venice and verona   by john ruskin lld     preface   this volume is the first of a series designed by the author with the purpose of placing in the hands of the public in more serviceable form those portions of his earlier works which he thinks deserving of a permanent place in the system of his general teaching they were at first intended to be accompanied by photographic reductions of the principal plates in the larger volumes but this design has been modified by the authors increasing desire to gather his past and present writings into a consistent body illustrated by one series of plates purchasable in separate parts and numbered consecutively of other prefatory matter once intendedapologetic mostlythe reader shall be spared the cumber and a clear prospectus issued by the publisher of the new series of plates as soon as they are in a state of forwardness  the second volume of this edition will contain the most useful matter out of the third volume of the old one closed by its topical index abridged and corrected  brantwood  3rd may 1879     contents   chap  i the quarry  ii the throne  iii torcello  iv st marks  v the ducal palace     the stones of venice     chapter i  first of the old edition  the quarry   section i since the first dominion of men was asserted over the ocean three thrones of mark beyond all others have been set upon its sands the thrones of tyre venice and england of the first of these great powers only the memory remains of the second the ruin the third which inherits their greatness if it forget their example may be led through prouder eminence to less pitied destruction  the exaltation the sin and the punishment of tyre have been recorded for us in perhaps the most touching words ever uttered by the prophets of israel against the cities of the stranger but we read them as a lovely song and close our ears to the sternness of their warning for the very depth of the fall of tyre has blinded us to its reality and we forget as we watch the bleaching of the rocks between the sunshine and the sea that they were once as in eden the garden of god  her successor like her in perfection of beauty though less in endurance of dominion is still left for our beholding in the final period of her decline a ghost upon the sands of the sea so weakso quietso bereft of all but her loveliness that we might well doubt as we watched her faint reflection in the mirage of the lagoon which was the city and which the shadow  i would endeavor to trace the lines of this image before it be for ever lost and to record as far as i may the warning which seems to me to be uttered by every one of the fastgaining waves that beat like passing bells against the stones of venice  section ii it would be difficult to overrate the value of the lessons which might be derived from a faithful study of the history of this strange and mighty city a history which in spite of the labor of countless chroniclers remains in vague and disputable outlinebarred with brightness and shade like the far away edge of her own ocean where the surf and the sandbank are mingled with the sky the inquiries in which we have to engage will hardly render this outline clearer but their results will in some degree alter its aspect and so far as they bear upon it at all they possess an interest of a far higher kind than that usually belonging to architectural investigations i may perhaps in the outset and in few words enable the general reader to form a clearer idea of the importance of every existing expression of venetian character through venetian art and of the breadth of interest which the true history of venice embraces than he is likely to have gleaned from the current fables of her mystery or magnificence  section iii venice is usually conceived as an oligarchy she was so during a period less than the half of her existence and that including the days of her decline and it is one of the first questions needing severe examination whether that decline was owing in any wise to the change in the form of her government or altogether as assuredly in great part to changes in the character of the persons of whom it was composed  the state of venice existed thirteen hundred and seventysix years from the first establishment of a consular government on the island of the rialto footnote appendix i foundations of venice to the moment when the generalinchief of the french army of italy pronounced the venetian republic a thing of the past of this period two hundred and seventysix years footnote appendix ii power of the doges were passed in a nominal subjection to the cities of old venetia especially to padua and in an agitated form of democracy of which the executive appears to have been entrusted to tribunes footnote sismondi hist des r√©p ital vol i ch v chosen one by the inhabitants of each of the principal islands for six hundred years footnote appendix iii serrar del consiglio during which the power of venice was continually on the increase her government was an elective monarchy her king or doge possessing in early times at least as much independent authority as any other european sovereign but an authority gradually subjected to limitation and shortened almost daily of its prerogatives while it increased in a spectral and incapable magnificence the final government of the nobles under the image of a king lasted for five hundred years during which venice reaped the fruits of her former energies consumed themand expired  section iv let the reader therefore conceive the existence of the venetian state as broadly divided into two periods the first of nine hundred the second of five hundred years the separation being marked by what was called the serrar del consiglio that is to say the final and absolute distinction of the nobles from the commonalty and the establishment of the government in their hands to the exclusion alike of the influence of the people on the one side and the authority of the doge on the other  then the first period of nine hundred years presents us with the most interesting spectacle of a people struggling out of anarchy into order and power and then governed for the most part by the worthiest and noblest man whom they could find among them footnote ha saputo trovar modo che non uno non pochi non molti signoreggiano ma molti buoni pochi migliori e insiememente un ottimo solo sansovino ah well done venice wisdom this indeed called their doge or leader with an aristocracy gradually and resolutely forming itself around him out of which and at last by which he was chosen an aristocracy owing its origin to the accidental numbers influence and wealth of some among the families of the fugitives from the older venetia and gradually organizing itself by its unity and heroism into a separate body  this first period includes the rise of venice her noblest achievements and the circumstances which determined her character and position among european powers and within its range as might have been anticipated we find the names of all her hero princesof pietro urseolo ordalafo falier domenico michieli sebastiano ziani and enrico dandolo  section v the second period opens with a hundred and twenty years the most eventful in the career of venicethe central struggle of her lifestained with her darkest crime the murder of carraradisturbed by her most dangerous internal sedition the conspiracy of falieroppressed by her most fatal war the war of chiozzaand distinguished by the glory of her two noblest citizens for in this period the heroism of her citizens replaces that of her monarchs vittor pisani and carlo zeno  i date the commencement of the fall of venice from the death of carlo zeno 8th may 1418 footnote daru liv xii ch xii the visible commencement from that of another of her noblest and wisest children the doge tomaso mocenigo who expired five years later the reign of foscari followed gloomy with pestilence and war a war in which large acquisitions of territory were made by subtle or fortunate policy in lombardy and disgrace significant as irreparable sustained in the battles on the po at cremona and in the marshes of caravaggio in 1454 venice the first of the states of christendom humiliated herself to the turk in the same year was established the inquisition of state footnote daru liv xvi cap xx we owe to this historian the discovery of the statutes of the tribunal and date of its establishment and from this period her government takes the perfidious and mysterious form under which it is usually conceived in 1477 the great turkish invasion spread terror to the shores of the lagoons and in 1508 the league of cambrai marks the period usually assigned as the commencement of the decline of the venetian power footnote ominously signified by their humiliation to the papal power as before to the turkish in 1509 and their abandonment of their right of appointing the clergy of their territories the commercial prosperity of venice in the close of the fifteenth century blinding her historians to the previous evidence of the diminution of her internal strength  section vi now there is apparently a significative coincidence between the establishment of the aristocratic and oligarchical powers and the diminution of the prosperity of the state but this is the very question at issue and it appears to me quite undetermined by any historian or determined by each in accordance with his own prejudices it is a triple question first whether the oligarchy established by the efforts of individual ambition was the cause in its subsequent operation of the fall of venice or secondly whether the establishment of the oligarchy itself be not the sign and evidence rather than the cause of national enervation or lastly whether as i rather think the history of venice might not be written almost without reference to the construction of her senate or the prerogatives of her doge it is the history of a people eminently at unity in itself descendants of roman race long disciplined by adversity and compelled by its position either to live nobly or to perishfor a thousand years they fought for life for three hundred they invited death their battle was rewarded and their call was heard  section vii throughout her career the victories of venice and at many periods of it her safety were purchased by individual heroism and the man who exalted or saved her was sometimes oftenest her king sometimes a noble sometimes a citizen to him no matter nor to her the real question is not so much what names they bore or with what powers they were entrusted as how they were trained how they were made masters of themselves servants of their country patient of distress impatient of dishonor and what was the true reason of the change from the time when she could find saviours among those whom she had cast into prison to that when the voices of her own children commanded her to sign covenant with death footnote the senate voted the abdication of their authority by a majority of 512 to 14 alison ch xxiii  section viii on this collateral question i wish the readers mind to be fixed throughout all our subsequent inquiries it will give double interest to every detail nor will the interest be profitless for the evidence which i shall be able to deduce from the arts of venice will be both frequent and irrefragable that the decline of her political prosperity was exactly coincident with that of domestic and individual religion  i say domestic and individual forand this is the second point which i wish the reader to keep in mindthe most curious phenomenon in all venetian history is the vitality of religion in private life and its deadness in public policy amidst the enthusiasm chivalry or fanaticism of the other states of europe venice stands from first to last like a masked statue her coldness impenetrable her exertion only aroused by the touch of a secret spring that spring was her commercial interestthis the one motive of all her important political acts or enduring national animosities she could forgive insults to her honor but never rivalship in her commerce she calculated the glory of her conquests by their value and estimated their justice by their facility the fame of success remains when the motives of attempt are forgotten and the casual reader of her history may perhaps be surprised to be reminded that the expedition which was commanded by the noblest of her princes and whose results added most to her military glory was one in which while all europe around her was wasted by the fire of its devotion she first calculated the highest price she could exact from its piety for the armament she furnished and then for the advancement of her own private interests at once broke her faith footnote by directing the arms of the crusaders against a christian prince daru liv iv ch iv viii and betrayed her religion  section ix and yet in the midst of this national criminality we shall be struck again and again by the evidences of the most noble individual feeling the tears of dandolo were not shed in hypocrisy though they could not blind him to the importance of the conquest of zara the habit of assigning to religion a direct influence over all his own actions and all the affairs of his own daily life is remarkable in every great venetian during the times of the prosperity of the state nor are instances wanting in which the private feeling of the citizens reaches the sphere of their policy and even becomes the guide of its course where the scales of expediency are doubtfully balanced i sincerely trust that the inquirer would be disappointed who should endeavor to trace any more immediate reasons for their adoption of the cause of alexander iii against barbarossa than the piety which was excited by the character of their suppliant and the noble pride which was provoked by the insolence of the emperor but the heart of venice is shown only in her hastiest councils her worldly spirit recovers the ascendency whenever she has time to calculate the probabilities of advantage or when they are sufficiently distinct to need no calculation and the entire subjection of private piety to national policy is not only remarkable throughout the almost endless series of treacheries and tyrannies by which her empire was enlarged and maintained but symbolized by a very singular circumstance in the building of the city itself i am aware of no other city of europe in which its cathedral was not the principal feature but the principal church in venice was the chapel attached to the palace of her prince and called the chiesa ducale the patriarchal church footnote appendix 4 san pietro di castello inconsiderable in size and mean in decoration stands on the outermost islet of the venetian group and its name as well as its site is probably unknown to the greater number of travellers passing hastily through the city nor is it less worthy of remark that the two most important temples of venice next to the ducal chapel owe their size and magnificence not to national effort but to the energy of the franciscan and dominican monks supported by the vast organization of those great societies on the mainland of italy and countenanced by the most pious and perhaps also in his generation the most wise of all the princes of venice footnote tomaso mocenigo above named section v who now rests beneath the roof of one of those very temples and whose life is not satirized by the images of the virtues which a tuscan sculptor has placed around his tomb  section x there are therefore two strange and solemn lights in which we have to regard almost every scene in the fitful history of the rivo alto we find on the one hand a deep and constant tone of individual religion characterizing the lives of the citizens of venice in her greatness we find this spirit influencing them in all the familiar and immediate concerns of life giving a peculiar dignity to the conduct even of their commercial transactions and confessed by them with a simplicity of faith that may well put to shame the hesitation with which a man of the world at present admits even if it be so in reality that religious feeling has any influence over the minor branches of his conduct and we find as the natural consequence of all this a healthy serenity of mind and energy of will expressed in all their actions and a habit of heroism which never fails them even when the immediate motive of action ceases to be praiseworthy with the fulness of this spirit the prosperity of the state is exactly correspondent and with its failure her decline and that with a closeness and precision which it will be one of the collateral objects of the following essay to demonstrate from such accidental evidence as the field of its inquiry presents and thus far all is natural and simple but the stopping short of this religious faith when it appears likely to influence national action correspondent as it is and that most strikingly with several characteristics of the temper of our present english legislature is a subject morally and politically of the most curious interest and complicated difficulty one however which the range of my present inquiry will not permit me to approach and for the treatment of which i must be content to furnish materials in the light i may be able to throw upon the private tendencies of the venetian character  section xi there is however another most interesting feature in the policy of venice which will be often brought before us and which a romanist would gladly assign as the reason of its irreligion namely the magnificent and successful struggle which she maintained against the temporal authority of the church of rome it is true that in a rapid survey of her career the eye is at first arrested by the strange drama to which i have already alluded closed by that ever memorable scene in the portico of st marks footnote                     in that temple porch   the brass is gone the porphyry remains   did barbarossa fling his mantle off   and kneeling on his neck receive the foot   of the proud pontiffthus at last consoled   for flight disguise and many an aguish shake   on his stony pillow  i need hardly say whence the lines are taken rogers italy has i believe now a place in the best beloved compartment of all libraries and will never be removed from it there is more true expression of the spirit of venice in the passages devoted to her in that poem than in all else that has been written of her the central expression in most mens thoughts of the unendurable elevation of the pontifical power it is true that the proudest thoughts of venice as well as the insignia of her prince and the form of her chief festival recorded the service thus rendered to the roman church but the enduring sentiment of years more than balanced the enthusiasm of a moment and the bull of clement v which excommunicated the venetians and their doge likening them to dathan abiram absalom and lucifer is a stronger evidence of the great tendencies of the venetian government than the umbrella of the doge or the ring of the adriatic the humiliation of francesco dandolo blotted out the shame of barbarossa and the total exclusion of ecclesiastics from all share in the councils of venice became an enduring mark of her knowledge of the spirit of the church of rome and of her defiance of it  to this exclusion of papal influence from her councils the romanist will attribute their irreligion and the protestant their success footnote at least such success as they had vide appendix 5 the papal power in venice  the first may be silenced by a reference to the character of the policy of the vatican itself and the second by his own shame when he reflects that the english legislature sacrificed their principles to expose themselves to the very danger which the venetian senate sacrificed theirs to avoid  section xii one more circumstance remains to be noted respecting the venetian government the singular unity of the families composing itunity far from sincere or perfect but still admirable when contrasted with the fiery feuds the almost daily revolutions the restless successions of families and parties in power which fill the annals of the other states of italy that rivalship should sometimes be ended by the dagger or enmity conducted to its ends under the mask of law could not but be anticipated where the fierce italian spirit was subjected to so severe a restraint it is much that jealousy appears usually unmingled with illegitimate ambition and that for every instance in which private passion sought its gratification through public danger there are a thousand in which it was sacrificed to the public advantage venice may well call upon us to note with reverence that of all the towers which are still seen rising like a branchless forest from her islands there is but one whose office was other than that of summoning to prayer and that one was a watchtower only footnote thus literally was fulfilled the promise to st markpax e from first to last while the palaces of the other cities of italy were lifted into sullen fortitudes of rampart and fringed with forked battlements for the javelin and the bow the sands of venice never sank under the weight of a war tower and her roof terraces were wreathed with arabian imagery of golden globes suspended on the leaves of lilies footnote the inconsiderable fortifications of the arsenal are no exception to this statement as far as it regards the city itself they are little more than a semblance of precaution against the attack of a foreign enemy  section xiii these then appear to me to be the points of chief general interest in the character and fate of the venetian people i would next endeavor to give the reader some idea of the manner in which the testimony of art bears upon these questions and of the aspect which the arts themselves assume when they are regarded in their true connection with the history of the state  1st receive the witness of painting  it will be remembered that i put the commencement of the fall of venice as far back as 1418  now john bellini was born in 1423 and titian in 1480 john bellini and his brother gentile two years older than he close the line of the sacred painters of venice but the most solemn spirit of religious faith animates their works to the last there is no religion in any work of titians there is not even the smallest evidence of religious temper or sympathies either in himself or in those for whom he painted his larger sacred subjects are merely themes for the exhibition of pictorial rhetoriccomposition and color his minor works are generally made subordinate to purposes of portraiture the madonna in the church of the frari is a mere lay figure introduced to form a link of connection between the portraits of various members of the pesaro family who surround her  now this is not merely because john bellini was a religious man and titian was not titian and bellini are each true representatives of the school of painters contemporary with them and the difference in their artistic feeling is a consequence not so much of difference in their own natural characters as in their early education bellini was brought up in faith titian in formalism between the years of their births the vital religion of venice had expired  section xiv the vital religion observe not the formal outward observance was as strict as ever and doge and senator still were painted in almost every important instance kneeling before the madonna or st mark a confession of faith made universal by the pure gold of the venetian sequin but observe the great picture of titians in the ducal palace of the doge antonio grimani kneeling before faith there is a curious lesson in it the figure of faith is a coarse portrait of one of titians least graceful female models faith had become carnal the eye is first caught by the flash of the doges armor the heart of venice was in her wars not in her worship  the mind of tintoret incomparably more deep and serious than that of titian casts the solemnity of its own tone over the sacred subjects which it approaches and sometimes forgets itself into devotion but the principle of treatment is altogether the same as titians absolute subordination of the religious subject to purposes of decoration or portraiture  the evidence might be accumulated a thousandfold from the works of veronese and of every succeeding painterthat the fifteenth century had taken away the religious heart of venice  section xv such is the evidence of painting to collect that of architecture will be our task through many a page to come but i must here give a general idea of its heads  philippe de commynes writing of his entry into venice in 1495 says  chascun me feit seoir au meillieu de ces deux ambassadeurs qui est lhonneur ditalie que destre au meillieu et me menerent au long de la grant rue quilz appellent le canal grant et est bien large les gallees y passent √† travers et y ay veu navire de quatre cens tonneaux ou plus pres des maisons et est la plus belle rue que je croy qui soit en tout le monde et la mieulx maisonnee et va le long de la ville les maisons sont fort grandes et haultes et de bonne pierre et les anciennes toutes painctes les aul tres faictes depuis cent ans toutes ont le devant de marbre blanc qui leur vient distrie √† cent mils de la et encores maincte grant piece de porphire et de sarpentine sur le devant cest la plus triumphante cit√© que jaye jamais veue et qui plus faict dhonneur √† ambassadeurs et estrangiers et qui plus saigement se gouverne et o√π le service de dieu est le plus sollennellement faict et encores quil y peust bien avoir daultres faultes si croy je que dieu les a en ayde pour la reverence quilz portent au service de leglise footnote m√©moires de commynes liv vii ch xviii  section xvi this passage is of peculiar interest for two reasons observe first the impression of commynes respecting the religion of venice of which as i have above said the forms still remained with some glimmering of life in them and were the evidence of what the real life had been in former times but observe secondly the impression instantly made on commynes mind by the distinction between the elder palaces and those built within this last hundred years which all have their fronts of white marble brought from istria a hundred miles away and besides many a large piece of porphyry and serpentine upon their fronts  on the opposite page i have given two of the ornaments of the palaces which so struck the french ambassador footnote appendix 6 renaissance ornaments he was right in his notice of the distinction there had indeed come a change over venetian architecture in the fifteenth century and a change of some importance to us moderns we english owe to it our st pauls cathedral and europe in general owes to it the utter degradation or destruction of her schools of architecture never since revived but that the reader may understand this it is necessary that he should have some general idea of the connection of the architecture of venice with that of the rest of europe from its origin forwards  section xvii all european architecture bad and good old and new is derived from greece through rome and colored and perfected from the east the history of architecture is nothing but the tracing of the various modes and directions of this derivation understand this once for all if you hold fast this great connecting clue you may string all the types of successive architectural invention upon it like so many beads the doric and the corinthian orders are the roots the one of all romanesque massycapitaled buildingsnorman lombard byzantine and what else you can name of the kind and the corinthian of all gothic early english french german and tuscan now observe those old greeks gave the shaft rome gave the arch the arabs pointed and foliated the arch the shaft and arch the framework and strength of architecture are from the race of japheth the spirituality and sanctity of it from ismael abraham and shem  section xviii there is high probability that the greek received his shaft system from egypt but i do not care to keep this earlier derivation in the mind of the reader it is only necessary that he should be able to refer to a fixed point of origin when the form of the shaft was first perfected but it may be incidently observed that if the greeks did indeed receive their doric from egypt then the three families of the earth have each contributed their part to its noblest architecture and ham the servant of the others furnishes the sustaining or bearing member the shaft japheth the arch shem the spiritualization of both  section xix i have said that the two orders doric and corinthian are the roots of all european architecture you have perhaps heard of five orders but there are only two real orders and there never can be any more until doomsday on one of these orders the ornament is convex those are doric norman and what else you recollect of the kind on the other the ornament is concave those are corinthian early english decorated and what else you recollect of that kind the transitional form in which the ornamental line is straight is the centre or root of both all other orders are varieties of those or phantasms and grotesques altogether indefinite in number and species footnote appendix 7 varieties of the orders  section xx this greek architecture then with its two orders was clumsily copied and varied by the romans with no particular result until they begun to bring the arch into extensive practical service except only that the doric capital was spoiled in endeavors to mend it and the corinthian much varied and enriched with fanciful and often very beautiful imagery and in this state of things came christianity seized upon the arch as her own decorated it and delighted in it invented a new doric capital to replace the spoiled roman one and all over the roman empire set to work with such materials as were nearest at hand to express and adorn herself as best she could this roman christian architecture is the exact expression of the christianity of the time very fervid and beautifulbut very imperfect in many respects ignorant and yet radiant with a strong childlike light of imagination which flames up under constantine illumines all the shores of the bosphorus and the aegean and the adriatic sea and then gradually as the people give themselves up to idolatry becomes corpselight the architecture sinks into a settled forma strange gilded and embalmed repose it with the religion it expressed and so would have remained for everso does remain where its languor has been undisturbed footnote the reader will find the weak points of byzantine architecture shrewdly seized and exquisitely sketched in the opening chapter of the most delightful book of travels i ever opened curzons monasteries of the levant but rough wakening was ordained  section xxi this christian art of the declining empire is divided into two great branches western and eastern one centred at rome the other at byzantium of which the one is the early christian romanesque properly so called and the other carried to higher imaginative perfection by greek workmen is distinguished from it as byzantine but i wish the reader for the present to class these two branches of art together in his mind they being in points of main importance the same that is to say both of them a true continuance and sequence of the art of old rome itself flowing uninterruptedly down from the fountainhead and entrusted always to the best workmen who could be foundlatins in italy and greeks in greece and thus both branches may be ranged under the general term of christian romanesque an architecture which had lost the refinement of pagan art in the degradation of the empire but which was elevated by christianity to higher aims and by the fancy of the greek workmen endowed with brighter forms and this art the reader may conceive as extending in its various branches over all the central provinces of the empire taking aspects more or less refined according to its proximity to the seats of government dependent for all its power on the vigor and freshness of the religion which animated it and as that vigor and purity departed losing its own vitality and sinking into nerveless rest not deprived of its beauty but benumbed and incapable of advance or change  section xxii meantime there had been preparation for its renewal while in rome and constantinople and in the districts under their immediate influence this roman art of pure descent was practised in all its refinement an impure form of ita patois of romanesquewas carried by inferior workmen into distant provinces and still ruder imitations of this patois were executed by the barbarous nations on the skirts of the empire but these barbarous nations were in the strength of their youth and while in the centre of europe a refined and purely descended art was sinking into graceful formalism on its confines a barbarous and borrowed art was organizing itself into strength and consistency the reader must therefore consider the history of the work of the period as broadly divided into two great heads the one embracing the elaborately languid succession of the christian art of rome and the other the imitations of it executed by nations in every conceivable phase of early organization on the edges of the empire or included in its now merely nominal extent  section xxiii some of the barbaric nations were of course not susceptible of this influence and when they burst over the alps appear like the huns as scourges only or mix as the ostrogoths with the enervated italians and give physical strength to the mass with which they mingle without materially affecting its intellectual character but others both south and north of the empire had felt its influence back to the beach of the indian ocean on the one hand and to the ice creeks of the north sea on the other on the north and west the influence was of the latins on the south and east of the greeks two nations preeminent above all the rest represent to us the force of derived mind on either side as the central power is eclipsed the orbs of reflected light gather into their fulness and when sensuality and idolatry had done their work and the religion of the empire was laid asleep in a glittering sepulchre the living light rose upon both horizons and the fierce swords of the lombard and arab were shaken over its golden paralysis  section xxiv the work of the lombard was to give hardihood and system to the enervated body and enfeebled mind of christendom that of the arab was to punish idolatry and to proclaim the spirituality of worship the lombard covered every church which he built with the sculptured representations of bodily exerciseshunting and war footnote appendix 8 the northern energy the arab banished all imagination of creature form from his temples and proclaimed from their minarets there is no god but god opposite in their character and mission alike in their magnificence of energy they came from the north and from the south the glacier torrent and the lava stream they met and contended over the wreck of the roman empire and the very centre of the struggle the point of pause of both the dead water of the opposite eddies charged with embayed fragments of the roman wreck is venice  the ducal palace of venice contains the three elements in exactly equal proportionsthe roman lombard and arab it is the central building of the world  section xxv the reader will now begin to understand something of the importance of the study of the edifices of a city which includes within the circuit of some seven or eight miles the field of contest between the three preeminent architectures of the worldeach architecture expressing a condition of religion each an erroneous condition yet necessary to the correction of the others and corrected by them  section xxvi it will be part of my endeavor in the following work to mark the various modes in which the northern and southern architectures were developed from the roman here i must pause only to name the distinguishing characteristics of the great families the christian roman and byzantine work is roundarched with single and wellproportioned shafts capitals imitated from classical roman mouldings more or less so and large surfaces of walls entirely covered with imagery mosaic and paintings whether of scripture history or of sacred symbols  the arab school is at first the same in its principal features the byzantine workmen being employed by the caliphs but the arab rapidly introduces characters half persepolitan half egyptian into the shafts and capitals in his intense love of excitement he points the arch and writhes it into extravagant foliations he banishes the animal imagery and invents an ornamentation of his own called arabesque to replace it this not being adapted for covering large surfaces he concentrates it on features of interest and bars his surfaces with horizontal lines of color the expression of the level of the desert he retains the dome and adds the minaret all is done with exquisite refinement  section xxvii the changes effected by the lombard are more curious still for they are in the anatomy of the building more than its decoration the lombard architecture represents as i said the whole of that of the northern barbaric nations and this i believe was at first an imitation in wood of the christian roman churches or basilicas without staying to examine the whole structure of a basilica the reader will easily understand thus much of it that it had a nave and two aisles the nave much higher than the aisles that the nave was separated from the aisles by rows of shafts which supported above large spaces of flat or dead wall rising above the aisles and forming the upper part of the nave now called the clerestory which had a gabled wooden roof  these high dead walls were in roman work built of stone but in the wooden work of the north they must necessarily have been made of horizontal boards or timbers attached to uprights on the top of the nave pillars which were themselves also of wood footnote appendix 9 wooden churches of the north now these uprights were necessarily thicker than the rest of the timbers and formed vertical square pilasters above the nave piers as christianity extended and civilization increased these wooden structures were changed into stone but they were literally petrified retaining the form which had been made necessary by their being of wood the upright pilaster above the nave pier remains in the stone edifice and is the first form of the great distinctive feature of northern architecturethe vaulting shaft in that form the lombards brought it into italy in the seventh century and it remains to this day in st ambrogio of milan and st michele of pavia  section xxviii when the vaulting shaft was introduced in the clerestory walls additional members were added for its support to the nave piers perhaps two or three pine trunks used for a single pillar gave the first idea of the grouped shaft be that as it may the arrangement of the nave pier in the form of a cross accompanies the superimposition of the vaulting shaft together with corresponding grouping of minor shafts in doorways and apertures of windows thus the whole body of the northern architecture represented by that of the lombards may be described as rough but majestic work roundarched with grouped shafts added vaulting shafts and endless imagery of active life and fantastic superstitions  section xxix the glacier stream of the lombards and the following one of the normans left their erratic blocks wherever they had flowed but without influencing i think the southern nations beyond the sphere of their own presence but the lava stream of the arab even after it ceased to flow warmed the whole of the northern air and the history of gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualization of northern work under its influence the noblest buildings of the world the pisanromanesque tuscan giottesque gothic and veronese gothic are those of the lombard schools themselves under its close and direct influence the various gothics of the north are the original forms of the architecture which the lombards brought into italy changing under the less direct influence of the arab  section xxx understanding thus much of the formation of the great european styles we shall have no difficulty in tracing the succession of architectures in venice herself from what i said of the central character of venetian art the reader is not of course to conclude that the roman northern and arabian elements met together and contended for the mastery at the same period the earliest element was the pure christian roman but few if any remains of this art exist at venice for the present city was in the earliest times only one of many settlements formed on the chain of marshy islands which extend from the mouths of the isonzo to those of the adige and it was not until the beginning of the ninth century that it became the seat of government while the cathedral of torcello though christian roman in general form was rebuilt in the eleventh century and shows evidence of byzantine workmanship in many of its details this cathedral however with the church of santa fosca at torcello san giacomo di rialto at venice and the crypt of st marks forms a distinct group of buildings in which the byzantine influence is exceedingly slight and which is probably very sufficiently representative of the earliest architecture on the islands  section xxxi the ducal residence was removed to venice in 809 and the body of st mark was brought from alexandria twenty years later the first church of st marks was doubtless built in imitation of that destroyed at alexandria and from which the relics of the saint had been obtained during the ninth tenth and eleventh centuries the architecture of venice seems to have been formed on the same model and is almost identical with that of cairo under the caliphs footnote appendix 10 church of alexandria it being quite immaterial whether the reader chooses to call both byzantine or both arabic the workmen being certainly byzantine but forced to the invention of new forms by their arabian masters and bringing these forms into use in whatever other parts of the world they were employed  to this first manner of venetian architecture together with such vestiges as remain of the christian roman i shall devote the first division of the following inquiry the examples remaining of it consist of three noble churches those of torcello murano and the greater part of st marks and about ten or twelve fragments of palaces  section xxxii to this style succeeds a transitional one of a character much more distinctly arabian the shafts become more slender and the arches consistently pointed instead of round certain other changes not to be enumerated in a sentence taking place in the capitals and mouldings this style is almost exclusively secular it was natural for the venetians to imitate the beautiful details of the arabian dwellinghouse while they would with reluctance adopt those of the mosque for christian churches  i have not succeeded in fixing limiting dates for this style it appears in part contemporary with the byzantine manner but outlives it its position is however fixed by the central date 1180 that of the elevation of the granite shafts of the piazetta whose capitals are the two most important pieces of detail in this transitional style in venice examples of its application to domestic buildings exist in almost every street of the city and will form the subject of the second division of the following essay  section xxxiii the venetians were always ready to receive lessons in art from their enemies else had there been no arab work in venice but their especial dread and hatred of the lombards appears to have long prevented them from receiving the influence of the art which that people had introduced on the mainland of italy nevertheless during the practice of the two styles above distinguished a peculiar and very primitive condition of pointed gothic had arisen in ecclesiastical architecture it appears to be a feeble reflection of the lombardarab forms which were attaining perfection upon the continent and would probably if left to itself have been soon merged in the venetianarab school with which it had from the first so close a fellowship that it will be found difficult to distinguish the arabian ogives from those which seem to have been built under this early gothic influence the churches of san giacopo dell orio san giovanni in bragora the carmine and one or two more furnish the only important examples of it but in the thirteenth century the franciscans and dominicans introduced from the continent their morality and their architecture already a distinct gothic curiously developed from lombardic and northern german forms and the influence of the principles exhibited in the vast churches of st paul and the frari began rapidly to affect the venetianarab school still the two systems never became united the venetian policy repressed the power of the church and the venetian artists resisted its example and thenceforward the architecture of the city becomes divided into ecclesiastical and civil the one an ungraceful yet powerful form of the western gothic common to the whole peninsula and only showing venetian sympathies in the adoption of certain characteristic mouldings the other a rich luxuriant and entirely original gothic formed from the venetianarab by the influence of the dominican and franciscan architecture and especially by the engrafting upon the arab forms of the most novel feature of the franciscan work its traceries these various forms of gothic the distinctive architecture of venice chiefly represented by the churches of st john and paul the frari and san stefano on the ecclesiastical side and by the ducal palace and the other principal gothic palaces on the secular side will be the subject of the third division of the essay  section xxxiv now observe the transitional or especially arabic style of the venetian work is centralized by the date 1180 and is transformed gradually into the gothic which extends in its purity from the middle of the thirteenth to the beginning of the fifteenth century that is to say over the precise period which i have described as the central epoch of the life of venice i dated her decline from the year 1418 foscari became doge five years later and in his reign the first marked signs appear in architecture of that mighty change which philippe de commynes notices as above the change to which london owes st pauls rome st peters venice and vicenza the edifices commonly supposed to be their noblest and europe in general the degradation of every art she has since practised  section xxxv this change appears first in a loss of truth and vitality in existing architecture all over the world compare seven lamps chap ii  all the gothics in existence southern or northern were corrupted at once the german and french lost themselves in every species of extravagance the english gothic was confined in its insanity by a straitwaistcoat of perpendicular lines the italian effloresced on the main land into the meaningless ornamentation of the certosa of pavia and the cathedral of como a style sometimes ignorantly called italian gothic and at venice into the insipid confusion of the porta della carta and wild crockets of st marks this corruption of all architecture especially ecclesiastical corresponded with and marked the state of religion over all europethe peculiar degradation of the romanist superstition and of public morality in consequence which brought about the reformation  section xxxvi against the corrupted papacy arose two great divisions of adversaries protestants in germany and england rationalists in france and italy the one requiring the purification of religion the other its destruction the protestant kept the religion but cast aside the heresies of rome and with them her arts by which last rejection he injured his own character cramped his intellect in refusing to it one of its noblest exercises and materially diminished his influence it may be a serious question how far the pausing of the reformation has been a consequence of this error  the rationalist kept the arts and cast aside the religion this rationalistic art is the art commonly called renaissance marked by a return to pagan systems not to adopt them and hallow them for christianity but to rank itself under them as an imitator and pupil in painting it is headed by giulio romano and nicolo poussin in architecture by sansovino and palladio  section xxxvii instant degradation followed in every directiona flood of folly and hypocrisy mythologies ill understood at first then perverted into feeble sensualities take the place of the representations of christian subjects which had become blasphemous under the treatment of men like the caracci gods without power satyrs without rusticity nymphs without innocence men without humanity gather into idiot groups upon the polluted canvas and scenic affectations encumber the streets with preposterous marble lower and lower declines the level of abused intellect the base school of landscape footnote appendix ii renaissance landscape gradually usurps the place of the historical painting which had sunk into prurient pedantrythe alsatian sublimities of salvator the confectionery idealities of claude the dull manufacture of gaspar and canaletto south of the alps and on the north the patient devotion of besotted lives to delineation of bricks and fogs fat cattle and ditchwater and thus christianity and morality courage and intellect and art all crumbling together into one wreck we are hurried on to the fall of italy the revolution in france and the condition of art in england saved by her protestantism from severer penalty in the time of george ii  section xxxviii i have not written in vain if i have heretofore done anything towards diminishing the reputation of the renaissance landscape painting but the harm which has been done by claude and the poussins is as nothing when compared to the mischief effected by palladio scamozzi and sansovino claude and the poussins were weak men and have had no serious influence on the general mind there is little harm in their works being purchased at high prices their real influence is very slight and they may be left without grave indignation to their poor mission of furnishing drawingrooms and assisting stranded conversation not so the renaissance architecture raised at once into all the magnificence of which it was capable by michael angelo then taken up by men of real intellect and imagination such as scamozzi sansovino inigo jones and wren it is impossible to estimate the extent of its influence on the european mind and that the more because few persons are concerned with painting and of those few the larger number regard it with slight attention but all men are concerned with architecture and have at some time of their lives serious business with it it does not much matter that an individual loses two or three hundred pounds in buying a bad picture but it is to be regretted that a nation should lose two or three hundred thousand in raising a ridiculous building nor is it merely wasted wealth or distempered conception which we have to regret in this renaissance architecture but we shall find in it partly the root partly the expression of certain dominant evils of modern timesoversophistication and ignorant classicalism the one destroying the healthfulness of general society the other rendering our schools and universities useless to a large number of the men who pass through them  now venice as she was once the most religious was in her fall the most corrupt of european states and as she was in her strength the centre of the pure currents of christian architecture so she is in her decline the source of the renaissance it was the originality and splendor of the palaces of vicenza and venice which gave this school its eminence in the eyes of europe and the dying city magnificent in her dissipation and graceful in her follies obtained wider worship in her decrepitude than in her youth and sank from the midst of her admirers into the grave  section xxxix it is in venice therefore and in venice only that effectual blows can be struck at this pestilent art of the renaissance destroy its claims to admiration there and it can assert them nowhere else this therefore will be the final purpose of the following essay i shall not devote a fourth section to palladio nor weary the reader with successive chapters of vituperation but i shall in my account of the earlier architecture compare the forms of all its leading features with those into which they were corrupted by the classicalists and pause in the close on the edge of the precipice of decline so soon as i have made its depths discernible in doing this i shall depend upon two distinct kinds of evidencethe first the testimony borne by particular incidents and facts to a want of thought or of feeling in the builders from which we may conclude that their architecture must be badthe second the sense which i doubt not i shall be able to excite in the reader of a systematic ugliness in the architecture itself of the first kind of testimony i shall here give two instances which may be immediately useful in fixing in the readers mind the epoch above indicated for the commencement of decline  section xl i must again refer to the importance which i have above attached to the death of carlo zeno and the doge tomaso mocenigo the tomb of that doge is as i said wrought by a florentine but it is of the same general type and feeling as all the venetian tombs of the period and it is one of the last which retains it the classical element enters largely into its details but the feeling of the whole is as yet unaffected like all the lovely tombs of venice and verona it is a sarcophagus with a recumbent figure above and this figure is a faithful but tender portrait wrought as far as it can be without painfulness of the doge as he lay in death he wears his ducal robe and bonnethis head is laid slightly aside upon his pillowhis hands are simply crossed as they fall the face is emaciated the features large but so pure and lordly in their natural chiselling that they must have looked like marble even in their animation they are deeply worn away by thought and death the veins on the temples branched and starting the skin gathered in sharp folds the brow higharched and shaggy the eyeball magnificently large the curve of the lips just veiled by the light mustache at the side the beard short double and sharppointed all noble and quiet the white sepulchral dust marking like light the stern angles of the cheek and brow  this tomb was sculptured in 1424 and is thus described by one of the most intelligent of the recent writers who represent the popular feeling respecting venetian art      of the italian school is also the rich but ugly ricco ma non     bel sarcophagus in which repose the ashes of tomaso mocenigo     it may be called one of the last links which connect the     declining art of the middle ages with that of the renaissance     which was in its rise we will not stay to particularize the     defects of each of the seven figures of the front and sides     which represent the cardinal and theological virtues nor will     we make any remarks upon those which stand in the niches above     the pavilion because we consider them unworthy both of the age     and reputation of the florentine school which was then with     reason considered the most notable in italy footnote     selvatico architettura di venezia p 147  it is well indeed not to pause over these defects but it might have been better to have paused a moment beside that noble image of a kings mortality  section xli in the choir of the same church st giov and paolo is another tomb that of the doge andrea vendramin this doge died in 1478 after a short reign of two years the most disastrous in the annals of venice he died of a pestilence which followed the ravage of the turks carried to the shores of the lagoons he died leaving venice disgraced by sea and land with the smoke of hostile devastation rising in the blue distances of friuli and there was raised to him the most costly tomb ever bestowed on her monarchs  section xlii if the writer above quoted was cold beside the statue of one of the fathers of his country he atones for it by his eloquence beside the tomb of the vendramin i must not spoil the force of italian superlative by translation      quando si guarda a quella corretta eleganza di profili e di     proporzioni a quella squisitezza dornamenti a quel certo     sapore antico che senza ombra d imitazione traspareda tutta l     operac sopra ornatissimo zoccolo fornito di squisiti     intagli s alza uno stylobatec sotto le colonne il     predetto stilobate si muta leggiadramente in piedistallo poi     con bella novita di pensiero e di effetto va coronato da un     fregio il piu gentile che veder si possac non puossi     lasciar senza un cenno l arca dove sta chiuso il doge     capo lavoro di pensiero e di esecuzione etc  there are two pages and a half of closely printed praise of which the above specimens may suffice but there is not a word of the statue of the dead from beginning to end i am myself in the habit of considering this rather an important part of a tomb and i was especially interested in it here because selvatico only echoes the praise of thousands it is unanimously declared the chef doeuvre of renaissance sepulchral work and pronounced by cicognara also quoted by selvatico      il vertice a cui larti veneziane si spinsero col ministero del     scalpellothe very culminating point to which the venetian     arts attained by ministry of the chisel  to this culminating point therefore covered with dust and cobwebs i attained as i did to every tomb of importance in venice by the ministry of such ancient ladders as were to be found in the sacristans keeping i was struck at first by the excessive awkwardness and want of feeling in the fall of the hand towards the spectator for it is thrown off the middle of the body in order to show its fine cutting now the mocenigo hand severe and even stiff in its articulations has its veins finely drawn its sculptor having justly felt that the delicacy of the veining expresses alike dignity and age and birth the vendramin hand is far more laboriously cut but its blunt and clumsy contour at once makes us feel that all the care has been thrown away and well it may be for it has been entirely bestowed in cutting gouty wrinkles about the joints such as the hand is i looked for its fellow at first i thought it had been broken off but on clearing away the dust i saw the wretched effigy had only one hand and was a mere block on the inner side the face heavy and disagreeable in its features is made monstrous by its semisculpture one side of the forehead is wrinkled elaborately the other left smooth one side only of the doges cap is chased one cheek only is finished and the other blocked out and distorted besides finally the ermine robe which is elaborately imitated to its utmost lock of hair and of ground hair on the one side is blocked out only on the other it having been supposed throughout the work that the effigy was only to be seen from below and from one side  section xliii it was indeed to be seen by nearly every one and i do not blamei should on the contrary have praisedthe sculptor for regulating his treatment of it by its position if that treatment had not involved first dishonesty in giving only half a face a monstrous mask when we demanded true portraiture of the dead and secondly such utter coldness of feeling as could only consist with an extreme of intellectual and moral degradation who with a heart in his breast could have stayed his hand as he drew the dim lines of the old mans countenanceunmajestic once indeed but at least sanctified by the solemnities of deathcould have stayed his hand as he reached the bend of the grey forehead and measured out the last veins of it at so much the zecchin  i do not think the reader if he has feeling will expect that much talent should be shown in the rest of his work by the sculptor of this base and senseless lie the whole monument is one wearisome aggregation of that species of ornamental flourish which when it is done with a pen is called penmanship and when done with a chisel should be called chiselmanship the subject of it being chiefly fatlimbed boys sprawling on dolphins dolphins incapable of swimming and dragged along the sea by expanded pockethandkerchiefs  but now reader comes the very gist and point of the whole matter this lying monument to a dishonored doge this culminating pride of the renaissance art of venice is at least veracious if in nothing else in its testimony to the character of its sculptor he was banished from venice for forgery in 1487 footnote selvatico p 221  section xliv i have more to say about this convicts work hereafter but i pass at present to the second slighter but yet more interesting piece of evidence which i promised  the ducal palace has two principal fa√ßades one towards the sea the other towards the piazzetta the seaward side and as far as the seventh main arch inclusive the piazzetta side is work of the early part of the fourteenth century some of it perhaps even earlier while the rest of the piazzetta side is of the fifteenth the difference in age has been gravely disputed by the venetian antiquaries who have examined many documents on the subject and quoted some which they never examined i have myself collated most of the written documents and one document more to which the venetian antiquaries never thought of referringthe masonry of the palace itself  section xlv that masonry changes at the centre of the eighth arch from the sea angle on the piazzetta side it has been of comparatively small stones up to that point the fifteenth century work instantly begins with larger stones brought from istria a hundred miles away footnote the older work is of istrian stone also but of different quality the ninth shaft from the sea in the lower arcade and the seventeenth which is above it in the upper arcade commence the series of fifteenth century shafts these two are somewhat thicker than the others and carry the partywall of the sala del scrutinio now observe reader the face of the palace from this point to the porta della carta was built at the instance of that noble doge mocenigo beside whose tomb you have been standing at his instance and in the beginning of the reign of his successor foscari that is to say circa 1424 this is not disputed it is only disputed that the sea fa√ßade is earlier of which however the proofs are as simple as they are incontrovertible for not only the masonry but the sculpture changes at the ninth lower shaft and that in the capitals of the shafts both of the upper and lower arcade the costumes of the figures introduced in the sea fa√ßade being purely giottesque correspondent with giottos work in the arena chapel at padua while the costume on the other capitals is renaissanceclassic and the lions heads between the arches change at the same point and there are a multitude of other evidences in the statues of the angels with which i shall not at present trouble the reader  section xlvi now the architect who built under foscari in 1424 remember my date for the decline of venice 1418 was obliged to follow the principal forms of the older palace but he had not the wit to invent new capitals in the same style he therefore clumsily copied the old ones the palace has seventeen main arches on the sea fa√ßade eighteen on the piazzetta side which in all are of course carried by thirtysix pillars and these pillars i shall always number from right to left from the angle of the palace at the ponte della paglia to that next the porta della carta i number them in this succession because i thus have the earliest shafts first numbered so counted the 1st the 18th and the 36th are the great supports of the angles of the palace and the first of the fifteenth century series being as above stated the 9th from the sea on the piazzetta side is the 26th of the entire series and will always in future be so numbered so that all numbers above twentysix indicate fifteenth century work and all below it fourteenth century with some exceptional cases of restoration  then the copied capitals are the 28th copied from the 7th the 29th from the 9th the 30th from the 10th the 31st from the 8th the 33d from the 12th and the 34th from the 11th the others being dull inventions of the 15th century except the 36th which is very nobly designed  section xlvii the capitals thus selected from the earlier portion of the palace for imitation together with the rest will be accurately described hereafter the point i have here to notice is in the copy of the ninth capital which was decorated being like the rest octagonal with figures of the eight virtuesfaith hope charity justice temperance prudence humility the venetian antiquaries call it humanity and fortitude the virtues of the fourteenth century are somewhat hardfeatured with vivid and living expression and plain everyday clothes of the time charity has her lap full of apples perhaps loaves and is giving one to a little child who stretches his arm for it across a gap in the leafage of the capital fortitude tears open a lions jaws faith lays her hand on her breast as she beholds the cross and hope is praying while above her a hand is seen emerging from sunbeamsthe hand of god according to that of revelations the lord god giveth them light and the inscription above is spes optima in deo  section xlviii this design then is rudely and with imperfect chiselling imitated by the fifteenth century workmen the virtues have lost their hard features and living expression they have now all got roman noses and have had their hair curled their actions and emblems are however preserved until we come to hope she is still praying but she is praying to the sun only the hand of god is gone  is not this a curious and striking type of the spirit which had then become dominant in the world forgetting to see gods hand in the light he gave so that in the issue when the light opened into the reformation on the one side and into full knowledge of ancient literature on the other the one was arrested and the other perverted  section xlix such is the nature of the accidental evidence on which i shall depend for the proof of the inferiority of character in the renaissance workmen but the proof of the inferiority of the work itself is not so easy for in this i have to appeal to judgments which the renaissance work has itself distorted i felt this difficulty very forcibly as i read a slight review of my former work the seven lamps in the architect the writer noticed my constant praise of st marks mr ruskin thinks it a very beautiful building we said the architect think it a very ugly building i was not surprised at the difference of opinion but at the thing being considered so completely a subject of opinion my opponents in matters of painting always assume that there is such a thing as a law of right and that i do not understand it but my architectural adversaries appeal to no law they simply set their opinion against mine and indeed there is no law at present to which either they or i can appeal no man can speak with rational decision of the merits or demerits of buildings he may with obstinacy he may with resolved adherence to previous prejudices but never as if the matter could be otherwise decided than by a majority of votes or pertinacity of partisanship i had always however a clear conviction that there was a law in this matter that good architecture might be indisputably discerned and divided from the bad that the opposition in their very nature and essence was clearly visible and that we were all of us just as unwise in disputing about the matter without reference to principle as we should be for debating about the genuineness of a coin without ringing it i felt also assured that this law must be universal if it were conclusive that it must enable us to reject all foolish and base work and to accept all noble and wise work without reference to style or national feeling that it must sanction the design of all truly great nations and times gothic or greek or arab that it must cast off and reprobate the design of all foolish nations and times chinese or mexican or modern european and that it must be easily applicable to all possible architectural inventions of human mind i set myself therefore to establish such a law in full belief that men are intended without excessive difficulty and by use of their general common sense to know good things from bad and that it is only because they will not be at the pains required for the discernment that the world is so widely encumbered with forgeries and basenesses i found the work simpler than i had hoped the reasonable things ranged themselves in the order i required and the foolish things fell aside and took themselves away so soon as they were looked in the face i had then with respect to venetian architecture the choice either to establish each division of law in a separate form as i came to the features with which it was concerned or else to ask the readers patience while i followed out the general inquiry first and determined with him a code of right and wrong to which we might together make retrospective appeal i thought this the best though perhaps the dullest way and in these first following pages i have therefore endeavored to arrange those foundations of criticism on which i shall rest in my account of venetian architecture in a form clear and simple enough to be intelligible even to those who never thought of architecture before to those who have much of what is stated in them will be well known or selfevident but they must not be indignant at a simplicity on which the whole argument depends for its usefulness from that which appears a mere truism when first stated they will find very singular consequences sometimes followingconsequences altogether unexpected and of considerable importance i will not pause here to dwell on their importance nor on that of the thing itself to be done for i believe most readers will at once admit the value of a criterion of right and wrong in so practical and costly an art as architecture and will be apt rather to doubt the possibility of its attainment than dispute its usefulness if attained i invite them therefore to a fair trial being certain that even if i should fail in my main purpose and be unable to induce in my reader the confidence of judgment i desire i shall at least receive his thanks for the suggestion of consistent reasons which may determine hesitating choice or justify involuntary preference and if i should succeed as i hope in making the stones of venice touchstones and detecting by the mouldering of her marble poison more subtle than ever was betrayed by the rending of her crystal and if thus i am enabled to show the baseness of the schools of architecture and nearly every other art which have for three centuries been predominant in europe i believe the result of the inquiry may be serviceable for proof of a more vital truth than any at which i have hitherto hinted for observe i said the protestant had despised the arts and the rationalist corrupted them but what has the romanist done meanwhile he boasts that it was the papacy which raised the arts why could it not support them when it was left to its own strength how came it to yield to classicalism which was based on infidelity and to oppose no barrier to innovations which have reduced the once faithfully conceived imagery of its worship to stage decoration footnote appendix xii romanist modern art shall we not rather find that romanism instead of being a promoter of the arts has never shown itself capable of a single great conception since the separation of protestantism from its side footnote perfectly true but the whole vital value of the truth was lost by my sectarian ignorance protestantism so far as it was still christianity and did not consist merely in maintaining ones own opinion for gospel could not separate itself from the catholic church the socalled catholics became themselves sectarians and heretics in casting them out and europe was turned into a mere cockpit of the theft and fury of unchristian men of both parties while innocent and silent on the hills and fields gods people in neglected peace everywhere and for ever catholics lived and died so long as corrupt though it might be no clear witness had been borne against it so that it still included in its ranks a vast number of faithful christians so long its arts were noble but the witness was bornethe error made apparent and rome refusing to hear the testimony or forsake the falsehood has been struck from that instant with an intellectual palsy which has not only incapacitated her from any further use of the arts which once were her ministers but has made her worship the shame of its own shrines and her worshippers their destroyers come then if truths such as these are worth our thoughts come and let us know before we enter the streets of the sea city whether we are indeed to submit ourselves to their undistinguished enchantment and to look upon the last changes which were wrought on the lifted forms of her palaces as we should on the capricious towering of summer clouds in the sunset ere they sank into the deep of night or whether rather we shall not behold in the brightness of their accumulated marble pages on which the sentence of her luxury was to be written until the waves should efface it as they fulfilledgod has numbered thy kingdom and finished it     chapter ii  first of second volume in old edition  the throne   section i in the olden days of travelling now to return no more in which distance could not be vanquished without toil but in which that toil was rewarded partly by the power of deliberate survey of the countries through which the journey lay and partly by the happiness of the evening hours when from the top of the last hill he had surmounted the traveller beheld the quiet village where he was to rest scattered among the meadows beside its valley stream or from the longhopedfor turn in the dusty perspective of the causeway saw for the first time the towers of some famed city faint in the rays of sunsethours of peaceful and thoughtful pleasure for which the rush of the arrival in the railway station is perhaps not always or to all men an equivalentin those days i say when there was something more to be anticipated and remembered in the first aspect of each successive haltingplace than a new arrangement of glass roofing and iron girder there were few moments of which the recollection was more fondly cherished by the traveller than that which as i endeavored to describe in the close of the last chapter brought him within sight of venice as his gondola shot into the open lagoon from the canal of mestre not but that the aspect of the city itself was generally the source of some slight disappointment for seen in this direction its buildings are far less characteristic than those of the other great towns of italy but this inferiority was partly disguised by distance and more than atoned for by the strange rising of its walls and towers out of the midst as it seemed of the deep sea for it was impossible that the mind or the eye could at once comprehend the shallowness of the vast sheet of water which stretched away in leagues of rippling lustre to the north and south or trace the narrow line of islets bounding it to the east the salt breeze the white moaning seabirds the masses of black weed separating and disappearing gradually in knots of heaving shoal under the advance of the steady tide all proclaimed it to be indeed the ocean on whose bosom the great city rested so calmly not such blue soft lakelike ocean as bathes the neapolitan promontories or sleeps beneath the marble rocks of genoa but a sea with the bleak power of our own northern waves yet subdued into a strange spacious rest and changed from its angry pallor into a field of burnished gold as the sun declined behind the belfry tower of the lonely island church fitly named st george of the seaweed as the boat drew nearer to the city the coast which the traveller had just left sank behind him into one long low sadcolored line tufted irregularly with brushwood and willows but at what seemed its northern extremity the hills of arqua rose in a dark cluster of purple pyramids balanced on the bright mirage of the lagoon two or three smooth surges of inferior hill extended themselves about their roots and beyond these beginning with the craggy peaks above vicenza the chain of the alps girded the whole horizon to the northa wall of jagged blue here and there showing through its clefts a wilderness of misty precipices fading far back into the recesses of cadore and itself rising and breaking away eastward where the sun struck opposite upon its snow into mighty fragments of peaked light standing up behind the barred clouds of evening one after another countless the crown of the adrian sea until the eye turned back from pursuing them to rest upon the nearer burning of the campaniles of murano and on the great city where it magnified itself along the waves as the quick silent pacing of the gondola drew nearer and nearer and at last when its walls were reached and the outmost of its untrodden streets was entered not through towered gate or guarded rampart but as a deep inlet between two rocks of coral in the indian sea when first upon the travellers sight opened the long ranges of columned palaceseach with its black boat moored at the portaleach with its image cast down beneath its feet upon that green pavement which every breeze broke into new fantasies of rich tessellation when first at the extremity of the bright vista the shadowy rialto threw its colossal curve slowly forth from behind the palace of the camerlenghi that strange curve so delicate so adamantine strong as a mountain cavern graceful as a bow just bent when first before its moonlike circumference was all risen the gondoliers cry ah stali footnote appendix i the gondoliers cry struck sharp upon the ear and the prow turned aside under the mighty cornices that half met over the narrow canal where the plash of the water followed close and loud ringing along the marble by the boats side and when at last that boat darted forth upon the breadth of silver sea across which the front of the ducal palace flushed with its sanguine veins looks to the snowy dome of our lady of salvation footnote appendix ii our lady of salvation it was no marvel that the mind should be so deeply entranced by the visionary charm of a scene so beautiful and so strange as to forget the darker truths of its history and its being well might it seem that such a city had owed her existence rather to the rod of the enchanter than the fear of the fugitive that the waters which encircled her had been chosen for the mirror of her state rather than the shelter of her nakedness and that all which in nature was wild or mercilesstime and decay as well as the waves and tempestshad been won to adorn her instead of to destroy and might still spare for ages to come that beauty which seemed to have fixed for its throne the sands of the hourglass as well as of the sea  section ii and although the last few eventful years fraught with change to the face of the whole earth have been more fatal in their influence on venice than the five hundred that preceded them though the noble landscape of approach to her can now be seen no more or seen only by a glance as the engine slackens its rushing on the iron line and though many of her palaces are for ever defaced and many in desecrated ruins there is still so much of magic in her aspect that the hurried traveller who must leave her before the wonder of that first aspect has been worn away may still be led to forget the humility of her origin and to shut his eyes to the depth of her desolation they at least are little to be envied in whose hearts the great charities of the imagination lie dead and for whom the fancy has no power to repress the importunity of painful impressions or to raise what is ignoble and disguise what is discordant in a scene so rich in its remembrances so surpassing in its beauty but for this work of the imagination there must be no permission during the task which is before us the impotent feeling of romance so singularly characteristic of this century may indeed gild but never save the remains of those mightier ages to which they are attached like climbing flowers and they must be torn away from the magnificent fragments if we would see them as they stood in their own strength those feelings always as fruitless as they are fond are in venice not only incapable of protecting but even of discerning the objects of which they ought to have been attached the venice of modern fiction and drama is a thing of yesterday a mere efflorescence of decay a stage dream which the first ray of daylight must dissipate into dust no prisoner whose name is worth remembering or whose sorrow deserved sympathy ever crossed that bridge of sighs which is the centre of the byronic ideal of venice no great merchant of venice ever saw that rialto under which the traveller now passes with breathless interest the statue which byron makes faliero address as of one of his great ancestors was erected to a soldier of fortune a hundred and fifty years after falieros death and the most conspicuous parts of the city have been so entirely altered in the course of the last three centuries that if henry dandolo or francis foscari could be summoned from their tombs and stood each on the deck of his galley at the entrance of the grand canal that renowned entrance the painters favorite subject the novelists favorite scene where the water first narrows by the steps of the church of la salutethe mighty doges would not know in what spot of the world they stood would literally not recognize one stone of the great city for whose sake and by whose ingratitude their gray hairs had been brought down with bitterness to the grave the remains of their venice lie hidden behind the cumbrous masses which were the delight of the nation in its dotage hidden in many a grassgrown court and silent pathway and lightless canal where the slow waves have sapped their foundations for five hundred years and must soon prevail over them for ever it must be our task to glean and gather them forth and restore out of them some faint image of the lost city more gorgeous a thousandfold than that which now exists yet not created in the daydream of the prince nor by the ostentation of the noble but built by iron hands and patient hearts contending against the adversity of nature and the fury of man so that its wonderfulness cannot be grasped by the indolence of imagination but only after frank inquiry into the true nature of that wild and solitary scene whose restless tides and trembling sands did indeed shelter the birth of the city but long denied her dominion  section iii when the eye falls casually on a map of europe there is no feature by which it is more likely to be arrested than the strange sweeping loop formed by the junction of the alps and the apennines and enclosing the great basin of lombardy this return of the mountain chain upon itself causes a vast difference in the character of the distribution of its d√©bris on its opposite sides the rock fragments and sediment which the torrents on the north side of the alps bear into the plains are distributed over a vast extent of country and though here and there lodged in beds of enormous thickness soon permit the firm substrata to appear from underneath them but all the torrents which descend from the southern side of the high alps and from the northern slope of the apennines meet concentrically in the recess or mountain bay which the two ridges enclose every fragment which thunder breaks out of their battlements and every grain of dust which the summer rain washes from their pastures is at last laid at rest in the blue sweep of the lombardic plain and that plain must have risen within its rocky barriers as a cup fills with wine but for two contrary influences which continually depress or disperse from its surface the accumulation of the ruins of ages  section iv i will not tax the readers faith in modern science by insisting on the singular depression of the surface of lombardy which appears for many centuries to have taken place steadily and continually the main fact with which we have to do is the gradual transport by the po and its great collateral rivers of vast masses of the finer sediment to the sea the character of the lombardic plains is most strikingly expressed by the ancient walls of its cities composed for the most part of large rounded alpine pebbles alternating with narrow courses of brick and was curiously illustrated in 1848 by the ramparts of these same pebbles thrown up four or five feet high round every field to check the austrian cavalry in the battle under the walls of verona the finer dust among which these pebbles are dispersed is taken up by the rivers fed into continual strength by the alpine snow so that however pure their waters may be when they issue from the lakes at the foot of the great chain they become of the color and opacity of clay before they reach the adriatic the sediment which they bear is at once thrown down as they enter the sea forming a vast belt of low land along the eastern coast of italy the powerful stream of the po of course builds forward the fastest on each side of it north and south there is a tract of marsh fed by more feeble streams and less liable to rapid change than the delta of the central river in one of these tracts is built ravenna and in the other venice  section v what circumstances directed the peculiar arrangement of this great belt of sediment in the earliest times it is not here the place to inquire it is enough for us to know that from the mouths of the adige to those of the piave there stretches at a variable distance of from three to five miles from the actual shore a bank of sand divided into long islands by narrow channels of sea the space between this bank and the true shore consists of the sedimentary deposits from these and other rivers a great plain of calcareous mud covered in the neighborhood of venice by the sea at high water to the depth in most places of a foot or a foot and a half and nearly everywhere exposed at low tide but divided by an intricate network of narrow and winding channels from which the sea never retires in some places according to the run of the currents the land has risen into marshy islets consolidated some by art and some by time into ground firm enough to be built upon or fruitful enough to be cultivated in others on the contrary it has not reached the sealevel so that at the average low water shallow lakelets glitter among its irregularly exposed fields of seaweed in the midst of the largest of these increased in importance by the confluence of several large river channels towards one of the openings in the sea bank the city of venice itself is built on a clouded cluster of islands the various plots of higher ground which appear to the north and south of this central cluster have at different periods been also thickly inhabited and now bear according to their size the remains of cities villages or isolated convents and churches scattered among spaces of open ground partly waste and encumbered by ruins partly under cultivation for the supply of the metropolis  section vi the average rise and fall of the tide is about three feet varying considerably with the seasons footnote appendix iii tides of venice but this fall on so flat a shore is enough to cause continual movement in the waters and in the main canals to produce a reflux which frequently runs like a mill stream at high water no land is visible for many miles to the north or south of venice except in the form of small islands crowned with towers or gleaming with villages there is a channel some three miles wide between the city and the mainland and some mile and a half wide between it and the sandy breakwater called the lido which divides the lagoon from the adriatic but which is so low as hardly to disturb the impression of the citys having been built in the midst of the ocean although the secret of its true position is partly yet not painfully betrayed by the clusters of piles set to mark the deepwater channels which undulate far away in spotty chains like the studded backs of huge seasnakes and by the quick glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker and dance before the strong winds upon the unlifted level of the shallow sea but the scene is widely different at low tide a fall of eighteen or twenty inches is enough to show ground over the greater part of the lagoon and at the complete ebb the city is seen standing in the midst of a dark plain of seaweed of gloomy green except only where the larger branches of the brenta and its associated streams converge towards the port of the lido through this salt and sombre plain the gondola and the fishingboat advance by tortuous channels seldom more than four or five feet deep and often so choked with slime that the heavier keels furrow the bottom till their crossing tracks are seen through the clear sea water like the ruts upon a wintry road and the oar leaves blue gashes upon the ground at every stroke or is entangled among the thick weed that fringes the banks with the weight of its sullen waves leaning to and fro upon the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide the scene is often profoundly oppressive even at this day when every plot of higher ground bears some fragment of fair building but in order to know what it was once let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the windings of some unfrequented channel far into the midst of the melancholy plain let him remove in his imagination the brightness of the great city that still extends itself in the distance and the walls and towers from the islands that are near and so wait until the bright investiture and sweet warmth of the sunset are withdrawn from the waters and the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath the night pathless comfortless infirm lost in dark languor and fearful silence except where the salt runlets plash into the tideless pools or the seabirds flit from their margins with a questioning cry and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently chosen by man for his habitation they little thought who first drove the stakes into the sand and strewed the ocean reeds for their rest that their children were to be the princes of that ocean and their palaces its pride and yet in the great natural laws that rule that sorrowful wilderness let it be remembered what strange preparation had been made for the things which no human imagination could have foretold and how the whole existence and fortune of the venetian nation were anticipated or compelled by the setting of those bars and doors to the rivers and the sea had deeper currents divided their islands hostile navies would again and again have reduced the rising city into servitude had stronger surges beaten their shores all the richness and refinement of the venetian architecture must have been exchanged for the walls and bulwarks of an ordinary seaport had there been no tide as in other parts of the mediterranean the narrow canals of the city would have become noisome and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous had the tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in its rise the wateraccess to the doors of the palaces would have been impossible even as it is there is sometimes a little difficulty at the ebb in landing without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps and the highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards and overflow the entrance halls eighteen inches more of difference between the level of the flood and ebb would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace at low water a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets and the entire system of watercarriage for the higher classes in their easy and daily intercourse must have been done away with the streets of the city would have been widened its network of canals filled up and all the peculiar character of the place and the people destroyed  section vii the reader may perhaps have felt some pain in the contrast between this faithful view of the site of the venetian throne and the romantic conception of it which we ordinarily form but this pain if he have felt it ought to be more than counterbalanced by the value of the instance thus afforded to us at once of the inscrutableness and the wisdom of the ways of god if two thousand years ago we had been permitted to watch the slow settling of the slime of those turbid rivers into the polluted sea and the gaining upon its deep and fresh waters of the lifeless impassable unvoyageable plain how little could we have understood the purpose with which those islands were shaped out of the void and the torpid waters enclosed with their desolate walls of sand how little could we have known any more than of what now seems to us most distressful dark and objectless the glorious aim which was then in the mind of him in whose hand are all the corners of the earth how little imagined that in the laws which were stretching forth the gloomy margins of those fruitless banks and feeding the bitter grass among their shallows there was indeed a preparation and the only preparation possible for the founding of a city which was to be set like a golden clasp on the girdle of the earth to write her history on the white scrolls of the seasurges and to word it in their thunder and to gather and give forth in worldwide pulsation the glory of the west and of the east from the burning heart of her fortitude and splendor     chapter iii  second of second volume in old edition  torcello   section i seven miles to the north of venice the banks of sand which near the city rise little above lowwater mark attain by degrees a higher level and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass raised here and there into shapeless mounds and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea one of the feeblest of these inlets after winding for some time among buried fragments of masonry and knots of sunburnt weeds whitened with webs of fucus stays itself in an utterly stagnant pool beside a plot of greener grass covered with ground ivy and violets on this mound is built a rude brick campanile of the commonest lombardic type which if we ascend towards evening and there are none to hinder us the door of its ruinous staircase swinging idly on its hinges we may command from it one of the most notable scenes in this wide world of ours far as the eye can reach a waste of wild sea moor of a lurid ashen gray not like our northern moors with their jetblack pools and purple heath but lifeless the color of sackcloth with the corrupted seawater soaking through the roots of its acrid weeds and gleaming hither and thither through its snaky channels no gathering of fantastic mists nor coursing of clouds across it but melancholy clearness of space in the warm sunset oppressive reaching to the horizon of its level gloom to the very horizon on the northeast but to the north and west there is a blue line of higher land along the border of it and above this but farther back a misty band of mountains touched with snow to the east the paleness and roar of the adriatic louder at momentary intervals as the surf breaks on the bars of sand to the south the widening branches of the calm lagoon alternately purple and pale green as they reflect the evening clouds or twilight sky and almost beneath our feet on the same field which sustains the tower we gaze from a group of four buildings two of them little larger than cottages though built of stone and one adorned by a quaint belfry the third an octagonal chapel of which we can see but little more than the flat red roof with its rayed tiling the fourth a considerable church with nave and aisles but of which in like manner we can see little but the long central ridge and lateral slopes of roof which the sunlight separates in one glowing mass from the green field beneath and gray moor beyond there are no living creatures near the buildings nor any vestige of village or city round about them they lie like a little company of ships becalmed on a faraway sea  section ii then look farther to the south beyond the widening branches of the lagoon and rising out of the bright lake into which they gather there are a multitude of towers dark and scattered among squareset shapes of clustered palaces a long and irregular line fretting the southern sky  mother and daughter you behold them both in their widowhoodtorcello and venice  thirteen hundred years ago the gray moorland looked as it does this day and the purple mountains stood as radiantly in the deep distances of evening but on the line of the horizon there were strange fires mixed with the light of sunset and the lament of many human voices mixed with the fretting of the waves on their ridges of sand the flames rose from the ruins of altinum the lament from the multitude of its people seeking like israel of old a refuge from the sword in the paths of the sea  the cattle are feeding and resting upon the site of the city that they left the mowers scythe swept this day at dawn over the chief street of the city that they built and the swathes of soft grass are now sending up their scent into the night air the only incense that fills the temple of their ancient worship let us go down into that little space of meadow land  section iii the inlet which runs nearest to the base of the campanile is not that by which torcello is commonly approached another somewhat broader and overhung by alder copse winds out of the main channel of the lagoon up to the very edge of the little meadow which was once the piazza of the city and there stayed by a few grey stones which present some semblance of a quay forms its boundary at one extremity hardly larger than an ordinary english farmyard and roughly enclosed on each side by broken palings and hedges of honeysuckle and briar the narrow field retires from the waters edge traversed by a scarcely traceable footpath for some forty or fifty paces and then expanding into the form of a small square with buildings on three sides of it the fourth being that which opens to the water two of these that on our left and that in front of us as we approach from the canal are so small that they might well be taken for the outhouses of the farm though the first is a conventual building and the other aspires to the title of the palazzo publico both dating as far back as the beginning of the fourteenth century the third the octagonal church of santa fosca is far more ancient than either yet hardly on a larger scale though the pillars of the portico which surrounds it are of pure greek marble and their capitals are enriched with delicate sculpture they and the arches they sustain together only raise the roof to the height of a cattleshed and the first strong impression which the spectator receives from the whole scene is that whatever sin it may have been which has on this spot been visited with so utter a desolation it could not at least have been ambition nor will this impression be diminished as we approach or enter the larger church to which the whole group of building is subordinate it has evidently been built by men in flight and distress footnote appendix iv date of the duomo of torcello who sought in the hurried erection of their island church such a shelter for their earnest and sorrowful worship as on the one hand could not attract the eyes of their enemies by its splendor and yet on the other might not awaken too bitter feelings by its contrast with the churches which they had seen destroyed  there is visible everywhere a simple and tender effort to recover some of the form of the temples which they had loved and to do honor to god by that which they were erecting while distress and humiliation prevented the desire and prudence precluded the admission either of luxury of ornament or magnificence of plan the exterior is absolutely devoid of decoration with the exception only of the western entrance and the lateral door of which the former has carved sideposts and architrave and the latter crosses of rich sculpture while the massy stone shutters of the windows turning on huge rings of stone which answer the double purpose of stanchions and brackets cause the whole building rather to resemble a refuge from alpine storm than the cathedral of a populous city and internally the two solemn mosaics of the eastern and western extremitiesone representing the last judgment the other the madonna her tears falling as her hands are raised to blessand the noble range of pillars which enclose the space between terminated by the high throne for the pastor and the semicircular raised seats for the superior clergy are expressive at once of the deep sorrow and the sacred courage of men who had no home left them upon earth but who looked for one to come of men persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed  section iv for observe this choice of subjects it is indeed possible that the walls of the nave and aisles which are now whitewashed may have been covered with fresco or mosaic and thus have supplied a series of subjects on the choice of which we cannot speculate i do not however find record of the destruction of any such works and i am rather inclined to believe that at any rate the central division of the building was originally decorated as it is now simply by mosaics representing christ the virgin and the apostles at one extremity and christ coming to judgment at the other and if so i repeat observe the significance of this choice most other early churches are covered with imagery sufficiently suggestive of the vivid interest of the builders in the history and occupations of the world symbols or representations of political events portraits of living persons and sculptures of satirical grotesque or trivial subjects are of constant occurrence mingled with the more strictly appointed representations of scriptural or ecclesiastical history but at torcello even these usual and one should have thought almost necessary successions of bible events do not appear the mind of the worshipper was fixed entirely upon two great facts to him the most precious of all factsthe present mercy of christ to his church and his future coming to judge the world that christs mercy was at this period supposed chiefly to be attainable through the pleading of the virgin and that therefore beneath the figure of the redeemer is seen that of the weeping madonna in the act of intercession may indeed be matter of sorrow to the protestant beholder but ought not to blind him to the earnestness and singleness of the faith with which these men sought their seasolitudes not in hope of founding new dynasties or entering upon new epochs of prosperity but only to humble themselves before god and to pray that in his infinite mercy he would hasten the time when the sea should give up the dead which were in it and death and hell give up the dead which were in them and when they might enter into the better kingdom where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  section v nor were the strength and elasticity of their minds even in the least matters diminished by thus looking forward to the close of all things on the contrary nothing is more remarkable than the finish and beauty of all the portions of the building which seem to have been actually executed for the place they occupy in the present structure the rudest are those which they brought with them from the mainland the best and most beautiful those which appear to have been carved for their island church of these the new capitals already noticed and the exquisite panel ornaments of the chancel screen are the most conspicuous the latter form a low wall across the church between the six small shafts whose places are seen in the plan and serve to enclose a space raised two steps above the level of the nave destined for the singers and indicated also in the plan by an open line a b c d the basreliefs on this low screen are groups of peacocks and lions two face to face on each panel rich and fantastic beyond description though not expressive of very accurate knowledge either of leonine or pavonine forms and it is not until we pass to the back of the stair of the pulpit which is connected with the northern extremity of this screen that we find evidence of the haste with which the church was constructed  section vi the pulpit however is not among the least noticeable of its features it is sustained on the four small detached shafts marked at p in the plan between the two pillars at the north side of the screen both pillars and pulpit studiously plain while the staircase which ascends to it is a compact mass of masonry shaded in the plan faced by carved slabs of marble the parapet of the staircase being also formed of solid blocks like pavingstones lightened by rich but not deep exterior carving now these blocks or at least those which adorn the staircase towards the aisle have been brought from the mainland and being of size and shape not easily to be adjusted to the proportions of the stair the architect has cut out of them pieces of the size he needed utterly regardless of the subject or symmetry of the original design the pulpit is not the only place where this rough procedure has been permitted at the lateral door of the church are two crosses cut out of slabs of marble formerly covered with rich sculpture over their whole surfaces of which portions are left on the surface of the crosses the lines of the original design being of course just as arbitrarily cut by the incisions between the arms as the patterns upon a piece of silk which has been shaped anew the fact is that in all early romanesque work large surfaces are covered with sculpture for the sake of enrichment only sculpture which indeed had always meaning because it was easier for the sculptor to work with some chain of thought to guide his chisel than without any but it was not always intended or at least not always hoped that this chain of thought might be traced by the spectator all that was proposed appears to have been the enrichment of surface so as to make it delightful to the eye and this being once understood a decorated piece of marble became to the architect just what a piece of lace or embroidery is to a dressmaker who takes of it such portions as she may require with little regard to the places where the patterns are divided and though it may appear at first sight that the procedure is indicative of bluntness and rudeness of feelingwe may perceive upon reflection that it may also indicate the redundance of power which sets little price upon its own exertion when a barbarous nation builds its fortresswalls out of fragments of the refined architecture it has overthrown we can read nothing but its savageness in the vestiges of art which may thus chance to have been preserved but when the new work is equal if not superior in execution to the pieces of the older art which are associated with it we may justly conclude that the rough treatment to which the latter have been subjected is rather a sign of the hope of doing better things than of want of feeling for those already accomplished and in general this careless fitting of ornament is in very truth an evidence of life in the school of builders and of their making a due distinction between work which is to be used for architectural effect and work which is to possess an abstract perfection and it commonly shows also that the exertion of design is so easy to them and their fertility so inexhaustible that they feel no remorse in using somewhat injuriously what they can replace with so slight an effort  section vii it appears however questionable in the present instance whether if the marbles had not been carved to his hand the architect would have taken the trouble to enrich them for the execution of the rest of the pulpit is studiously simple and it is in this respect that its design possesses it seems to me an interest to the religious spectator greater than he will take in any other portion of the building it is supported as i said on a group of four slender shafts itself of a slightly oval form extending nearly from one pillar of the nave to the next so as to give the preacher free room for the action of the entire person which always gives an unaffected impressiveness to the eloquence of the southern nations in the centre of its curved front a small bracket and detached shaft sustain the projection of a narrow marble desk occupying the place of a cushion in a modern pulpit which is hollowed out into a shallow curve on the upper surface leaving a ledge at the bottom of the slab so that a book laid upon it or rather into it settles itself there opening as if by instinct but without the least chance of slipping to the side or in any way moving beneath the preachers hands six balls or rather almonds of purple marble veined with white are set round the edge of the pulpit and form its only decoration perfectly graceful but severe and almost cold in its simplicity built for permanence and service so that no single member no stone of it could be spared and yet all are firm and uninjured as when they were first set together it stands in venerable contrast both with the fantastic pulpits of mediaeval cathedrals and with the rich furniture of those of our modern churches it is worth while pausing for a moment to consider how far the manner of decorating a pulpit may have influence on the efficiency of its service and whether our modern treatment of this to us allimportant feature of a church be the best possible footnote appendix v modern pulpits  section viii when the sermon is good we need not much concern ourselves about the form of the pulpit but sermons cannot always be good and i believe that the temper in which the congregation set themselves to listen may be in some degree modified by their perception of fitness or unfitness impressiveness or vulgarity in the disposition of the place appointed for the speakernot to the same degree but somewhat in the same way that they may be influenced by his own gestures or expression irrespective of the sense of what he says i believe therefore in the first place that pulpits ought never to be highly decorated the speaker is apt to look mean or diminutive if the pulpit is either on a very large scale or covered with splendid ornament and if the interest of the sermon should flag the mind is instantly tempted to wander i have observed that in almost all cathedrals when the pulpits are peculiarly magnificent sermons are not often preached from them but rather and especially if for any important purpose from some temporary erection in other parts of the buildingand though this may often be done because the architect has consulted the effect upon the eye more than the convenience of the ear in the placing of his larger pulpit i think it also proceeds in some measure from a natural dislike in the preacher to match himself with the magnificence of the rostrum lest the sermon should not be thought worthy of the place yet this will rather hold of the colossal sculptures and pyramids of fantastic tracery which encumber the pulpits of flemish and german churches than of the delicate mosaics and ivorylike carving of the romanesque basilicas for when the form is kept simple much loveliness of color and costliness of work may be introduced and yet the speaker not be thrown into the shade by them  section ix but in the second place whatever ornaments we admit ought clearly to be of a chaste grave and noble kind and what furniture we employ evidently more for the honoring of gods word than for the ease of the preacher for there are two ways of regarding a sermon either as a human composition or a divine message if we look upon it entirely as the first and require our clergymen to finish it with their utmost care and learning for our better delight whether of ear or intellect we shall necessarily be led to expect much formality and stateliness in its delivery and to think that all is not well if the pulpit have not a golden fringe round it and a goodly cushion in front of it and if the sermon be not fairly written in a black book to be smoothed upon the cushion in a majestic manner before beginning all this we shall duly come to expect but we shall at the same time consider the treatise thus prepared as something to which it is our duty to listen without restlessness for half an hour or three quarters but which when that duty has been decorously performed we may dismiss from our minds in happy confidence of being provided with another when next it shall be necessary but if once we begin to regard the preacher whatever his faults as a man sent with a message to us which it is a matter of life or death whether we hear or refuse if we look upon him as set in charge over many spirits in danger of ruin and having allowed to him but an hour or two in the seven days to speak to them if we make some endeavor to conceive how precious these hours ought to be to him a small vantage on the side of god after his flock have been exposed for six days together to the full weight of the worlds temptation and he has been forced to watch the thorn and the thistle springing in their hearts and to see what wheat had been scattered there snatched from the wayside by this wild bird and the other and at last when breathless and weary with the weeks labor they give him this interval of imperfect and languid hearing he has but thirty minutes to get at the separate hearts of a thousand men to convince them of all their weaknesses to shame them for all their sins to warn them of all their dangers to try by this way and that to stir the hard fastenings of those doors where the master himself has stood and knocked yet none opened and to call at the openings of those dark streets where wisdom herself hath stretched forth her hands and no man regardedthirty minutes to raise the dead inlet us but once understand and feel this and we shall look with changed eyes upon that frippery of gay furniture about the place from which the message of judgment must be delivered which either breathes upon the dry bones that they may live or if ineffectual remains recorded in condemnation perhaps against the utterer and listener alike but assuredly against one of them we shall not so easily bear with the silk and gold upon the seat of judgment nor with ornament of oratory in the mouth of the messenger we shall wish that his words may be simple even when they are sweetest and the place from which he speaks like a marble rock in the desert about which the people have gathered in their thirst  section x but the severity which is so marked in the pulpit at torcello is still more striking in the raised seats and episcopal throne which occupy the curve of the apse the arrangement at first somewhat recalls to the mind that of the roman amphitheatres the flight of steps which lead up to the central throne divides the curve of the continuous steps or seats it appears in the first three ranges questionable which were intended for they seem too high for the one and too low and close for the other exactly as in an amphitheatre the stairs for access intersect the sweeping ranges of seats but in the very rudeness of this arrangement and especially in the want of all appliances of comfort for the whole is of marble and the arms of the central throne are not for convenience but for distinction and to separate it more conspicuously from the undivided seats there is a dignity which no furniture of stalls nor carving of canopies ever could attain and well worth the contemplation of the protestant both as sternly significative of an episcopal authority which in the early days of the church was never disputed and as dependent for all its impressiveness on the utter absence of any expression either of pride or selfindulgence  section xi but there is one more circumstance which we ought to remember as giving peculiar significance to the position which the episcopal throne occupies in this island church namely that in the minds of all early christians the church itself was most frequently symbolized under the image of a ship of which the bishop was the pilot consider the force which this symbol would assume in the imaginations of men to whom the spiritual church had become an ark of refuge in the midst of a destruction hardly less terrible than that from which the eight souls were saved of old a destruction in which the wrath of man had become as broad as the earth and as merciless as the sea and who saw the actual and literal edifice of the church raked up itself like an ark in the midst of the waters no marvel if with the surf of the adriatic rolling between them and the shores of their birth from which they were separated for ever they should have looked upon each other as the disciples did when the storm came down on the tiberias lake and have yielded ready and loving obedience to those who ruled them in his name who had there rebuked the winds and commanded stillness to the sea and if the stranger would yet learn in what spirit it was that the dominion of venice was begun and in what strength she went forth conquering and to conquer let him not seek to estimate the wealth of her arsenals or number of her armies nor look upon the pageantry of her palaces nor enter into the secrets of her councils but let him ascend the highest tier of the stern ledges that sweep round the altar of torcello and then looking as the pilot did of old along the marble ribs of the goodly templeship let him repeople its veined deck with the shadows of its dead mariners and strive to feel in himself the strength of heart that was kindled within them when first after the pillars of it had settled in the sand and the roof of it had been closed against the angry sky that was still reddened by the fires of their homesteadsfirst within the shelter of its knitted walls amidst the murmur of the waste of waves and the beating of the wings of the seabirds round the rock that was strange to themrose that ancient hymn in the power of their gathered voices    the sea is his and he made it   and his hands prepared the dry land     chapter iv  st marks   section i and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus if as the shores of asia lessened upon his sight the spirit of prophecy had entered into the heart of the weak disciple who had turned back when his hand was on the plough and who had been judged by the chiefest of christs captains unworthy thenceforward to go forth with him to the work footnote acts xiii 13 xv 38 39 how wonderful would he have thought it that by the lion symbol in future ages he was to be represented among men how woful that the warcry of his name should so often reanimate the rage of the soldier on those very plains where he himself had failed in the courage of the christian and so often dye with fruitless blood that very cypriot sea over whose waves in repentance and shame he was following the son of consolation  section ii that the venetians possessed themselves of his body in the ninth century there appears no sufficient reason to doubt nor that it was principally in consequence of their having done so that they chose him for their patron saint there exists however a tradition that before he went into egypt he had founded the church at aquileia and was thus in some sort the first bishop of the venetian isles and people i believe that this tradition stands on nearly as good grounds as that of st peter having been the first bishop of rome footnote the reader who desires to investigate it may consult galliciolli delle memorie venete venice 1795 tom ii p 332 and the authorities quoted by him but as usual it is enriched by various later additions and embellishments much resembling the stories told respecting the church of murano thus we find it recorded by the santo padre who compiled the vite de santi spettanti alle chiese di venezia footnote venice 1761 tom i p 126 that st mark having seen the people of aquileia well grounded in religion and being called to rome by st peter before setting off took with him the holy bishop hermagoras and went in a small boat to the marshes of venice there were at that period some houses built upon a certain high bank called rialto and the boat being driven by the wind was anchored in a marshy place when st mark snatched into ecstasy heard the voice of an angel saying to him peace be to thee mark here shall thy body rest the angel goes on to foretell the building of una stupenda ne pi√π veduta citt√† but the fable is hardly ingenious enough to deserve farther relation  section iii but whether st mark was first bishop of aquileia or not st theodore was the first patron of the city nor can he yet be considered as having entirely abdicated his early right as his statue standing on a crocodile still companions the winged lion on the opposing pillar of the piazzetta a church erected to this saint is said to have occupied before the ninth century the site of st marks and the traveller dazzled by the brilliancy of the great square ought not to leave it without endeavoring to imagine its aspect in that early time when it was a green field cloisterlike and quiet footnote st marks place partly covered by turf and planted with a few trees and on account of its pleasant aspect called brollo or broglio that is to say garden the canal passed through it over which is built the bridge of the malpassi galliciolli lib i cap viii divided by a small canal with a line of trees on each side and extending between the two churches of st theodore and st geminian as the little piazza of torcello lies between its palazzo and cathedral  section iv but in the year 813 when the seat of government was finally removed to the rialto a ducal palace built on the spot where the present one stands with a ducal chapel beside it footnote my authorities for this statement are given below in the chapter on the ducal palace gave a very different character to the square of st mark and fifteen years later the acquisition of the body of the saint and its deposition in the ducal chapel perhaps not yet completed occasioned the investiture of that chapel with all possible splendor st theodore was deposed from his patronship and his church destroyed to make room for the aggrandizement of the one attached to the ducal palace and thenceforward known as st marks footnote in the chronicles sancti marci ducalis cappella  section v this first church was however destroyed by fire when the ducal palace was burned in the revolt against candiano in 976 it was partly rebuilt by his successor pietro orseolo on a larger scale and with the assistance of byzantine architects the fabric was carried on under successive doges for nearly a hundred years the main building being completed in 1071 but its incrustation with marble not till considerably later it was consecrated on the 8th of october 1085 footnote to god the lord the glorious virgin annunciate and the protector st markcorner p 14 it is needless to trouble the reader with the various authorities for the above statements i have consulted the best the previous inscription once existing on the church itself    anno milleno transacto bisque trigeno   desuper undecimo fuit facta primo  is no longer to be seen and is conjectured by corner with much probability to have perished in qualche ristauro according to sansovino and the author of the chiesa ducale di s marco in 1094 according to lazari but certainly between 1084 and 1096 those years being the limits of the reign of vital falier i incline to the supposition that it was soon after his accession to the throne in 1085 though sansovino writes by mistake ordelafo instead of vital falier but at all events before the close of the eleventh century the great consecration of the church took place it was again injured by fire in 1106 but repaired and from that time to the fall of venice there was probably no doge who did not in some slight degree embellish or alter the fabric so that few parts of it can be pronounced boldly to be of any given date two periods of interference are however notable above the rest the first that in which the gothic school had superseded the byzantine towards the close of the fourteenth century when the pinnacles upper archivolts and window traceries were added to the exterior and the great screen with various chapels and tabernaclework to the interior the second when the renaissance school superseded the gothic and the pupils of titian and tintoret substituted over one half of the church their own compositions for the greek mosaics with which it was originally decorated footnote signed bartolomeus bozza 1634 1647 1656 etc happily though with no good will having left enough to enable us to imagine and lament what they destroyed of this irreparable loss we shall have more to say hereafter meantime i wish only to fix in the readers mind the succession of periods of alteration as firmly and simply as possible  section vi we have seen that the main body of the church may be broadly stated to be of the eleventh century the gothic additions of the fourteenth and the restored mosaics of the seventeenth there is no difficulty in distinguishing at a glance the gothic portions from the byzantine but there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining how long during the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries additions were made to the byzantine church which cannot be easily distinguished from the work of the eleventh century being purposely executed in the same manner two of the most important pieces of evidence on this point are a mosaic in the south transept and another over the northern door of the fa√ßade the first representing the interior the second the exterior of the ancient church  section vii it has just been stated that the existing building was consecrated by the doge vital falier a peculiar solemnity was given to that of consecration in the minds of the venetian people by what appears to have been one of the best arranged and most successful impostures ever attempted by the clergy of the romish church the body of st mark had without doubt perished in the conflagration of 976 but the revenues of the church depended too much upon the devotion excited by these relics to permit the confession of their loss the following is the account given by corner and believed to this day by the venetians of the pretended miracle by which it was concealed  after the repairs undertaken by the doge orseolo the place in which the body of the holy evangelist rested had been altogether forgotten so that the doge vital falier was entirely ignorant of the place of the venerable deposit this was no light affliction not only to the pious doge but to all the citizens and people so that at last moved by confidence in the divine mercy they determined to implore with prayer and fasting the manifestation of so great a treasure which did not now depend upon any human effort a general fast being therefore proclaimed and a solemn procession appointed for the 25th day of june while the people assembled in the church interceded with god in fervent prayers for the desired boon they beheld with as much amazement as joy a slight shaking in the marbles of a pillar near the place where the altar of the cross is now which presently falling to the earth exposed to the view of the rejoicing people the chest of bronze in which the body of the evangelist was laid  section viii of the main facts of this tale there is no doubt they were embellished afterwards as usual by many fanciful traditions as for instance that when the sarcophagus was discovered st mark extended his hand out of it with a gold ring on one of the fingers which he permitted a noble of the dolfin family to remove and a quaint and delightful story was further invented of this ring which i shall not repeat here as it is now as well known as any tale of the arabian nights but the fast and the discovery of the coffin by whatever means effected are facts and they are recorded in one of the bestpreserved mosaics of the north transept executed very certainly not long after the event had taken place closely resembling in its treatment that of the bayeux tapestry and showing in a conventional manner the interior of the church as it then was filled by the people first in prayer then in thanksgiving the pillar standing open before them and the doge in the midst of them distinguished by his crimson bonnet embroidered with gold but more unmistakably by the inscription dux over his head as uniformly is the case in the bayeux tapestry and most other pictorial works of the period the church is of course rudely represented and the two upper stories of it reduced to a small scale in order to form a background to the figures one of those bold pieces of picture history which we in our pride of perspective and a thousand things besides never dare attempt we should have put in a column or two of the real or perspective size and subdued it into a vague background the old workman crushed the church together that he might get it all in up to the cupolas and has therefore left us some useful notes of its ancient form though any one who is familiar with the method of drawing employed at the period will not push the evidence too far the two pulpits are there however as they are at this day and the fringe of mosaic flowerwork which then encompassed the whole church but which modern restorers have destroyed all but one fragment still left in the south aisle there is no attempt to represent the other mosaics on the roof the scale being too small to admit of their being represented with any success but some at least of those mosaics had been executed at that period and their absence in the representation of the entire church is especially to be observed in order to show that we must not trust to any negative evidence in such works m lazari has rashly concluded that the central archivolt of st marks must be posterior to the year 1205 because it does not appear in the representation of the exterior of the church over the northern door footnote guida di venezia p 6 he is right however but he justly observes that this mosaic which is the other piece of evidence we possess respecting the ancient form of the building cannot itself be earlier than 1205 since it represents the bronze horses which were brought from constantinople in that year and this one fact renders it very difficult to speak with confidence respecting the date of any part of the exterior of st marks for we have above seen that it was consecrated in the eleventh century and yet here is one of the most important exterior decorations assuredly retouched if not entirely added in the thirteenth although its style would have led us to suppose it had been an original part of the fabric however for all our purposes it will be enough for the reader to remember that the earliest parts of the building belong to the eleventh twelfth and first part of the thirteenth century the gothic portions to the fourteenth some of the altars and embellishments to the fifteenth and sixteenth and the modern portion of the mosaics to the seventeenth  section ix this however i only wish him to recollect in order that i may speak generally of the byzantine architecture of st marks without leading him to suppose the whole church to have been built and decorated by greek artists its later portions with the single exception of the seventeenth century mosaics have been so dexterously accommodated to the original fabric that the general effect is still that of a byzantine building and i shall not except when it is absolutely necessary direct attention to the discordant points or weary the reader with anatomical criticism whatever in st marks arrests the eye or affects the feelings is either byzantine or has been modified by byzantine influence and our inquiry into its architectural merits need not therefore be disturbed by the anxieties of antiquarianism or arrested by the obscurities of chronology  section x and now i wish that the reader before i bring him into st marks place would imagine himself for a little time in a quiet english cathedral town and walk with me to the west front of its cathedral let us go together up the more retired street at the end of which we can see the pinnacles of one of the towers and then through the low gray gateway with its battlemented top and small latticed window in the centre into the inner privatelooking road or close where nothing goes in but the carts of the tradesmen who supply the bishop and the chapter and where there are little shaven grassplots fenced in by neat rails before oldfashioned groups of somewhat diminutive and excessively trim houses with little oriel and bay windows jutting out here and there and deep wooden cornices and eaves painted cream color and white and small porches to their doors in the shape of cockleshells or little crooked thick indescribable wooden gables warped a little on one side and so forward till we come to larger houses also oldfashioned but of red brick and with gardens behind them and fruit walls which show here and there among the nectarines the vestiges of an old cloister arch or shaft and looking in front on the cathedral square itself laid out in rigid divisions of smooth grass and gravel walk yet not uncheerful especially on the sunny side where the canons children are walking with their nurserymaids and so taking care not to tread on the grass we will go along the straight walk to the west front and there stand for a time looking up at its deeppointed porches and the dark places between their pillars where there were statues once and where the fragments here and there of a stately figure are still left which has in it the likeness of a king perhaps indeed a king on earth perhaps a saintly king long ago in heaven and so higher and higher up to the great mouldering wall of rugged sculpture and confused arcades shattered and gray and grisly with heads of dragons and mocking fiends worn by the rain and swirling winds into yet unseemlier shape and colored on their stony scales by the deep russetorange lichen melancholy gold and so higher still to the bleak towers so far above that the eye loses itself among the bosses of their traceries though they are rude and strong and only sees like a drift of eddying black points now closing now scattering and now settling suddenly into invisible places among the bosses and flowers the crowd of restless birds that fill the whole square with that strange clangor of theirs so harsh and yet so soothing like the cries of birds on a solitary coast between the cliffs and sea  section xi think for a little while of that scene and the meaning of all its small formalisms mixed with its serene sublimity estimate its secluded continuous drowsy felicities and its evidence of the sense and steady performance of such kind of duties as can be regulated by the cathedral clock and weigh the influence of those dark towers on all who have passed through the lonely square at their feet for centuries and on all who have seen them rising far away over the wooded plain or catching on their square masses the last rays of the sunset when the city at their feet was indicated only by the mist at the bend of the river and then let us quickly recollect that we are in venice and land at the extremity of the calle lunga san mois√® which may be considered as there answering to the secluded street that led us to our english cathedral gateway  section xii we find ourselves in a paved alley some seven feet wide where it is widest full of people and resonant with cries of itinerant salesmena shriek in their beginning and dying away into a kind of brazen ringing all the worse for its confinement between the high houses of the passage along which we have to make our way over head an inextricable confusion of rugged shutters and iron balconies and chimney flues pushed out on brackets to save room and arched windows with projecting sills of istrian stone and gleams of green leaves here and there where a figtree branch escapes over a lower wall from some inner cortile leading the eye up to the narrow stream of blue sky high over all on each side a row of shops as densely set as may be occupying in fact intervals between the square stone shafts about eight feet high which carry the first floors intervals of which one is narrow and serves as a door the other is in the more respectable shops wainscoted to the height of the counter and glazed above but in those of the poorer tradesmen left open to the ground and the wares laid on benches and tables in the open air the light in all cases entering at the front onlyand fading away in a few feet from the threshold into a gloom which the eye from without cannot penetrate but which is generally broken by a ray or two from a feeble lamp at the back of the shop suspended before a print of the virgin the less pious shopkeeper sometimes leaves his lamp unlighted and is contented with a penny print the more religious one has his print colored and set in a little shrine with a gilded or figured fringe with perhaps a faded flower or two on each side and his lamp burning brilliantly here at the fruiterers where the darkgreen watermelons are heaped upon the counter like cannon balls the madonna has a tabernacle of fresh laurel leaves but the pewterer next door has let his lamp out and there is nothing to be seen in his shop but the dull gleam of the studded patterns on the copper pans hanging from his roof in the darkness next comes a vendita frittole e liquori where the virgin enthroned in a very humble manner beside a tallow candle on a back shelf presides over certain ambrosial morsels of a nature too ambiguous to be denned or enumerated but a few steps farther on at the regular wineshop of the calle where we are offered vino nostrani a soldi 2832 the madonna is in great glory enthroned above ten or a dozen large red casks of threeyearold vintage and flanked by goodly ranks of bottles of maraschino and two crimson lamps and for the evening when the gondoliers will come to drink out under her auspices the money they have gained during the day she will have a whole chandelier  section xiii a yard or two farther we pass the hostelry of the black eagle and glancing as we pass through the square door of marble deeply moulded in the outer wall we see the shadows of its pergola of vines resting on an ancient well with a pointed shield carved on its side and so presently emerge on the bridge and campo san mois√® whence to the entrance into st marks place called the bocca di piazza mouth of the square the venetian character is nearly destroyed first by the frightful fa√ßade of san mois√® which we will pause at another time to examine and then by the modernizing of the shops as they near the piazza and the mingling with the lower venetian populace of lounging groups of english and austrians we will push fast through them into the shadow of the pillars at the end of the bocca di piazza and then we forget them all for between those pillars there opens a great light and in the midst of it as we advance slowly the vast tower of st mark seems to lift itself visibly forth from the level field of chequered stones and on each side the countless arches prolong themselves into ranged symmetry as if the rugged and irregular houses that pressed together above us in the dark alley had been struck back into sudden obedience and lovely order and all their rude casements and broken walls had been transformed into arches charged with goodly sculpture and fluted shafts of delicate stone  section xiv and well may they fall back for beyond those troops of ordered arches there rises a vision out of the earth and all the great square seems to have opened from it in a kind of awe that we may see it far awaya multitude of pillars and white domes clustered into a long low pyramid of colored light a treasureheap it seems partly of gold and partly of opal and motherofpearl hollowed beneath into five great vaulted porches ceiled with fair mosaic and beset with sculpture of alabaster clear as amber and delicate as ivorysculpture fantastic and involved of palm leaves and lilies and grapes and pomegranates and birds clinging and fluttering among the branches all twined together into an endless network of buds and plumes and in the midst of it the solemn forms of angels sceptred and robed to the feet and leaning to each other across the gates their figures indistinct among the gleaming of the golden ground through the leaves beside them interrupted and dim like the morning light as it faded back among the branches of eden when first its gates were angelguarded long ago and round the walls of the porches there are set pillars of variegated stones jasper and porphyry and deepgreen serpentine spotted with flakes of snow and marbles that half refuse and half yield to the sunshine cleopatralike their bluest veins to kissthe shadow as it steals back from them revealing line after line of azure undulation as a receding tide leaves the waved sand their capitals rich with interwoven tracery rooted knots of herbage and drifting leaves of acanthus and vine and mystical signs all beginning and ending in the cross and above them in the broad archivolts a continuous chain of language and of lifeangels and the signs of heaven and the labors of men each in its appointed season upon the earth and above these another range of glittering pinnacles mixed with white arches edged with scarlet flowersa confusion of delight amidst which the breasts of the greek horses are seen blazing in their breadth of golden strength and the st marks lion lifted on a blue field covered with stars until at last as if in ecstasy the crests of the arches break into a marble foam and toss themselves far into the blue sky in flashes and wreaths of sculptured spray as if the breakers on the lido shore had been frostbound before they fell and the seanymphs had inlaid them with coral and amethyst  between that grim cathedral of england and this what an interval there is a type of it in the very birds that haunt them for instead of the restless crowd hoarsevoiced and sablewinged drifting on the bleak upper air the st marks porches are full of doves that nestle among the marble foliage and mingle the soft iridescence of their living plumes changing at every motion with the tints hardly less lovely that have stood unchanged for seven hundred years  section xv and what effect has this splendor on those who pass beneath it you may walk from sunrise to sunset to and fro before the gateway of st marks and you will not see an eye lifted to it nor a countenance brightened by it priest and layman soldier and civilian rich and poor pass by it alike regardlessly up to the very recesses of the porches the meanest tradesmen of the city push their counters nay the foundations of its pillars are themselves the seatsnot of them that sell doves for sacrifice but of the vendors of toys and caricatures round the whole square in front of the church there is almost a continuous line of cafes where the idle venetians of the middle classes lounge and read empty journals in its centre the austrian bands play during the time of vespers their martial music jarring with the organ notesthe march drowning the miserere and the sullen crowd thickening round thema crowd which if it had its will would stiletto every soldier that pipes to it and in the recesses of the porches all day long knots of men of the lowest classes unemployed and listless lie basking in the sun like lizards and unregarded childrenevery heavy glance of their young eyes full of desperation and stony depravity and their throats hoarse with cursinggamble and fight and snarl and sleep hour after hour clashing their bruised centesimi upon the marble ledges of the church porch and the images of christ and his angels look down upon it continually  that we may not enter the church out of the midst of the horror of this let us turn aside under the portico which looks towards the sea and passing round within the two massive pillars brought from st jean dacre we shall find the gate of the baptistery let us enter there the heavy door closes behind us instantly and the light and the turbulence of the piazzetta are together shut out by it  section xvi we are in a low vaulted room vaulted not with arches but with small cupolas starred with gold and chequered with gloomy figures in the centre is a bronze font charged with rich basreliefs a small figure of the baptist standing above it in a single ray of light that glances across the narrow room dying as it falls from a window high in the wall and the first thing that it strikes and the only thing that it strikes brightly is a tomb we hardly know if it be a tomb indeed for it is like a narrow couch set beside the window lowroofed and curtained so that it might seem but that it has some height above the pavement to have been drawn towards the window that the sleeper might be wakened earlyonly there are two angels who have drawn the curtain back and are looking down upon him let us look also and thank that gentle light that rests upon his forehead for ever and dies away upon his breast  the face is of a man in middle life but there are two deep furrows right across the forehead dividing it like the foundations of a tower the height of it above is bound by the fillet of the ducal cap the rest of the features are singularly small and delicate the lips sharp perhaps the sharpness of death being added to that of the natural lines but there is a sweet smile upon them and a deep serenity upon the whole countenance the roof of the canopy above has been blue filled with stars beneath in the centre of the tomb on which the figure rests is a seated figure of the virgin and the border of it all around is of flowers and soft leaves growing rich and deep as if in a field in summer  it is the doge andrea dandolo a man early great among the great of venice and early lost she chose him for her king in his 36th year he died ten years later leaving behind him that history to which we owe half of what we know of her former fortunes  section xvii look round at the room in which he lies the floor of it is of rich mosaic encompassed by a low seat of red marble and its walls are of alabaster but worn and shattered and darkly stained with age almost a ruinin places the slabs of marble have fallen away altogether and the rugged brickwork is seen through the rents but all beautiful the ravaging fissures fretting their way among the islands and channelled zones of the alabaster and the timestains on its translucent masses darkened into fields of rich golden brown like the color of seaweed when the sun strikes on it through deep sea the light fades away into the recess of the chamber towards the altar and the eye can hardly trace the lines of the basrelief behind it of the baptism of christ but on the vaulting of the roof the figures are distinct and there are seen upon it two great circles one surrounded by the principalities and powers in heavenly places of which milton has expressed the ancient division in the single massy line    thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers  and around the other the apostles christ the centre of both and upon the walls again and again repeated the gaunt figure of the baptist in every circumstance of his life and death and the streams of the jordan running down between their cloven rocks the axe laid to the root of a fruitless tree that springs upon their shore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire yes verily to be baptized with fire or to be cast therein it is the choice set before all men the marchnotes still murmur through the grated window and mingle with the sounding in our ears of the sentence of judgment which the old greek has written on that baptistery wall venice has made her choice  section xviii he who lies under that stony canopy would have taught her another choice in his day if she would have listened to him but he and his counsels have long been forgotten by her the dust lies upon his lips  through the heavy door whose bronze network closes the place of his rest let us enter the church itself it is lost in still deeper twilight to which the eye must be accustomed for some moments before the form of the building can be traced and then there opens before us a vast cave hewn out into the form of a cross and divided into shadowy aisles by many pillars round the domes of its roof the light enters only through narrow apertures like large stars and here and there a ray or two from some far away casement wanders into the darkness and casts a narrow phosphoric stream upon the waves of marble that heave and fall in a thousand colors along the floor what else there is of light is from torches or silver lamps burning ceaselessly in the recesses of the chapels the roof sheeted with gold and the polished walls covered with alabaster give back at every curve and angle some feeble gleaming to the flames and the glories round the heads of the sculptured saints flash out upon us as we pass them and sink again into the gloom under foot and over head a continual succession of crowded imagery one picture passing into another as in a dream forms beautiful and terrible mixed together dragons and serpents and ravening beasts of prey and graceful birds that in the midst of them drink from running fountains and feed from vases of crystal the passions and the pleasures of human life symbolized together and the mystery of its redemption for the mazes of interwoven lines and changeful pictures lead always at last to the cross lifted and carved in every place and upon every stonel sometimes with the serpent of eternity wrapt round it sometimes with doves beneath its arms and sweet herbage growing forth from its feet but conspicuous most of all on the great rood that crosses the church before the altar raised in bright blazonry against the shadow of the apse and although in the recesses of the aisles and chapels when the mist of the incense hangs heavily we may see continually a figure traced in faint lines upon their marble a woman standing with her eyes raised to heaven and the inscription above her mother of god she is not here the presiding deity it is the cross that is first seen and always burning in the centre of the temple and every dome and hollow of its roof has the figure of christ in the utmost height of it raised in power or returning in judgment  section xix nor is this interior without effect on the minds of the people at every hour of the day there are groups collected before the various shrines and solitary worshippers scattered through the dark places of the church evidently in prayer both deep and reverent and for the most part profoundly sorrowful the devotees at the greater number of the renowned shrines of romanism may be seen murmuring their appointed prayers with wandering eyes and unengaged gestures but the step of the stranger does not disturb those who kneel on the pavement of st marks and hardly a moment passes from early morning to sunset in which we may not see some halfveiled figure enter beneath the arabian porch cast itself into long abasement on the floor of the temple and then rising slowly with more confirmed step and with a passionate kiss and clasp of the arms given to the feet of the crucifix by which the lamps burn always in the northern aisle leave the church as if comforted  section xx but we must not hastily conclude from this that the nobler characters of the building have at present any influence in fostering a devotional spirit there is distress enough in venice to bring many to their knees without excitement from external imagery and whatever there may be in the temper of the worship offered in st marks more than can be accounted for by reference to the unhappy circumstances of the city is assuredly not owing either to the beauty of its architecture or to the impressiveness of the scripture histories embodied in its mosaics that it has a peculiar effect however slight on the popular mind may perhaps be safely conjectured from the number of worshippers which it attracts while the churches of st paul and the frari larger in size and more central in position are left comparatively empty footnote the mere warmth of st marks in winter which is much greater than that of the other two churches above named must however be taken into consideration as one of the most efficient causes of its being then more frequented but this effect is altogether to be ascribed to its richer assemblage of those sources of influence which address themselves to the commonest instincts of the human mind and which in all ages and countries have been more or less employed in the support of superstition darkness and mystery confused recesses of building artificial light employed in small quantity but maintained with a constancy which seems to give it a kind of sacredness preciousness of material easily comprehended by the vulgar eye close air loaded with a sweet and peculiar odor associated only with religious services solemn music and tangible idols or images having popular legends attached to themthese the stage properties of superstition which have been from the beginning of the world and must be to the end of it employed by all nations whether openly savage or nominally civilized to produce a false awe in minds incapable of apprehending the true nature of the deity are assembled in st marks to a degree as far as i know unexampled in any other european church the arts of the magus and the brahmin are exhausted in the animation of a paralyzed christianity and the popular sentiment which these arts excite is to be regarded by us with no more respect than we should have considered ourselves justified in rendering to the devotion of the worshippers at eleusis ellora or edfou footnote i said above that the larger number of the devotees entered by the arabian porch the porch that is to say on the north side of the church remarkable for its rich arabian archivolt and through which access is gained immediately to the northern transept the reason is that in that transept is the chapel of the madonna which has a greater attraction for the venetians than all the rest of the church besides the old builders kept their images of the virgin subordinate to those of christ but modern romanism has retrograded from theirs and the most glittering portions of the whole church are the two recesses behind this lateral altar covered with silver hearts dedicated to the virgin  section xxi indeed these inferior means of exciting religious emotion were employed in the ancient church as they are at this day but not employed alone torchlight there was as there is now but the torchlight illumined scripture histories on the walls which every eye traced and every heart comprehended but which during my whole residence in venice i never saw one venetian regard for an instant i never heard from any one the most languid expression of interest in any feature of the church or perceived the slightest evidence of their understanding the meaning of its architecture and while therefore the english cathedral though no longer dedicated to the kind of services for which it was intended by its builders and much at variance in many of its characters with the temper of the people by whom it is now surrounded retains yet so much of its religious influence that no prominent feature of its architecture can be said to exist altogether in vain we have in st marks a building apparently still employed in the ceremonies for which it was designed and yet of which the impressive attributes have altogether ceased to be comprehended by its votaries the beauty which it possesses is unfelt the language it uses is forgotten and in the midst of the city to whose service it has so long been consecrated and still filled by crowds of the descendants of those to whom it owes its magnificence it stands in reality more desolate than the ruins through which the sheepwalk passes unbroken in our english valleys and the writing on its marble walls is less regarded and less powerful for the teaching of men than the letters which the shepherd follows with his finger where the moss is lightest on the tombs in the desecrated cloister  section xxii it must therefore be altogether without reference to its present usefulness that we pursue our inquiry into the merits and meaning of the architecture of this marvellous building and it can only be after we have terminated that inquiry conducting it carefully on abstract grounds that we can pronounce with any certainty how far the present neglect of st marks is significative of the decline of the venetian character or how far this church is to be considered as the relic of a barbarous age incapable of attracting the admiration or influencing the feelings of a civilized community  the inquiry before us is twofold throughout the first volume i carefully kept the study of expression distinct from that of abstract architectural perfection telling the reader that in every building we should afterwards examine he would have first to form a judgment of its construction and decorative merit considering it merely as a work of art and then to examine farther in what degree it fulfilled its expressional purposes accordingly we have first to judge of st marks merely as a piece of architecture not as a church secondly to estimate its fitness for its special duty as a place of worship and the relation in which it stands as such to those northern cathedrals that still retain so much of the power over the human heart which the byzantine domes appear to have lost for ever  section xxiii in the two succeeding sections of this work devoted respectively to the examination of the gothic and renaissance buildings in venice i have endeavored to analyze and state as briefly as possible the true nature of each schoolfirst in spirit then in form i wished to have given a similar analysis in this section of the nature of byzantine architecture but could not make my statements general because i have never seen this kind of building on its native soil nevertheless in the following sketch of the principles exemplified in st marks i believe that most of the leading features and motives of the style will be found clearly enough distinguished to enable the reader to judge of it with tolerable fairness as compared with the better known systems of european architecture in the middle ages  section xxiv now the first broad characteristic of the building and the root nearly of every other important peculiarity in it is its confessed incrustation it is the purest example in italy of the great school of architecture in which the ruling principle is the incrustation of brick with more precious materials and it is necessary before we proceed to criticise any one of its arrangements that the reader should carefully consider the principles which are likely to have influenced or might legitimately influence the architects of such a school as distinguished from those whose designs are to be executed in massive materials  it is true that among different nations and at different times we may find examples of every sort and degree of incrustation from the mere setting of the larger and more compact stones by preference at the outside of the wall to the miserable construction of that modern brick cornice with its coating of cement which but the other day in london killed its unhappy workmen in its fall footnote vide builder for october 1851 but just as it is perfectly possible to have a clear idea of the opposing characteristics of two different species of plants or animals though between the two there are varieties which it is difficult to assign either to the one or the other so the reader may fix decisively in his mind the legitimate characteristics of the incrusted and the massive styles though between the two there are varieties which confessedly unite the attributes of both for instance in many roman remains built of blocks of tufa and incrusted with marble we have a style which though truly solid possesses some of the attributes of incrustation and in the cathedral of florence built of brick and coated with marble the marble facing is so firmly and exquisitely set that the building though in reality incrusted assumes the attributes of solidity but these intermediate examples need not in the least confuse our generally distinct ideas of the two families of buildings the one in which the substance is alike throughout and the forms and conditions of the ornament assume or prove that it is so as in the best greek buildings and for the most part in our early norman and gothic and the other in which the substance is of two kinds one internal the other external and the system of decoration is founded on this duplicity as preeminently in st marks  section xxv i have used the word duplicity in no depreciatory sense in chapter ii of the seven lamps section 18 i especially guarded this incrusted school from the imputation of insincerity and i must do so now at greater length it appears insincere at first to a northern builder because accustomed to build with solid blocks of freestone he is in the habit of supposing the external superficies of a piece of masonry to be some criterion of its thickness but as soon as he gets acquainted with the incrusted style he will find that the southern builders had no intention to deceive him he will see that every slab of facial marble is fastened to the next by a confessed rivet and that the joints of the armor are so visibly and openly accommodated to the contours of the substance within that he has no more right to complain of treachery than a savage would have who for the first time in his life seeing a man in armor had supposed him to be made of solid steel acquaint him with the customs of chivalry and with the uses of the coat of mail and he ceases to accuse of dishonesty either the panoply or the knight  these laws and customs of the st marks architectural chivalry it must be our business to develop  section xxvi first consider the natural circumstances which give rise to such a style suppose a nation of builders placed far from any quarries of available stone and having precarious access to the mainland where they exist compelled therefore either to build entirely with brick or to import whatever stone they use from great distances in ships of small tonnage and for the most part dependent for speed on the oar rather than the sail the labor and cost of carriage are just as great whether they import common or precious stone and therefore the natural tendency would always be to make each shipload as valuable as possible but in proportion to the preciousness of the stone is the limitation of its possible supply limitation not determined merely by cost but by the physical conditions of the material for of many marbles pieces above a certain size are not to be had for money there would also be a tendency in such circumstances to import as much stone as possible ready sculptured in order to save weight and therefore if the traffic of their merchants led them to places where there were ruins of ancient edifices to ship the available fragments of them home out of this supply of marble partly composed of pieces of so precious a quality that only a few tons of them could be on any terms obtained and partly of shafts capitals and other portions of foreign buildings the island architect has to fashion as best he may the anatomy of his edifice it is at his choice either to lodge his few blocks of precious marble here and there among his masses of brick and to cut out of the sculptured fragments such new forms as may be necessary for the observance of fixed proportions in the new building or else to cut the colored stones into thin pieces of extent sufficient to face the whole surface of the walls and to adopt a method of construction irregular enough to admit the insertion of fragmentary sculptures rather with a view of displaying their intrinsic beauty than of setting them to any regular service in the support of the building  an architect who cared only to display his own skill and had no respect for the works of others would assuredly have chosen the former alternative and would have sawn the old marbles into fragments in order to prevent all interference with his own designs but an architect who cared for the preservation of noble work whether his own or others and more regarded the beauty of his building than his own fame would have done what those old builders of st marks did for us and saved every relic with which he was entrusted  section xxvii but these were not the only motives which influenced the venetians in the adoption of their method of architecture it might under all the circumstances above stated have been a question with other builders whether to import one shipload of costly jaspers or twenty of chalk flints and whether to build a small church faced with porphyry and paved with agate or to raise a vast cathedral in freestone but with the venetians it could not be a question for an instant they were exiles from ancient and beautiful cities and had been accustomed to build with their ruins not less in affection than in admiration they had thus not only grown familiar with the practice of inserting older fragments in modern buildings but they owed to that practice a great part of the splendor of their city and whatever charm of association might aid its change from a refuge into a home the practice which began in the affections of a fugitive nation was prolonged in the pride of a conquering one and beside the memorials of departed happiness were elevated the trophies of returning victory the ship of war brought home more marble in triumph than the merchant vessel in speculation and the front of st marks became rather a shrine at which to dedicate the splendor of miscellaneous spoil than the organized expression of any fixed architectural law or religious emotion  section xxviii thus far however the justification of the style of this church depends on circumstances peculiar to the time of its erection and to the spot where it arose the merit of its method considered in the abstract rests on far broader grounds  in the fifth chapter of the seven lamps section 14 the reader will find the opinion of a modern architect of some reputation mr wood that the chief thing remarkable in this church is its extreme ugliness and he will find this opinion associated with another namely that the works of the caracci are far preferable to those of the venetian painters this second statement of feeling reveals to us one of the principal causes of the first namely that mr wood had not any perception of color or delight in it the perception of color is a gift just as definitely granted to one person and denied to another as an ear for music and the very first requisite for true judgment of st marks is the perfection of that colorfaculty which few people ever set themselves seriously to find out whether they possess or not for it is on its value as a piece of perfect and unchangeable coloring that the claims of this edifice to our respect are finally rested and a deaf man might as well pretend to pronounce judgment on the merits of a full orchestra as an architect trained in the composition of form only to discern the beauty of st marks it possesses the charm of color in common with the greater part of the architecture as well as of the manufactures of the east but the venetians deserve especial note as the only european people who appear to have sympathized to the full with the great instinct of the eastern races they indeed were compelled to bring artists from constantinople to design the mosaics of the vaults of st marks and to group the colors of its porches but they rapidly took up and developed under more masculine conditions the system of which the greeks had shown them the example while the burghers and barons of the north were building their dark streets and grisly castles of oak and sandstone the merchants of venice were covering their palaces with porphyry and gold and at last when her mighty painters had created for her a color more priceless than gold or porphyry even this the richest of her treasures she lavished upon walls whose foundations were beaten by the sea and the strong tide as it runs beneath the rialto is reddened to this day by the reflection of the frescoes of giorgione  section xxix if therefore the reader does not care for color i must protest against his endeavor to form any judgment whatever of this church of st marks but if he both cares for and loves it let him remember that the school of incrusted architecture is the only one in which perfect and permanent chromatic decoration is possible and let him look upon every piece of jasper and alabaster given to the architect as a cake of very hard color of which a certain portion is to be ground down or cut off to paint the walls with once understand this thoroughly and accept the condition that the body and availing strength of the edifice are to be in brick and that this under muscular power of brickwork is to be clothed with the defence and the brightness of the marble as the body of an animal is protected and adorned by its scales or its skin and all the consequent fitnesses and laws of the structure will be easily discernible these i shall state in their natural order  section xxx law i that the plinths and cornices used for binding the armor are to be light and delicate a certain thickness at least two or three inches must be required in the covering pieces even when composed of the strongest stone and set on the least exposed parts in order to prevent the chance of fracture and to allow for the wear of time and the weight of this armor must not be trusted to cement the pieces must not be merely glued to the rough brick surface but connected with the mass which they protect by binding cornices and string courses and with each other so as to secure mutual support aided by the rivetings but by no means dependent upon them and for the full honesty and straightforwardness of the work it is necessary that these string courses and binding plinths should not be of such proportions as would fit them for taking any important part in the hard work of the inner structure or render them liable to be mistaken for the great cornices and plinths already explained as essential parts of the best solid building they must be delicate slight and visibly incapable of severer work than that assigned to them  section xxxi law ii science of inner structure is to be abandoned as the body of the structure is confessedly of inferior and comparatively incoherent materials it would be absurd to attempt in it any expression of the higher refinements of construction it will be enough that by its mass we are assured of its sufficiency and strength and there is the less reason for endeavoring to diminish the extent of its surface by delicacy of adjustment because on the breadth of that surface we are to depend for the better display of the color which is to be the chief source of our pleasure in the building the main body of the work therefore will be composed of solid walls and massive piers and whatever expression of finer structural science we may require will be thrown either into subordinate portions of it or entirely directed to the support of the external mail where in arches or vaults it might otherwise appear dangerously independent of the material within  section xxxii law iii all shafts are to be solid wherever by the smallness of the parts we may be driven to abandon the incrusted structure at all it must be abandoned altogether the eye must never be left in the least doubt as to what is solid and what is coated whatever appears probably solid must be assuredly so and therefore it becomes an inviolable law that no shaft shall ever be incrusted not only does the whole virtue of a shaft depend on its consolidation but the labor of cutting and adjusting an incrusted coat to it would be greater than the saving of material is worth therefore the shaft of whatever size is always to be solid and because the incrusted character of the rest of the building renders it more difficult for the shafts to clear themselves from suspicion they must not in this incrusted style be in any place jointed no shaft must ever be used but of one block and this the more because the permission given to the builder to have his walls and piers as ponderous as he likes renders it quite unnecessary for him to use shafts of any fixed size in our norman and gothic where definite support is required at a definite point it becomes lawful to build up a tower of small stones in the shape of a shaft but the byzantine is allowed to have as much support as he wants from the walls in every direction and he has no right to ask for further license in the structure of his shafts let him by generosity in the substance of his pillars repay us for the permission we have given him to be superficial in his walls the builder in the chalk valleys of france and england may be blameless in kneading his clumsy pier out of broken flint and calcined lime but the venetian who has access to the riches of asia and the quarries of egypt must frame at least his shafts out of flawless stone  section xxxiii and this for another reason yet although as we have said it is impossible to cover the walls of a large building with color except on the condition of dividing the stone into plates there is always a certain appearance of meanness and niggardliness in the procedure it is necessary that the builder should justify himself from this suspicion and prove that it is not in mere economy or poverty but in the real impossibility of doing otherwise that he has sheeted his walls so thinly with the precious film now the shaft is exactly the portion of the edifice in which it is fittest to recover his honor in this respect for if blocks of jasper or porphyry be inserted in the walls the spectator cannot tell their thickness and cannot judge of the costliness of the sacrifice but the shaft he can measure with his eye in an instant and estimate the quantity of treasure both in the mass of its existing substance and in that which has been hewn away to bring it into its perfect and symmetrical form and thus the shafts of all buildings of this kind are justly regarded as an expression of their wealth and a form of treasure just as much as the jewels or gold in the sacred vessels they are in fact nothing else than large jewels footnote quivi presso si vedi una colonna di tanta bellezza e finezza che e riputato piutosto gioia che pietrasansovino of the verdantique pillar in san jacomo dell orio a remarkable piece of natural history and moral philosophy connected with this subject will be found in the second chapter of our third volume quoted from the work of a florentine architect of the fifteenth century the block of precious serpentine or jasper being valued according to its size and brilliancy of color like a large emerald or ruby only the bulk required to bestow value on the one is to be measured in feet and tons and on the other in lines and carats the shafts must therefore be without exception of one block in all buildings of this kind for the attempt in any place to incrust or joint them would be a deception like that of introducing a false stone among jewellery for a number of joints of any precious stone are of course not equal in value to a single piece of equal weight and would put an end at once to the spectators confidence in the expression of wealth in any portion of the structure or of the spirit of sacrifice in those who raised it  section xxxiv law iv the shafts may sometimes be independent of the construction exactly in proportion to the importance which the shaft assumes as a large jewel is the diminution of its importance as a sustaining member for the delight which we receive in its abstract bulk and beauty of color is altogether independent of any perception of its adaptation to mechanical necessities like other beautiful things in this world its end is to be beautiful and in proportion to its beauty it receives permission to be otherwise useless we do not blame emeralds and rubies because we cannot make them into heads of hammers nay so far from our admiration of the jewel shaft being dependent on its doing work for us it is very possible that a chief part of its preciousness may consist in a delicacy fragility and tenderness of material which must render it utterly unfit for hard work and therefore that we shall admire it the more because we perceive that if we were to put much weight upon it it would be crushed but at all events it is very clear that the primal object in the placing of such shafts must be the display of their beauty to the best advantage and that therefore all imbedding of them in walls or crowding of them into groups in any position in which either their real size or any portion of their surface would be concealed is either inadmissible together or objectionable in proportion to their value that no symmetrical or scientific arrangements of pillars are therefore ever to be expected in buildings of this kind and that all such are even to be looked upon as positive errors and misapplications of materials but that on the contrary we must be constantly prepared to see and to see with admiration shafts of great size and importance set in places where their real service is little more than nominal and where the chief end of their existence is to catch the sunshine upon their polished sides and lead the eye into delighted wandering among the mazes of their azure veins  section xxxv law v the shafts may be of variable size since the value of each shaft depends upon its bulk and diminishes with the diminution of its mass in a greater ratio than the size itself diminishes as in the case of all other jewellery it is evident that we must not in general expect perfect symmetry and equality among the series of shafts any more than definiteness of application but that on the contrary an accurately observed symmetry ought to give us a kind of pain as proving that considerable and useless loss has been sustained by some of the shafts in being cut down to match with the rest it is true that symmetry is generally sought for in works of smaller jewellery but even there not a perfect symmetry and obtained under circumstances quite different from those which affect the placing of shafts in architecture first the symmetry is usually imperfect the stones that seem to match each other in a ring or necklace appear to do so only because they are so small that their differences are not easily measured by the eye but there is almost always such difference between them as would be strikingly apparent if it existed in the same proportion between two shafts nine or ten feet in height secondly the quantity of stones which pass through a jewellers hands and the facility of exchange of such small objects enable the tradesman to select any number of stones of approximate size a selection however often requiring so much time that perfect symmetry in a group of very fine stones adds enormously to their value but the architect has neither the time nor the facilities of exchange he cannot lay aside one column in a corner of his church till in the course of traffic he obtain another that will match it he has not hundreds of shafts fastened up in bundles out of which he can match sizes at his ease he cannot send to a brothertradesman and exchange the useless stones for available ones to the convenience of both his blocks of stone or his ready hewn shafts have been brought to him in limited number from immense distances no others are to be had and for those which he does not bring into use there is no demand elsewhere his only means of obtaining symmetry will therefore be in cutting down the finer masses to equality with the inferior ones and this we ought not to desire him often to do and therefore while sometimes in a baldacchino or an important chapel or shrine this costly symmetry may be necessary and admirable in proportion to its probable cost in the general fabric we must expect to see shafts introduced of size and proportion continually varying and such symmetry as may be obtained among them never altogether perfect and dependent for its charm frequently on strange complexities and unexpected rising and falling of weight and accent in its marble syllables bearing the same relation to a rigidly chiselled and proportioned architecture that the wild lyric rhythm of aeschylus or pindar bears to the finished measures of pope  section xxxvi the application of the principles of jewellery to the smaller as well as the larger blocks will suggest to us another reason for the method of incrustation adopted in the walls it often happens that the beauty of the veining in some varieties of alabaster is so great that it becomes desirable to exhibit it by dividing the stone not merely to economize its substance but to display the changes in the disposition of its fantastic lines by reversing one of two thin plates successively taken from the stone and placing their corresponding edges in contact a perfectly symmetrical figure may be obtained which will enable the eye to comprehend more thoroughly the position of the veins and this is actually the method in which for the most part the alabasters of st mark are employed thus accomplishing a double gooddirecting the spectator in the first place to close observation of the nature of the stone employed and in the second giving him a farther proof of the honesty of intention in the builder for wherever similar veining is discovered in two pieces the fact is declared that they have been cut from the same stone it would have been easy to disguise the similarity by using them in different parts of the building but on the contrary they are set edge to edge so that the whole system of the architecture may be discovered at a glance by any one acquainted with the nature of the stones employed nay but it is perhaps answered me not by an ordinary observer a person ignorant of the nature of alabaster might perhaps fancy all these symmetrical patterns to have been found in the stone itself and thus be doubly deceived supposing blocks to be solid and symmetrical which were in reality subdivided and irregular i grant it but be it remembered that in all things ignorance is liable to be deceived and has no right to accuse anything but itself as the source of the deception the style and the words are dishonest not which are liable to be misunderstood if subjected to no inquiry but which are deliberately calculated to lead inquiry astray there are perhaps no great or noble truths from those of religion downwards which present no mistakable aspect to casual or ignorant contemplation both the truth and the lie agree in hiding themselves at first but the lie continues to hide itself with effort as we approach to examine it and leads us if undiscovered into deeper lies the truth reveals itself in proportion to our patience and knowledge discovers itself kindly to our pleading and leads us as it is discovered into deeper truths  section xxxvii law vi the decoration must be shallow in cutting the method of construction being thus systematized it is evident that a certain style of decoration must arise out of it based on the primal condition that over the greater part of the edifice there can be no deep cutting the thin sheets of covering stones do not admit of it we must not cut them through to the bricks and whatever ornaments we engrave upon them cannot therefore be more than an inch deep at the utmost consider for an instant the enormous differences which this single condition compels between the sculptural decoration of the incrusted style and that of the solid stones of the north which may be hacked and hewn into whatever cavernous hollows and black recesses we choose struck into grim darknesses and grotesque projections and rugged ploughings up of sinuous furrows in which any form or thought may be wrought out on any scalemighty statues with robes of rock and crowned foreheads burning in the sun or venomous goblins and stealthy dragons shrunk into lurkingplaces of untraceable shade think of this and of the play and freedom given to the sculptors hand and temper to smite out and in hither and thither as he will and then consider what must be the different spirit of the design which is to be wrought on the smooth surface of a film of marble where every line and shadow must be drawn with the most tender pencilling and cautious reserve of resourcewhere even the chisel must not strike hard lest it break through the delicate stone nor the mind be permitted in any impetuosity of conception inconsistent with the fine discipline of the hand consider that whatever animal or human form is to be suggested must be projected on a flat surface that all the features of the countenance the folds of the drapery the involutions of the limbs must be so reduced and subdued that the whole work becomes rather a piece of fine drawing than of sculpture and then follow out until you begin to perceive their endlessness the resulting differences of character which will be necessitated in every part of the ornamental designs of these incrusted churches as compared with that of the northern schools i shall endeavor to trace a few of them only  section xxxviii the first would of course be a diminution of the builders dependence upon human form as a source of ornament since exactly in proportion to the dignity of the form itself is the loss which it must sustain in being reduced to a shallow and linear basrelief as well as the difficulty of expressing it at all under such conditions wherever sculpture can be solid the nobler characters of the human form at once lead the artist to aim at its representation rather than at that of inferior organisms but when all is to be reduced to outline the forms of flowers and lower animals are always more intelligible and are felt to approach much more to a satisfactory rendering of the objects intended than the outlines of the human body this inducement to seek for resources of ornament in the lower fields of creation was powerless in the minds of the great pagan nations ninevite greek or egyptian first because their thoughts were so concentrated on their own capacities and fates that they preferred the rudest suggestion of human form to the best of an inferior organism secondly because their constant practice in solid sculpture often colossal enabled them to bring a vast amount of science into the treatment of the lines whether of the low relief the monochrome vase or shallow hieroglyphic  section xxxix but when various ideas adverse to the representation of animal and especially of human form originating with the arabs and iconoclast greeks had begun at any rate to direct the builders minds to seek for decorative materials in inferior types and when diminished practice in solid sculpture had rendered it more difficult to find artists capable of satisfactorily reducing the high organisms to their elementary outlines the choice of subject for surface sculpture would be more and more uninterruptedly directed to floral organisms and human and animal form would become diminished in size frequency and general importance so that while in the northern solid architecture we constantly find the effect of its noblest features dependent on ranges of statues often colossal and full of abstract interest independent of their architectural service in the southern incrusted style we must expect to find the human form for the most part subordinate and diminutive and involved among designs of foliage and flowers in the manner of which endless examples had been furnished by the fantastic ornamentation of the romans from which the incrusted style had been directly derived  section xl farther in proportion to the degree in which his subject must be reduced to abstract outline will be the tendency in the sculptor to abandon naturalism of representation and subordinate every form to architectural service where the flower or animal can be hewn into bold relief there will always be a temptation to render the representation of it more complete than is necessary or even to introduce details and intricacies inconsistent with simplicity of distant effect very often a worse fault than this is committed and in the endeavor to give vitality to the stone the original ornamental purpose of the design is sacrificed or forgotten but when nothing of this kind can be attempted and a slight outline is all that the sculptor can command we may anticipate that this outline will be composed with exquisite grace and that the richness of its ornamental arrangement will atone for the feebleness of its power of portraiture on the porch of a northern cathedral we may seek for the images of the flowers that grow in the neighboring fields and as we watch with wonder the gray stones that fret themselves into thorns and soften into blossoms we may care little that these knots of ornament as we retire from them to contemplate the whole building appear unconsidered or confused on the incrusted building we must expect no such deception of the eye or thoughts it may sometimes be difficult to determine from the involutions of its linear sculpture what were the natural forms which originally suggested them but we may confidently expect that the grace of their arrangement will always be complete that there will not be a line in them which could be taken away without injury nor one wanting which could be added with advantage  section xli farther while the sculptures of the incrusted school will thus be generally distinguished by care and purity rather than force and will be for the most part utterly wanting in depth of shadow there will be one means of obtaining darkness peculiarly simple and obvious and often in the sculptors power wherever he can without danger leave a hollow behind his covering slabs or use them like glass to fill an aperture in the wall he can by piercing them with holes obtain points or spaces of intense blackness to contrast with the light tracing of the rest of his design and we may expect to find this artifice used the more extensively because while it will be an effective means of ornamentation on the exterior of the building it will be also the safest way of admitting light to the interior still totally excluding both rain and wind and it will naturally follow that the architect thus familiarized with the effect of black and sudden points of shadow will often seek to carry the same principle into other portions of his ornamentation and by deep drillholes or perhaps inlaid portions of black color to refresh the eye where it may be wearied by the lightness of the general handling  section xlii farther exactly in proportion to the degree in which the force of sculpture is subdued will be the importance attached to color as a means of effect or constituent of beauty i have above stated that the incrusted style was the only one in which perfect or permanent color decoration was possible it is also the only one in which a true system of color decoration was ever likely to be invented in order to understand this the reader must permit me to review with some care the nature of the principles of coloring adopted by the northern and southern nations  section xliii i believe that from the beginning of the world there has never been a true or fine school of art in which color was despised it has often been imperfectly attained and injudiciously applied but i believe it to be one of the essential signs of life in a school of art that it loves color and i know it to be one of the first signs of death in the renaissance schools that they despised color  observe it is not now the question whether our northern cathedrals are better with color or without perhaps the great monotone gray of nature and of time is a better color than any that the human hand can give but that is nothing to our present business the simple fact is that the builders of those cathedrals laid upon them the brightest colors they could obtain and that there is not as far as i am aware in europe any monument of a truly noble school which has not been either painted all over or vigorously touched with paint mosaic and gilding in its prominent parts thus far egyptians greeks goths arabs and mediaeval christians all agree none of them when in their right senses ever think of doing without paint and therefore when i said above that the venetians were the only people who had thoroughly sympathized with the arabs in this respect i referred first to their intense love of color which led them to lavish the most expensive decorations on ordinary dwellinghouses and secondly to that perfection of the colorinstinct in them which enabled them to render whatever they did in this kind as just in principle as it was gorgeous in appliance it is this principle of theirs as distinguished from that of the northern builders which we have finally to examine  section xliv in the second chapter of the first volume it was noticed that the architect of bourges cathedral liked hawthorn and that the porch of his cathedral was therefore decorated with a rich wreath of it but another of the predilections of that architect was there unnoticed namely that he did not at all like gray hawthorn but preferred it green and he painted it green accordingly as bright as he could the color is still left in every sheltered interstice of the foliage he had in fact hardly the choice of any other color he might have gilded the thorns by way of allegorizing human life but if they were to be painted at all they could hardly be painted anything but green and green all over people would have been apt to object to any pursuit of abstract harmonies of color which might have induced him to paint his hawthorn blue  section xlv in the same way whenever the subject of the sculpture was definite its color was of necessity definite also and in the hands of the northern builders it often became in consequence rather the means of explaining and animating the stories of their stonework than a matter of abstract decorative science flowers were painted red trees green and faces fleshcolor the result of the whole being often far more entertaining than beautiful and also though in the lines of the mouldings and the decorations of shafts or vaults a richer and more abstract method of coloring was adopted aided by the rapid development of the best principles of color in early glasspainting the vigorous depths of shadow in the northern sculpture confused the architects eye compelling him to use violent colors in the recesses if these were to be seen as color at all and thus injured his perception of more delicate color harmonies so that in innumerable instances it becomes very disputable whether monuments even of the best times were improved by the color bestowed upon them or the contrary but in the south the flatness and comparatively vague forms of the sculpture while they appeared to call for color in order to enhance their interest presented exactly the conditions which would set it off to the greatest advantage breadth or surface displaying even the most delicate tints in the lights and faintness of shadow joining with the most delicate and pearly grays of color harmony while the subject of the design being in nearly all cases reduced to mere intricacy of ornamental line might be colored in any way the architect chose without any loss of rationality where oakleaves and roses were carved into fresh relief and perfect bloom it was necessary to paint the one green and the other red but in portions of ornamentation where there was nothing which could be definitely construed into either an oakleaf or a rose but a mere labyrinth of beautiful lines becoming here something like a leaf and there something like a flower the whole tracery of the sculpture might be left white and grounded with gold or blue or treated in any other manner best harmonizing with the colors around it and as the necessarily feeble character of the sculpture called for and was ready to display the best arrangements of color so the precious marbles in the architects hands give him at once the best examples and the best means of color the best examples for the tints of all natural stones are as exquisite in quality as endless in change and the best means for they are all permanent  section xlvi every motive thus concurred in urging him to the study of chromatic decoration and every advantage was given him in the pursuit of it and this at the very moment when as presently to be noticed the na√Øvet√© of barbaric christianity could only be forcibly appealed to by the help of colored pictures so that both externally and internally the architectural construction became partly merged in pictorial effect and the whole edifice is to be regarded less as a temple wherein to pray than as itself a book of common prayer a vast illuminated missal bound with alabaster instead of parchment studded with porphyry pillars instead of jewels and written within and without in letters of enamel and gold  section xlvii law vii that the impression of the architecture is not to be dependent on size and now there is but one final consequence to be deduced the reader understands i trust by this time that the claims of these several parts of the building upon his attention will depend upon their delicacy of design their perfection of color their preciousness of material and their legendary interest all these qualities are independent of size and partly even inconsistent with it neither delicacy of surface sculpture nor subtle gradations of color can be appreciated by the eye at a distance and since we have seen that our sculpture is generally to be only an inch or two in depth and that our coloring is in great part to be produced with the soft tints and veins of natural stones it will follow necessarily that none of the parts of the building can be removed far from the eye and therefore that the whole mass of it cannot be large it is not even desirable that it should be so for the temper in which the mind addresses itself to contemplate minute and beautiful details is altogether different from that in which it submits itself to vague impressions of space and size and therefore we must not be disappointed but grateful when we find all the best work of the building concentrated within a space comparatively small and that for the great clifflike buttresses and mighty piers of the north shooting up into indiscernible height we have here low walls spread before us like the pages of a book and shafts whose capitals we may touch with our hand  section xlviii the due consideration of the principles above stated will enable the traveller to judge with more candor and justice of the architecture of st marks than usually it would have been possible for him to do while under the influence of the prejudices necessitated by familiarity with the very different schools of northern art i wish it were in my power to lay also before the general reader some exemplification of the manner in which these strange principles are developed in the lovely building but exactly in proportion to the nobility of any work is the difficulty of conveying a just impression of it and wherever i have occasion to bestow high praise there it is exactly most dangerous for me to endeavor to illustrate my meaning except by reference to the work itself and in fact the principal reason why architectural criticism is at this day so far behind all other is the impossibility of illustrating the best architecture faithfully of the various schools of painting examples are accessible to every one and reference to the works themselves is found sufficient for all purposes of criticism but there is nothing like st marks or the ducal palace to be referred to in the national gallery and no faithful illustration of them is possible on the scale of such a volume as this and it is exceedingly difficult on any scale nothing is so rare in art as far as my own experience goes as a fair illustration of architecture perfect illustration of it does not exist for all good architecture depends upon the adaptation of its chiselling to the effect at a certain distance from the eye and to render the peculiar confusion in the midst of order and uncertainty in the midst of decision and mystery in the midst of trenchant lines which are the result of distance together with perfect expression of the peculiarities of the design requires the skill of the most admirable artist devoted to the work with the most severe conscientiousness neither the skill nor the determination having as yet been given to the subject and in the illustration of details every building of any pretensions to high architectural rank would require a volume of plates and those finished with extraordinary care with respect to the two buildings which are the principal subjects of the present volume st marks and the ducal palace i have found it quite impossible to do them the slightest justice by any kind of portraiture and i abandoned the endeavor in the case of the latter with less regret because in the new crystal palace as the poetical public insist upon calling it though it is neither a palace nor of crystal there will be placed i believe a noble cast of one of its angles as for st marks the effort was hopeless from the beginning for its effect depends not only upon the most delicate sculpture in every part out as we have just stated eminently on its color also and that the most subtle variable inexpressible color in the worldthe color of glass of transparent alabaster of polished marble and lustrous gold it would be easier to illustrate a crest of scottish mountain with its purple heather and pale harebells at their fullest and fairest or a glade of jura forest with its floor of anemone and moss than a single portico of st marks the fragment of one of its archivolts given at the bottom of the opposite plate is not to illustrate the thing itself but to illustrate the impossibility of illustration  section xlix it is left a fragment in order to get it on a larger scale and yet even on this scale it is too small to show the sharp folds and points of the marble vineleaves with sufficient clearness the ground of it is gold the sculpture in the spandrils is not more than an inch and a half deep rarely so much it is in fact nothing more than an exquisite sketching of outlines in marble to about the same depth as in the elgin frieze the draperies however being filled with close folds in the manner of the byzantine pictures folds especially necessary here as large masses could not be expressed in the shallow sculpture without becoming insipid but the disposition of these folds is always most beautiful and often opposed by broad and simple spaces like that obtained by the scroll in the hand of the prophet seen in the plate  the balls in the archivolt project considerably and the interstices between their interwoven bands of marble are filled with colors like the illuminations of a manuscript violet crimson blue gold and green alternately but no green is ever used without an intermixture of blue pieces in the mosaic nor any blue without a little centre of pale green sometimes only a single piece of glass a quarter of an inch square so subtle was the feeling for color which was thus to be satisfied footnote the fact is that no two tesserae of the glass are exactly of the same tint the greens being all varied with blues the blues of different depths the reds of different clearness so that the effect of each mass of color is full of variety like the stippled color of a fruit piece the intermediate circles have golden stars set on an azure ground varied in the same manner and the small crosses seen in the intervals are alternately blue and subdued scarlet with two small circles of white set in the golden ground above and beneath them each only about half an inch across this work remember being on the outside of the building and twenty feet above the eye while the blue crosses have each a pale green centre of all this exquisitely mingled hue no plate however large or expensive could give any adequate conception but if the reader will supply in imagination to the engraving what he supplies to a common woodcut of a group of flowers the decision of the respective merits of modern and of byzantine architecture may be allowed to rest on this fragment of st marks alone  from the vineleaves of that archivolt though there is no direct imitation of nature in them but on the contrary a studious subjection to architectural purpose more particularly to be noticed hereafter we may yet receive the same kind of pleasure which we have in seeing true vineleaves and wreathed branches traced upon golden light its stars upon their azure ground ought to make us remember as its builder remembered the stars that ascend and fall in the great arch of the sky and i believe that stars and boughs and leaves and bright colors are everlastingly lovely and to be by all men beloved and moreover that church walls grimly seared with squared lines are not better nor nobler things than these i believe the man who designed and the men who delighted in that archivolt to have been wise happy and holy let the reader look back to the archivolt i have already given out of the streets of london plate xiii vol i stones of venice and see what there is in it to make us any of the three let him remember that the men who design such work as that call st marks a barbaric monstrosity and let him judge between us  section l some farther details of the st marks architecture and especially a general account of byzantine capitals and of the principal ones at the angles of the church will be found in the following chapter footnote some illustration also of what was said in section xxxiii above respecting the value of the shafts of st marks as large jewels will be found in appendix 9 shafts of st marks here i must pass on to the second part of our immediate subject namely the inquiry how far the exquisite and varied ornament of st marks fits it as a temple for its sacred purpose and would be applicable in the churches of modern times we have here evidently two questions the first that wide and continually agitated one whether richness of ornament be right in churches at all the second whether the ornament of st marks be of a truly ecclesiastical and christian character  section li in the first chapter of the seven lamps of architecture i endeavored to lay before the reader some reasons why churches ought to be richly adorned as being the only places in which the desire of offering a portion of all precious things to god could be legitimately expressed but i left wholly untouched the question whether the church as such stood in need of adornment or would be better fitted for its purposes by possessing it this question i would now ask the reader to deal with briefly and candidly  the chief difficulty in deciding it has arisen from its being always presented to us in an unfair form it is asked of us or we ask of ourselves whether the sensation which we now feel in passing from our own modern dwellinghouse through a newly built street into a cathedral of the thirteenth century be safe or desirable as a preparation for public worship but we never ask whether that sensation was at all calculated upon by the builders of the cathedral  section lii now i do not say that the contrast of the ancient with the modern building and the strangeness with which the earlier architectural forms fall upon the eye are at this day disadvantageous but i do say that their effect whatever it may be was entirely uncalculated upon by the old builder he endeavored to make his work beautiful but never expected it to be strange and we incapacitate ourselves altogether from fair judgment of its intention if we forget that when it was built it rose in the midst of other work fanciful and beautiful as itself that every dwellinghouse in the middle ages was rich with the same ornaments and quaint with the same grotesques which fretted the porches or animated the gargoyles of the cathedral that what we now regard with doubt and wonder as well as with delight was then the natural continuation into the principal edifice of the city of a style which was familiar to every eye throughout all its lanes and streets and that the architect had often no more idea of producing a peculiarly devotional impression by the richest color and the most elaborate carving than the builder of a modern meetinghouse has by his whitewashed walls and squarecut casements footnote see the farther notice of this subject in vol iii chap iv stones of venice  section liii let the reader fix this great fact well in his mind and then follow out its important corollaries we attach in modern days a kind of sacredness to the pointed arch and the groined roof because while we look habitually out of square windows and live under flat ceilings we meet with the more beautiful forms in the ruins of our abbeys but when those abbeys were built the pointed arch was used for every shop door as well as for that of the cloister and the feudal baron and freebooter feasted as the monk sang under vaulted roofs not because the vaulting was thought especially appropriate to either the revel or psalm but because it was then the form in which a strong roof was easiest built we have destroyed the goodly architecture of our cities we have substituted one wholly devoid of beauty or meaning and then we reason respecting the strange effect upon our minds of the fragments which fortunately we have left in our churches as if those churches had always been designed to stand out in strong relief from all the buildings around them and gothic architecture had always been what it is now a religious language like monkish latin most readers know if they would arouse their knowledge that this was not so but they take no pains to reason the matter out they abandon themselves drowsily to the impression that gothic is a peculiarly ecclesiastical style and sometimes even that richness in church ornament is a condition or furtherance of the romish religion undoubtedly it has become so in modern times for there being no beauty in our recent architecture and much in the remains of the past and these remains being almost exclusively ecclesiastical the high church and romanist parties have not been slow in availing themselves of the natural instincts which were deprived of all food except from this source and have willingly promulgated the theory that because all the good architecture that is now left is expressive of high church or romanist doctrines all good architecture ever has been and must be soa piece of absurdity from which though here and there a country clergyman may innocently believe it i hope the common sense of the nation will soon manfully quit itself it needs but little inquiry into the spirit of the past to ascertain what once for all i would desire here clearly and forcibly to assert that wherever christian church architecture has been good and lovely it has been merely the perfect development of the common dwellinghouse architecture of the period that when the pointed arch was used in the street it was used in the church when the round arch was used in the street it was used in the church when the pinnacle was set over the garret window it was set over the belfry tower when the flat roof was used for the drawingroom it was used for the nave there is no sacredness in round arches nor in pointed none in pinnacles nor in buttresses none in pillars nor traceries churches were larger than in most other buildings because they had to hold more people they were more adorned than most other buildings because they were safer from violence and were the fitting subjects of devotional offering but they were never built in any separate mystical and religious style they were built in the manner that was common and familiar to everybody at the time the flamboyant traceries that adorn the fa√ßade of rouen cathedral had once their fellows in every window of every house in the market place the sculptures that adorn the porches of st marks had once their match on the walls of every palace on the grand canal and the only difference between the church and the dwellinghouse was that there existed a symbolical meaning in the distribution of the parts of all buildings meant for worship and that the painting or sculpture was in the one case less frequently of profane subject than in the other a more severe distinction cannot be drawn for secular history was constantly introduced into church architecture and sacred history or allusion generally formed at least one half of the ornament of the dwellinghouse  section liv this fact is so important and so little considered that i must be pardoned for dwelling upon it at some length and accurately marking the limits of the assertion i have made i do not mean that every dwellinghouse of mediaeval cities was as richly adorned and as exquisite in composition as the fronts of their cathedrals but that they presented features of the same kind often in parts quite as beautiful and that the churches were not separated by any change of style from the buildings round them as they are now but were merely more finished and full examples of a universal style rising out of the confused streets of the city as an oak tree does out of an oak copse not differing in leafage but in size and symmetry of course the quainter and smaller forms of turret and window necessary for domestic service the inferior materials often wood instead of stone and the fancy of the inhabitants which had free play in the design introduced oddnesses vulgarities and variations into house architecture which were prevented by the traditions the wealth and the skill of the monks and freemasons while on the other hand conditions of vaulting buttressing and arch and tower building were necessitated by the mere size of the cathedral of which it would be difficult to find examples elsewhere but there was nothing more in these features than the adaptation of mechanical skill to vaster requirements there was nothing intended to be or felt to be especially ecclesiastical in any of the forms so developed and the inhabitants of every village and city when they furnished funds for the decoration of their church desired merely to adorn the house of god as they adorned their own only a little more richly and with a somewhat graver temper in the subjects of the carving even this last difference is not always clearly discernible all manner of ribaldry occurs in the details of the ecclesiastical buildings of the north and at the time when the best of them were built every mans house was a kind of temple a figure of the madonna or of christ almost always occupied a niche over the principal door and the old testament histories were curiously interpolated amidst the grotesques of the brackets and the gables  section lv and the reader will now perceive that the question respecting fitness of church decoration rests in reality on totally different grounds from those commonly made foundations of argument so long as our streets are walled with barren brick and our eyes rest continually in our daily life on objects utterly ugly or of inconsistent and meaningless design it may be a doubtful question whether the faculties of eye and mind which are capable of perceiving beauty having been left without food during the whole of our active life should be suddenly feasted upon entering a place of worship and color and music and sculpture should delight the senses and stir the curiosity of men unaccustomed to such appeal at the moment when they are required to compose themselves for acts of devotionthis i say may be a doubtful question but it cannot be a question at all that if once familiarized with beautiful form and color and accustomed to see in whatever human hands have executed for us even for the lowest services evidence of noble thought and admirable skill we shall desire to see this evidence also in whatever is built or labored for the house of prayer that the absence of the accustomed loveliness would disturb instead of assisting devotion and that we should feel it as vain to ask whether with our own house full of goodly craftsmanship we should worship god in a house destitute of it as to ask whether a pilgrim whose days journey had led him through fair woods and by sweet waters must at evening turn aside into some barren place to pray  section lvi then the second question submitted to us whether the ornament of st marks be truly ecclesiastical and christian is evidently determined together with the first for if not only the permission of ornament at all but the beautiful execution of it be dependent on our being familiar with it in daily life it will follow that no style of noble architecture can be exclusively ecclesiastical it must be practised in the dwelling before it be perfected in the church and it is the test of a noble style that it shall be applicable to both for if essentially false and ignoble it may be made to fit the dwellinghouse but never can be made to fit the church and just as there are many principles which will bear the light of the worlds opinion yet will not bear the light of gods word while all principles which will bear the test of scripture will also bear that of practice so in architecture there are many forms which expediency and convenience may apparently justify or at least render endurable in daily use which will yet be found offensive the moment they are used for church service but there are none good for church service which cannot bear daily use thus the renaissance manner of building is a convenient style for dwellinghouses but the natural sense of all religious men causes them to turn from it with pain when it has been used in churches and this has given rise to the popular idea that the roman style is good for houses and the gothic for churches this is not so the roman style is essentially base and we can bear with it only so long as it gives us convenient windows and spacious rooms the moment the question of convenience is set aside and the expression or beauty of the style it tried by its being used in a church we find it fails but because the gothic and byzantine styles are fit for churches they are not therefore less fit for dwellings they are in the highest sense fit and good for both nor were they ever brought to perfection except where they were used for both  section lvii but there is one character of byzantine work which according to the time at which it was employed may be considered as either fitting or unfitting it for distinctly ecclesiastical purposes i mean the essentially pictorial character of its decoration we have already seen what large surfaces it leaves void of bold architectural features to be rendered interesting merely by surface ornament or sculpture in this respect byzantine work differs essentially from pure gothic styles which are capable of filling every vacant space by features purely architectural and may be rendered if we please altogether independent of pictorial aid a gothic church may be rendered impressive by mere successions of arches accumulations of niches and entanglements of tracery but a byzantine church requires expression and interesting decoration over vast plane surfacesdecoration which becomes noble only by becoming pictorial that is to say by representing natural objectsmen animals or flowers and therefore the question whether the byzantine style be fit for church service in modern days becomes involved in the inquiry what effect upon religion has been or may yet be produced by pictorial art and especially by the art of the mosaicist  section lviii the more i have examined the subject the more dangerous i have found it to dogmatize respecting the character of the art which is likely at a given period to be most useful to the cause of religion one great fact first meets me i cannot answer for the experience of others but i never yet met with a christian whose heart was thoroughly set upon the world to come and so far as human judgment could pronounce perfect and right before god who cared about art at all i have known several very noble christian men who loved it intensely but in them there was always traceable some entanglement of the thoughts with the matters of this world causing them to fall into strange distresses and doubts and often leading them into what they themselves would confess to be errors in understanding or even failures in duty i do not say that these men may not many of them be in very deed nobler than those whose conduct is more consistent they may be more tender in the tone of all their feelings and farthersighted in soul and for that very reason exposed to greater trials and fears than those whose hardier frame and naturally narrower vision enable them with less effort to give their hands to god and walk with him but still the general fact is indeed so that i have never known a man who seemed altogether right and calm in faith who seriously cared about art and when casually moved by it it is quite impossible to say beforehand by what class of art this impression will on such men be made very often it is by a theatrical commonplace more frequently still by false sentiment i believe that the four painters who have had and still have the most influence such as it is on the ordinary protestant christian mind are carlo dolci guercino benjamin west and john martin raphael much as he is talked about is i believe in very fact rarely looked at by religious people much less his master or any of the truly great religious men of old but a smooth magdalen of carlo dolci with a tear on each cheek or a guercino christ or st john or a scripture illustration of wests or a black cloud with a flash of lightning in it of martins rarely rails of being verily often deeply felt for the time  section lix there are indeed many very evident reasons for this the chief one being that as all truly great religious painters have been hearty romanists there are none of their works which do not embody in some portions of them definitely romanist doctrines the protestant mind is instantly struck by these and offended by them so as to be incapable of entering or at least rendered indisposed to enter farther into the heart of the work or to the discovering those deeper characters of it which are not romanist but christian in the everlasting sense and power of christianity thus most protestants entering for the first time a paradise of angelico would be irrevocably offended by finding that the first person the painter wished them to speak to was st dominic and would retire from such a heaven as speedily as possiblenot giving themselves time to discover that whether dressed in black or white or gray and by whatever name in the calendar they might be called the figures that filled that angelico heaven were indeed more saintly and pure and full of love in every feature than any that the human hand ever traced before or since and thus protestantism having foolishly sought for the little help it requires at the hand of painting from the men who embodied no catholic doctrine has been reduced to receive it from those who believed neither catholicism nor protestantism but who read the bible in search of the picturesque we thus refuse to regard the painters who passed their lives in prayer but are perfectly ready to be taught by those who spent them in debauchery there is perhaps no more popular protestant picture than salvators witch of endor of which the subject was chosen by the painter simply because under the names of saul and the sorceress he could paint a captain of banditti and a neapolitan hag  section lx the fact seems to be that strength of religious feeling is capable of supplying for itself whatever is wanting in the rudest suggestions of art and will either on the one hand purify what is coarse into inoffensiveness or on the other raise what is feeble into impressiveness probably all art as such is unsatisfactory to it and the effort which it makes to supply the void will be induced rather by association and accident than by the real merit of the work submitted to it the likeness to a beloved friend the correspondence with a habitual conception the freedom from any strange or offensive particularity and above all an interesting choice of incident will win admiration for a picture when the noblest efforts of religious imagination would otherwise fail of power how much more when to the quick capacity of emotion is joined a childish trust that the picture does indeed represent a fact it matters little whether the fact be well or ill told the moment we believe the picture to be true we complain little of its being illpainted let it be considered for a moment whether the child with its colored print inquiring eagerly and gravely which is joseph and which is benjamin is not more capable of receiving a strong even a sublime impression from the rude symbol which it invests with reality by its own effort than the connoisseur who admires the grouping of the three figures in raphaels telling of the dreams and whether also when the human mind is in right religious tone it has not always this childish poweri speak advisedly this powera noble one and possessed more in youth than at any period of after life but always i think restored in a measure by religionof raising into sublimity and reality the rudest symbol which is given to it of accredited truth  section lxi ever since the period of the renaissance however the truth has not been accredited the painter of religious subject is no longer regarded as the narrator of a fact but as the inventor of an idea footnote i do not mean that modern christians believe less in the facts than ancient christians but they do not believe in the representation of the facts as true we look upon the picture as this or that painters conception the elder christians looked upon it as this or that painters description of what had actually taken place and in the greek church all painting is to this day strictly a branch of tradition see m diderons admirably written introduction to his iconographie chr√©tienne p 7un de mes compagnons s√©tonnait de re trouver √† la panagia de st luc le saint jean chrysostome quil avait dessin√© dans le baptist√®re de st marc √† venise le costume des personnages est partout et en tout temps le m√™me nonseulement pour la forme mais pour la couleur mais pour le dessin mais jusque pour le nombre et l√©paisseur des plis we do not severely criticise the manner in which a true history is told but we become harsh investigators of the faults of an invention so that in the modern religious mind the capacity of emotion which renders judgment uncertain is joined with an incredulity which renders it severe and this ignorant emotion joined with ignorant observance of faults is the worst possible temper in which any art can be regarded but more especially sacred art for as religious faith renders emotion facile so also it generally renders expression simple that is to say a truly religious painter will very often be ruder quainter simpler and more faulty in his manner of working than a great irreligious one and it was in this artless utterance and simple acceptance on the part of both the workman and the beholder that all noble schools of art have been cradled it is in them that they must be cradled to the end of time it is impossible to calculate the enormous loss of power in modern days owing to the imperative requirement that art shall be methodical and learned for as long as the constitution of this world remains unaltered there will be more intellect in it than there can be education there will be many men capable of just sensation and vivid invention who never will have time to cultivate or polish their natural powers and all unpolished power is in the present state of society lost in other things as well as in the arts but in the arts especially nay in nine cases out of ten people mistake the polish for the power until a man has passed through a course of academy studentship and can draw in an approved manner with french chalk and knows foreshortening and perspective and something of anatomy we do not think he can possibly be an artist what is worse we are very apt to think that we can make him an artist by teaching him anatomy and how to draw with french chalk whereas the real gift in him is utterly independent of all such accomplishments and i believe there are many peasants on every estate and laborers in every town of europe who have imaginative powers of a high order which nevertheless cannot be used for our good because we do not choose to look at anything but what is expressed in a legal and scientific way i believe there is many a village mason who set to carve a series of scripture or any other histories would find many a strange and noble fancy in his head and set it down roughly enough indeed but in a way well worth our having but we are too grand to let him do this or to set up his clumsy work when it is done and accordingly the poor stonemason is kept hewing stones smooth at the corners and we build our church of the smooth square stones and consider ourselves wise  section lxii i shall pursue this subject farther in another place but i allude to it here in order to meet the objections of those persons who suppose the mosaics of st marks and others of the period to be utterly barbarous as representations of religious history let it be granted that they are so we are not for that reason to suppose they were ineffective in religious teaching i have above spoken of the whole church as a great book of common prayer the mosaics were its illuminations and the common people of the time were taught their scripture history by means of them more impressively perhaps though far less fully than ours are now by scripture reading they had no other bible andprotestants do not often enough consider thiscould have no other we find it somewhat difficult to furnish our poor with printed bibles consider what the difficulty must have been when they could be given only in manuscript the walls of the church necessarily became the poor mans bible and a picture was more easily read upon the walls than a chapter under this view and considering them merely as the bible pictures of a great nation in its youth i shall finally invite the reader to examine the connection and subjects of these mosaics but in the meantime i have to deprecate the idea of their execution being in any sense barbarous i have conceded too much to modern prejudice in permitting them to be rated as mere childish efforts at colored portraiture they have characters in them of a very noble kind nor are they by any means devoid of the remains of the science of the later roman empire the character of the features is almost always fine the expression stern and quiet and very solemn the attitudes and draperies always majestic in the single figures and in those of the groups which are not in violent action footnote all the effects of byzantine art to represent violent action are inadequate most of them ludicrously so even when the sculptural art is in other respects far advanced the early gothic sculptors on the other hand fail in all points of refinement but hardly ever in expression of action this distinction is of course one of the necessary consequences of the difference in all respects between the repose of the eastern and activity of the western mind which we shall have to trace out completely in the inquiry into the nature of gothic while the bright coloring and disregard of chiaroscuro cannot be regarded as imperfections since they are the only means by which the figures could be rendered clearly intelligible in the distance and darkness of the vaulting so far am i from considering them barbarous that i believe of all works of religious art whatsoever these and such as these have been the most effective they stand exactly midway between the debased manufacture of wooden and waxen images which is the support of romanist idolatry all over the world and the great art which leads the mind away from the religious subject to the art itself respecting neither of these branches of human skill is there nor can there be any question the manufacture of puppets however influential on the romanist mind of europe is certainly not deserving of consideration as one of the fine arts it matters literally nothing to a romanist what the image he worships is like take the vilest doll that is screwed together in a cheap toyshop trust it to the keeping of a large family of children let it be beaten about the house by them till it is reduced to a shapeless block then dress it in a satin frock and declare it to have fallen from heaven and it will satisfactorily answer all romanist purposes idolatry footnote appendix x proper sense of the word idolatry it cannot be too often repeated is no encourager of the fine arts but on the other hand the highest branches of the fine arts are no encouragers either of idolatry or of religion no picture of leonardos or raphaels no statue of michael angelos has ever been worshipped except by accident carelessly regarded and by ignorant persons there is less to attract in them than in commoner works carefully regarded and by intelligent persons they instantly divert the mind from their subject to their art so that admiration takes the place of devotion i do not say that the madonna di s sisto the madonna del cardellino and such others have not had considerable religious influence on certain minds but i say that on the mass of the people of europe they have had none whatever while by far the greater number of the most celebrated statues and pictures are never regarded with any other feelings than those of admiration of human beauty or reverence for human skill effective religious art therefore has always lain and i believe must always lie between the two extremesof barbarous idolfashioning on one side and magnificent craftsmanship on the other it consists partly in missalpainting and such bookillustrations as since the invention of printing have taken its place partly in glasspainting partly in rude sculpture on the outsides of buildings partly in mosaics and partly in the frescoes and tempera pictures which in the fourteenth century formed the link between this powerful because imperfect religious art and the impotent perfection which succeeded it  section lxiii but of all these branches the most important are the inlaying and mosaic of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries represented in a central manner by these mosaics of st marks missalpainting could not from its minuteness produce the same sublime impressions and frequently merged itself in mere ornamentation of the page modern bookillustration has been so little skillful as hardly to be worth naming sculpture though in some positions it becomes of great importance has always a tendency to lose itself in architectural effect and was probably seldom deciphered in all its parts by the common people still less the traditions annealed in the purple burning of the painted window finally tempera pictures and frescoes were often of limited size or of feeble color but the great mosaics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries covered the walls and roofs of the churches with inevitable lustre they could not be ignored or escaped from their size rendered them majestic their distance mysterious their color attractive they did not pass into confused or inferior decorations neither were they adorned with any evidences of skill or science such as might withdraw the attention from their subjects they were before the eyes of the devotee at every interval of his worship vast shadowings forth of scenes to whose realization he looked forward or of spirits whose presence he invoked and the man must be little capable of receiving a religious impression of any kind who to this day does not acknowledge some feeling of awe as he looks up at the pale countenances and ghastly forms which haunt the dark roofs of the baptisteries of parma and florence or remains altogether untouched by the majesty of the colossal images of apostles and of him who sent apostles that look down from the darkening gold of the domes of venice and pisa  section lxiv i shall in a future portion of this work endeavor to discover what probabilities there are of our being able to use this kind of art in modern churches but at present it remains for us to follow out the connection of the subjects represented in st marks so as to fulfil our immediate object and form an adequate conception of the feelings of its builders and of its uses to those for whom it was built  now there is one circumstance to which i must in the outset direct the readers special attention as forming a notable distinction between ancient and modern days our eyes are now familiar and weaned with writing and if an inscription is put upon a building unless it be large and clear it is ten to one whether we ever trouble ourselves to decipher it but the old architect was sure of readers he knew that every one would be glad to decipher all that he wrote that they would rejoice in possessing the vaulted leaves of his stone manuscript and that the more he gave them the more grateful would the people be we must take some pains therefore when we enter st marks to read all that is inscribed or we shall not penetrate into the feeling either of the builder or of his times  section lxv a large atrium or portico is attached to two sides of the church a space which was especially reserved for unbaptized persons and new converts it was thought right that before their baptism these persons should be led to contemplate the great facts of the old testament history the history of the fall of man and of the lives of patriarchs up to the period of the covenant by moses the order of the subjects in this series being very nearly the same as in many northern churches but significantly closing with the fall of the manna in order to mark to the catechumen the insufficiency of the mosaic covenant for salvationour fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are deadand to turn his thoughts to the true bread of which the manna was the type  section lxvi then when after his baptism he was permitted to enter the church over its main entrance he saw on looking back a mosaic of christ enthroned with the virgin on one side and st mark on the other in attitudes of adoration christ is represented as holding a book open upon his knee on which is written i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved on the red marble moulding which surrounds the mosaic is written i am the gate of life let those who are mine enter by me above on the red marble fillet which forms the cornice of the west end of the church is written with reference to the figure of christ below who he was and from whom he came and at what price he redeemed thee and why he made thee and gave thee all things do thou consider  now observe this was not to be seen and read only by the catechumen when he first entered the church every one who at any time entered was supposed to look back and to read this writing their daily entrance into the church was thus made a daily memorial of their first entrance into the spiritual church and we shall find that the rest of the book which was opened for them upon its walls continually led them in the same manner to regard the visible temple as in every part a type of the invisible church of god  section lxvii therefore the mosaic of the first dome which is over the head of the spectator as soon as he has entered by the great door that door being the type of baptism represents the effusion of the holy spirit as the first consequence and seal of the entrance into the church of god in the centre of the cupola is the dove enthroned in the greek manner as the lamb is enthroned when the divinity of the second and third persons is to be insisted upon together with their peculiar offices from the central symbol of the holy spirit twelve streams of fire descend upon the heads of the twelve apostles who are represented standing around the dome and below them between the windows which are pierced in its walls are represented by groups of two figures for each separate people the various nations who heard the apostles speak at pentecost every man in his own tongue finally on the vaults at the four angles which support the cupola are pictured four angels each bearing a tablet upon the end of a rod in his hand on each of the tablets of the three first angels is inscribed the word holy on that of the fourth is written lord and the beginning of the hymn being thus put into the mouths of the four angels the words of it are continued around the border of the dome uniting praise to god for the gift of the spirit with welcome to the redeemed soul received into his church      holy holy holy lord god of sabaoth        heaven and earth are full of thy glory          hosanna in the highest   blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord  and observe in this writing that the convert is required to regard the outpouring of the holy spirit especially as a work of sanctification it is the holiness of god manifested in the giving of his spirit to sanctify those who had become his children which the four angels celebrate in their ceaseless praise and it is on account of this holiness that the heaven and earth are said to be full of his glory  section lxviii after thus hearing praise rendered to god by the angels for the salvation of the newlyentered soul it was thought fittest that the worshipper should be led to contemplate in the most comprehensive forms possible the past evidence and the future hopes of christianity as summed up in three facts without assurance of which all faith is vain namely that christ died that he rose again and that he ascended into heaven there to prepare a place for his elect on the vault between the first and second cupolas are represented the crucifixion and resurrection of christ with the usual series of intermediate scenesthe treason of judas the judgment of pilate the crowning with thorns the descent into hades the visit of the women to the sepulchre and the apparition to mary magdalene the second cupola itself which is the central and principal one of the church is entirely occupied by the subject of the ascension at the highest point of it christ is represented as rising into the blue heaven borne up by four angels and throned upon a rainbow the type of reconciliation beneath him the twelve apostles are seen upon the mount of olives with the madonna and in the midst of them the two men in white apparel who appeared at the moment of the ascension above whom as uttered by them are inscribed the words ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this christ the son of god as he is taken from you shall so come the arbiter of the earth trusted to do judgment and justice  section lxix beneath the circle of the apostles between the windows of the cupola are represented the christian virtues as sequent upon the crucifixion of the flesh and the spiritual ascension together with christ beneath them on the vaults which support the angles of the cupola are placed the four evangelists because on their evidence our assurance of the fact of the ascension rests and finally beneath their feet as symbols of the sweetness and fulness of the gospel which they declared are represented the four rivers of paradise pison gihon tigris and euphrates  section lxx the third cupola that over the altar represents the witness of the old testament to christ showing him enthroned in its centre and surrounded by the patriarchs and prophets but this dome was little seen by the people footnote it is also of inferior workmanship and perhaps later than the rest vide lord lindsay vol i p 124 note their contemplation was intended to be chiefly drawn to that of the centre of the church and thus the mind of the worshipper was at once fixed on the main groundwork and hope of christianitychrist is risen and christ shall come if he had time to explore the minor lateral chapels and cupolas he could find in them the whole series of new testament history the events of the life of christ and the apostolic miracles in their order and finally the scenery of the book of revelation footnote the old mosaics from the revelation have perished and have been replaced by miserable work of the seventeenth century but if he only entered as often the common people do to this hour snatching a few moments before beginning the labor of the day to offer up an ejaculatory prayer and advanced but from the main entrance as far as the altar screen all the splendor of the glittering nave and variegated dome if they smote upon his heart as they might often in strange contrast with his reed cabin among the shallows of the lagoon smote upon it only that they might proclaim the two great messageschrist is risen and christ shall come daily as the white cupolas rose like wreaths of seafoam in the dawn while the shadowy campanile and frowning palace were still withdrawn into the night they rose with the easter voice of triumphchrist is risen and daily as they looked down upon the tumult of the people deepening and eddying in the wide square that opened from their feet to the sea they uttered above them the sentence of warningchrist shall come  section lxxi and this thought may surely dispose the reader to look with some change of temper upon the gorgeous building and wild blazonry of that shrine of st marks he now perceives that it was in the hearts of the old venetian people far more than a place of worship it was at once a type of the redeemed church of god and a scroll for the written word of god it was to be to them both an image of the bride all glorious within her clothing of wrought gold and the actual table of the law and the testimony written within and without and whether honored as the church or as the bible was it not fitting that neither the gold nor the crystal should be spared in the adornment of it that as the symbol of the bride the building of the wall thereof should be of jasper footnote rev xxi 18 and the foundations of it garnished with all manner of precious stones and that as the channel of the world that triumphant utterance of the psalmist should be true of iti have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches and shall we not look with changed temper down the long perspective of st marks place towards the sevenfold gates and glowing domes of its temple when we know with what solemn purpose the shafts of it were lifted above the pavement of the populous square men met there from all countries of the earth for traffic or for pleasure but above the crowd swaying for ever to and fro in the restlessness of avarice or thirst of delight was seen perpetually the glory of the temple attesting to them whether they would hear or whether they would forbear that there was one treasure which the merchantmen might buy without a price and one delight better than all others in the word and the statutes of god not in the wantonness of wealth not in vain ministry to the desire of the eyes or the pride of life were those marbles hewn into transparent strength and those arches arrayed in the colors of the iris there is a message written in the dyes of them that once was written in blood and a sound in the echoes of their vaults that one day shall fill the vault of heavenhe shall return to do judgment and justice the strength of venice was given her so long as she remembered this her destruction found her when she had forgotten this and it found her irrevocably because she forgot it without excuse never had city a more glorious bible among the nations of the north a rude and shadowy sculpture filled their temples with confused and hardly legible imagery but for her the skill and the treasures of the east had gilded every letter and illumined every page till the booktemple shone from afar off like the star of the magi in other cities the meetings of the people were often in places withdrawn from religious association subject to violence and to change and on the grass of the dangerous rampart and in the dust of the troubled street there were deeds done and counsels taken which if we cannot justify we may sometimes forgive but the sins of venice whether in her palace or in her piazza were done with the bible at her right hand the walls on which its testimony was written were separated but by a few inches of marble from those which guarded the secrets of her councils or confined the victims of her policy and when in her last hours she threw off all shame and all restraint and the great square of the city became filled with the madness of the whole earth be it remembered how much her sin was greater because it was done in the face of the house of god burning with the letters of his law mountebank and masker laughed their laugh and went their way and a silence has followed them not unforetold for amidst them all through century after century of gathering vanity and festering guilt that white dome of st marks had uttered in the dead ear of venice know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment     chapter v  the ducal palace   section i it was stated in the commencement of the preceding chapter that the gothic art of venice was separated by the building of the ducal palace into two distinct periods and that in all the domestic edifices which were raised for half a century after its completion their characteristic and chiefly effective portions were more or less directly copied from it the fact is that the ducal palace was the great work of venice at this period itself the principal effort of her imagination employing her best architects in its masonry and her best painters in its decoration for a long series of years and we must receive it as a remarkable testimony to the influence which it possessed over the minds of those who saw it in its progress that while in the other cities of italy every palace and church was rising in some original and daily more daring form the majesty of this single building was able to give pause to the gothic imagination in its full career stayed the restlessness of innovation in an instant and forbade the powers which had created it thenceforth to exert themselves in new directions or endeavor to summon an image more attractive  section ii the reader will hardly believe that while the architectural invention of the venetians was thus lost narcissuslike in selfcontemplation the various accounts of the progress of the building thus admired and beloved are so confused as frequently to leave it doubtful to what portion of the palace they refer and that there is actually at the time being a dispute between the best venetian antiquaries whether the main fa√ßade of the palace be of the fourteenth or fifteenth century the determination of this question is of course necessary before we proceed to draw any conclusions from the style of the work and it cannot be determined without a careful review of the entire history of the palace and of all the documents relating to it i trust that this review may not be found tediousassuredly it will not be fruitlessbringing many facts before us singularly illustrative of the venetian character  section iii before however the reader can enter upon any inquiry into the history of this building it is necessary that he should be thoroughly familiar with the arrangement and names of its principal parts as it at present stands otherwise he cannot comprehend so much as a single sentence of any of the documents referring to it i must do what i can by the help of a rough plan and birdseye view to give him the necessary topographical knowledge  opposite is a rude ground plan of the buildings round st marks place and the following references will clearly

church of st mark  of this fourth side therefore nothing can be seen of the other three sides we shall have to speak constantly and they will be respectively called that towards the piazzetta the piazzetta fa√ßade that towards the riva de schiavoni the sea fa√ßade and that towards the rio del palazzo the rio fa√ßade this rio or canal is usually looked upon by the traveller with great respect or even horror because it passes under the bridge of sighs it is however one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and the bridge and its canal together occupy in the mind of a venetian very much the position of fleet street and temple bar in that of a londonerat least at the time when temple bar was occasionally decorated with human heads the two buildings closely resemble each other in form  section iv we must now proceed to obtain some rough idea of the appearance and distribution of the palace itself but its arrangement will be better understood by supposing ourselves raised some hundred and fifty feet above the point in the lagoon in front of it so as to get a general view of the sea fa√ßade and rio fa√ßade the latter in very steep perspective and to look down into its interior court fig ii roughly represents such a view omitting all details on the roofs in order to avoid confusion in this drawing we have merely to notice that of the two bridges seen on the right the uppermost above the black canal is the bridge of sighs the lower one is the ponte della paglia the regular thoroughfare from quay to quay and i believe called the bridge of straw because the boats which brought straw from the mainland used to sell it at this place the corner of the palace rising above this bridge and formed by the meeting of the sea fa√ßade and rio fa√ßade will always be called the vine angle because it is decorated by a sculpture of the drunkenness of noah the angle opposite will be called the figtree angle because it is decorated by a sculpture of the fall of man the long and narrow range of building of which the roof is seen in perspective behind this angle is the part of the palace fronting the piazzetta and the angle under the pinnacle most to the left of the two which terminate it will be called for a reason presently to be stated the judgment angle within the square formed by the building is seen its interior court with one of its wells terminated by small and fantastic buildings of the renaissance period which face the giants stair of which the extremity is seen sloping down on the left  section v the great fa√ßade which fronts the spectator looks southward hence the two traceried windows lower than the rest and to the right of the spectator may be conveniently distinguished as the eastern windows there are two others like them filled with tracery and at the same level which look upon the narrow canal between the ponte della paglia and the bridge of sighs these we may conveniently call the canal windows the reader will observe a vertical line in this dark side of the palace separating its nearer and plainer wall from a long fourstoried range of rich architecture this more distant range is entirely renaissance its extremity is not indicated because i have no accurate sketch of the small buildings and bridges beyond it and we shall have nothing whatever to do with this part of the palace in our present inquiry the nearer and undecorated wall is part of the older palace though much defaced by modern opening of common windows refittings of the brickwork etc  section vi it will be observed that the fa√ßade is composed of a smooth mass of wall sustained on two tiers of pillars one above the other the manner in which these support the whole fabric will be understood at once by the rough section fig iii which is supposed to be taken right through the palace to the interior court from near the middle of the sea fa√ßade here a and d are the rows of shafts both in the inner court and on the fa√ßade which carry the main walls b c are solid walls variously strengthened with pilasters a b c are the three stories of the interior of the palace  illustration fig iii  the reader sees that it is impossible for any plan to be more simple and that if the inner floors and walls of the stories a b were removed there would be left merely the form of a basilicatwo high walls carried on ranges of shafts and roofed by a low gable  the stories a b are entirely modernized and divided into confused ranges of small apartments among which what vestiges remain of ancient masonry are entirely undecipherable except by investigations such as i have had neither the time nor as in most cases they would involve the removal of modern plastering the opportunity to make with the subdivisions of this story therefore i shall not trouble the reader but those of the great upper story c are highly important  section vii in the birdseye view above fig ii it will be noticed that the two windows on the right are lower than the other four of the fa√ßade in this arrangement there is one of the most remarkable instances i know of the daring sacrifice of symmetry to convenience which was noticed in chap vii as one of the chief noblenesses of the gothic schools  the part of the palace in which the two lower windows occur we shall find was first built and arranged in four stories in order to obtain the necessary number of apartments owing to circumstances of which we shall presently give an account it became necessary in the beginning of the fourteenth century to provide another large and magnificent chamber for the meeting of the senate that chamber was added at the side of the older building but as only one room was wanted there was no need to divide the added portion into two stories the entire height was given to the single chamber being indeed not too great for just harmony with its enormous length and breadth and then came the question how to place the windows whether on a line with the two others or above them  the ceiling of the new room was to be adorned by the paintings of the best masters in venice and it became of great importance to raise the light near that gorgeous roof as well as to keep the tone of illumination in the council chamber serene and therefore to introduce light rather in simple masses than in many broken streams a modern architect terrified at the idea of violating external symmetry would have sacrificed both the pictures and the peace of the council he would have placed the larger windows at the same level with the other two and have introduced above them smaller windows like those of the upper story in the older building as if that upper story had been continued along the fa√ßade but the old venetian thought of the honor of the paintings and the comfort of the senate before his own reputation he unhesitatingly raised the large windows to their proper position with reference to the interior of the chamber and suffered the external appearance to take care of itself and i believe the whole pile rather gains than loses in effect by the variation thus obtained in the spaces of wall above and below the windows  section viii on the party wall between the second and third windows which faces the eastern extremity of the great council chamber is painted the paradise of tintoret and this wall will therefore be hereafter called the wall of the paradise  in nearly the centre of the sea fa√ßade and between the first and second windows of the great council chamber is a large window to the ground opening on a balcony which is one of the chief ornaments of the palace and will be called in future the sea balcony  the fa√ßade which looks on the piazzetta is very nearly like this to the sea but the greater part of it was built in the fifteenth century when people had become studious of their symmetries its side windows are all on the same level two light the west end of the great council chamber one lights a small room anciently called the quarantia civil nuova the other three and the central one with a balcony like that to the sea light another large chamber called sala del scrutinio or hall of enquiry which extends to the extremity of the palace above the porta della carta  section ix the reader is now well enough acquainted with the topography of the existing building to be able to follow the accounts of its history  we have seen above that there were three principal styles of venetian architecture byzantine gothic and renaissance  the ducal palace which was the great work of venice was built successively in the three styles there was a byzantine ducal palace a gothic ducal palace and a renaissance ducal palace the second superseded the first totally a few stones of it if indeed so much are all that is left but the third superseded the second in part only and the existing building is formed by the union of the two  we shall review the history of each in succession footnote the reader will find it convenient to note the following editions of the printed books which have been principally consulted in the following inquiry the numbers of the manuscripts referred to in the marcian library are given with the quotations   sansovino venetia descritta 410 venice 1663   sansovino lettera intorno al palazzo ducale 8vo venice 1829   temanza antica pianta di venezia with text venice 1780   cadorin pareri di xv

last representation of her power  section x of the exact position and form of this palace of participazio little is ascertained sansovino says that it was built near the ponte della paglia and answeringly on the grand canal towards san giorgio that is to say in the place now occupied by the sea fa√ßade but this was merely the popular report of his day footnote what i call the sea was called the grand canal by the venetians as well as the great water street of the city but i prefer calling it the sea in order to distinguish between that street and the broad water in front of the ducal palace which interrupted only by the island of san giorgio stretches for many miles to the south and for more than two to the boundary of the lido it was the deeper channel just in front of the ducal palace continuing the line of the great water street itself which the venetians spoke of as the grand canal the words of sansovino are fu cominciato dove si vede vicino al ponte della paglia et rispondente sul canal grande filiasi says simply the palace was built where it now is il palazio fu fatto dove ora pure esistevol iii chap 27 the savina chronicle already quoted says in the place called the bruolo or broglio that is to say on the piazzetta  we know however positively that it was somewhere upon the site of the existing palace and that it had an important front towards the piazzetta with which as we shall see hereafter the present palace at one period was incorporated we know also that it was a pile of some magnificence from the account given by sagornino of the visit paid by the emperor otho the great to the doge pietro orseolo ii the chronicler says that the emperor beheld carefully all the beauty of the palace footnote omni decoritate illius perlustratasagornino quoted by cadorin and temanza and the venetian historians express pride in the buildings being worthy of an emperors examination this was after the palace had been much injured by fire in the revolt against candiano iv footnote there is an interesting account of this revolt in monaci p 68 some historians speak of the palace as having been destroyed entirely but that it did not even need important restorations appears from sagorninos expression quoted by cadorin and temanza speaking of the doge participazio he says qui palatii hucusque manentis fuerit fabricator the reparations of the palace are usually attributed to the successor of candiano pietro orseolo i but the legend under the picture of that doge in the council chamber speaks only of his rebuilding st marks and performing many miracles his whole mind seems to have been occupied with ecclesiastical affairs and his piety was finally manifested in a way somewhat startling to the state by absconding with a french priest to st michaels in gascony and there becoming a monk what repairs therefore were necessary to the ducal palace were left to be undertaken by his son orseolo ii above named and just repaired and richly adorned by orseolo himself who is spoken of by sagornino as having also adorned the chapel of the ducal palace st marks with ornaments of marble and gold footnote quam non modo marmoreo verum aureo compsit ornamentotemanza there can be no doubt whatever that the palace at this period resembled and impressed the other byzantine edifices of the city such as the fondaco de turchi c whose remains have been already described and that like them it was covered with sculpture and richly adorned with gold and color  section xi in the year 1106 it was for the second time injured by fire footnote lanno 1106 uscito fuoco duna casa privata arse parte del palazzosansovino of the beneficial effect of these fires vide cadorin but repaired before 1116 when it received another emperor henry v of germany and was again honored by imperial praise footnote urbis situm aedificiorum decorem et regiminis sequitatem multipliciter commendavitcronaca dandolo quoted by cadorin  between 1173 and the close of the century it seems to have been again repaired and much enlarged by the doge sebastian ziani sansovino says that this doge not only repaired it but enlarged it in every direction footnote non solamente rinovo il palazzo ma lo aggrandi per ogni versosansovino zanotto quotes the altinat chronicle for account of these repairs and after this enlargement the palace seems to have remained untouched for a hundred years until in the commencement of the fourteenth century the works of the gothic palace were begun as therefore the old byzantine building was at the time when those works first interfered with it in the form given to it by ziani i shall hereafter always speak of it as the ziani palace and this the rather because the only chronicler whose words are perfectly clear respecting the existence of part of this palace so late as the year 1422 speaks of it as built by ziani the old palace of which half remains to this day was built as we now see it by sebastian ziani footnote el palazzo che anco di mezzo se vede vecchio per m sebastian ziani fu fatto compir come el se vedechronicle of pietro dolfino cod ven p 47 this chronicle is spoken of by sansovino as molto

important change in the venetian government which gave stability to the aristocratic power took place about the year 1297 footnote see vol i appendix 3 stones of venice under the doge pietro gradenigo a man thus characterized by sansovinoa prompt and prudent man of unconquerable determination and great eloquence who laid so to speak the foundations of the eternity of this republic by the admirable regulations which he introduced into the government  we may now with some reason doubt of their admirableness but their importance and the vigorous will and intellect of the doge are not to be disputed venice was in the zenith of her strength and the heroism of her citizens was displaying itself in every quarter of the world footnote vide sansovinos enumeration of those who flourished in the reign of gradenigo p 564 the acquiescence in the secure establishment of the aristocratic power was an expression by the people of respect for the families which had been chiefly instrumental in raising the commonwealth to such a height of prosperity  the serrar del consiglio fixed the numbers of the senate within certain limits and it conferred upon them a dignity greater than they had ever before possessed it was natural that the alteration in the character of the assembly should be attended by some change in the size arrangement or decoration of the chamber in which they sat  we accordingly find it recorded by sansovino that in 1301 another saloon was begun on the rio del palazzo under the doge gradenigo and finished in 1309 in which year the grand council first sat in it footnote sansovino 324 i in the first year therefore of the fourteenth century the gothic ducal palace of venice was begun and as the byzantine palace was in its foundation coeval with that of the state so the gothic palace was in its foundation coeval with that of the aristocratic power considered as the principal representation of the venetian school of architecture the ducal palace is the parthenon of venice and gradenigo its pericles  section xiii sansovino with a caution very frequent among venetian historians when alluding to events connected with the serrar del consiglio does not specially mention the cause for the requirement of the new chamber but the sivos chronicle is a little more distinct in expression in 1301 it was determined to build a great saloon for the assembling of the great council and the room was built which is now called the sala del scrutinio footnote 1301 fu presa parte di fare una sala grande per la riduzione del gran consiglio e fu fatta quella che ora si chiama dello scrutiniocronaca sivos quoted by cadorin there is another most interesting entry in the chronicle of magno relating to this event but the passage is so ill written that i am not

extends from 1253 to 1454  abstract 1301 to 1309 gradenigos room134042 page 2951419 new proposals p 298 now that is to say at the time when the sivos chronicle was written the room has long ago been destroyed and its name given to another chamber on the opposite side of the palace but i wish the reader to remember the date 1301 as marking the commencement of a great architectural epoch in which took place the first appliance of the energy of the aristocratic power and of the gothic style to the works of the ducal palace the operations then begun were continued with hardly an interruption during the whole period of the prosperity of venice we shall see the new buildings consume and take the place of the ziani palace piece by piece and when the ziani palace was destroyed they fed upon themselves being continued round the square until in the sixteenth century they reached the point where they had been begun in the fourteenth and pursued the track they had then followed some distance beyond the junction destroying or hiding their own commencement as the serpent which is the type of eternity conceals its tail in its jaws  section xiv we cannot therefore see the extremity wherein lay the sting and force of the whole creaturethe chamber namely built by the doge gradenigo but the reader must keep that commencement and the date of it carefully in his mind the body of the palace serpent will soon become visible to us  the gradenigo chamber was somewhere on the rio fa√ßade behind the present position of the bridge of sighs ie about the point marked on the roof by the dotted lines in the woodcut it is not known whether low or high but probably on a first story the great fa√ßade of the ziani palace being as above mentioned on the piazzetta this chamber was as far back and out of the way as possible secrecy and security being obviously the points first considered  section xv but the newly constituted senate had need of other additions to the ancient palace besides the council chamber a short but most significant sentence is added to sansovinos account of the construction of that room there were near it he says the cancellaria and the gheba or gabbia afterwards called the little tower footnote vi era appresso la cancellarla e la gheba o gabbia iniamata poi torresellap 324 a small square tower is seen above the vine angle in the view of venice dated 1500 and attributed to albert durer it appears about 25 feet square and is very probably the torresella in question  gabbia means a cage and there can be no question that certain apartments were at this time added at the top of the palace and on the rio fa√ßade which were to be used as prisons whether any portion of the old torresella still remains is a doubtful question but the apartments at the top of the palace in its fourth story were still used for prisons as late as the beginning of the seventeenth century footnote vide bettio lettera p 23 i wish the reader especially to notice that a separate tower or range of apartments was built for this purpose in order to clear the government of the accusations so constantly made against them by ignorant or partial historians of wanton cruelty to prisoners the stories commonly told respecting the piombi of the ducal palace are utterly false instead of being as usually reported small furnaces under the leads of the palace they were comfortable rooms with good flat roofs of larch and carefully ventilated footnote bettio lettera p 20 those who wrote without having seen them described them as covered with lead and those who have seen them know that between their flat timber roofs and the sloping leaden roof of the palace the interval is five metres where it is least and nine where it is greatest the new chamber then and the prisons being built the great council first sat in their retired chamber on the rio in the year 1309  section xvi now observe the significant progress of events they had no sooner thus established themselves in power than they were disturbed by the conspiracy of the tiepolos in the year 1310 in consequence of that conspiracy the council of ten was created still under the doge gradenigo who having finished his work and left the aristocracy of venice armed with this terrible power died in the year 1312 some say by poison he was succeeded by the doge marino giorgio who reigned only one year and then followed the prosperous government of john soranzo there is no mention of any additions to the ducal palace during his reign but he was succeeded by that francesco dandolo the sculptures on whose tomb still existing in the cloisters of the salute may be compared by any traveller with those of the ducal palace of him it is recorded in the savina chronicle this doge also had the great gate built which is at the entry of the palace above which is his statue kneeling with the gonfalon in hand before the feet of the lion of st marks footnote questo dose anche fese far la porta granda che se al

after the senate had completed their council chamber and the prisons they required a nobler door than that of the old ziani palace for their magnificences to enter by this door is twice spoken of in the government accounts of expenses which are fortunately preserved footnote these documents i have not examined myself being satisfied of the accuracy of cadorin from whom i take the passages quoted

consider where a larger and more magnificent one might be built the government was now thoroughly established and it was probably felt that there was some meanness in the retired position as well as insufficiency in the size of the council chamber on the rio the first definite account which i find of their proceedings under these circumstances is in the caroldo chronicle footnote cod ven no cxli p 365  1340 on the 28th of december in the preceding year master marco erizzo nicolo soranzo and thomas gradenigo were chosen to examine where a new saloon might be built in order to assemble therein the greater council on the 3rd of june 1341 the great council elected two procurators of the work of this saloon with a salary of eighty ducats a year  it appears from the entry still preserved in the archivio and quoted by cadorin that it was on the 28th of december 1340 that the commissioners appointed to decide on this important matter gave in their report to the grand council and that the decree passed thereupon for the commencement of a new council chamber on the grand canal footnote sansovino is more explicit than usual in his reference to this decree for it having appeared that the place the first council chamber is not capacious enough the saloon on the grand canal was ordered per cio parendo che il luogo non fosse capace fu ordinata la sala sul canal grandep 324  the room then begun is the one now in existence and its building involved the building of all that is best and most beautiful in the present ducal palace the rich arcades of the lower stories being all prepared for sustaining this sala del gran consiglio  section xix in saying that it is the same now in existence i do not mean that it has undergone no alterations as we shall see hereafter it has been refitted again and again and some portions of its walls rebuilt but in the place and form in which it first stood it still stands and by a glance at the position which its windows occupy as shown in figure ii above the reader will see at once that whatever can be known respecting the design of the sea fa√ßade must be gleaned out of the entries which refer to the building of this great council chamber  cadorin quotes two of great importance to which we shall return in due time made during the progress of the work in 1342 and 1344 then one of 1349 resolving that the works at the ducal palace which had been discontinued during the plague should be resumed and finally one in 1362 which speaks of the great council chamber as having been neglected and suffered to fall into great desolation and resolves that it shall be forthwith completed footnote cadorin 185 2 the decree of 1342 is falsely given as of 1345 by the sivos chronicle and by magno while sanuto gives the decree to its right year 1342 but speaks of the council chamber as only begun in 1345  the interruption had not been caused by the plague only but by the conspiracy of faliero and the violent death of the master builder footnote calendario see appendix i vol iii the work was resumed in 1362 and completed within the next three years at least so far as that guariento was enabled to paint his paradise on the walls footnote ii primo che vi colorisse fu guariento il quale lanno 1365 vi fece il paradiso in testa della salasansovino so that the building must at any rate have been roofed by this time its decorations and fittings however were long in completion the paintings on the roof being only executed in 1400 footnote lan poi 1400 vi fece il ciclo compartita a quadretti doro ripieni di stelle chera la insegna del doge stenosansovino lib viii they represented the heavens covered with stars footnote in questi tempi si messe in oro il ciclo della sala del gran consiglio et si fece il pergole del finestra grande chi guarda sul canale adornato luno e laltro di stelle eh erano la insegne del dogesansovino lib xiii compare also pareri p 129 this being says sansovino the bearings of the doge steno almost all ceilings and vaults were at this time in venice covered with stars without any reference to armorial bearings but steno claims under his noble title of stellifer an important share in completing the chamber in an inscription upon two square tablets now inlaid in the walls on each side of the great window towards the sea    mille quadringenti currebant quatuor anni   hoc opus illustris michael dux stellifer auxit  and in fact it is to this doge that we owe the beautiful balcony of that window though the work above it is partly of more recent date and i think the tablets bearing this important inscription have been taken out and reinserted in the newer masonry the labor of these final decorations occupied a total period of sixty years the grand council sat in the finished chamber for the first time in 1423 in that year the gothic ducal palace of venice was completed it had taken to build it the energies of the entire period which i have above described as the central one of her life  section xx 3rd the renaissance palace i must go back a step or two in order to be certain that the reader understands clearly the state of the palace in 1423 the works of addition or renovation had now been proceeding at intervals during a space of a hundred and twentythree years three generations at least had been accustomed to witness the gradual advancement of the form of the ducal palace into more stately symmetry and to contrast the works of sculpture and painting with which it was decoratedfull of the life knowledge and hope of the fourteenth centurywith the rude byzantine chiselling of the palace of the doge ziani the magnificent fabric just completed of which the new council chamber was the nucleus was now habitually known in venice as the palazzo nuovo and the old byzantine edifice now ruinous and more manifest in its decay by its contrast with the goodly stones of the building which had been raised at its side was of course known as the palazzo vecchio footnote baseggio pareri p 127 is called the proto of the new palace farther notes will be found in appendix i vol iii that fabric however still occupied the principal position in venice the new council chamber had been erected by the side of it towards the sea but there was not then the wide quay in front the riva dei schiavoni which now renders the sea fa√ßade as important as that to the piazzetta there was only a narrow walk between the pillars and the water and the old palace of ziani still faced the piazzetta and interrupted by its decrepitude the magnificence of the square where the nobles daily met every increase of the beauty of the new palace rendered the discrepancy between it and the companion building more painful and then began to arise in the minds of all men a vague idea of the necessity of destroying the old palace and completing the front of the piazzetta with the same splendor as the sea fa√ßade but no such sweeping measure of renovation had been contemplated by the senate when they first formed the plan of their new council chamber first a single additional room then a gateway then a larger room but all considered merely as necessary additions to the palace not as involving the entire reconstruction of the ancient edifice the exhaustion of the treasury and the shadows upon the political horizon rendered it more than imprudent to incur the vast additional expense which such a project involved and the senate fearful of itself and desirous to guard against the weakness of its own enthusiasm passed a decree like the effort of a man fearful of some strong temptation to keep his thoughts averted from the point of danger it was a decree not merely that the old palace should not be rebuilt but that no one should propose rebuilding it the feeling of the desirableness of doing so was too strong to permit fair discussion and the senate knew that to bring forward such a motion was to carry it  section xxi the decree thus passed in order to guard against their own weakness forbade any one to speak of rebuilding the old palace under the penalty of a thousand ducats but they had rated their own enthusiasm too low there was a man among them whom the loss of a thousand ducats could not deter from proposing what he believed to be for the good of the state  some excuse was given him for bringing forward the motion by a fire which occurred in 1419 and which injured both the church of st marks and part of the old palace fronting the piazzetta what followed i shall relate in the words of sanuto footnote cronaca sanudo no cxxv in the marcian library p 568  section xxii therefore they set themselves with all diligence and care to repair and adorn sumptuously first gods house but in the princes house things went on more slowly for it did not please the doge footnote tomaso mocenigo to restore it in the form in which it was before and they could not rebuild it altogether in a better manner so great was the parsimony of these old fathers because it was forbidden by laws which condemned in a penalty of a thousand ducats any one who should propose to throw down the old palace and to rebuild it more richly and with greater expense but the doge who was magnanimous and who desired above all things what was honorable to the city had the thousand ducats carried into the senate chamber and then proposed that the palace should be rebuilt saying that since the late fire had ruined in great part the ducal habitation not only his own private palace but all the places used for public business this occasion was to be taken for an admonishment sent from god that they ought to rebuild the palace more nobly and in a way more befitting the greatness to which by gods grace their dominions had reached and that his motive in proposing this was neither ambition nor selfish interest that as for ambition they might have seen in the whole course of his life through so many years that he had never done anything for ambition either in the city or in foreign business but in all his actions had kept justice first in his thoughts and then the advantage of the state and the honor of the venetian name and that as far as regarded his private interest if it had not been for this accident of the fire he would never have thought of changing anything in the palace into either a more sumptuous or a more honorable form and that during the many years in which he had lived in it he had never endeavored to make any change but had always been content with it as his predecessors had left it and that he knew well that if they took in hand to build it as he exhorted and besought them being now very old and broken down with many toils god would call him to another life before the walls were raised a pace from the ground and that therefore they might perceive that he did not advise them to raise this building for his own convenience but only for the honor of the city and its dukedom and that the good of it would never be felt by him but by his successors then he said that in order as he had always done to observe the laws he had brought with him the thousand ducats which had been appointed as the penalty for proposing such a measure so that he might prove openly to all men that it was not his own advantage that he sought but the dignity of the state there was no one sanuto goes on to tell us who ventured or desired to oppose the wishes of the doge and the thousand ducats were unanimously devoted to the expenses of the work and they set themselves with much diligence to the work and the palace was begun in the form and manner in which it is at present seen but as mocenigo had prophesied not long after he ended his life and not only did not see the work brought to a close but hardly even begun  section xxiii there are one or two expressions in the above extracts which if they stood alone might lead the reader to suppose that the whole palace had been thrown down and rebuilt we must however remember that at this time the new council chamber which had been one hundred years in building was actually unfinished the council had not yet sat in it and it was just as likely that the doge should then propose to destroy and rebuild it as in this year 1853 it is that any one should propose in our house of commons to throw down the new houses of parliament under the title of the old palace and rebuild them  section xxiv the manner in which sanuto expresses himself will at once be seen to be perfectly natural when it is remembered that although we now speak of the whole building as the ducal palace it consisted in the minds of the old venetians of four distinct buildings there were in it the palace the state prisons the senatehouse and the offices of public business in other words it was buckingham palace the tower of olden days the houses of parliament and downing street all in one and any of these four portions might be spoken of without involving an allusion to any other il palazzo was the ducal residence which with most of the public offices mocenigo did propose to pull down and rebuild and which was actually pulled down and rebuilt but the new council chamber of which the whole fa√ßade to the sea consisted never entered into either his or sanutos mind for an instant as necessarily connected with the ducal residence  i said that the new council chamber at the time when mocenigo brought forward his measure had never yet been used it was in the year 1422 footnote vide notes in appendix that the decree passed to rebuild the palace mocenigo died in the following year and francesco foscari was elected in his room footnote on the 4th of april 1423 according to the copy of the zancarol chronicle in the marcian library but previously according to the caroldo chronicle which makes foscari enter the senate as doge on the 3rd of april the great council chamber was used for the first time on the day when foscari entered the senate as dogethe 3rd of april 1423 according to the caroldo chronicle footnote nella quale the sala del gran consiglio non si fece gran consiglio salvo nell anno 1423 alli 3 april et fu il primo giorno che il duce foscari venisse in gran consiglio dopo la sua creationecopy in marcian library p 365 the 23rd which is probably correct by an anonymous ms no 60 in the correr museum footnote e a di 23 april 1423 by the context sequente fo

mantoa c p 426and the following year on the 27th of march the first hammer was lifted up against the old palace of ziani footnote compare appendix i vol iii  section xxv that hammer stroke was the first act of the period properly called the renaissance it was the knell of the architecture of veniceand of venice herself  the central epoch of her life was past the decay had already begun i dated its commencement above ch i vol i from the death of mocenigo a year had not yet elapsed since that great doge had been called to his account his patriotism always sincere had been in this instance mistaken in his zeal for the honor of future venice he had forgotten what was due to the venice of long ago a thousand palaces might be built upon her burdened islands but none of them could take the place or recall the memory of that which was first built upon her unfrequented shore it fell and as if it had been the talisman of her fortunes the city never flourished again  section xxvi i have no intention of following out in their intricate details the operations which were begun under foscari and continued under succeeding doges till the palace assumed its present form for i am not in this work concerned except by occasional reference with the architecture of the fifteenth century but the main facts are the following the palace of ziani was destroyed the existing fa√ßade to the piazzetta built so as both to continue and to resemble in most particulars the work of the great council chamber it was carried back from the sea as far as the judgment angle beyond which is the porta della carta begun in 1439 and finished in two years under the doge foscari footnote tutte queste fatture si compirono sotto il dogade del foscari nel 1441pareri p 131 the interior buildings connected with it were added by the doge christopher moro the othello of shakspeare footnote this identification has been accomplished and i think conclusively by my friend mr rawdon brown who has devoted all the leisure which during the last twenty years his manifold office of kindness to almost every english visitant of venice have left him in discovering and translating the passages of the venetian records which bear upon english history and literature i shall have occasion to take advantage hereafter of a portion of his labors which i trust will shortly be made public in 1462  section xxvii by reference to the figure the reader will see that we have now gone the round of the palace and that the new work of 1462 was close upon the first piece of the gothic palace the new council chamber of 1301 some remnants of the ziani palace were perhaps still left between the two extremities of the gothic palace or as is more probable the last stones of it may have been swept away after the fire of 1419 and replaced by new apartments for the doge but whatever buildings old or new stood on this spot at the time of the completion of the porta della carta were destroyed by another great fire in 1479 together with so much of the palace on the rio that though the saloon of gradenigo then known as the sala de pregadi was not destroyed it became necessary to reconstruct the entire fa√ßades of the portion of the palace behind the bridge of sighs both towards the court and canal this work was entrusted to the best renaissance architects of the close of the fifteenth and opening of the sixteenth centuries antonio ricci executing the giants staircase and on his absconding with a large sum of the public money pietro lombardo taking his place the whole work must have been completed towards the middle of the sixteenth century the architects of the palace advancing round the square and led by fire had more than reached the point from which they had set out and the work of 1560 was joined to the work of 13011340 at the point marked by the conspicuous vertical line in figure ii on the rio fa√ßade  section xviii but the palace was not long permitted to remain in this finished form another terrific fire commonly called the great fire burst out in 1574 and destroyed the inner fittings and all the precious pictures of the great council chamber and of all the upper rooms on the sea fa√ßade and most of those on the rio fa√ßade leaving the building a mere shell shaken and blasted by the flames it was debated in the great council whether the ruin should not be thrown down and an entirely new palace built in its stead the opinions of all the leading architects of venice were taken respecting the safety of the walls or the possibility of repairing them as they stood these opinions given in writing have been preserved and published by the abb√© cadorin in the work already so often referred to and they form one of the most important series of documents connected with the ducal palace  i cannot help feeling some childish pleasure in the accidental resemblance to my own name in that of the architect whose opinion was first given in favor of the ancient fabric giovanni rusconi others especially palladio wanted to pull down the old palace and execute designs of their own but the best architects in venice and to his immortal honor chiefly francesco sansovino energetically pleaded for the gothic pile and prevailed it was successfully repaired and tintoret painted his noblest picture on the wall from which the paradise of guariento had withered before the flames  section xxix the repairs necessarily undertaken at this time were however extensive and interfered in many directions with the earlier work of the palace still the only serious alteration in its form was the transposition of the prisons formerly at the top of the palace to the other side of the rio del palazzo and the building of the bridge of sighs to connect them with the palace by antonio da ponte the completion of this work brought the whole edifice into its present form with the exception of alterations indoors partitions and staircases among the inner apartments not worth noticing and such barbarisms and defacements as have been suffered within the last fifty years by i suppose nearly every building of importance in italy  section xxx now therefore we are at liberty to examine some of the details of the ducal palace without any doubt about their dates i shall not however give any elaborate illustrations of them here because i could not do them justice on the scale of the page of this volume or by means of line engraving i believe a new era is opening to us in the art of illustration footnote see the last chapter of the third volume stones of venice and that i shall be able to give large figures of the details of the ducal palace at a price which will enable every person who is interested in the subject to possess them so that the cost and labor of multiplying illustrations here would be altogether wasted i shall therefore direct the readers attention only to such points of interest as can be explained in the text  section xxxi first then looking back to the woodcut at the beginning of this chapter the reader will observe that as the building was very nearly square on the ground plan a peculiar prominence and importance were given to its angles which rendered it necessary that they should be enriched and softened by sculpture i do not suppose that the fitness of this arrangement will be questioned but if the reader will take the pains to glance over any series of engravings of church towers or other foursquare buildings in which great refinement of form has been attained he will at once observe how their effect depends on some modification of the sharpness of the angle either by groups of buttresses or by turrets and niches rich in sculpture it is to be noted also that this principle of breaking the angle is peculiarly gothic arising partly out of the necessity of strengthening the flanks of enormous buildings where composed of imperfect materials by buttresses or pinnacles partly out of the conditions of gothic warfare which generally required a tower at the angle partly out of the natural dislike of the meagreness of effect in buildings which admitted large surfaces of wall if the angle were entirely unrelieved the ducal palace in its acknowledgment of this principle makes a more definite concession to the gothic spirit than any of the previous architecture of venice no angle up to the time of its erection had been otherwise decorated than by a narrow fluted pilaster of red marble and the sculpture was reserved always as in greek and roman work for the plane surfaces of the building with as far as i recollect two exceptions only both in st marks namely the bold and grotesque gargoyle on its northwest angle and the angels which project from the four inner angles under the main cupola both of these arrangements being plainly made under lombardic influence and if any other instances occur which i may have at present forgotten i am very sure the northern influence will always be distinctly traceable in them  section xxxii the ducal palace however accepts the principle in its completeness and throws the main decoration upon its angles the central window which looks rich and important in the woodcut was entirely restored in the renaissance time as we have seen under the doge steno so that we have no traces of its early treatment and the principal interest of the older palace is concentrated in the angle sculpture which is arranged in the following manner the pillars of the two bearing arcades are much enlarged in thickness at the angles and their capitals increased in depth breadth and fulness of subject above each capital on the angle of the wall a sculptural subject is introduced consisting in the great lower arcade of two or more figures of the size of life in the upper arcade of a single angel holding a scroll above these angels rise the twisted pillars with their crowning niches already noticed in the account of parapets in the seventh chapter thus forming an unbroken line of decoration from the ground to the top of the angle  section xxxiii it was before noticed that one of the corners of the palace joins the irregular outer buildings connected with st marks and is not generally seen there remain therefore to be decorated only the three angles above distinguished as the vine angle the figtree angle and the judgment angle and at these we have according to the arrangement just explained  first three great bearing capitals lower arcade  secondly three figure subjects of sculpture above them lower arcade  thirdly three smaller bearing capitals upper arcade  fourthly three angels above them upper arcade  fifthly three spiral shafts with niches  section xxxiv i shall describe the bearing capitals hereafter in their order with the others of the arcade for the first point to which the readers attention ought to be directed is the choice of subject in the great figure sculptures above them these observe are the very corner stones of the edifice and in them we may expect to find the most important evidences of the feeling as well as the skill of the builder if he has anything to say to us of the purpose with which he built the palace it is sure to be said here if there was any lesson which he wished principally to teach to those for whom he built here it is sure to be inculcated if there was any sentiment which they themselves desired to have expressed in the principal edifice of their city this is the place in which we may be secure of finding it legibly inscribed  section xxxv now the first two angles of the vine and figtree belong to the old or true gothic palace the third angle belongs to the renaissance imitation of it therefore at the first two angles it is the gothic spirit which is going to speak to us and at the third the renaissance spirit  the reader remembers i trust that the most characteristic sentiment of all that we traced in the working of the gothic heart was the frank confession of its own weakness and i must anticipate for a moment the results of our inquiry in subsequent chapters so far as to state that the principal element in the renaissance spirit is its firm confidence in its own wisdom  hear then the two spirits speak for themselves  the first main sculpture of the gothic palace is on what i have called the angle of the figtree  its subject is the fall of man  the second sculpture is on the angle of the vine  its subject is the drunkenness of noah  the renaissance sculpture is on the judgment angle  its subject is the judgment of solomon  it is impossible to overstate or to regard with too much admiration the significance of this single fact it is as if the palace had been built at various epochs and preserved uninjured to this day for the sole purpose of teaching us the difference in the temper of the two schools  section xxxvi i have called the sculpture on the figtree angle the principal one because it is at the central bend of the palace where it turns to the piazetta the fa√ßade upon the piazetta being as we saw above the more important one in ancient times the great capital which sustains this figtree angle is also by far more elaborate than the head of the pilaster under the vine angle marking the pre√´minence of the former in the architects mind it is impossible to say which was first executed but that of the figtree angle is somewhat rougher in execution and more stiff in the design of the figures so that i rather suppose it to have been the earliest completed  section xxxvii in both the subjects of the fall and the drunkenness the tree which forms the chiefly decorative portion of the sculpturefig in the one case vine in the otherwas a necessary adjunct its trunk in both sculptures forms the true outer angle of the palace boldly cut separate from the stonework behind and branching out above the figures so as to enwrap each side of the angle for several feet with its deep foliage nothing can be more masterly or superb than the sweep of this foliage on the figtree angle the broad leaves lapping round the budding fruit and sheltering from sight beneath their shadows birds of the most graceful form and delicate plumage the branches are however so strong and the masses of stone hewn into leafage so large that notwithstanding the depth of the undercutting the work remains nearly uninjured not so at the vine angle where the natural delicacy of the vineleaf and tendril having tempted the sculptor to greater effort he has passed the proper limits of his art and cut the upper stems so delicately that half of them have been broken away by the casualties to which the situation of the sculpture necessarily exposes it what remains is however so interesting in its extreme refinement that i have chosen it for the subject of the first illustration footnote see note at end of this chapter rather than the nobler masses of the figtree which ought to be rendered on a larger scale although half of the beauty of the composition is destroyed by the breaking away of its central masses there is still enough in the distribution of the variously bending leaves and in the placing of the birds on the lighter branches to prove to us the power of the designer i have already referred to this plate as a remarkable instance of the gothic naturalism and indeed it is almost impossible for the copying of nature to be carried farther than in the fibres of the marble branches and the careful finishing of the tendrils note especially the peculiar expression of the knotty joints of the vine in the light branch which rises highest yet only half the finish of the work can be seen in the plate for in several cases the sculptor has shown the under sides of the leaves turned boldly to the light and has literally carved every rib and vein upon them in relief not merely the main ribs which sustain the lobes of the leaf and actually project in nature but the irregular and sinuous veins which chequer the membranous tissues between them and which the sculptor has represented conventionally as relieved like the others in order to give the vine leaf its peculiar tessellated effect upon the eye  section xxxviii as must always be the case in early sculpture the figures are much inferior to the leafage yet so skilful in many respects that it was a long time before i could persuade myself that they had indeed been wrought in the first half of the fourteenth century fortunately the date is inscribed upon a monument in the church of san simeon grande bearing a recumbent statue of the saint of far finer workmanship in every respect than those figures of the ducal palace yet so like them that i think there can be no question that the head of noah was wrought by the sculptor of the palace in emulation of that of the statue of st simeon in this latter sculpture the face is represented in death the mouth partly open the lips thin and sharp the teeth carefully sculptured beneath the face full of quietness and majesty though very ghastly the hair and beard flowing in luxuriant wreaths disposed with the most masterly freedom yet severity of design far down upon the shoulders the hands crossed upon the body carefully studied and the veins and sinews perfectly and easily expressed yet without any attempt at extreme finish or display of technical skill this monument bears date 1317 footnote in xrinoie amen annincarnationis mcccxvii inesetbr in the name of christ amen in the year of the incarnation 1317 in the month of september c and its sculptor was justly proud of it thus recording his name    celavit marcus opus hoc insigne romanis       laudibus non parcus est sua digna manus  section xxxix the head of the noah on the ducal palace evidently worked in emulation of this statue has the same profusion of flowing hair and beard but wrought in smaller and harder curls and the veins on the arms and breast are more sharply drawn the sculptor being evidently more practised in keen and fine lines of vegetation than in those of the figure so that which is most remarkable in a workman of this early period he has failed in telling his story plainly regret and wonder being so equally marked on the features of all the three brothers that it is impossible to say which is intended for ham two of the heads of the brothers are seen in the plate the third figure is not with the rest of the group but set at a distance of about twelve feet on the other side of the arch which springs from the angle capital  section xl it may be observed as a farther evidence of the date of the group that in the figures of all the three youths the feet are protected simply by a bandage arranged in crossed folds round the ankle and lower part of the limb a feature of dress which will be found in nearly every piece of figure sculpture in venice from the year 1300 to 1380 and of which the traveller may see an example within three hundred yards of this very group in the basreliefs on the tomb of the doge andrea dandolo in st marks who died in 1354  section xli the figures of adam and eve sculptured on each side of the figtree angle are more stiff than those of noah and his sons but are better fitted for their architectural service and the trunk of the tree with the angular body of the serpent writhed around it is more nobly treated as a terminal group of lines than that of the vine  the renaissance sculptor of the figures of the judgment of solomon has very nearly copied the figtree from this angle placing its trunk between the executioner and the mother who leans forward to stay his hand but though the whole group is much more free in design than those of the earlier palace and in many ways excellent in itself so that it always strikes the eye of a careless observer more than the others it is of immeasurably inferior spirit in the workmanship the leaves of the tree though far more studiously varied in flow than those of the figtree from which they are partially copied have none of its truth to nature they are ill set on the steins bluntly defined on the edges and their curves are not those of growing leaves but of wrinkled drapery  section xlii above these three sculptures are set in the upper arcade the statues of the archangels raphael michael and gabriel their positions will be understood by reference to the lowest figure in plate xvii where that of raphael above the vine angle is seen on the right a diminutive figure of tobit follows at his feet and he bears in his hand a scroll with this inscription    efice q   sofre   tur afa   el reve   rende   quietu  ie effice quseso fretum raphael reverende quietum footnote oh venerable raphael make thou the gulf calm we beseech thee the peculiar office of the angel raphael is in general according to tradition the restraining the harmful influences of evil spirits sir charles eastlake told me that sometimes in this office he is represented bearing the gall of the fish caught by tobit and reminded me of the peculiar superstitions of the venetians respecting the raising of storms by fiends as embodied in the well known tale of the fisherman and st marks ring i could not decipher the inscription on the scroll borne by the angel michael and the figure of gabriel which is by much the most beautiful feature of the renaissance portion of the palace has only in its hand the annunciation lily  section xliii such are the subjects of the main sculptures decorating the angles of the palace notable observe for their simple expression of two feelings the consciousness of human frailty and the dependence upon divine guidance and protection this being of course the general purpose of the introduction of the figures of the angels and i imagine intended to be more particularly conveyed by the manner in which the small figure of tobit follows the steps of raphael just touching the hem of his garment we have next to examine the course of divinity and of natural history embodied by the old sculpture in the great series of capitals which support the lower arcade of the palace and which being at a height of little more than eight feet above the eye might be read like the pages of a book by those the noblest men in venice who habitually walked beneath the shadow of this great arcade at the time of their first meeting each other for morning converse  section xliv we will now take the pillars of the ducal palace in their order it has already been mentioned vol i chap i section xlvi that there are in all thirtysix great pillars supporting the lower story and that these are to be counted from right to left because then the more ancient of them come first and that thus arranged the first which is not a shaft but a pilaster will be the support of the vine angle the eighteenth will be the great shaft of the figtree angle and the thirtysixth that of the judgment angle  section xlv all their capitals except that of the first are octagonal and are decorated by sixteen leaves differently enriched in every capital but arranged in the same way eight of them rising to the angles and there forming volutes the eight others set between them on the sides rising halfway up the bell of the capital there nodding forward and showing above them rising out of their luxuriance the groups or single figures which we have to examine footnote i have given one of these capitals carefully already in my folio work and hope to give most of the others in due time it was of no use to draw them here as the scale would have been too small to allow me to show the expression of the figures in some instances the intermediate or lower leaves are reduced to eight sprays of foliage and the capital is left dependent for its effect on the bold position of the figures in referring to the figures on the octagonal capitals i shall call the outer side fronting either the sea or the piazzetta the first side and so count round from left to right the fourth side being thus of course the innermost as however the first five arches were walled up after the great fire only three sides of their capitals are left visible which we may describe as the front and the eastern and western sides of each  section xlvi first capital ie of the pilaster at the vine angle  in front towards the sea a child holding a bird before him with its wings expanded covering his breast  on its eastern side childrens heads among leaves  on its western side a child carrying in one hand a comb in the other a pair of scissors  it appears curious that this the principal pilaster of the fa√ßade should have been decorated only by these graceful grotesques for i can hardly suppose them anything more there may be meaning in them but i will not venture to conjecture any except the very plain and practical meaning conveyed by the last figure to all venetian children which it would be well if they would act upon for the rest i have seen the comb introduced in grotesque work as early as the thirteenth century but generally for the purpose of ridiculing too great care in dressing the hair which assuredly is not its purpose here the childrens heads are very sweet and full of life but the eyes sharp and small  section xlvii second capital only three sides of the original work are left unburied by the mass of added wall each side has a bird one webfooted with a fish one clawed with a serpent which opens its jaws and darts its tongue at the birds breast the third pluming itself with a feather between the mandibles of its bill it is by far the most beautiful of the three capitals decorated with birds  third capital also has three sides only left they have three heads large and very ill cut one female and crowned  fourth capital has three children the eastern one is defaced the one in front holds a small bird whose plumage is beautifully indicated in its right hand and with its left holds up half a walnut showing the nut inside the third holds a fresh fig cut through showing the seeds  the hair of all the three children is differently worked the first has luxuriant flowing hair and a double chin the second light flowing hair falling in pointed locks on the forehead the third crisp curling hair deep cut with drill holes  this capital has been copied on the renaissance side of the palace only with such changes in the ideal of the children as the workman thought expedient and natural it is highly interesting to compare the child of the fourteenth with the child of the fifteenth century the early heads are full of youthful life playful humane affectionate beaming with sensation and vivacity but with much manliness and firmness also not a little cunning and some cruelty perhaps beneath all the features small and hard and the eyes keen there is the making of rough and great men in them but the children of the fifteenth century are dull smoothfaced dunces without a single meaning line in the fatness of their stolid cheeks and although in the vulgar sense as handsome as the other children are ugly capable of becoming nothing but perfumed coxcombs  fifth capital still three sides only left bearing three halflength statues of kings this is the first capital which bears any inscription in front a king with a sword in his right hand points to a handkerchief embroidered and fringed with a head on it carved on the cavetto of the abacus his name is written above titus vespasian imperator contracted ipat  on eastern side trajanus imperator crowned a sword in right hand and sceptre in left  on western octavianus augustus imperator the oct is broken away he bears a globe in his right hand with mundus pacis upon it a sceptre in his left which i think has terminated in a human figure he has a flowing beard and a singularly high crown the face is much injured but has once been very noble in expression  sixth capital has large male and female heads very coarsely cut hard and bad  section xlviii seventh capital this is the first of the series which is complete the first open arch of the lower arcade being between it and the sixth it begins the representation of the virtues  first side largitas or liberality always distinguished from the higher charity a male figure with his lap full of money which he pours out of his hand the coins are plain circular and smooth there is no attempt to mark device upon them the inscription above is largitas me onorat  in the copy of this design on the twentyfifth capital instead of showering out the gold from his open hand the figure holds it in a plate or salver introduced for the sake of disguising the direct imitation the changes thus made in the renaissance pillars are always injuries  this virtue is the proper opponent of avarice though it does not occur in the systems of orcagna or giotto being included in charity it was a leading virtue with aristotle and the other ancients  section xlix second side constancy not very characteristic an armed man with a sword in his hand inscribed constantia sum nil timens  this virtue is one of the forms of fortitude and giotto therefore sets as the vice opponent to fortitude inconstantia represented as a woman in loose drapery falling from a rolling globe the vision seen in the interpreters house in the pilgrims progress of the man with a very bold countenance who says to him who has the writers inkhorn by his side set down my name is the best personification of the venetian constantia of which i am aware in literature it would be well for us all to consider whether we have yet given the order to the man with the inkhorn set down my name  section l third side discord holding up her finger but needing the inscription above to assure us of her meaning discordia sum discordians in the renaissance copy she is a meek and nunlike person with a veil  she is the at√´ of spencer mother of debate thus described in the fourth book    her face most fowle and filthy was to see    with squinted eyes contrarie wayes intended    and loathly mouth unmeete a mouth to bee    that nought but gall and venim comprehended    and wicked wordes that god and man offended    her lying tongue was in two parts divided    and both the parts did speake and both contended    and as her tongue so was her hart discided    that never thoght one thing but doubly stil was guided  note the fine old meaning of discided cut in two it is a great pity we have lost this powerful expression we might keep determined for the other sense of the word  section li fourth side patience a female figure very expressive and lovely in a hood with her right hand on her breast the left extended inscribed patientia manet mecum  she is one of the principal virtues in all the christian systems a masculine virtue in spenser and beautifully placed as the physician in the house of holinesse the opponent vice impatience is one of the hags who attend the captain of the lusts of the flesh the other being impotence in like manner in the pilgrims progress the opposite of patience is passion but spensers thought is farther carried his two hags impatience and impotence as attendant upon the evil spirit of passion embrace all the phenomena of human conduct down even to the smallest matters according to the adage more haste worse speed  section lii fifth side despair a female figure thrusting a dagger into her throat and tearing her long hair which flows down among the leaves of the capital below her knees one of the finest figures of the series inscribed desperacio m√îs mortis crudelis in the renaissance copy she is totally devoid of expression and appears instead of tearing her hair to be dividing it into long curls on each side  this vice is the proper opposite of hope by giotto she is represented as a woman hanging herself a fiend coming for her soul spensers vision of despair is well known it being indeed currently reported that this part of the faerie queen was the first which drew to it the attention of sir philip sidney  section liii sixth side obedience with her arms folded meek but rude and commonplace looking at a little dog standing on its hind legs and begging with a collar round its neck inscribed obedienti   the rest of the sentence is much defaced but looks like aonoexibeo  i suppose the note of contraction above the final a has disappeared and that the inscription was obedientiam domino exhibeo  this virtue is of course a principal one in the monkish systems represented by giotto at assisi as an angel robed in black placing the finger of his left hand on his mouth and passing the yoke over the head of a franciscan monk kneeling at his feet footnote lord lindsay vol ii p 226  obedience holds a less principal place in spenser we have seen her above associated with the other peculiar virtues of womanhood  section liv seventh side infidelity a man in a turban with a small image in his hand or the image of a child of the inscription nothing but infidelitate    and some fragmentary letters ili cero remain  by giotto infidelity is most nobly symbolized as a woman helmeted the helmet having a broad rim which keeps the light from her eyes she is covered with heavy drapery stands infirmly as if about to fall is bound by a cord round her neck to an image which she carries in her hand and has flames bursting forth at her feet  in spenser infidelity is the saracen knight sans foy        full large of limbe and every joint   he was and cared not for god or man a point  for the part which he sustains in the contest with godly fear or the redcross knight see appendix 2 vol iii  section lv eighth side modesty bearing a pitcher in the renaissance copy a vase like a coffeepot inscribed modestia robuobtineo  i do not find this virtue in any of the italian series except that of venice in spenser she is of course one of those attendant on womanhood but occurs as one of the tenants of the heart of man thus portrayed in the second book    straunge was her tyre and all her garment blew    close rownd about her tuckt with many a plight    upon her fist the bird which shonneth vew                                            and ever and anone with rosy red    the bashfull blood her snowy cheekes did dye    that her became as polisht yvory    which cunning craftesman hand hath overlayd    with fayre vermilion or pure castory  section lvi eighth capital it has no inscriptions and its subjects are not by themselves intelligible but they appear to be typical of the degradation of human instincts  first side a caricature of arion on his dolphin he wears a cap ending in a long proboscislike horn and plays a violin with a curious twitch of the bow and wag of the head very graphically expressed but still without anything approaching to the power of northern grotesque his dolphin has a goodly row of teeth and the waves beat over his back  second side a human figure with curly hair and the legs of a bear the paws laid with great sculptural skill upon the foliage it plays a violin shaped like a guitar with a bent doublestringed bow  third side a figure with a serpents tail and a monstrous head founded on a negro type hollowcheeked largelipped and wearing a cap made of a serpents skin holding a fircone in its hand  fourth side a monstrous figure terminating below in a tortoise it is devouring a gourd which it grasps greedily with both hands it wears a cap ending in a hoofed leg  fifth side a centaur wearing a crested helmet and holding a curved sword  sixth side a knight riding a headless horse and wearing a chain armor with a triangular shield flung behind his back and a twoedged sword  seventh side a figure like that on the fifth wearing a round helmet and with the legs and tail of a horse he bears a long mace with a top like a fircone  eighth side a figure with curly hair and an acorn in its hand ending below in a fish  section lvii ninth capital first side faith she has her left hand on her breast and the cross on her right inscribed fides optima in deo the faith of giotto holds the cross in her right hand in her left a scroll with the apostles creed she treads upon cabalistic books and has a key suspended to her waist spensers faith fidelia is still more spiritual and noble    she was araied all in lilly white   and in her right hand bore a cup of gold   with wine and water fild up to the hight   in which a serpent did himselfe enfold   that horrour made to all that did behold   but she no whitt did chaunge her constant mood   and in her other hand she fast did hold   a booke that was both signd and seald with blood   wherein darke things were writt hard to be understood  section lviii second side fortitude a longbearded man samson tearing open a lions jaw the inscription is illegible and the somewhat vulgar personification appears to belong rather to courage than fortitude on the renaissance copy it is inscribed fortitudo sum virilis the latin word has perhaps been received by the sculptor as merely signifying strength the rest of the perfect idea of this virtue having been given in constantia previously but both these venetian symbols together do not at all approach the idea of fortitude as given generally by giotto and the pisan sculptors clothed with a lions skin knotted about her neck and falling to her feet in deep folds drawing back her right hand with the sword pointed towards her enemy and slightly retired behind her immovable shield which with giotto is square and rested on the ground like a tower covering her up to above her shoulders bearing on it a lion and with broken heads of javelins deeply infixed  among the greeks this is of course one of the principal virtues apt however in their ordinary conception of it to degenerate into mere manliness or courage  section lix third side temperance bearing a pitcher of water and a cup inscription illegible here and on the renaissance copy nearly so temperantia sum inom ls only left in this somewhat vulgar and most frequent conception of this virtue afterwards continually repeated as by sir joshua in his window at newcollege temperance is confused with mere abstinence the opposite of gula or gluttony whereas the greek temperance a truly cardinal virtue is the moderator of all the passions and so represented by giotto who has placed a bridle upon her lips and a sword in her hand the hilt of which she is binding to the scabbard in his system she is opposed among the vices not by gula or gluttony but by ira anger so also the temperance of spenser or sir guyon but with mingling of much sternness    a goodly knight all armd in harnesse meete    that from his head no place appeared to his feete    his carriage was full comely and upright    his countenance demure and temperate    but yett so sterne and terrible in sight    that cheard his friendes and did his foes amate  the temperance of the greeks greek sophrosunae involves the idea of prudence and is a most noble virtue yet properly marked by plato as inferior to sacred enthusiasm though necessary for its government he opposes it under the name mortal temperance or the temperance which is of men to divine madness greek mania or inspiration but he most justly and nobly expresses the general idea of it under the term greek ubris which in the phaedrus is divided into various intemperances with respect to various objects and set forth under the image of a black vicious diseased and furious horse yoked by the side of prudence or wisdom set forth under the figure of a white horse with a crested and noble head like that which we have among the elgin marbles to the chariot of the soul the system of aristotle as above stated is throughout a mere complicated blunder supported by sophistry the laboriously developed mistake of temperance for the essence of the virtues which it guides temperance in the mediaeval systems is generally opposed by anger or by folly or gluttony but her proper opposite is spensers acrasia the principal enemy of sir guyon at whose gates we find the subordinate vice excesse as the introduction to intemperance a graceful and feminine image necessary to illustrate the more dangerous forms of subtle intemperance as opposed to the brutal gluttony in the first book she presses grapes into a cup because of the words of st paul be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but always delicately    into her cup she scruzd with daintie breach    of her fine fingers without fowle empeach    that so faire winepresse made the wine more sweet  the reader will i trust pardon these frequent extracts from spenser for it is nearly as necessary to point out the profound divinity and philosophy of our great english poet as the beauty of the ducal palace  section lx fourth side humility with a veil upon her head carrying a lamp in her lap inscribed in the copy humilitas habitat in me  this virtue is of course a peculiarly christian one hardly recognized in the pagan systems though carefully impressed upon the greeks in early life in a manner which at this day it would be well if we were to imitate and together with an almost feminine modesty giving an exquisite grace to the conduct and bearing of the welleducated greek youth it is of course one of the leading virtues in all the monkish systems but i have not any notes of the manner of its representation  section lxi fifth side charity a woman with her lap full of loaves  giving one to a child who stretches his arm out for it across a broad gap in the leafage of the capital  again very far inferior to the giottesque rendering of this virtue in the arena chapel she is distinguished from all the other virtues by having a circular glory round her head and a cross of fire she is crowned with flowers presents with her right hand a vase of corn and fruit and with her left receives treasure from christ who appears above her to provide her with the means of continual offices of beneficence while she tramples under foot the treasures of the earth  the peculiar beauty of most of the italian conceptions of charity is in the subjection of mere munificence to the glowing of her love always represented by flames here in the form of a cross round her head in orcagnas shrine at florence issuing from a censer in her hand and with dante inflaming her whole form so that in a furnace of clear fire she could not have been discerned  spenser represents her as a mother surrounded by happy children an idea afterwards grievously hackneyed and vulgarized by english painters and sculptors  section lxii sixth side justice crowned and with sword inscribed in the copy rex sum justicie  this idea was afterwards much amplified and adorned in the only good capital of the renaissance series under the judgment angle giotto has also given his whole strength to the painting of this virtue representing her as enthroned under a noble gothic canopy holding scales not by the beam but one in each hand a beautiful idea showing that the equality of the scales of justice is not owing to natural laws but to her own immediate weighing the opposed causes in her own hands in one scale is an executioner beheading a criminal in the other an angel crowning a man who seems in selvaticos plate to have been working at a desk or table  beneath her feet is a small predella representing various persons riding securely in the woods and others dancing to the sound of music  spensers justice sir artegall is the hero of an entire book and the betrothed knight of britomart or chastity  section lxiii seventh side prudence a man with a book and a pair of compasses wearing the noble cap hanging down towards the shoulder and bound in a fillet round the brow which occurs so frequently during the fourteenth century in italy in the portraits of men occupied in any civil capacity  this virtue is as we have seen conceived under very different degrees of dignity from mere worldly prudence up to heavenly wisdom being opposed sometimes by stultitia sometimes by ignorantia i do not find in any of the representations of her that her truly distinctive character namely forethought is enough insisted upon giotto expresses her vigilance and just measurement or estimate of all things by painting her as janusheaded and gazing into a convex mirror with compasses in her right hand the convex mirror showing her power of looking at many things in small compass but forethought or anticipation by which independently of greater or less natural capacities one man becomes more prudent than another is never enough considered or symbolized  the idea of this virtue oscillates in the greek systems between temperance and heavenly wisdom  section lxiv eighth side hope a figure full of devotional expression holding up its hands as in prayer and looking to a hand which is extended towards it out of sunbeams in the renaissance copy this hand does not appear  of all the virtues this is the most distinctively christian it could not of course enter definitely into any pagan scheme and above all others it seems to me the testing virtuethat by the possession of which we may most certainly determine whether we are christians or not for many men have charity that is to say general kindness of heart or even a kind of faith who have not any habitual hope of or longing for heaven the hope of giotto is represented as winged rising in the air while an angel holds a crown before her i do not know if spenser was the first to introduce our marine virtue leaning on an anchor a symbol as inaccurate as it is vulgar for in the first place anchors are not for men but for ships and in the second anchorage is the characteristic not of hope but of faith faith is dependent but hope is aspirant spenser however introduces hope twicethe first time as the virtue with the anchor but afterwards fallacious hope far more beautifully in the masque of cupid    she always smyld and in her hand did hold    an holywater sprinckle dipt in deowe  section lxv tenth capital first side luxury the opposite of chastity as above explained a woman with a jewelled chain across her forehead smiling as she looks into a mirror exposing her breast by drawing down her dress with one hand inscribed luxuria sum imensa  these subordinate forms of vice are not met with so frequently in art as those of the opposite virtues but in spenser we find them all his luxury rides upon a goat    in a greene gowne he clothed was full faire    which underneath did hide his filthinesse    and in his hand a burning heart he bare  but in fact the proper and comprehensive expression of this vice is the cupid of the ancients and there is not any minor circumstance more indicative of the intense difference between the mediaeval and the renaissance spirit than the mode in which this god is represented  i have above said that all great european art is rooted in the thirteenth century and it seems to me that there is a kind of central year about which we may consider the energy of the middle ages to be gathered a kind of focus of time which by what is to my mind a most touching and impressive divine appointment has been marked for us by the greatest writer of the middle ages in the first words he utters namely the year 1300 the mezzo del cammin of the life of dante now therefore to giotto the contemporary of dante and who drew dantes still existing portrait in this very year 1300 we may always look for the central mediaeval idea in any subject and observe how he represents cupid as one of three a terrible trinity his companions being satan and death and he himself a lean scarecrow with bow quiver and fillet and feet ending in claws footnote lord lindsay vol ii letter iv thrust down into hell by penance from the presence of purity and fortitude spenser who has been so often noticed as furnishing the exactly intermediate type of conception between the mediaeval and the renaissance indeed represents cupid under the form of a beautiful winged god and riding on a lion but still no plaything of the graces but full of terror    with that the darts which his right hand did straine    full dreadfully he shooke that all did quake    and clapt on hye his coloured winges twaine    that all his many it afraide did make  his many that is to say his company and observe what a company it is before him go fancy desire doubt danger fear fallacious hope dissemblance suspicion grief fury displeasure despite and cruelty after him reproach repentance shame    unquiet care and fond unthriftyhead    lewd losse of time and sorrow seeming dead    inconstant chaunge and false disloyalty    consuming riotise and guilty dread    of heavenly vengeaunce faint infirmity    vile poverty and lastly death with infamy  compare these two pictures of cupid with the lovegod of the renaissance as he is represented to this day confused with angels in every faded form of ornament and allegory in our furniture our literature and our minds  section lxvi second side gluttony a woman in a turban with a jewelled cup in her right hand in her left the clawed limb of a bird which she is gnawing inscribed gula sine ordine sum  spensers gluttony is more than usually fine    his belly was upblownt with luxury    and eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne    and like a crane his necke was long and fyne    wherewith he swallowed up excessive feast    for want whereof poore people oft did pyne  he rides upon a swine and is clad in vineleaves with a garland of ivy compare the account of excesse above as opposed to temperance  section lxvii third side pride a knight with a heavy and stupid face holding a sword with three edges his armor covered with ornaments in the form of roses and with two ears attached to his helmet the inscription indecipherable all but superbia  spenser has analyzed this vice with great care he first represents it as the pride of life that is to say the pride which runs in a deep undercurrent through all the thoughts and acts of men as such it is a feminine vice directly opposed to holiness and mistress of a castle called the house of pryde and her chariot is driven by satan with a team of beasts ridden by the mortal sins in the throne chamber of her palace she is thus described    so proud she shyned in her princely state    looking to heaven for earth she did disdayne    and sitting high for lowly she did hate    lo underneath her scornefull feete was layne    a dreadfull dragon with an hideous trayne    and in her hand she held a mirrhour bright    wherein her face she often vewed fayne  the giant orgoglio is a baser species of pride born of the earth and eolus that is to say of sensual and vain conceits his fosterfather and the keeper of his castle is ignorance book i canto viii  finally disdain is introduced in other places as the form of pride which vents itself in insult to others  section lxviii fourth side anger a woman tearing her dress open at her breast inscription here undecipherable but in the renaissance copy it is ira crudelis est in me  giotto represents this vice under the same symbol but it is the weakest of all the figures in the arena chapel the wrath of spenser rides upon a lion brandishing a firebrand his garments stained with blood rage or furor occurs subordinately in other places it appears to me very strange that neither giotto nor spenser should have given any representation of the restrained anger which is infinitely the most terrible both of them make him violent  section lxix fifth side avarice an old woman with a veil over her forehead and a bag of money in each hand a figure very marvellous for power of expression the throat is all made up of sinews with skinny channels deep between them strained as by anxiety and wasted by famine the features hungerbitten the eyes hollow the look glaring and intense yet without the slightest caricature inscribed in the renaissance copy avaritia impletor  spensers avarice the vice is much feebler than this but the god mammon and his kingdom have been described by him with his usual power note the position of the house of richesse    betwixt them both was but a little stride   that did the house of richesse from hellmouth divide  it is curious that most moralists confuse avarice with covetousness although they are vices totally different in their operation on the human heart and on the frame of society the love of money the sin of judas and ananias is indeed the root of all evil in the hardening of the heart but covetousness which is idolatry the sin of ahab that is the inordinate desire of some seen or recognized goodthus destroying peace of mindis probably productive of much more misery in heart and error in conduct than avarice itself only covetousness is not so inconsistent with christianity for covetousness may partly proceed from vividness of the affections and hopes as in david and be consistent with much charity not so avarice  section lxx sixth side idleness accidia a figure much broken away having had its arms round two branches of trees  i do not know why idleness should be represented as among trees unless in the italy of the fourteenth century forest country was considered as desert and therefore the domain of idleness spenser fastens this vice especially upon the clergy    upon a slouthfull asse he chose to ryde   arayd in habit blacke and amis thin   like to an holy monck the service to begin   and in his hand his portesse still he bare   that much was worne but therein little redd  and he properly makes him the leader of the train of the vices    may seem the wayne was very evil ledd   when such an one had guiding of the way  observe that subtle touch of truth in the wearing of the portesse indicating the abuse of books by idle readers so thoroughly characteristic of unwilling studentship from the schoolboy upwards  section lxxi seventh side vanity she is smiling complacently as she looks into a mirror in her lap her robe is embroidered with roses and roses form her crown undecipherable  there is some confusion in the expression of this vice between pride in the personal appearance and lightness of purpose the word vanitas generally i think bears in the mediaeval period the sense given it in scripture let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompense vanity of vanities the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain it is difficult to find this sinwhich after pride is the most universal perhaps the most fatal of all fretting the whole depth of our humanity into storm to waft a feather or to drown a flydefinitely expressed in art even spenser i think has only partially expressed it under the figure of phaedria more properly idle mirth in the second book the idea is however entirely worked out in the vanity fair of the pilgrims progress  section lxxii eighth side envy one of the noblest pieces of expression in the series she is pointing malignantly with her finger a serpent is wreathed about her head like a cap another forms the girdle of her waist and a dragon rests in her lap  giotto has however represented her with still greater subtlety as having her fingers terminating in claws and raising her right hand with an expression partly of impotent regret partly of involuntary grasping a serpent issuing from her mouth is about to bite her between the eyes she has long membranous ears horns on her head and flames consuming her body the envy of spenser is only inferior to that of giotto because the idea of folly and quickness of hearing is not suggested by the size of the ear in other respects it is even finer joining the idea of fury in the wolf on which he rides with that of corruption on his lips and of discoloration or distortion in the whole mind                        malicious envy rode   upon a ravenous wolfe and still did chaw   between his cankred teeth avenemous tode   that all the poison ran about his jaw   and in a kirtle of discolourd say   he clothed was ypaynted full of eies   and in his bosome secretly there lay   an hatefull snake the which his taile uptyes   in many folds and mortali sting implyes  he has developed the idea in more detail and still more loathsomely in the twelfth canto of the fifth book  section lxxiii eleventh capital its decoration is composed of eight birds arranged as shown in plate v of the seven lamps which however was sketched from the renaissance copy these birds are all varied in form and action but not so as to require special description  section lxxiv twelfth capital this has been very interesting but is grievously defaced four of its figures being entirely broken away and the character of two others quite undecipherable it is fortunate that it has been copied in the thirtythird capital of the renaissance series from which we are able to identify the lost figures  first side misery a man with a wan face seemingly pleading with a child who has its hands crossed on its breast there is a buckle at his own breast in the shape of a cloven heart inscribed miseria  the intention of this figure is not altogether apparent as it is by no means treated as a vice the distress seeming real and like that of a parent in poverty mourning over his child yet it seems placed here as in direct opposition to the virtue of cheerfulness which follows next in order rather however i believe with the intention of illustrating human life than the character of the vice which as we have seen dante placed in the circle of hell the word in that case would i think have been tristitia the unholy griefe of spenser           all in sable sorrowfully clad   downe hanging his dull head with heavy chere                                         a pair of pincers in his hand he had   with which he pinched people to the heart  he has farther amplified the idea under another figure in the fifth canto of the fourth book    his name was care a blacksmith by his trade    that neither day nor night from working spared    but to small purpose yron wedges made    those be unquiet thoughts that carefull minds invade     rude was his garment and to rags all rent    ne better had he ne for better cared    with blistered hands among the cinders brent  it is to be noticed however that in the renaissance copy this figure is stated to be not miseria but misericordia the contraction is a very moderate one misericordia being in old ms written always as mia if this reading be right the figure is placed here rather as the companion than the opposite of cheerfulness unless indeed it is intended to unite the idea of mercy and compassion with that of sacred sorrow  section lxxv second side cheerfulness a woman with long flowing hair crowned with roses playing on a tambourine and with open lips as singing inscribed alacritas  we have already met with this virtue among those especially set by spenser to attend on womanhood it is inscribed in the renaissance copy alachritas chanit mecum note the gutturals of the rich and fully developed venetian dialect now affecting the latin which is free from them in the earlier capitals  section lxxvi third side destroyed but from the copy we find it has been stultitia folly and it is there represented simply as a man riding a sculpture worth the consideration of the english residents who bring their horses to venice giotto gives stultitia a feather cap and club in early manuscripts he is always eating with one hand and striking with the other in later ones he has a cap and bells or cap crested with a cocks head whence the word coxcomb  section lxxvii fourth side destroyed all but a book which identifies it with the celestial chastity of the renaissance copy there represented as a woman pointing to a book connecting the convent life with the pursuit of literature  spensers chastity britomart is the most exquisitely wrought of all his characters but as before noticed she is not the chastity of the convent but of wedded life  section lxxviii fifth side only a scroll is left but from the copy we find it has been honesty or truth inscribed honestatem diligo it is very curious that among all the christian systems of the virtues which we have examined we should find this one in venice only  the truth of spenser una is after chastity the most exquisite character in the faerie queen  section lxxix sixth side falsehood an old woman leaning on a crutch and inscribed in the copy falsitas in me semper est the fidessa of spenser the great enemy of una or truth is far more subtly conceived probably not without special reference to the papal deceits in her true form she is a loathsome hag but in her outward aspect    a goodly lady clad in scarlet red    purfled with gold and pearle    her wanton palfrey all was overspred    with tinsell trappings woven like a wave    whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses brave  dantes fraud geryon is the finest personification of all but the description inferno canto xvii is too long to be quoted  section lxxx seventh side injustice an armed figure holding a halbert so also in the copy the figure used by giotto with the particular intention of representing unjust government is represented at the gate of an embattled castle in a forest between rocks while various deeds of violence are committed at his feet spensers adicia is a furious hag at last transformed into a tiger  eighth side a man with a dagger looking sorrowfully at a child who turns its back to him i cannot understand this figure it is inscribed in the copy astinecia abstinentia opitima  section lxxxi thirteenth capital it has lions heads all round coarsely cut  fourteenth capital it has various animals each sitting on its haunches three dogs one a greyhound one longhaired one shorthaired with bells about its neck two monkeys one with fanshaped hair projecting on each side of its face a noble boar with its tusks hoofs and bristles sharply cut and a lion and lioness  section lxxxii fifteenth capital the pillar to which it belongs is thicker than the rest as well as the one over it in the upper arcade  the sculpture of this capital is also much coarser and seems to me later than that of the rest and it has no inscription which is embarrassing as its subjects have had much meaning but i believe selvatico is right in supposing it to have been intended for a general illustration of idleness  first side a woman with a distaff her girdle richly decorated and fastened by a buckle  second side a youth in a long mantle with a rose in his hand  third side a woman in a turban stroking a puppy which she holds by the haunches  fourth side a man with a parrot  fifth side a woman in very rich costume with braided hair and dress thrown into minute folds holding a rosary  in her left hand her right on her breast  sixth side a man with a very thoughtful face laying his hand upon the leaves of the capital  seventh side a crowned lady with a rose in her hand  eighth side a boy with a ball in his left hand and his right laid on his breast  section lxxxiii sixteenth capital it is decorated with eight large heads partly intended to be grotesque footnote selvatico states that these are intended to be representative of eight nations latins tartars turks hungarians greeks goths egyptians and persians either the inscriptions are now defaced or i have carelessly omitted to note them and very coarse and bad except only that in the sixth side which is totally different from all the rest and looks like a portrait it is thin thoughtful and dignified thoroughly fine in every way it wears a cap surmounted by two winged lions and therefore i think selvatico must have inaccurately written the list given in the note for this head is certainly meant to express the superiority of the venetian character over that of other nations nothing is more remarkable in all early sculpture than its appreciation of the signs of dignity of character in the features and the way in which it can exalt the principal figure in any subject by a few touches  section lxxxiv seventeenth capital this has been so destroyed by the sea wind which sweeps at this point of the arcade round the angle of the palace that its inscriptions are no longer legible and great part of its figures are gone selvatico states them as follows solomon the wise priscian the grammarian aristotle the logician tully the orator pythagoras the philosopher archimedes the mechanic orpheus the musician ptolemy the astronomer the fragments actually remaining are the following  first side a figure with two books in a robe richly decorated with circles of roses inscribed salomon sap iens  second side a man with one book poring over it he has had a long stick or reed in his hand of inscription only the letters grammatic remain  third side aristotle so inscribed he has a peaked double beard and a flat cap from under which his long hair falls down his back  fourth side destroyed  fifth side destroyed all but a board with three counters on it  sixth side a figure with compasses inscribed geomet    seventh side nothing is left but a guitar with its handle wrought into a lions head  eighth side destroyed  section lxxxv we have now arrived at the eighteenth capital the most interesting and beautiful of the palace it represents the planets and the sun and moon in those divisions of the zodiac known to astrologers as their houses and perhaps indicates by the position in which they are placed the period of the year at which this great cornerstone was laid the inscriptions above have been in quaint latin rhyme but are now decipherable only in fragments and that with the more difficulty because the rusty iron bar that binds the abacus has broken away in its expansion nearly all the upper portions of the stone and with them the signs of contraction which are of great importance i shall give the fragments of them that i could decipher first as the letters actually stand putting those of which i am doubtful in brackets with a note of interrogation and then as i would read them  section lxxxvi it should be premised that in modern astrology the houses of the planets are thus arranged  the house of the sun      is leo                 moon       cancer                 mars       aries and scorpio                 venus      taurus and libra                 mercury    gemini and virgo                 jupiter    sagittarius and pisces                 saturn     capricorn                 herschel   aquarius  the herschel planet being of course unknown to the old astrologers we have only the other six planetary powers together with the sun and aquarius is assigned to saturn as his house i could not find capricorn at all but this sign may have been broken away as the whole capital is grievously defaced the eighth side of the capital which the herschel planet would now have occupied bears a sculpture of the creation of man it is the most conspicuous side the one set diagonally across the angle or the eighth in our usual mode of reading the capitals from which i shall not depart  section lxxxvii the first side then or that towards the sea has aquarius as the house of saturn represented as a seated figure beautifully draped pouring a stream of water out of an amphora over the leaves of the capital his inscription is  et saturne domus eclocerunt is 7bre  section lxxxviii second side jupiter in his houses sagittarius and pisces represented throned with an upper dress disposed in radiating folds about his neck and hanging down upon his breast ornamented by small pendent trefoiled studs or bosses he wears the drooping bonnet and long gloves but the folds about the neck shot forth to express the rays of the star are the most remarkable characteristic of the figure he raises his sceptre in his left hand over sagittarius represented as the centaur chiron and holds two thunnies in his right something rough like a third fish has been broken away below them the more easily because this part of the group is entirely undercut and the two fish glitter in the light relieved on the deep gloom below the leaves the inscription is  inde jovi dona pises simul atq cirona footnote the comma in these inscriptions stands for a small cuneiform mark i believe of contraction and the small for a zigzag mark of the same kind the dots or periods are similarly marked on the stone  or   inde jovis dona    pisces simul atque chirona  domus is i suppose to be understood before jovis then the house of jupiter gives or governs the fishes and chiron  section lxxxix third side mars in his houses aries and scorpio represented as a very ugly knight in chain mail seated sideways on the ram whose horns are broken away and having a large scorpion in his left hand whose tail is broken also to the infinite injury of the group for it seems to have curled across to the angle leaf and formed a bright line of light like the fish in the hand of jupiter the knight carries a shield on which fire and water are sculptured and bears a banner upon his lance with the word deferosum which puzzled me for some time it should be read i believe de ferro sum which would be good venetian latin for i am of iron  section xc fourth side the sun in his house leo represented under the figure of apollo sitting on the lion with rays shooting from his head and the world in his hand the inscription  tu es domu solis quo signe leoni  i believe the first phrase is tune est domus solis but there is a letter gone after the quo and i have no idea what case of signum signe stands for  section xci fifth side venus in her houses taurus and libra the most beautiful figure of the series she sits upon the bull who is deep in the dewlap and better cut than most of the animals holding a mirror in her right hand and the scales in her left her breast is very nobly and tenderly indicated under the folds of her drapery which is exquisitely studied in its fall what is left of the inscription runs  libra cum tauro domus    purior aur  section xcii sixth side mercury represented as wearing a pendent cap and holding a book he is supported by three children in reclining attitudes representing his houses gemini and virgo but i cannot understand the inscription though more than usually legible  occupat erigone stibons geminuq lagone  section xciii seventh side the moon in her house cancer this sculpture which is turned towards the piazzetta is the most picturesque of the series the moon is represented as a woman in a boat upon the sea who raises the crescent in her right hand and with her left draws a crab out of the waves up the boats side the moon was i believe represented in egyptian sculptures as in a boat but i rather think the venetian was not aware of this and that he meant to express the peculiar sweetness of the moonlight at venice as seen across the lagoons whether this was intended by putting the planet in the boat may be questionable but assuredly the idea was meant to be conveyed by the dress of the figure for all the draperies of the other figures on this capital as well as on the rest of the fa√ßade are disposed in severe but full folds showing little of the forms beneath them but the moons drapery ripples down to her feet so as exactly to suggest the trembling of the moonlight on the waves this beautiful idea is highly characteristic of the thoughtfulness of the early sculptors five hundred men may be now found who could have cut the drapery as such far better for one who would have disposed its folds with this intention the inscription is  lune cancer domu t pbet iorbe signoru  section xciv eighth side god creating man represented as a throned figure with a glory round the head laying his left hand on the head of a naked youth and sustaining him with his right hand the inscription puzzled me for a long time but except the lost r and m of formavit and a letter quite undefaced but to me unintelligble before the word eva in the shape of a figure of 7 i have safely ascertained the rest  delimo dsada deco stafo   avit7eva  or     de limo dominus adam de costa form avit evam   from the dust the lord made adam and from the rib eve  i imagine the whole of this capital thereforethe principal one of the old palaceto have been intended to signify first the formation of the planets for the service of man upon the earth secondly the entire subjection of the fates and fortune of man to the will of god as determined from the time when the earth and stars were made and in fact written in the volume of the stars themselves  thus interpreted the doctrines of judicial astrology were not only consistent with but an aid to the most spiritual and humble christianity  in the workmanship and grouping of its foliage this capital is on the whole the finest i know in europe the sculptor has put his whole strength into it i trust that it will appear among the other venetian casts lately taken for the crystal palace but if not i have myself cast all its figures and two of its leaves and i intend to give drawings of them on a large scale in my folio work  section xcv nineteenth capital this is of course the second counting from the sea on the piazzetta side of the palace calling that of the figtree angle the first  it is the most important capital as a piece of evidence in point of dates in the whole palace great pains have been taken with it and in some portion of the accompanying furniture or ornaments of each of its figures a small piece of colored marble has been inlaid with peculiar significance for the capital represents the arts of sculpture and architecture and the inlaying of the colored stones which are far too small to be effective at a distance and are found in this one capital only of the whole series is merely an expression of the architects feeling of the essential importance of this art of inlaying and of the value of color generally in his own art  section xcvi first side st simplicius so inscribed a figure working with a pointed chisel on a small oblong block of green serpentine about four inches long by one wide inlaid in the capital the chisel is of course in the left hand but the right is held up open with the palm outwards  second side a crowned figure carving the image of a child on a small statue with a ground of red marble the sculptured figure is highly finished and is in type of head much like the ham or japheth at the vine angle inscription effaced  third side an old man uncrowned but with curling hair at work on a small column with its capital complete and a little shaft of dark red marble spotted with paler red the capital is precisely of the form of that found in the palace of the tiepolos and the other thirteenth century work of venice this one figure would be quite enough without any other evidence whatever to determine the date of this flank of the ducal palace as not later at all events than the first half of the fourteenth century its inscription is broken away all but disipulo  fourth side a crowned figure but the object on which it has been working is broken away and all the inscription except st enas  fifth side a man with a turban and a sharp chisel at work on a kind of panel or niche the back of which is of red marble  sixth side a crowned figure with hammer and chisel employed on a little range of windows of the fifth order having roses set instead of orbicular ornaments between the spandrils with a rich cornice and a band of marble inserted above this sculpture assures us of the date of the fifth order window which it shows to have been universal in the early fourteenth century  there are also five arches in the block on which the sculptor is working marking the frequency of the number five in the window groups of the time  seventh side a figure at work on a pilaster with lombardic thirteenth century capital for account of the series of forms in venetian capitals see the final appendix of the next volume the shaft of dark red spotted marble  eighth side a figure with a rich open crown working on a delicate recumbent statue the head of which is laid on a pillow covered with a rich chequer pattern the whole supported on a block of dark red marble inscription broken away all but st sym symmachus tv   anvs there appear therefore altogether to have been five saints two of them popes if simplicius is the pope of that name three in front two on the fourth and sixth sides alternating with the three uncrowned workmen in the manual labor of sculpture i did not therefore insult our present architects in saying above that they ought to work in the masons yard with their men it would be difficult to find a more interesting expression of the devotional spirit in which all great work was undertaken at this time  section xcvii twentieth capital it is adorned with heads of animals and is the finest of the whole series in the broad massiveness of its effect so simply characteristic indeed of the grandeur of style in the entire building that i chose it for the first plate in my folio work in spite of the sternness of its plan however it is wrought with great care in surface detail and the ornamental value of the minute chasing obtained by the delicate plumage of the birds and the clustered bees on the honeycomb in the bears mouth opposed to the strong simplicity of its general form cannot be too much admired there are also more grace life and variety in the sprays of foliage on each side of it and under the heads than in any other capital of the series though the earliness of the workmanship is marked by considerable hardness and coldness in the larger heads a northern gothic workman better acquainted with bears and wolves than it was possible to become in st marks place would have put far more life into these heads but he could not have composed them more skilfully  section xcviii first side a lion with a stags haunch in his mouth those readers who have the folio plate should observe the peculiar way in which the ear is cut into the shape of a ring jagged or furrowed on the edge an archaic mode of treatment peculiar in the ducal palace to the lions heads of the fourteenth century the moment we reach the renaissance work the lions ears are smooth inscribed simply leo  second side a wolf with a dead bird in his mouth its body wonderfully true in expression of the passiveness of death the feathers are each wrought with a central quill and radiating filaments inscribed lupus  third side a fox not at all like one with a dead cock in his mouth its comb and pendent neck admirably designed so as to fall across the great angle leaf of the capital its tail hanging down on the other side its long straight feathers exquisitely cut inscribed vulpis  fourth side entirely broken away  fifth side aper well tusked with a head of maize in his mouth at least i suppose it to be maize though shaped like a pinecone  sixth side chanis with a bone very ill cut and a baldheaded species of dog with ugly flap ears  seventh side muscipulus with a rat  in his mouth  eighth side ursus with a honeycomb covered with large bees  section xcix twentyfirst capital represents the principal inferior professions  first side an old man with his brow deeply wrinkled and very expressive features beating in a kind of mortar with a hammer inscribed lapicida sum  second side i believe a goldsmith he is striking a small flat bowl or patera on a pointed anvil with a light hammer the inscription is gone  third side a shoemaker with a shoe in his hand and an instrument for cutting leather suspended beside him inscription undecipherable  fourth side much broken a carpenter planing a beam resting on two horizontal logs inscribed carpentarius sum  fifth side a figure shovelling fruit into a tub the latter very carefully carved from what appears to have been an excellent piece of cooperage two thin laths cross each other over the top of it the inscription now lost was according to selvatico mensurator  sixth side a man with a large hoe breaking the ground which lies in irregular furrows and clods before him now undecipherable but according to selvatico agrichola  seventh side a man in a pendent cap writing on a large scroll which falls over his knee inscribed notarius sum  eighth side a man forging a sword or scytheblade he wears a large skullcap beats with a large hammer on a solid anvil and is inscribed faber sum  section c twentysecond capital the ages of man and the influence of the planets on human life  first side the moon governing infancy for four years according to selvatico i have no note of this side having i suppose been prevented from raising the ladder against it by some fruitstall or other impediment in the regular course of my examination and then forgotten to return to it  second side a child with a tablet and an alphabet inscribed on it the legend above is  mecureu dnt puericie pan x  or mercurius dominatur puerilite per annos x selvatico reads vii mercury governs boyhood for ten or seven years  third side an older youth with another tablet but broken inscribed  adoloscencie    p an vii  selvatico misses this side altogether as i did the first so that the lost planet is irrecoverable as the inscription is now defaced note the o for e in adolescentia so also we constantly find u for o showing together with much other incontestable evidence of the same kind how full and deep the old pronunciation of latin always remained and how ridiculous our english mincing of the vowels would have sounded to a roman ear  fourth side a youth with a hawk on his fist  iuventuti dnt sol p an xix the sue governs youth for nineteen years  fifth side a man sitting helmed with a sword over his shoulder inscribed  senectuti dnt mars p an xv mars governs manhood for fifteen years  sixth side a very graceful and serene figure in the pendent cap reading  senicie dnt jupiter p ann xii jupiter governs age for twelve years  seventh side an old man in a skullcap praying  decrepite dnt satn uq admote saturnus usque ad mortem saturn governs decrepitude until death  eighth side the dead body lying on a mattress  ultima est mors pena peccati last comes death the penalty of sin  section ci shakespeares seven ages are of course merely the expression of this early and wellknown system he has deprived the dotage of its devotion but i think wisely as the italian system would imply that devotion was or should be always delayed until dotage  twentythird capital i agree with selvatico in thinking this has been restored it is decorated with large and vulgar heads  section cii twentyfourth capital this belongs to the large shaft which sustains the great party wall of the sala del gran consiglio the shaft is thicker than the rest but the capital though ancient is coarse and somewhat inferior in design to the others of the series it represents the history of marriage the lover first seeing his mistress at a window then addressing her bringing her presents then the bridal the birth and the death of a child but i have not been able to examine these sculptures properly because the pillar is encumbered by the railing which surrounds the two guns set before the austrian guardhouse  section ciii twentyfifth capital we have here the employments of the months with which we are already tolerably acquainted there are however one or two varieties worth noticing in this series  first side march sitting triumphantly in a rich dress as the beginning of the year  second side april and may april with a lamb may with a feather fan in her hand  third side june carrying cherries in a basket  i did not give this series with the others in the previous chapter because this representation of june is peculiarly venetian it is called the month of cherries mese delle ceriese in the popular rhyme on the conspiracy of tiepolo quoted above vol i  the cherries principally grown near venice are of a deep red color and large but not of high flavor though refreshing they are carved upon the pillar with great care all their stalks undercut  fourth side july and august the first reaping the leaves of the straw being given shooting out from the tubular stalk august opposite beats the grain in a basket  fifth side september a woman standing in a winetub and holding a branch of vine very beautiful  sixth side october and november i could not make out their occupation they seem to be roasting or boiling some root over a fire  seventh side december killing pigs as usual  eighth side january warming his feet and february frying fish this last employment is again as characteristic of the venetian winter as the cherries are of the venetian summer  the inscriptions are undecipherable except a few letters here and there and the words marcius aprilis and februarius  this is the last of the capitals of the early palace the next or twentysixth capital is the first of those executed in the fifteenth century under foscari and hence to the judgment angle the traveller has nothing to do but to compare the base copies of the earlier work with their originals or to observe the total want of invention in the renaissance sculptor wherever he has depended on his own resources this however always with the exception of the twentyseventh and of the last capital which are both fine  i shall merely enumerate the subjects and point out the plagiarisms of these capitals as they are not worth description  section civ twentysixth capital copied from the fifteenth merely changing the succession of the figures  twentyseventh capital i think it possible that this may be part of the old work displaced in joining the new palace with the old at all events it is well designed though a little coarse it represents eight different kinds of fruit each in a basket the characters well given and groups well arranged but without much care or finish the names are inscribed above though somewhat unnecessarily and with certainly as much disrespect to the beholders intelligence as the sculptors art namely zerexis piri chucumeris persici zuche moloni fici huva zerexis cherries and zuche gourds both begin with the same letter whether meant for z s or c i am not sure the zuche are the common gourds divided into two protuberances one larger than the other like a bottle compressed near the neck and the moloni are the long watermelons which roasted form a staple food of the venetians to this day  section cv twentyeighth capital copied from the seventh  twentyninth capital copied from the ninth  thirtieth capital copied from the tenth the accidia is noticeable as having the inscription complete accidia me stringit and the luxuria for its utter want of expression having a severe and calm face a robe up to the neck and her hand upon her breast the inscription is also different luxuria sum stercs  inferi  thirtyfirst capital copied from the eighth  thirtysecond capital has no inscription only fully robed figures laying their hands without any meaning on their own shoulders heads or chins or on the leaves around them  thirtythird capital copied from the twelfth  thirtyfourth capital copied from the eleventh  thirtyfifth capital has children with birds or fruit pretty in features and utterly inexpressive like the cherubs of the eighteenth century  section cvi thirtysixth capital this is the last of the piazzetta fa√ßade the elaborate one under the judgment angle its foliage is copied from the eighteenth at the opposite side with an endeavor on the part of the renaissance sculptor to refine upon it by which he has merely lost some of its truth and force this capital will however be always thought at first the most beautiful of the whole series and indeed it is very noble its groups of figures most carefully studied very graceful and much more pleasing than those of the earlier work though with less real power in them and its foliage is only inferior to that of the magnificent figtree angle it represents on its front or first side justice enthroned seated on two lions and on the seven other sides examples of acts of justice or good government or figures of lawgivers in the following order  second side aristotle with two pupils giving laws inscribed  aristot   che die lege aristotle who declares laws  third side i have mislaid my note of this side selvatico and lazari call it isidore  footnote can they have mistaken the isipione of the fifth side for the word isidore  fourth side solon with his pupils inscribed  salo uno dei sete savi di grecia che die lege solon one of the seven sages of greece who declares laws  note by the by the pure venetian dialect used in this capital instead of the latin in the more ancient ones one of the seated pupils in this sculpture is remarkably beautiful in the sweep of his flowing drapery  fifth side the chastity of scipio inscribed  isipione a chastita ch    e la fia e la figlia   are  a soldier in a plumed bonnet presents a kneeling maiden to the seated scipio who turns thoughtfully away  sixth side numa pompilius building churches  numa pompilio imperador edifichador di tempi e chiese  numa in a kind of hat with a crown above it directing a soldier in roman armor note this as contrasted with the mail of the earlier capitals they point to a tower of three stories filled with tracery  seventh side moses receiving the law inscribed  quando mose receve la lece i sul monte  moses kneels on a rock whence springs a beautifully fancied tree with clusters of three berries in the centre of the three leaves sharp and quaint like fine northern gothic the half figure of the deity comes out of the abacus the arm meeting that of moses both at full stretch with the stone tablets between  eighth side trajan doing justice to the widow  trajano imperador che fa justitia a la vedova  he is riding spiritedly his mantle blown out behind the widow kneeling before his horse  section cvii the reader will observe that this capital is of peculiar interest in its relation to the much disputed question of the character of the later government of venice it is the assertion by that government of its belief that justice only could be the foundation of its stability as these stones of justice and judgment are the foundation of its halls of council and this profession of their faith may be interpreted in two ways most modern historians would call it in common with the continual reference to the principles of justice in the political and judicial language of the period footnote compare the speech of the doge mocenigo abovefirst justice and then the interests of the state and see vol iii chap ii section lix nothing more than a cloak for consummate violence and guilt and it may easily be proved to have been so in myriads of instances but in the main i believe the expression of feeling to be genuine i do not believe of the majority of the leading venetians of this period whose portraits have come down to us that they were deliberately and everlastingly hypocrites i see no hypocrisy in their countenances much capacity of it much subtlety much natural and acquired reserve but no meanness on the contrary infinite grandeur repose courage and the peculiar unity and tranquillity of expression which come of sincerity or wholeness of heart and which it would take much demonstration to make me believe could by any possibility be seen on the countenance of an insincere man i trust therefore that these venetian nobles of the fifteenth century did in the main desire to do judgment and justice to all men but as the whole system of morality had been by this time undermined by the teaching of the romish church the idea of justice had become separated from that of truth so that dissimulation in the interest of the state assumed the aspect of duty we had perhaps better consider with some carefulness the mode in which our own government is carried on and the occasional difference between parliamentary and private morality before we judge mercilessly of the venetians in this respect the secrecy with which their political and criminal trials were conducted appears to modern eyes like a confession of sinister intentions but may it not also be considered and with more probability as the result of an endeavor to do justice in an age of violencethe only means by which law could establish its footing in the midst of feudalism might not irish juries at this day justifiably desire to conduct their proceedings with some greater approximation to the judicial principles of the council of ten finally if we examine with critical accuracy the evidence on which our present impressions of venetian government are founded we shall discover in the first place that twothirds of the traditions of its cruelties are romantic fables in the second that the crimes of which it can be proved to have been guilty differ only from those committed by the other italian powers in being done less wantonly and under profounder conviction of their political expediency and lastly that the final degradation of the venetian power appears owing not so much to the principles of its government as to their being forgotten in the pursuit of pleasure  section cviii we have now examined the portions of the palace which contain the principal evidence of the feeling of its builders the capitals of the upper arcade are exceedingly various in their character their design is formed as in the lower series of eight leaves thrown into volutes at the angles and sustaining figures at the flanks but these figures have no inscriptions and though evidently not without meaning cannot be interpreted without more knowledge than i possess of ancient symbolism many of the capitals toward the sea appear to have been restored and to be rude copies of the ancient ones others though apparently original have been somewhat carelessly wrought but those of them which are both genuine and carefully treated are even finer in composition than any except the eighteenth in the lower arcade the traveller in venice ought to ascend into the corridor and examine with great care the series of capitals which extend on the piazzetta side from the figtree angle to the pilaster which carries the party wall of the sala del gran consiglio as examples of graceful composition in massy capitals meant for hard service and distant effect these are among the finest things i know in gothic art and that above the figtree is remarkable for its sculpture of the four winds each on the side turned towards the wind represented levante the east wind a figure with rays round its head to show that it is always clear weather when that wind blows raising the sun out of the sea hotro the south wind crowned holding the sun in its right hand ponente the west wind plunging the sun into the sea and tramontana the north wind looking up at the north star this capital should be carefully examined if for no other reason than to attach greater distinctness of idea to the magnificent verbiage of milton              thwart of these as fierce   forth rush the levant and the ponent winds   eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise   sirocco and libecchio  i may also especially point out the bird feeding its three young ones on the seventh pillar on the piazzetta side but there is no end to the fantasy of these sculptures and the traveller ought to observe them all carefully until he comes to the great pilaster or complicated pier which sustains the party wall of the sala del consiglio that is to say the fortyseventh capital of the whole series counting from the pilaster of the vine angle inclusive as in the series of the lower arcade the fortyeighth fortyninth and fiftieth are bad work but they are old the fiftyfirst is the first renaissance capital of the upper arcade the first new lions head with smooth ears cut in the time of foscari is over the fiftieth capital and that capital with its shaft stands on the apex of the eighth arch from the sea on the piazzetta side of which one spandril is masonry of the fourteenth and the other of the fifteenth century  section cix the reader who is not able to examine the building on the spot may be surprised at the definiteness with which the point of junction is ascertainable but a glance at the lowest range of leaves in the opposite plate xx will enable him to judge of the grounds on which the above statement is made fig 12 is a cluster of leaves from the capital of the four winds early work of the finest time fig 13 is a leaf from the great renaissance capital at the judgment angle worked in imitation of the older leafage fig 14 is a leaf from one of the renaissance capitals of the upper arcade which are all worked in the natural manner of the period it will be seen that it requires no great ingenuity to distinguish between such design as that of fig 12 and that of fig 14  section cx it is very possible that the reader may at first like fig 14 best i shall endeavor in the next chapter to show why he should not but it must also be noted that fig 12 has lost and fig 14 gained both largely under the hands of the engraver all the bluntness and coarseness of feeling in the workmanship of fig 14 have disappeared on this small scale and all the subtle refinements in the broad masses of fig 12 have vanished they could not indeed be rendered in line engraving unless by the hand of albert durer and i have therefore abandoned for the present all endeavor to represent any more important mass of the early sculpture of the ducal palace but i trust that in a few months casts of many portions will be within the reach of the inhabitants of london and that they will be able to judge for themselves of their perfect pure unlabored naturalism the freshness elasticity and softness of their leafage united with the most noble symmetry and severe reserveno running to waste no loose or experimental lines no extravagance and no weakness their design is always sternly architectural there is none of the wildness or redundance of natural vegetation but there is all the strength freedom and tossing flow of the breathing leaves and all the undulation of their surfaces rippled as they grew by the summer winds as the sands are by the sea  section cxi this early sculpture of the ducal palace then represents the state of gothic work in venice at its central and proudest period i e circa 1350 after this time all is declineof what nature and by what steps we shall inquire in the ensuing chapter for as this investigation though still referring to gothic architecture introduces us to the first symptoms of the renaissance influence i have considered it as properly belonging to the third division of our subject  section cxii and as under the shadow of these nodding leaves we bid farewell to the great gothic spirit here also we may cease our examination of the details of the ducal palace for above its upper arcade there are only the four traceried windows and one or two of the third order on the rio fa√ßade which can be depended upon as exhibiting the original workmanship of the older palace footnote some further details respecting these portions as well as some necessary confirmations of my statements of dates are however given in appendix i vol iii i feared wearying the general reader by introducing them into the text i examined the capitals of the four other windows on the fa√ßade and of those on the piazzetta one by one with great care and i found them all to be of far inferior workmanship to those which retain their traceries i believe the stone framework of these windows must have been so cracked and injured by the flames of the great fire as to render it necessary to replace it by new traceries and that the present mouldings and capitals are base imitations of the original ones the traceries were at first however restored in their complete form as the holes for the bolts which fastened the bases of their shafts are still to be seen in the windowsills as well as the marks of the inner mouldings on the soffits how much the stone facing of the fa√ßade the parapets and the shafts and niches of the angles retain of their original masonry it is also impossible to determine but there is nothing in the workmanship of any of them demanding especial notice still less in the large central windows on each fa√ßade which are entirely of renaissance execution all that is admirable in these portions of the building is the disposition of their various parts and masses which is without doubt the same as in the original fabric and calculated when seen from a distance to produce the same impression  section cxiii not so in the interior all vestige of the earlier modes of decoration was here of course destroyed by the fires and the severe and religious work of guariento and bellini has been replaced by the wildness of tintoret and the luxury of veronese but in this case though widely different in temper the art of the renewal was at least intellectually as great as that which had perished and though the halls of the ducal palace are no more representative of the character of the men by whom it was built each of them is still a colossal casket of priceless treasure a treasure whose safety has till now depended on its being despised and which at this moment and as i write is piece by piece being destroyed for ever  section cxiv the reader will forgive my quitting our more immediate subject in order briefly to explain the causes and the nature of this destruction for the matter is simply the most important of all that can be brought under our present consideration respecting the state of art in europe  the fact is that the greater number of persons or societies throughout europe whom wealth or chance or inheritance has put in possession of valuable pictures do not know a good picture from a bad one and have no idea in what the value of a picture really consists footnote many persons capable of quickly sympathizing with any excellence when once pointed out to them easily deceive themselves into the supposition that they are judges of art there is only one real test of such power of judgment can they at a glance discover a good picture obscured by the filth and confused among the rubbish of the pawnbrokers or dealers garret the reputation of certain work is raised partly by accident partly by the just testimony of artists partly by the various and generally bad taste of the public no picture that i know of has ever in modern times attained popularity in the full sense of the term without having some exceedingly bad qualities mingled with its good ones and when this reputation has once been completely established it little matters to what state the picture may be reduced few minds are so completely devoid of imagination as to be unable to invest it with the beauties which they have heard attributed to it  section cxv this being so the pictures that are most valued are for the most part those by masters of established renown which are highly or neatly finished and of a size small enough to admit of their being placed in galleries or saloons so as to be made subjects of ostentation and to be easily seen by a crowd for the support of the fame and value of such pictures little more is necessary than that they should be kept bright partly by cleaning which is incipient destruction and partly by what is called restoring that is painting over which is of course total destruction nearly all the gallery pictures in modern europe have been more or less destroyed by one or other of these operations generally exactly in proportion to the estimation in which they are held and as originally the smaller and more highly finished works of any great master are usually his worst the contents of many of our most celebrated galleries are by this time in reality of very small value indeed  section cxvi on the other hand the most precious works of any noble painter are usually those which have been done quickly and in the heat of the first thought on a large scale for places where there was little likelihood of their being well seen or for patrons from whom there was little prospect of rich remuneration in general the best things are done in this way or else in the enthusiasm and pride of accomplishing some great purpose such as painting a cathedral or a camposanto from one end to the other especially when the time has been short and circumstances disadvantageous  section cxvii works thus executed are of course despised on account of their quantity as well as their frequent slightness in the places where they exist and they are too large to be portable and too vast and comprehensive to be read on the spot in the hasty temper of the present age they are therefore almost universally neglected whitewashed by custodes shot at by soldiers suffered to drop from the walls piecemeal in powder and rags by society in general but which is an advantage more than counterbalancing all this evil they are not often restored what is left of them however fragmentary however ruinous however obscured and defiled is almost always the real thing there are no fresh readings and therefore the greatest treasures of art which europe at this moment possesses are pieces of old plaster on ruinous brick walls where the lizards burrow and bask and which few other living creatures ever approach and torn sheets of dim canvas in waste corners of churches and mildewed stains in the shape of human figures on the walls of dark chambers which now and then an exploring traveller causes to be unlocked by their tottering custode looks hastily round and retreats from in a weary satisfaction at his accomplished duty  section cxviii many of the pictures on the ceilings and walls of the ducal palace by paul veronese and tintoret have been more or less reduced by neglect to this condition unfortunately they are not altogether without reputation and their state has drawn the attention of the venetian authorities and academicians it constantly happens that public bodies who will not pay five pounds to preserve a picture will pay fifty to repaint it footnote this is easily explained there are of course in every place and at all periods bad painters who conscientiously believe that they can improve every picture they touch and these men are generally in their presumption the most influential over the innocence whether of monarchs or municipalities the carpenter and slater have little influence in recommending the repairs of the roof but the bad painter has great influence as well as interest in recommending those of the picture and when i was at venice in 1846 there were two remedial operations carrying on at one and the same time in the two buildings which contain the pictures of greatest value in the city as pieces of color of greatest value in the world curiously illustrative of this peculiarity in human nature buckets were set on the floor of the scuola di san rocco in every shower to catch the rain which came through the pictures of tintoret on the ceiling while in the ducal palace those of paul veronese were themselves laid on the floor to be repainted and i was myself present at the reillumination of the breast of a white horse with a brush at the end of a stick five feet long luxuriously dipped in a common housepainters vessel of paint  this was of course a large picture the process has already been continued in an equally destructive though somewhat more delicate manner over the whole of the humbler canvases on the ceiling of the sala del gran consiglio and i heard it threatened when i was last in venice 18512 to the paradise at its extremity which is yet in tolerable conditionthe largest work of tintoret and the most wonderful piece of pure manly and masterly oilpainting in the world  section cxix i leave these facts to the consideration of the european patrons of art twenty years hence they will be acknowledged and regretted at present i am well aware that it is of little use to bring them forward except only to explain the present impossibility of stating what pictures are and what were in the interior of the ducal palace i can only say that in the winter of 1851 the paradise of tintoret was still comparatively uninjured and that the camera di collegio and its antechamber and the sala de pregadi were full of pictures by veronese and tintoret that made their walls as precious as so many kingdoms so precious indeed and so full of majesty that sometimes when walking at evening on the lido whence the great chain of the alps crested with silver clouds might be seen rising above the front of the ducal palace i used to feel as much awe in gazing on the building as on the hills and could believe that god had done a greater work in breathing into the narrowness of dust the mighty spirits by whom its haughty walls had been raised and its burning legends written than in lifting the rocks of granite higher than the clouds of heaven and veiling them with their various mantle of purple flower and shadowy pine     note   i have printed the chapter on the ducal palace quite one of the most important pieces of work done in my life without alteration of its references to the plates of the first edition because i hope both to republish some of those plates and together with them a few permanent photographs both from the sculpture of the palace itself and from my own drawings of its detail which may be purchased by the possessors of this smaller edition to bind with the book or not as they please this separate publication i can now soon set in hand and i believe it will cause much less confusion to leave for the present the references to the old plates untouched the woodblocks used for the first three figures in this chapter are the original ones that of the ducal palace fa√ßade was drawn on the wood by my own hand and cost me more trouble than it is worth being merely given for division and proportion the greater part of the first volume omitted in this edition after the quarry will be republished in the series of my reprinted works with its original woodblocks  but my mind is mainly set now on getting some worthy illustration of the st marks mosaics and of such remains of the old capitals now for ever removed in process of the palace restoration from their life in sea wind and sunlight and their ancient duty to a museumgrave as i have useful record of drawn in their native light the series both of these and of the earlier mosaics of which the sequence is sketched in the preceding volume and farther explained in the third number of st marks rest become to me every hour of my life more precious both for their art and their meaning and if any of my readers care to help me in my old age to fulfil my lifes work rightly let them send what pence they can spare for these objects to my publisher mr allen sunnyside orpington kent  since writing the first part of this note i have received a letter from mr burne jones assuring me of his earnest sympathy in its object and giving me hope even of his superintendence of the drawings which i have already desired to be undertaken but i am no longer able to continue work of this kind at my own cost and the fulfilment of my purpose must entirely depend on the moneyhelp given me by my readers
