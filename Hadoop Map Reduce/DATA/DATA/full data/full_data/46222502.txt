part i     east and west poems     a greyport legend  1797    they ran through the streets of the seaport town they peered from the decks of the ships that lay the cold seafog that came whitening down was never as cold or white as they  ho starbuck and pinckney and tenterden   run for your shallops gather your men   scatter your boats on the lower bay  good cause for fear in the thick midday the hulk that lay by the rotting pier filled with the children in happy play parted its moorings and drifted clear   drifted clear beyond the reach or call   thirteen children they were in all     all adrift in the lower bay  said a hardfaced skipper god help us all she will not float till the turning tide said his wife my darling will hear my call whether in sea or heaven she bide   and she lifted a quavering voice and high   wild and strange as a seabirds cry     till they shuddered and wondered at her side  the fog drove down on each laboring crew veiled each from each and the sky and shore there was not a sound but the breath they drew and the lap of water and creak of oar   and they felt the breath of the downs fresh blown   oer leagues of clover and cold gray stone     but not from the lips that had gone before  they come no more but they tell the tale that when fogs are thick on the harbor reef the mackerel fishers shorten sail for the signal they know will bring relief   for the voices of children still at play   in a phantom hulk that drifts alway     through channels whose waters never fail  it is but a foolish shipmans tale a theme for a poets idle page but still when the mists of doubt prevail and we lie becalmed by the shores of age   we hear from the misty troubled shore   the voice of the children gone before     drawing the soul to its anchorage     a newport romance    they say that she died of a broken heart   i tell the tale as twas told to me but her spirit lives and her soul is part   of this sad old house by the sea  her lover was fickle and fine and french   it was nearly a hundred years ago when he sailed away from her armspoor wench   with the admiral rochambeau  i marvel much what periwigged phrase   won the heart of this sentimental quaker at what goldenlaced speech of those modish days   she listenedthe mischief take her  but she kept the posies of mignonette   that he gave and ever as their bloom failed and faded though with her tears still wet   her youth with their own exhaled  till one night when the seafog wrapped a shroud   round spar and spire and tarn and tree her soul went up on that lifted cloud   from this sad old house by the sea  and ever since then when the clock strikes two   she walks unbidden from room to room and the air is filled that she passes through   with a subtle sad perfume  the delicate odor of mignonette   the ghost of a dead and gone bouquet is all that tells of her story yet   could she think of a sweeter way                                       i sit in the sad old house tonight   myself a ghost from a farther sea and i trust that this quaker woman might   in courtesy visit me  for the laugh is fled from porch and lawn   and the bugle died from the fort on the hill and the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone   and the grand piano is still  somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two   and there is no sound in the sad old house but the long veranda dripping with dew   and in the wainscot a mouse  the light of my studylamp streams out   from the library door but has gone astray in the depths of the darkened hall small doubt   but the quakeress knows the way  was it the trick of a sense oerwrought   with outward watching and inward fret but i swear that the air just now was fraught   with the odor of mignonette  i open the window and seem almost   so still lies the oceanto hear the beat of its great gulf artery off the coast   and to bask in its tropic heat  in my neighbors windows the gaslights flare   as the dancers swing in a waltz of strauss and i wonder now could i fit that air   to the song of this sad old house  and no odor of mignonette there is   but the breath of morn on the dewy lawn and mayhap from causes as slight as this   the quaint old legend is born  but the soul of that subtle sad perfume   as the spiced embalmings they say outlast the mummy laid in his rocky tomb   awakens my buried past  and i think of the passion that shook my youth   of its aimless loves and its idle pains and am thankful now for the certain truth   that only the sweet remains  and i hear no rustle of stiff brocade   and i see no face at my library door for now that the ghosts of my heart are laid   she is viewless forevermore  but whether she came as a faint perfume   or whether a spirit in stole of white i feel as i pass from the darkened room   she has been with my soul tonight     the hawks nest  sierras    we checked our pacethe red road sharply rounding   we heard the troubled flow of the dark olive depths of pines resounding   a thousand feet below  above the tumult of the cañon lifted   the gray hawk breathless hung or on the hill a wingèd shadow drifted   where furze and thornbush clung  or where halfway the mountain side was furrowed   with many a seam and scar or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed   a molehill seen so far  we looked in silence down across the distant   unfathomable reach a silence broken by the guides consistent   and realistic speech  walker of murphys blew a hole through peters   for telling him he lied then up and dusted out of south hornitos   across the long divide  we ran him out of strongs and up through eden   and cross the ford below and up this cañon peters brother leadin   and me and clark and joe  he fout us game somehow i disremember   jest how the thing kem round some say twas wadding some a scattered ember   from fires on the ground  but in one minute all the hill below him   was just one sheet of flame guardin the crest sam clark and i called to him   andwell the dog was game  he made no sign the fires of hell were round him   the pit of hell below we sat and waited but never found him   and then we turned to go  and thenyou see that rock thats grown so bristly   with chaparral and tan suthin crep out it might hev been a grizzly   it might hev been a man  suthin that howled and gnashed its teeth and shouted   in smoke and dust and flame suthin that sprang into the depths about it   grizzly or manbut game  thats all well yes it does look rather risky   and kinder makes one queer and dizzy looking down a drop of whiskey   aint a bad thing right here     in the

as a friend which his health it were vain to call hearty   since the mind to deceit it might lend for his arm it was broken quite recent   and has something gone wrong with his lung which is why it is proper and decent   i should write what he runs off his tongue  first he says miss hes read through your letter   to the endand the end came too soon that a slight illness kept him your debtor   which for weeks he was wild as a loon that his spirits are buoyant as yours is   that with you miss he challenges fate which the language that invalid uses   at times it were vain to relate  and he says that the mountains are fairer   for once being held in your thought that each rock holds a wealth that is rarer   than ever by goldseeker sought which are words he would put in these pages   by a party not given to guile which the same not at date paying wages   might produce in the sinful a smile  he remembers the ball at the ferry   and the ride and the gate and the vow and the rose that you gave himthat very   same rose he is treasuring now which his blanket hes kicked on his trunk miss   and insists on his legs being free and his language to me from his bunk miss   is frequent and painful and free  he hopes you are wearing no willows   but are happy and gay all the while that he knows which this dodging of pillows   imparts but small ease to the style and the same you will pardonhe knows miss   that though parted by many a mile yet were he lying under the snows miss   theyd melt into tears at your smile  and youll still think of him in your pleasures   in your brief twilight dreams of the past in this green laurelspray that he treasures   it was plucked where your parting was last in this specimenbut a small trifle   it will do for a pin for your shawl which the truth not to wickedly stifle   was his last weeks clean upand his all  hes asleep which the same might seem strange miss   were it not that i scorn to deny that i raised his last dose for a change miss   in view that his fever was high but he lies there quite peaceful and pensive   and now my respects miss to you which my language although comprehensive   might seem to be freedomits true  which i have a small favor to ask you   as concerns a bullpup which the same if the duty would not overtask you   you would please to procure for me game and send per express to the flat miss   which they say york is famed for the breed which though words of deceit may be that miss   ill trust to your taste miss indeed  pswhich this same interfering   into other folks way i despise yet if it so be i was hearing   that its just empty pockets as lies betwixt you and joseph it follers   that having no family claims heres my pile which its six hundred dollars   as is yours with respects                                truthful james    further language from truthful james  nyes ford stanislaus  1870    do i sleep do i dream do i wonder and doubt are things what they seem or is visions about is our civilization a failure or is the caucasian played out  which expressions are strong yet would feebly imply some account of a wrong not to call it a lie as was worked off on william my pardner and the same being w nye  he came down to the ford on the very same day of that lottery drawed by those sharps at the bay and he says to me truthful how goes it i replied it is far far from gay  for the camp has gone wild on this lottery game and has even beguiled injin dick by the same which said nye to me injins is pizen do you know what his number is james  i replied 72 984 is his hand when he started and drew out a list which he scanned then he softly went for his revolver with language i cannot command  then i said william nye but he turned upon me and the look in his eye was quite painful to see and he says you mistake this poor injin i protects from such sharps as you be  i was shocked and withdrew but i grieve to relate when he next met my view injin dick was his mate and the two around town was alying in a frightfully dissolute state  which the wardance they had round a tree at the bend was a sight that was sad and it seemed that the end would not justify the proceedings as i quiet remarked to a friend  for that injin he fled the next day to his band and we found william spread very loose on the strand with a peacefullike smile on his features and a dollar greenback in his hand  which the same when rolled out we observed with surprise that that injin no doubt had believed was the prize them figures in red in the corner which the number of notes specifies  was it guile or a dream is it nye that i doubt are things what they seem or is visions about is our civilization a failure or is the caucasian played out     the wonderful spring of san joaquin    of all the fountains that poets sing crystal thermal or mineral spring ponce de leons fount of youth wells with bottoms of doubtful truth in short of all the springs of time that ever were flowing in fact or rhyme that ever were tasted felt or seen there were none like the spring of san joaquin  anno domini eighteenseven father dominguez now in heaven obiit eighteen twentyseven found the spring and found it too by his mules miraculous cast of a shoe for his beasta descendant of balaams ass stopped on the instant and would not pass  the padre thought the omen good and bent his lips to the trickling flood thenas the chronicles declare on the honest faith of a true believer his cheeks though wasted lank and bare filled like a withered russetpear in the vacuum of a glass receiver and the snows that seventy winters bring melted away in that magic spring  such at least was the wondrous news the padre brought into santa cruz the church of course had its own views of who were worthiest to use the magic spring but the prior claim fell to the aged sick and lame far and wide the people came some from the healthful aptos creek hastened to bring their helpless sick even the fishers of rude soquel suddenly found they were far from well the brawny dwellers of san lorenzo said in fact they had never been so and all wereailingstrange to say from pescadero to monterey  over the mountain they poured in with leathern bottles and bags of skin through the cañons a motley throng trotted hobbled and limped along the fathers gazed at the moving scene with pious joy and with souls serene and thena result perhaps foreseen they laid out the mission of san joaquin  not in the eyes of faith alone the good effects of the waters shone but skins grew rosy eyes waxed clear of rough vacquero and muleteer angular forms were rounded out limbs grew supple and waists grew stout and as for the girlsfor miles about they had no equal to this day from pescadero to monterey youll still find eyes in which are seen the liquid graces of san joaquin  there is a limit to human bliss and the mission of san joaquin had this none went abroad to roam or stay but they fell sick in the queerest way a singular maladie du pays with gastric symptoms so they spent their days in a sensuous content caring little for things unseen beyond their bowers of living green beyond the mountains that lay between the world and the mission of san joaquin  winter passed and the summer came the trunks of madroño all aflame here and there through the underwood like pillars of fire starkly stood all of the breezy solitude   was filled with the spicing of pine and bay and resinous odors mixed and blended   and dim and ghostlike far away the smoke of the burning woods ascended then of a sudden the mountains swam the rivers piled their floods in a dam  the ridge above los gatos creek   arched its spine in a feline fashion the forests waltzed till they grew sick   and nature shook in a speechless passion and swallowed up in the earthquakes spleen the wonderful spring of san joaquin vanished and never more was seen  two days passed the mission folk out of their rosy dream awoke some of them looked a trifle white but that no doubt was from earthquake fright three days there was sore distress headache nausea giddiness four days faintings tenderness of the mouth and fauces and in less than one weekhere the story closes we wont continue the prognosis enough that now no trace is seen of spring or mission of san joaquin   moral  you see the point dont be too quick to break bad habits better stick like the mission folk to your arsenic     on a cone of the big trees  sequoia gigantea    brown foundling of the western wood   babe of primeval wildernesses long on my table thou hast stood   encounters strange and rude caresses perchance contented with thy lot   surroundings new and curious faces as though ten centuries were not   imprisoned in thy shining cases  thou bringst me back the halcyon days   of grateful rest the week of leisure the journey lapped in autumn haze   the sweet fatigue that seemed a pleasure the morning ride the noonday halt   the blazing slopes the red dust rising and thenthe dim brown columned vault   with its cool damp sepulchral spicing  once more i see the rocking masts   that scrape the sky their only tenant the jaybird that in frolic casts   from some high yard his broad blue pennant i see the indian files that keep   their places in the dusty heather their red trunks standing ankle deep   in moccasins of rusty leather  i see all this and marvel much   that thou sweet woodland waif art able to keep the company of such   as throng thy friendsthe poetstable the latest spawn the press hath cast   the modern popes the later byrons why een the best may not outlast   thy poor relationsempervirens  thy sire saw the light that shone   on mohammeds uplifted crescent on many a royal gilded throne   and deed forgotten in the present he saw the age of sacred trees   and druid groves and mystic larches and saw from forest domes like these   the builder bring his gothic arches  and must thou foundling still forego   thy heritage and high ambition to lie full lowly and full low   adjusted to thy new condition not hidden in the drifted snows   but under inkdrops idly spattered and leaves ephemeral as those   that on thy woodland tomb were scattered  yet lie thou there o friend and speak   the moral of thy simple story though life is all that thou dost seek   and age alone thy crown of glory not thine the only germs that fail   the purpose of their high creation if their poor tenements avail   for worldly show and ostentation     a sanitary message    last night above the whistling wind   i heard the welcome rain a fusillade upon the roof   a tattoo on the pane the keyhole piped the chimneytop   a warlike trumpet blew yet mingling with these sounds of strife   a softer voice stole through  give thanks o brothers said the voice   that he who sent the rains hath spared your fields the scarlet dew   that drips from patriot veins ive seen the grass on eastern graves   in brighter verdure rise but oh the rain that gave it life   sprang first from human eyes  i come to wash away no stain   upon your wasted lea i raise no banners save the ones   the forest wave to me upon the mountain side where spring   her farthest picket sets my reveille awakes a host   of grassy bayonets    i visit every humble roof   i mingle with the low only upon the highest peaks   my blessings fall in snow until in tricklings of the stream   and drainings of the lea my unspent bounty comes at last   to mingle with the sea  and thus all night above the wind   i heard the welcome rain a fusillade upon the roof   a tattoo on the pane the keyhole piped the chimneytop   a warlike trumpet blew but mingling with these sounds of strife   this hymn of peace stole through     the copperhead  1864    there is peace in the swamp where the copper head sleeps where the waters are stagnant the white vapor creeps where the musk of magnolia hangs thick in the air and the lilies phylacteries broaden in prayer there is peace in the swamp though the quiet is death though the mist is miasm the upas trees breath though no echo awakes to the cooing of doves there is peace yes the peace that the copperhead loves  go seek him he coils in the ooze and the drip like a thong idly flung from the slavedrivers whip but beware the false footstepthe stumble that brings a deadlier lash than the overseer swings never arrow so true never bullet so dread as the straight steady stroke of that hammershaped head whether slave or proud planter who braves that dull crest woe to him who shall trouble the copperheads rest  then why waste your labors brave hearts and strong men in tracking a trail to the copperheads den lay your axe to the cypress hew open the shade to the free sky and sunshine jehovah has made let the breeze of the north sweep the vapors away till the stagnant lake ripples the freed waters play and then to your heel can you righteously doom the copperhead born of its shadow and gloom     on a pen of thomas starr king    this is the reed the dead musician dropped   with tuneful magic in its sheath still hidden the prompt allegro of its music stopped   its melodies unbidden  but who shall finish the unfinished strain   or wake the instrument to awe and wonder and bid the slender barrel breathe again   an organpipe of thunder  his pen what humbler memories cling about   its golden curves what shapes and laughing graces slipped from its point when his full heart went out   in smiles and courtly phrases  the truth half jesting half in earnest flung   the word of cheer with recognition in it the note of alms whose golden speech outrung   the golden gift within it  but all in vain the enchanters wand we wave   no stroke of ours recalls his magic vision the incantation that its power gave   sleeps with the dead magician

 no need to quote those truths he spoke   that burned through years of war and shame while history carves with surer stroke   across our map his noonday fame  no need to bid him show the scars   of

gums and spice india cottons and india rice and the richest silks of far cathay was due at acapulco bay  due she was and overdue galleon merchandise and crew creeping along through rain and shine through the tropics under the line  the trains were waiting outside the walls the wives of sailors thronged the town the traders sat by their empty stalls and the viceroy himself came down the bells in the tower were all atrip te deums were on each fathers lip the limes were ripening in the sun for the sick of the coming galleon  all in vain weeks passed away and yet no galleon saw the bay india goods advanced in price the governor missed his favorite spice the señoritas mourned for sandal and the famous cottons of coromandel  and some for an absent lover lost and one for a husbanddonna julia wife of the captain tempesttossed in circumstances so peculiar even the fathers unawares grumbled a little at their prayers and all along the coast that year votive candles were scarce and dear  never a tear bedims the eye that time and patience will not dry never a lip is curved with pain that cant be kissed into smiles again and these same truths as far as i know obtained on the coast of mexico more than two hundred years ago  in sixteen hundred and fiftyone ten years after the deed was done and folks had forgotten the galleon the divers plunged in the gulf for pearls white as the teeth of the indian girls the traders sat by their full bazaars the mules with many a weary load and oxen dragging their creaking cars came and went on the mountain road  where was the galleon all this while wrecked on some lonely coral isle burnt by the roving seamarauders or sailing north under secret orders had she found the anian passage famed by lying moldonado claimed and sailed through the sixtyfifth degree direct to the north atlantic sea or had she found the river of kings of which de fonté told such strange things in sixteen forty never a sign east or west or under the line they saw of the missing galleon never a sail or plank or chip they found of the longlost treasureship or enough to build a tale upon but when she was lost and where and how are the facts were coming to just now  take if you please the chart of that day published at madridpor el rey look for a spot in the old south sea the hundred and eightieth degree longitude west of madrid there under the equatorial glare just where the east and west are one youll find the missing galleon youll find the san gregorio yet riding the seas with sails all set fresh as upon the very day she sailed from acapulco bay  how did she get there what strange spell kept her two hundred years so well free from decay and mortal taint what but the prayers of a patron saint a hundred leagues from manilla town the san gregorios helm came down round she went on her heel and not a cables length from a galliot that rocked on the waters just abreast of the galleons course which was westsouwest  then said the galleons commandante general pedro sobriente that was his rank on land and main a regular custom of old spain my pilot is dead of scurvy may i ask the longitude time and day the first two given and compared the thirdthe commandante stared  the first of june i make it second said the stranger then youve wronglyreckoned i make it first as you came this way you should have lostdye seea day lost a day as plainly see on the hundred and eightieth degree lost a day yes if not rude when did you make east longitude on the ninth of mayour patrons day on the ninthyou had no ninth of may eighth and tenth was there but stay too late for the galleon bore away  lost was the day they should have kept lost unheeded and lost unwept lost in a way that made search vain lost in the trackless and boundless main lost like the day of jobs awful curse in his third chapter third and fourth verse wrecked was their patrons only day what would the holy fathers say  said the fray antonio estavan the galleons chaplaina learned man nothing is lost that you can regain and the way to look for a thing is plain to go where you lost it back again back with your galleon till you see the hundred and eightieth degree wait till the rolling year goes round and there will the missing day be found for youll findif computations true that sailing east will give to you not only one ninth of may but two one for the good saints present cheer and one for the day we lost last year  back to the spot sailed the galleon where for a twelvemonth off and on the hundred and eightieth degree she rose and fell on a tropic sea but lo when it came to the ninth of may all of a sudden becalmed she lay one degree from that fatal spot without the power to move a knot and of course the moment she lost her way gone was her chance to save that day  to cut a lengthening story short she never saved it made the sport of evil spirits and baffling wind she was always before or just behind one day too soon or one day too late and the sun meanwhile would never wait she had two eighths as she idly lay two tenths but never a ninth of may and there she rides through two hundred years of dreary penance and anxious fears yet through the grace of the saint she served captain and crew are still preserved  by a computation that still holds good made by the holy brotherhood the san gregorio will cross that line in nineteen hundred and thirtynine just three hundred years to a day from the time she lost the ninth of may and the folk in acapulco town over the waters looking down will see in the glow of the setting sun the sails of the missing galleon and the royal standard of philip rey the gleaming mast and glistening spar as she nears the surf of the outer bar a te deum sung on her crowded deck an odor of spice along the shore a crash a cry from a shattered wreck and the yearly galleon sails no more in or out of the olden bay for the blessed patron has found his day                                       such is the legend hear this truth over the trackless past somewhere lie the lost days of our tropic youth only regained by faith and prayer only recalled by prayer and plaint each lost day has its patron saint     a second review of the grand army    i read last night of the grand review in washingtons chiefest avenue two hundred thousand men in blue   i think they said was the number till i seemed to hear their trampling feet the bugle blast and the drums quick beat the clatter of hoofs in the stony street the cheers of people who came to greet and the thousand details that to repeat   would only my verse encumber till i fell in a reverie sad and sweet   and then to a fitful slumber  when lo in a vision i seemed to stand in the lonely capitol on each hand far stretched the portico dim and grand its columns ranged like a martial band of sheeted spectres whom some command   had called to a last reviewing and the streets of the city were white and bare no footfall echoed across the square but out of the misty midnight air i heard in the distance a trumpet blare and the wandering nightwinds seemed to bear   the sound of a far tattooing  then i held my breath with fear and dread for into the square with a brazen tread there rode a figure whose stately head   oerlooked the review that morning that never bowed from its firmset seat when the living column passed its feet yet now rode steadily up the street   to the phantom bugles warning  till it reached the capitol square and wheeled and there in the moonlight stood revealed a wellknown form that in state and field   had led our patriot sires whose face was turned to the sleeping camp afar through the rivers fog and damp that showed no flicker nor waning lamp   nor wasted bivouac fires  and i saw a phantom army come with never a sound of fife or drum but keeping time to a throbbing hum   of wailing and lamentation the martyred heroes of malvern hill of gettysburg and chancellorsville the men whose wasted figures fill       the patriot graves of the nation  and there came the nameless deadthe men who perished in fever swamp and fen the slowlystarved of the prisonpen       and marching beside the others came the dusky martyrs of pillows fight with limbs enfranchised and bearing bright i thoughtperhaps twas the pale moonlight       they looked as white as their brothers  and so all night marched the nations dead with never a banner above them spread nor a badge nor a motto brandished no marksave the bare uncovered head   of the silent bronze reviewer with never an arch save the vaulted sky with never a flower save those that lie on the distant gravesfor love could buy   no gift that was purer or truer  so all night long swept the strange array so all night long till the morning gray i watched for one who had passed away   with a reverent awe and wonder till a blue cap waved in the lengthening line and i knew that one who was kin of mine had come and i spakeand lo that sign   awakened me from my slumber      part ii     before the curtain    behind the footlights hangs the rusty baize a trifle shabby in the upturned blaze of flaring gas and curious eyes that gaze  the stage methinks perhaps is none too wide and hardly fit for royal richards stride or falstaffs bulk or denmarks youthful pride  ah well no passion walks its humble boards oer it no king nor valiant hector lords the simplest skill is all its space affords  the song and jest the dance and trifling play the local hit at follies of the day the trick to pass an idle hour away  for these no trumpets that announce the moor no blast that makes the heros welcome sure a single fiddle in the overture     the stagedrivers story    it was the stagedrivers story as he stood with his back to the wheelers quietly flecking his whip and turning his quid of tobacco while on the dusty road and blent with the rays of the moonlight we saw the long curl of his lash and the juice of tobacco descending  danger sir i believe youindeed i may say on that subject you your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager i have seen danger oh no not me sir indeed i assure you twas only the man with the dog that is sitting alone in yon wagon  it was the geiger grade a mile and a half from the summit black as your hat was the night and never a star in the heavens thundering down the grade the gravel and stones we sent flying over the precipice sidea thousand feet plumb to the bottom  halfway down the grade i felt sir a thrilling and creaking then a lurch to one side as we hung on the bank of the cañon then looking up the road i saw in the distance behind me the off hind wheel of the coach just loosed from its axle and following  one glance alone i gave then gathered together my ribbons shouted and flung them outspread on the straining necks of my cattle screamed at the top of my voice and lashed the air in my frenzy while down the geiger grade on three wheels the vehicle thundered  speed was our only chance when again came the ominous rattle crack and another wheel slipped away and was lost in the darkness two only now were left yet such was our fearful momentum upright erect and sustained on two wheels the vehicle thundered  as some huge boulder unloosed from its rocky shelf on the mountain drives before it the hare and the timorous squirrel farleaping so down the geiger grade rushed the pioneer coach and before it leaped the wild horses and shrieked in advance of the danger impending  but to be brief in my tale again ere we came to the level slipped from its axle a wheel so that to be plain in my statement a matter of twelve hundred yards or more as the distance may be we travelled upon one wheel until we drove up to the station  then sir we sank in a heap but picking myself from the ruins i heard a noise up the grade and looking i saw in the distance the three wheels following still like moons on the horizon whirling till circling they gracefully sank on the road at the side of the     station  this is my story sir a trifle indeed i assure you much more perchance might be said but i hold him of all men most     lightly who swerves from the truth in his taleno thank youwell since you     are pressing perhaps i dont care if i do you may give me the same jimno sugar     aspiring miss de laine  a chemical narrative    certain facts which serve to explain the physical charms of miss addie de laine who as the common reports obtain surpassed in complexion the lily and rose with a very sweet mouth and a retroussé nose a figure like hebes or that which revolves in a milliners window and partially solves that question which mentor and moralist pains if grace may exist minus feeling or brains  of course the young lady had beaux by the score all that she wantedwhat girl could ask more lovers that sighed and lovers that swore lovers that danced and lovers that played men of profession of leisure and trade but one who was destined to take the high part of holding that mythical treasure her heart this loverthe wonder and envy of town was a practising chemista fellow called brown  i might here remark that twas doubted by many in regard to the heart if miss addie had any but no one could look in that eloquent face with its exquisite outline and features of grace and mark through the transparent skin how the tide ebbed and flowed at the impulse of passion or pride none could look who believed in the bloods circulation as argued by harvey but saw confirmation that here at least nature had triumphed oer art and as far as complexion went she had a heart  but this par parenthesis brown was the man preferred of all others to carry her fan hook her glove drape her shawl and do all that a belle may demand of the lover she wants to treat well folks wondered and stared that a fellow called brown abstracted and solemn in manner a clown ill dressed with a lingering smell of the shop should appear as her escort at party or hop some swore he had cooked up some villanous charm or love philter not in the regular pharm acopea and thus from pure malis prepense had bewitched and bamboozled the young ladys sense others thought with more reason the secret to lie in a magical wash or indelible dye while society with its censorious eye and judgment impartial stood ready to damn what wasnt improper as being a sham  for a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog with a party the finest the season had seen to be given in honor of miss pollywog who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen the guests were invited but one night before a carriage drew up at the modest backdoor of browns labratory and full in the glare of a big purple bottle some closelyveiled fair alighted and entered to make matters plain spite of veils and disguisestwas addie de laine  as a bower for true love twas hardly the one that a lady would choose to be wooed in or won no odor of rose or sweet jessamines sigh breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme but the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime and salts which your chemist delights to explain as the base of the smell of the rose and the drain think of this o ye lovers of sweetness and know what you smell when you snuff up lubin or pinaud  i pass by the greetings the transports and bliss which of course duly followed a meeting like this and come down to businessfor such the intent of the lady who now oer the crucible leant in the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime like a fairy called up in the new pantomime and give but her words as she coyly looked down in reply to the questioning glances of brown i am taking the drops and am using the paste and the little white powders that had a sweet taste which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye and the depilatory and also the dye and im charmed with the trial and now my dear brown i have one other favornow ducky dont frown only one for a chemist and genius like you but a trifle and one you can easily do now listen tomorrow you know is the night of the birthday soiree of that pollywog fright and im to be there and the dress i shall wear is too lovely butbut what then ma chere said brown as the lady came to a full stop and glanced round the shelves of the little back shop well i wanti want something to fill out the skirt to the proper dimension without being girt in a stiff crinoline or caged in a hoop that shows through ones skirt like the bars of a coop something light that a lady may waltz in or polk with a freedom that none but you masculine folk ever know for however poor woman aspires shes always bound down to the earth by these wires are you listening nonsense dont stare like a spoon idiotic some light thing and spacious and soon something likewell in factsomething like a balloon here she paused and here brown overcome by surprise gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes and the lady departed but just at the door something happenedtis true it had happened before in this sanctum of sciencea sibilant sound like some element just from its trammels unbound or two substances that their affinities found  the night of the anxiously lookedfor soirée had come with its fair ones in gorgeous array with the rattle of wheels and the tinkle of bells and the how do ye dos and the hope you are wells and the crash in the passage and last lingering look you give as you hang your best hat on the hook the rush of hot air as the door opens wide and your entrythat blending of selfpossessed pride and humility shown in your perfectbred stare at the folk as if wondering how they got there with other tricks worthy of vanity fair meanwhile that safe topic the heat of the room already was losing its freshness and bloom young people were yawning and wondering when the dance would come off and why didnt it then when a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd lo the door swung its hinges with utterance proud and pompey announced with a trumpetlike strain the entrance of brown and miss addie de laine  she entered but oh how imperfect the verb to express to the senses her movement superb to say that she sailed in more clearly might tell her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell her robe was a vague circumambient space with shadowy boundaries made of pointlace the rest was but guesswork and well might defy the power of critical feminine eye to define or describe twere as futile to try the gossamer web of the cirrus to trace floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky  midst the humming of praises and the glances of beaux that greet our fair maiden wherever she goes brown slipped like a shadow grim silent and black with a look of anxiety close in her track once he whispered aside in her delicate ear a sentence of warningit might be of fear dont stand in a draught if you value your life nothing moresuch advice might be given your wife or your sweetheart in times of bronchitis and cough without mystery romance or frivolous scoff but hark to the music the dance has begun the closelydraped windows wide open are flung the notes of the piccolo joyous and light like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night round about go the dancers in circles they fly trip trip go their feet as their skirts eddy by and swifter and lighter but somewhat too plain whisks the fair circumvolving miss addie de laine  taglioni and cerito well might have pined for the vigor and ease that her movements combined een rigelboche never flung higher her robe in the naughtiest city thats known on the globe twas amazing twas scandalous lost in surprise some opened their mouths and a few shut their eyes  but hark at the moment miss addie de laine circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse which brought her fair form to the window again from the arms of her partner incautiously slips and a shriek fills the air and the music is still and the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn still frenziedly points from the wide windowsill into space and the night for miss addie was gone  gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun gone like the grain when the reaper is done gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass gone without parting farewell and alas gone with a flavor of hydrogen gas  when the weather is pleasant you frequently meet a whiteheaded man slowly pacing the street his trembling hand shading his lacklustre eye half blind with continually scanning the sky  rumor points him as some astronomical sage reperusing by day the celestial page but the reader sagacious will recognize brown

1868    very fair and full of promise lay the island of st thomas ocean oer its reefs and bars hid its elemental scars groves of cocoanut and guava grew above its fields of lava so the gem of the antilles isles of eden where no ill is like a great green turtle slumbered on the sea that it encumbered then said william henry seward as he cast his eye to leeward quite important to our commerce is this island of st thomas  said the mountain ranges thankee but we cannot stand the yankee oer our scars and fissures poring in our very vitals boring in our sacred caverns prying all our secret problems trying digging blasting with dynamit mocking all our thunders damn it other lands may be more civil bust our lava crust if we will  said the seaits white teeth gnashing through its coralreef lips flashing shall i let this scheming mortal shut with stone my shining portal curb my tide and check my play fence with wharves my shining bay rather let me be drawn out in one awful waterspout  said the blackbrowed hurricane brooding down the spanish main shall i see my forces zounds measured by square inch and pounds with detectives at my back when i double on my track and my secret paths made clear published oer the hemisphere to each gaping prying crew shall i blow me if i do  so the mountains shook and thundered and the hurricane came sweeping and the people stared and wondered as the sea came on them leaping each according to his promise made things lively at st thomas  till one morn when mr seward cast his weather eye to leeward there was not an inch of dry land left to mark his recent island  not a flagstaff or a sentry not a wharf or port of entry onlyto cut matters shorter just a patch of muddy water in the open ocean lying and a gull above it flying     the ballad of mr cooke  a legend of the cliff house san francisco    where the sturdy ocean breeze drives the spray of roaring seas that the cliffhouse balconies                 overlook  there in spite of rain that balked with his sandals duly chalked once upon a tightrope walked                 mr cooke  but the jesters lightsome mien and his spangles and his sheen all had vanished when the scene                 he forsook  yet in some delusive hope in some vague desire to cope one still came to view the rope                 walked by cooke  amid beautys bright array on that strange eventful day partly hidden from the spray                 in a nook  stood florinda vere de vere who with winddishevelled hair and a rapt distracted air                 gazed on cooke  then she turned and quickly cried

thats cooke  haughtily that young man spoke i descend from noble folk seven oaks and then sennoak                 lastly snook  is the way my name i trace shall a youth of noble race in affairs of love give place                 to a cooke  clifford snook i know thy claim to that lineage and name and i think ive read the same                 in horne tooke  but i swear by all divine never never to be thine till thou canst upon yon line                 walk like cooke  though to that gymnastic feat he no closer might compete than to strike a balancesheet                 in a book  yet thenceforward from that day he his figure would display in some wild athletic way                 after cooke  on some household eminence on a clothesline or a fence over ditches drains and thence                 oer a brook  he by high ambition led ever walked and balanced till the people wondering said                 how like cooke  step by step did he proceed nerved by valor not by greed and at last the crowning deed                 undertook  misty was the midnight air and the cliff was bleak and bare when he came to do and dare                 just like cooke  through the darkness oer the flow stretched the line where he should go straight across as flies the crow                 or the rook  one wild glance around he cast then he faced the ocean blast and he strode the cable last                 touched by cooke  vainly roared the angry seas vainly blew the ocean breeze but alas the walkers knees                 had a crook  and before he reached the rock did they both together knock and he stumbled with a shock                 unlike cooke  downward dropping in the dark like an arrow to its mark or a fishpole when a shark                 bites the hook  dropped the pole he could not save dropped the walker and the wave swift ingulfed the rival brave                 of j cooke  came a roar across the sea of sealions in their glee in a tongue remarkably                 like chinnook  and the maddened seagull seemed still to utter as he screamed perish thus the wretch who deemed                 himself cooke  but on misty moonlit nights comes a skeleton in tights walks once more the giddy heights                 he mistook  and unseen to mortal eyes purged of grosser earthly ties now at last in spirit guise                 outdoes cooke  still the sturdy ocean breeze sweeps the spray of roaring seas where the cliffhouse balconies                 overlook  and the maidens in their prime reading of this mournful rhyme weep where in the olden time

being the only genuine sequel to maud muller    maud muller all that summer day raked the meadow sweet with hay  yet looking down the distant lane she hoped the judge would come again  but when he came with smile and bow maud only blushed and stammered haow  and spoke of her pa and wondered whether hed give consent they should wed together  old muller burst in tears and then begged that the judge would lend him ten  for trade was dull and wages low and the craps this year were somewhat slow  and ere the languid summer died sweet maud became the judges bride  but on the day that they were mated mauds brother bob was intoxicated  and mauds relations twelve in all were very drunk at the judges hall  and when the summer came again the young bride bore him babies twain  and the judge was blest but thought it strange that bearing children made such a change  for maud grew broad and red and stout and the waist that his arm once clasped about  was more than he now could span and he sighed as he pondered ruefully  how that which in maud was native grace in mrs jenkins was out of place  and thought of the twins and wished that they looked less like the man who raked the hay  on mullers farm and dreamed with pain of the day he wandered down the lane  and looking down that dreary track he half regretted that he came back  for had he waited he might have wed some maiden fair and thoroughbred  for there be women fair as she whose verbs and nouns do more agree  alas for maiden alas for judge and the sentimentalthats onehalf fudge  for maud soon thought the judge a bore with all his learning and all his lore  and the judge would have bartered mauds fair face for more refinement and social grace  if of all words of tongue and pen the saddest are it might have been  more

street and there being several thousandbut this subject why pursue tis with perkins and not johnson that today we have to do  no not wild promiscuous treating not the winecups ruby flow but the female of his species brought the noble perkins low twas a wild poetic fervor and excess of sentiment that left the noble perkins in a week without a cent  milton perkins said the siren not thy wealth do i admire but the intellect that flashes from those eyes of opal fire and methinks the name thou bearest surely cannot be misplaced and embrace me mister perkins milton perkins her embraced  but i grieve to state that even then as she was wiping dry the tear of sensibility in milton perkins eye she prigged his diamond bosompin and that her wipe of lace did seem to have of chloroform a most suspicious

went through him like an unresisting child   moral  now one word to pogonippers ere this subject i resign in this tale of milton perkinslate an owner in white pine you shall see that wealth and women

ponder and stare why are my eyelids so open and wild only the better to see with my child only the better and clearer to view cheeks that are rosy and eyes that are blue  dost thou still wonder and ask why these arms fill thy soft bosom with tender alarms swaying so wickedlyare they misplaced clasping or shielding some delicate waist hands whose coarse sinews may fill you with fear only the better protect you my dear  little red ridinghood when in the street why do i press your small hand when we meet why when you timidly offered your cheek why did i sigh and why didnt i speak why well you seeif the truth must appear im not your grandmother ridinghood dear     the ritualist  by a communicant of st jamess    he wore i think a chasuble the day when first we met a stole and snowy alb likewise i recollect it yet he called me daughter as he raised his jewelled hand to bless and then in thrilling undertones he asked would i confess  o mother dear blame not your child if then on bended knees i dropped and thought of abelard and also eloise or when beside the altar high he bowed before the pyx i envied that seraphic kiss he gave the crucifix  the cruel world may think it wrong perhaps may deem me weak and speaking of that sainted man may call his conduct cheek and like that wicked barrister whom cousin harry quotes may term his mixèd chalice grog his vestments petticoats  but whatsoeer they do or say ill build a christians hope on incense and on altarlights on chasuble and cope let others prove by precedent the faith that they profess his cant be wrong thats symbolized by such becoming dress     a moral vindicator    if mr jones lycurgus b had one peculiar quality twas his severe advocacy of conjugal fidelity  his views of heaven were very free his views of life were painfully ridiculous but fervently he dwelt on marriage sanctity  he frequently went on a spree but in his wildest revelry on this especial subject he betrayed no ambiguity  and though at times lycurgus b did lay his hands not lovingly upon his wife the sanctity of wedlock was his guaranty  but mrs jones declined to see affairs in the same light as he and quietly got a decree divorcing her from that l b  and what did jones lycurgus b with his known idiosyncrasy he smileda bitter smile to see and drew the weapon of bowie  he did what sickles did to key what cole on hiscock wrought did he in fact on persons twentythree he proved the marriage sanctity  the counsellor who took the fee the witnesses and referee the judge who granted the decree died in that wholesale butchery  and then when jones lycurgus b had wiped the weapon of bowie twelve jurymen did instantly acquit and set lycurgus free     songs without sense  for the parlor and piano    ithe personified sentimental   affections charm no longer gilds   the idol of the shrine but cold oblivion seeks to fill   regrets ambrosial wine though friendships offering buried lies   neath cold aversions snow regard and faith will ever bloom   perpetually below  i see thee whirl in marble halls   in pleasures giddy train remorse is never on that brow   nor sorrows mark of pain deceit has marked thee for her own   inconstancy the same and ruin wildly sheds its gleam   athwart thy path of shame    iithe homely pathetic   the dews are heavy on my brow   my breath comes hard and low yet mother dear grant one request   before your boy must go oh lift me ere my spirit sinks   and ere my senses fail place me once more o mother dear   astride the old fencerail  the old fencerail the old fencerail   how oft these youthful legs with alice and ben bolts were hung   across those wooden pegs twas there the nauseating smoke   of my first pipe arose o mother dear these agonies   are far less keen than those  i know where lies the hazel dell   where simple nellie sleeps i know the cot of nettie moore   and where the willow weeps i know the brookside and the mill   but all their pathos fails beside the days when once i sat   astride the old fencerails    iiiswiss air   im a gay tra la la with my fal lal la la and my bright and my light   tra la le   repeat  then laugh ha ha ha and ring ting ling ling and sing fal la la   la la le   repeat
