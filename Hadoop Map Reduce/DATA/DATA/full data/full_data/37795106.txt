37795106	captains all  by ww jacobs    the boatswains mate  illustration the boatswains mate  mr george benn retired boatswain sighed noisily and with a despondent gesture turned to the door and stood with the handle in his hand mrs waters sitting behind the tiny bar in a tall windsorchair eyed him with some heat  my feelingsll never change said the boatswain  nor mine either said the landlady sharply  its a strange thing mr benn but you always ask me to marry you after the third mug  its only to get my courage up pleaded the boatswain  next time ill do it afore i ave a drop thatll prove to you im in earnest  he stepped outside and closed the door before the landlady could make a selection from the many retorts that crowded to her lips  after the cool bar with its smell of damp sawdust the road seemed hot and dusty but the boatswain a prey to gloom natural to a man whose hand has been refused five times in a fortnight walked on unheeding  his steps lagged but his brain was active  he walked for two miles deep in thought and then coming to a shady bank took a seat upon an inviting piece of turf and lit his pipe  the heat and the drowsy hum of bees made him nod his pipe hung from the corner of his mouth and his eyes closed  he opened them at the sound of approaching footsteps and feeling in his pocket for matches gazed lazily at the intruder  he saw a tall man carrying a small bundle over his shoulder and in the erect carriage the keen eyes and bronzed face had little difficulty in detecting the old soldier  the stranger stopped as he reached the seated boatswain and eyed him pleasantly  got a pipe o baccy mate he inquired  the boatswain handed him the small metal box in which he kept that luxury  lobster aint you he said affably  the tall man nodded  was he replied  now im my own commanderin chief  padding it suggested the boatswain taking the box from him and refilling his pipe  the other nodded and with the air of one disposed to conversation dropped his bundle in the ditch and took a seat beside him  ive got plenty of time he remarked  mr benn nodded and for a while smoked on in silence  a dim idea which had been in his mind for some time began to clarify  he stole a glance at his companiona man of about thirtyeight clear eyes with humorous wrinkles at the corners a heavy moustache and a cheerful expression more than tinged with recklessness  aint over and above fond o work suggested the boatswain when he had finished his inspection  i love it said the other blowing a cloud of smoke in the air but we cant have all we want in this world it wouldnt be good for us  the boatswain thought of mrs waters and sighed  then he rattled his pocket  would arf a quid be any good to you he inquired  look here began the soldier just because i asked you for a pipe o baccy  no offence said the other quickly  i mean if you earned it  the soldier nodded and took his pipe from his mouth  gardening and windows he hazarded with a shrug of his shoulders  the boatswain shook his head  scrubbing praps said the soldier with a sigh of resignation last house i scrubbed out i did it so thoroughly they accused me of pouching the soap  hang em  and you didnt queried the boatswain eyeing him keenly  the soldier rose and knocking the ashes out of his pipe gazed at him darkly  i cant give it back to you he said slowly because ive smoked some of it and i cant pay you for it because ive only got twopence and that i want for myself  so long matey and next time a poor wretch asks you for a pipe be civil  i never see such a man for taking offence in all my born days expostulated the boatswain  i ad my reasons for that remark mate good reasons they was  the soldier grunted and stooping picked up his bundle  i spoke of arf a sovereign just now continued the boatswain impressively and when i tell you that i offer it to you to do a bit o burgling youll see ow necessary it is for me to be certain of your honesty  burgling gasped the astonished soldier  honesty  struth are you drunk or am i  meaning said the boatswain waving the imputation away with his hand for you to pretend to be a burglar  were both drunk thats what it is said the other resignedly  the boatswain fidgeted  if you dont agree mums the word and no arm done he said holding out his hand  mums the word said the soldier taking it  my names ned travers and barring cells for a spree now and again theres nothing against it mind that  might appen to anybody said mr benn soothingly  you fill your pipe and dont go chucking good tobacco away agin  mr travers took the offered box and with economy born of adversity stooped and filled up first with the plug he had thrown away  then he resumed his seat and leaning back luxuriously bade the other fire away  i aint got it all shipshape and proper yet said mr benn slowly but its in my minds eye  its been there off and on like for some time  he lit his pipe again and gazed fixedly at the opposite hedge  two miles from here where i live he said after several vigorous puffs theres a little publicouse called the beehive kept by a lady wot ive got my eye on  the soldier sat up  she wont ave me said the boatswain with an air of mild surprise  the soldier leaned back again  shes a lone widder continued mr benn shaking his head and the beehive is in a lonely place  its right through the village and the nearest house is arf a mile off  silly place for a pub commented mr travers  ive been telling her ow unsafe it is said the boatswain  ive been telling her that she wants a man to protect her and she only laughs at me  she dont believe it dye see  likewise im a small mansmall but stiff  she likes tall men  most women do said mr travers sitting upright and instinctively twisting his moustache  when i was in the ranks  my idea is continued the boatswain slightly raising his voice to kill two birds with one stoneprove to her that she does want being protected and that im the man to protect her  dye take my meaning mate  the soldier reached out a hand and felt the others biceps  like a lump o wood he said approvingly  my opinion is said the boatswain with a faint smirk that she loves me without knowing it  they often do said mr travers with a grave shake of his head  consequently i dont want er to be disappointed said the other  it does you credit remarked mr travers  ive got a good head said mr benn else i shouldnt ave got my rating as boatswain as soon as i did and ive been turning it over in my mind over and over agin till my brainpan fair aches with it  now if you do what i want you to tonight and it comes off all right damme ill make it a quid  go on vanderbilt said mr travers im listening  the boatswain gazed at him fixedly  you meet me ere in this spot at eleven oclock tonight he said solemnly and ill take you to her ouse and put you through a little winder i know of  you goes upstairs and alarms her and she screams for help  im watching the house faithfullike and hear er scream  i dashes in at the winder knocks you down and rescues her  dye see  i hear corrected mr travers coldly  she clings to me continued the boatswain with a rapt expression of face in her gratitood and proud of my strength and pluck she marries me  an i get a five years honeymoon said the soldier  the boatswain shook his head and patted the others shoulder  in the excitement of the moment you spring up and escape he said with a kindly smile  ive thought it all out  you can run much faster than i can anyways you will  the nearest ouse is arf a mile off as i said and her servant is staying till tomorrow at er mothers ten miles away  mr travers rose to his feet and stretched himself  time i was toddling he said with a yawn  thanks for amusing me mate  you wont do it said the boatswain eyeing him with much concern  im hanged if i do said the soldier emphatically  accidents will happen and then where should i be  if they did said the boatswain id own up and clear you  you might said mr travers and then again you mightnt  so long mate  iill make it two quid said the boatswain trembling with eagerness  ive took a fancy to you youre just the man for the job  the soldier adjusting his bundle glanced at him over his shoulder thankee he said with mock gratitude  look ere said the boatswain springing up and catching him by the sleeve ill give it to you in writing  come you aint fainthearted why a bluejacket ud do it for the fun o the thing  if i give it to you in writing and there should be an accident its worse for me than it is for you aint it  mr travers hesitated and pushing his cap back scratched his head  i gives you the two quid afore you go into the house continued the boatswain hastily following up the impression he had made  id give em to you now if id got em with me  thats my confidence in you i likes the look of you  soldier or sailor when there is a mans work to be done give em to me afore anybody  illustration i gives you the two quid afore you go into the house continued the boatswain  the soldier seated himself again and let his bundle fall to the ground go on he said slowly  write it out fair and square and sign it and im your man  the boatswain clapped him on the shoulder and produced a bundle of papers from his pocket  theres letters there with my name and address on em he said  its all fair square and aboveboard  when youve cast your eyes over them ill give you the writing  mr travers took them and relighting his pipe smoked in silence with various side glances at his companion as that enthusiast sucked his pencil and sat twisting in the agonies of composition  the document finishedafter several failures had been retrieved and burnt by the careful mr traversthe boatswain heaved a sigh of relief and handing it over to him leaned back with a complacent air while he read it  seems all right said the soldier folding it up and putting it in his waistcoatpocket  ill be here at eleven tonight  eleven it is said the boatswain briskly and between palsheres arf a dollar to go on with  he patted him on the shoulder again and with a caution to keep out of sight as much as possible till night walked slowly home  his step was light but he carried a face in which care and exultation were strangely mingled  by ten oclock that night care was in the ascendant and by eleven when he discerned the red glow of mr traverss pipe set as a beacon against a dark background of hedge the boatswain was ready to curse his inventive powers  mr travers greeted him cheerily and honestly attributing the fact to good food and a couple of pints of beer he had had since the boatswain left him said that he was ready for anything  mr benn grunted and led the way in silence  there was no moon but the night was clear and mr travers after one or two lighthearted attempts at conversation abandoned the effort and fell to whistling softly instead  except for one lighted window the village slept in darkness but the boatswain who had been walking with the stealth of a red indian on the warpath breathed more freely after they had left it behind  a renewal of his antics a little farther on apprised mr travers that they were approaching their destination and a minute or two later they came to a small inn standing just off the road  all shut up and mrs waters abed bless her whispered the boatswain after walking carefully round the house  how do you feel  im all right said mr travers  i feel as if id been burgling all my life  how do you feel  narvous said mr benn pausing under a small window at the rear of the house  this is the one  mr travers stepped back a few paces and gazed up at the house  all was still  for a few moments he stood listening and then rejoined the boatswain  goodbye mate he said hoisting himself on to the sill  death or victory  the boatswain whispered and thrust a couple of sovereigns into his hand take your time theres no hurry he muttered  i want to pull myself together  frighten er enough but not too much  when she screams ill come in  mr travers slipped inside and then thrust his head out of the window wont she think it funny you should be so handy he inquired  no its my faithful art said the boatswain keeping watch over her every night thats the ticket  she wont know no better  mr travers grinned and removing his boots passed them out to the other we dont want her to hear me till im upstairs he whispered  put em outside handy for me to pick up  the boatswain obeyed and mr traverswho was by no means a good hand at darning socksshivered as he trod lightly over a stone floor  then following the instructions of mr benn he made his way to the stairs and mounted noiselessly  but for a slight stumble halfway up his progress was very creditable for an amateur  he paused and listened and all being silent made his way to the landing and stopped outside a door  despite himself his heart was beating faster than usual  he pushed the door open slowly and started as it creaked  nothing happening he pushed again and standing just inside saw by a small ewer silhouetted against the casement that he was in a bedroom  he listened for the sound of breathing but in vain  quiet sleeper he reflected or perhaps it is an empty room  now i wonder whether  the sound of an opening door made him start violently and he stood still scarcely breathing with his ears on the alert  a light shone on the landing and peeping round the door he saw a woman coming along the corridora younger and betterlooking woman than he had expected to see  in one hand she held aloft a candle in the other she bore a doublebarrelled gun  mr travers withdrew into the room and as the light came nearer slipped into a big cupboard by the side of the fireplace and standing bolt upright waited  the light came into the room  must have been my fancy said a pleasant voice  bless her smiled mr travers  his trained ear recognized the sound of cocking triggers  the next moment a heavy body bumped against the door of the cupboard and the key turned in the lock  got you said the voice triumphantly  keep still if you try and break out i shall shoot you  all right said mr travers hastily i wont move  better not said the voice  mind ive got a gun pointing straight at you  point it downwards theres a good girl said mr travers earnestly and take your finger off the trigger  if anything happened to me youd never forgive yourself  its all right so long as you dont move said the voice and im not a girl it added sternly  yes you are said the prisoner  i saw you  i thought it was an angel at first  i saw your little bare feet and  a faint scream interrupted him  youll catch cold urged mr travers  dont you trouble about me said the voice tartly  i wont give any trouble said mr travers who began to think it was time for the boatswain to appear on the scene  why dont you call for help  ill go like a lamb  i dont want your advice was the reply  i know what to do  now dont you try and break out  im going to fire one barrel out of the window but ive got the other one for you if you move  my dear girl protested the horrified mr travers youll alarm the neighbourhood  just what i want to do said the voice  keep still mind  mr travers hesitated  the game was up and it was clear that in any case the stratagem of the ingenious mr benn would have to be disclosed  stop he said earnestly  dont do anything rash  im not a burglar im doing this for a friend of yoursmr benn  what said an amazed voice  true as i stand here asseverated mr travers  here heres my instructions  ill put em under the door and if you go to the back window youll see him in the garden waiting  he rustled the paper under the door and it was at once snatched from his fingers  he regained an upright position and stood listening to the startled and indignant exclamations of his gaoler as she read the boatswains permit       this is to give notice that i george benn being of sound mind      and body have told ned travers to pretend to be a burglar at mrs      waterss  he aint a burglar and i shall be outside all the time      its all aboveboard and shipshape       signed george benn  sound mindaboveboardshipshape repeated a dazed voice  where is he  out at the back replied mr travers  if you go to the window you can see him  now do put something round your shoulders theres a good girl  there was no reply but a board creaked  he waited for what seemed a long time and then the board creaked again  did you see him he inquired  i did was the sharp reply  you both ought to be ashamed of yourselves  you ought to be punished  there is a clothespeg sticking into the back of my head remarked mr travers  what are you going to do  there was no reply  what are you going to do repeated mr travers somewhat uneasily you look too nice to do anything hard leastways so far as i can judge through this crack  there was a smothered exclamation and then sounds of somebody moving hastily about the room and the swish of clothing hastily donned  you ought to have done it before commented the thoughtful mr travers its enough to give you your death of cold  mind your business said the voice sharply  now if i let you out will you promise to do exactly as i tell you  honour bright said mr travers fervently  im going to give mr benn a lesson he wont forget proceeded the other grimly  im going to fire off this gun and then run down and tell him ive killed you  eh  said the amazed mr travers  oh lord  hsh  stop that laughing commanded the voice  hell hear you  be quiet  the key turned in the lock and mr travers stepping forth clapped his hand over his mouth and endeavoured to obey  mrs waters stepping back with the gun ready scrutinized him closely  come on to the landing said mr travers eagerly  we dont want anybody else to hear  fire into this  he snatched a patchwork rug from the floor and stuck it up against the balusters  you stay here said mrs waters  he nodded  she pointed the gun at the hearthrug the walls shook with the explosion and with a shriek that set mr traverss teeth on edge she rushed downstairs and drawing back the bolts of the back door tottered outside and into the arms of the agitated boatswain  oh oh oh she cried  whatwhats the matter gasped the boatswain  the widow struggled in his arms  a burglar she said in a tense whisper  but its all right ive killed him  kill stuttered the other  killkilled him  mrs waters nodded and released herself first shot she said with a satisfied air  the boatswain wrung his hands  good heavens he said moving slowly towards the door  poor fellow  come back said the widow tugging at his coat  i waswas going to seewhether i could do anything for im quavered the boatswain  poor fellow  you stay where you are commanded mrs waters  i dont want any witnesses  i dont want this house to have a bad name  im going to keep it quiet  quiet said the shaking boatswain  how  first thing to do said the widow thoughtfully is to get rid of the body  ill bury him in the garden i think  theres a very good bit of ground behind those potatoes  youll find the spade in the toolhouse  the horrified mr benn stood stockstill regarding her  while youre digging the grave continued mrs waters calmly ill go in and clean up the mess  the boatswain reeled and then fumbled with trembling fingers at his collar  like a man in a dream he stood watching as she ran to the toolhouse and returned with a spade and pick like a man in a dream he followed her on to the garden  be careful she said sharply youre treading down my potatoes  the boatswain stopped dead and stared at her  apparently unconscious of his gaze she began to pace out the measurements and then placing the tools in his hands urged him to lose no time  ill bring him down when youre gone she said looking towards the house  the boatswain wiped his damp brow with the back of his hand  how are you going to get it downstairs he breathed  drag it said mrs waters briefly  suppose he isnt dead said the boatswain with a gleam of hope  fiddlesticks said mrs waters  do you think i dont know  now dont waste time talking and mind you dig it deep  ill put a few cabbages on top afterwardsive got more than i want  she reentered the house and ran lightly upstairs  the candle was still alight and the gun was leaning against the bedpost but the visitor had disappeared  conscious of an odd feeling of disappointment she looked round the empty room  come and look at him entreated a voice and she turned and beheld the amused countenance of her late prisoner at the door  ive been watching from the back window he said nodding  youre a wonder thats what you are  come and look at him  mrs waters followed and leaning out of the window watched with simple pleasure the efforts of the amateur sexton  mr benn was digging like one possessed only pausing at intervals to straighten his back and to cast a fearsome glance around him  the only thing that marred her pleasure was the behaviour of mr travers who was struggling for a place with all the fervour of a citizen at the lord mayors show  get back she said in a fierce whisper  hell see you  mr travers with obvious reluctance obeyed just as the victim looked up  is that you mrs waters inquired the boatswain fearfully  yes of course it is snapped the widow  who else should it be do you think  go on  what are you stopping for  mr benns breathing as he bent to his task again was distinctly audible the head of mr travers ranged itself once more alongside the widows for a long time they watched in silence  wont you come down here mrs waters called the boatswain looking up so suddenly that mr traverss head bumped painfully against the side of the window  its a bit creepy all alone  im all right said mrs waters  i keep fancying theres something dodging behind them currant bushes pursued the unfortunate mr benn hoarsely  how you can stay there alone i cant think  i thought i saw something looking over your shoulder just now  fancy if it came creeping up behind and caught hold of you  the widow gave a sudden faint scream  if you do that again she said turning fiercely on mr travers  he put it into my head said the culprit humbly i should never have thought of such a thing by myself  im one of the quietest and bestbehaved  make haste mr benn said the widow turning to the window again ive got a lot to do when youve finished  the boatswain groaned and fell to digging again and mrs waters after watching a little while longer gave mr travers some pointed instructions about the window and went down to the garden again  that will do i think she said stepping into the hole and regarding it critically  now youd better go straight off home and mind not a word to a soul about this  she put her hand on his shoulder and noticing with pleasure that he shuddered at her touch led the way to the gate  the boatswain paused for a moment as though about to speak and then apparently thinking better of it bade her goodbye in a hoarse voice and walked feebly up the road  mrs waters stood watching until his steps died away in the distance and then returning to the garden took up the spade and stood regarding with some dismay the mountainous result of his industry  mr travers who was standing just inside the back door joined her  let me he said gallantly  the day was breaking as he finished his task  the clean sweet air and the exercise had given him an appetite to which the smell of cooking bacon and hot coffee that proceeded from the house had set a sharper edge  he took his coat from a bush and put it on  mrs waters appeared at the door  you had better come in and have some breakfast before you go she said brusquely theres no more sleep for me now  mr travers obeyed with alacrity and after a satisfying wash in the scullery came into the big kitchen with his face shining and took a seat at the table  the cloth was neatly laid and mrs waters fresh and cool with a smile upon her pleasant face sat behind the tray  she looked at her guest curiously mr traverss spirits being somewhat higher than the state of his wardrobe appeared to justify  why dont you get some settled work she inquired with gentle severity as he imparted snatches of his history between bites  easier said than done said mr travers serenely  but dont you run away with the idea that im a beggar because im not  i pay my way such as it is  and bythebye i spose i havent earned that two pounds benn gave me  his face lengthened and he felt uneasily in his pocket  ill give them to him when im tired of the joke said the widow holding out her hand and watching him closely  mr travers passed the coins over to her  soft hand youve got he said musingly  i dont wonder benn was desperate  i dare say i should have done the same in his place  mrs waters bit her lip and looked out at the window mr travers resumed his breakfast  theres only one job that im really fit for now that im too old for the army he said confidentially as breakfast finished he stood at the door ready to depart  playing at burglars hazarded mrs waters  landlord of a little country publichouse said mr travers simply  mrs waters fell back and regarded him with openeyed amazement  good morning she said as soon as she could trust her voice  goodbye said mr travers reluctantly  i should like to hear how old benn takes this joke though  mrs waters retreated into the house and stood regarding him  if youre passing this way again and like to look inill tell you she said after a long pause  goodbye  ill look in in a weeks time said mr travers  he took the proffered hand and shook it warmly  it would be the best joke of all he said turning away  what would  the soldier confronted her again  for old benn to come round here one evening and find me landlord  think it over  mrs waters met his gaze soberly  ill think it over when you have gone she said softly  now go
