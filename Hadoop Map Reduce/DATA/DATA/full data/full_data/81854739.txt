the waves   britons never will be slaves         alfred a masque by james thomson    o sophonisba sophonisba o      sophonisba a tragedy by the same author   to  miss julia maugham       the hero     i   colonel parsons sat by the window in the diningroom to catch the last glimmer of the fading day looking through his standard to make sure that he had overlooked no part of it finally with a little sigh he folded it up and taking off his spectacles put them in their case  have you finished the paper asked his wife  yes i think ive read it all theres nothing in it  he looked out of window at the wellkept drive that led to the house and at the trim laurel bushes which separated the front garden from the village green his eyes rested with a happy smile upon the triumphal arch which decorated the gate for the homecoming of his son expected the next day from south africa mrs parsons knitted diligently at a sock for her husband working with quick and clever fingers he watched the rapid glint of the needles  youll try your eyes if you go on much longer with this light my dear  oh i dont require to see replied his wife with a gentle affectionate smile but she stopped rather tired and laying the sock on the table smoothed it out with her hand  i shouldnt mind if you made it a bit higher in the leg than the last pair  how high would you like it  she went to the window so that the colonel might show the exact length he desired and when he had made up his mind sat down again quietly on her chair by the fireside with hands crossed on her lap waiting placidly for the maid to bring the lamp  mrs parsons was a tall woman of fiftyfive carrying herself with a certain diffidence as though a little ashamed of her stature greater than the colonels it had seemed to her through life that those extra inches savoured after a fashion of disrespect she knew it was her duty spiritually to look up to her husband yet physically she was always forced to look down and eager to prevent even the remotest suspicion of wrongdoing she had taken care to be so submissive in her behaviour as to leave no doubt that she recognised the obligation of respectful obedience enjoined by the bible and confirmed by her own conscience mrs parsons was the gentlest of creatures and the most kindhearted she looked upon her husband with great and unalterable affection admiring intensely both his head and his heart he was her type of the upright man walking in the ways of the lord you saw in the placid smooth brow of the colonels wife in her calm eyes even in the severe arrangement of the hair parted in the middle and drawn back that her character was frank simple and straightforward she was a woman to whom evil had never offered the smallest attraction she was merely aware of its existence theoretically to her the only way of life had been that which led to god the others had been nonexistent duty had one hand only and only one finger and that finger had always pointed definitely in one direction yet mrs parsons had a firm mouth and a chin square enough to add another impression as she sat motionless hands crossed watching her husband with loving eyes you might have divined that however kindhearted she was not indulgent neither lenient to her own faults nor to those of others perfectly unassuming but with a sense of duty a feeling of the absolute rightness of some deeds and of the absolute wrongness of others which would be even to those she loved best in the world utterly unsparing  heres a telegraph boy said colonel parsons suddenly jamie cant have arrived yet  oh richmond  mrs parsons sprang from her chair and a colour brightened her pale cheeks her heart beat painfully and tears of eager expectation filled her eyes  its probably only from william to say the ship is signalled said the colonel to quieten her but his own voice trembled with anxiety  nothing can have happened richmond can it said mrs parsons her cheeks blanching again at the idea  no no of course not how silly you are the telegram was brought in by the servant i cant see without a light said the colonel  oh give it me i can see quite well  mrs parsons took it to the window and with trembling hand tore it open  arriving tonight 725jamie  mrs parson looked for one moment at her husband and then unable to restrain herself sank on a chair and hiding her face with her hands burst into tears  come come frances said the colonel trying to smile but half choked with his own emotion dont cry you ought to laugh when you know the boys coming home  he patted her on the shoulder and she took his hand holding it for comfort with the other the colonel loudly blew his nose at last mrs parsons dried her eyes  oh i thank god that its all over hes coming home i hope we shall never have to endure again that anxiety it makes me tremble still when i think how we used to long for the paper to come and dread it how we used to look all through the list of casualties fearing to see the boys name  well well its all over now said the colonel cheerily blowing his nose again how pleased mary will be  it was characteristic of him that almost his first thought was of the pleasure this earlier arrival would cause to mary clibborn the girl to whom for five years his son had been engaged  yes said mrs parson but shell be dreadfully disappointed not to be here shes gone to the polsons in tunbridge wells and she wont be home till after supper  that is a pity im afraid its too late to go and meet him its nearly seven already  oh yes and its damp this evening i dont think you ought to go out  then mrs parsons roused herself to household matters  theres the supper to think of richmond she said weve only the rest of the cold mutton and theres not time to cook one of tomorrows chickens  they had invited three or four friends to dinner on the following day to celebrate the return of their son and mrs parsons had laid in for the occasion a store of solid things  well we might try and get some chops i expect howe is open still  yes ill send betty out and we can have a blancmange for a sweet  mrs parsons went to give the necessary orders and the colonel walked up to his sons room to see for the hundredth time that everything was in order they had discussed for days the question whether the young soldier should be given the best spare bedroom or that which he had used from his boyhood it was wonderful the thought they expended in preparing everything as they fancied he would like it no detail slipped their memory and they arranged and rearranged so that he should find nothing altered in his absence they attempted to satisfy in this manner the eager longing of their hearts it made them both a little happier to know that they were actually doing something for their son no pain in love is so hard to bear as that which comes from the impossibility of doing any service for the wellbeloved and no service is so repulsive that love cannot make it delightful and easy they had not seen him for five years their only child for he had gone from sandhurst straight to india and thence on the outbreak of war to the cape no one knew how much the lonely parents had felt the long separation how eagerly they awaited his letters how often they read them      but it was more than parental affection which caused the passionate interest they took in jamies career they looked to him to restore the good name which his father had lost four generations of parsons had been in the army and had borne themselves with honour to their family and with credit to themselves it was a fine record that colonel parsons inherited of brave men and good soldiers and he the truest bravest most honourable of them all had dragged the name through the dust had been forced from the service under a storm of obloquy disgraced dishonoured ruined  colonel parsons had done the greater portion of his service creditably enough he had always put his god before the war office but the result had not been objectionable he looked upon his men with fatherly affection and the regiment under his command was almost a model of propriety and seemliness his influence was invariably for good and his subordinates knew that in him they had always a trusty friend few men had gained more love he was a mild eventempered fellow and in no circumstance of life forgot to love his neighbour as himself he never allowed it to slip his memory that even the lowest caste native had an immortal soul and before god equal rights with him colonel parsons was a man whose piety was so unaggressive so goodhumoured so simple that none could resist it ribaldry and blasphemy were instinctively hushed in his presence and even the most hardened ruffian was softened by his contact  but a couple of years before he would naturally have been put on halfpay under the age limit a little expedition was arranged against some unruly hilltribes and colonel parsons was given the command he took the enemy by surprise finding them at the foot of the hills and cut off by means of flanking bodies their retreat through the two passes behind he placed his guns on a line of hillocks to the right and held the tribesmen in the hollow of his hand he could have massacred them all but nothing was farther from his thoughts he summoned them to surrender and towards evening the headmen came in and agreed to give up their rifles next day the night was cold and dark and stormy the good colonel was delighted with the success both of his stratagem and of his humanity he had not shed a single drop of blood  treat them well he said and theyll treat you better  he acted like a gentleman and a christian but the enemy were neither he never dreamed that he was being completely overreached that the natives were using the delay he had unsuspectingly granted to send over the hills urgent messages for help through the night armed men had been coming stealthily silently from all sides and in the early morning before dawn his flanking parties were attacked colonel parsons rather astonished sent them help and thinking himself still superior in numbers to the rebellious tribesmen attacked their main body they wanted nothing better falling back slowly they drew him into the mountain defiles until he found himself entrapped his little force was surrounded five hours were passed in almost blind confusion men were shot down like flies by an enemy they could not see and when by desperate fighting they managed to cut their way out fifty were killed and over a hundred more were wounded  colonel parsons escaped with only the remnants of the fine force he had commanded and they were nerveless broken almost panicstricken he was obliged to retreat the colonel was a brave man he did what he could to prevent the march from becoming a disorderly rout he gathered his men together put courage into them risked his life a dozen times but nothing could disguise the fact that his failure was disastrous it was a small affair and was hushed up but the consequences were not to be forgotten the hilltribes emboldened by their success became more venturesome more unruly a disturbance which might have been settled without difficulty now required a large force to put it down and ten times more lives were lost  colonel parsons was required to send in his papers and left india a broken man he came back to england and settled in his fathers house at little primpton his agony continued and looking into the future he saw only hideous despair unavailing regret for months he could bear to see no one imagining always that he was pointed out as the man whose folly had cost so many lives when he heard people laugh he thought it was in scorn of him when he saw compassion in their eyes he could scarcely restrain his tears he was indeed utterly broken he walked in his garden away from the eyes of his fellows up and down continually turning over in his mind the events of that terrible week and he could not console himself by thinking that any other course would have led to just as bad results his error was too plain he could put his finger exactly on the point of his failure and say o god why did i do it and as he walked restlessly unmindful of heat and cold the tears ran down his thin cheeks painful and scalding he would not take his wifes comfort  you acted for the best richmond she said  yes dear i acted for the best when i got those fellows hemmed in i could have killed them all but im not a butcher i couldnt have them shot down in cold blood thats not war thats murder what should i have said to my maker when he asked me to account for those many souls i spared them i imagined theyd understand but they thought it was weakness i couldnt know they were preparing a trap for me and now my name is shameful i shall never hold up my head again  you acted rightly in the sight of god richmond  i think and trust i acted as a christian frances  if you have pleased god you need not mind the opinion of man  oh its not that they called me a fool and a cowardi could have borne that i did what i thought was right i thought it my duty to save the lives of my men and to spare the enemy and the result was that ten times more lives have been lost than if i had struck boldly and mercilessly there are widows and orphans in england who must curse me because i am the cause that their husbands are dead and that their fathers are rotting on the hills of india if i had acted like a savage like a brutebeast like a butcher all those men would have been alive today i was merciful and i was met with treachery i was longsuffering and they thought me weak i was forgiving and they laughed at me  mrs parsons put her hand on her husbands shoulder  you must try to forget it richmond she said its over and it cant be helped now you acted like a godfearing man your conscience is clear of evil intent what is the judgment of man beside the judgment of god if you have received insult and humiliation at the hands of man god will repay you an hundredfold for you acted as his servant and i believe in you richmond and im proud of what you did  i have always tried to act like a christian and a gentleman frances  at night he would continually dream of those days of confusion and mortal anxiety he would imagine he was again making that horrible retreat cheering his men doing all he could to retrieve the disaster but aware that ruin only awaited him conscious that the most ignorant sepoy in his command thought him incapable and mad he saw the look in the eyes of the officers under him their bitter contempt their anger because he forced them to retire before the enemy and because instead of honour and glory they had earned only ridicule his limbs shook and he sweated with agony as he recalled the interview with his chief youre only fit to be a damned missionary and the last contemptuous words i shant want you any more you can send in your papers  but human sorrow is like water in an earthen pot little by little colonel parsons forgot his misery he had turned it over in his mind so often that at last he grew confused it became then only a deep wound partly healed scarring over and he began to take an interest in the affairs of the life surrounding him he could read his paper without every word stabbing him by some chance association and there is nothing like the daily and thorough perusal of a newspaper for dulling a mans brain he pottered about his garden gossiping with the gardener made little alterations in the housebricks and mortar are like an anodyne he collected stamps played bezique with his wife and finally in his mild gentle way found peace of mind  but when james passed brilliantly out of sandhurst the thought seized him that the good name which he valued so highly might be retrieved colonel parsons had shrunk from telling the youth anything of the catastrophe which had driven him from the service but now he forced himself to give an exact account thereof his wife sat by listening with pain in her eyes for she knew what torture it was to revive that halfforgotten story  i thought you had better hear it from me than from a stranger the colonel said when he had finished i entered the army with the reputation of my father behind me my reputation can only harm you men will nudge one another and say theres the son of old parsons who bungled the affair against the madda khels you must show them that youre of good stuff i acted for the best and my conscience is at ease i think i did my duty but if you can distinguish yourselfif you can make them forgeti think i shall die a little happier  the commanding officer of jamies regiment was an old friend of the colonels and wrote to him after a while to say that he thought well of the boy he had already distinguished himself in a frontier skirmish and presently for gallantry in some other little expedition his name was mentioned in despatches colonel parsons regained entirely his old cheerfulness jamies courage and manifest knowledge of his business made him feel that at last he could again look the world frankly in the face then came the boer war for the parents at little primpton and for mary clibborn days of fearful anxiety of gnawing painall the greater because each for the others sake tried to conceal it and at last the announcement in the paper that james parsons had been severely wounded while attempting to save the life of a brother officer and was recommended for the victoria cross     ii   the parsons sat again in their diningroom counting the minutes which must pass before jamies arrival the table was laid simply for all their habits were simple and the blancmange prepared for the morrows festivities stood uncompromising and stiff as a dissenting minister in the middle of the table i wish someone would write an invective upon that most detestable of all the national dishes pallid chilly glutinous unpleasant to look upon insipid in the mouth it is a preparation which seems to mark a transition stage in culture just as the south sea islanders with the advance of civilisation forsook putrid whale for roast missionary the great english middle classes complained that tarts and plumpuddings were too substantial more suited to the robust digestions of a past generation in the blancmange on the other hand they found almost an appearance of distinction its name at least suggested french cookery it was possible to the plainest cook and it required no mastication  i shall have to tell betty to make a jelly for dinner tomorrow said mrs parsons  yes replied the colonel and after a pause dont you think we ought to let mary know that jamie has come back shed like to see him tonight  ive sent over already  it was understood that james having got his company would marry mary clibborn almost at once his father and mother had been delighted when he announced the engagement they had ever tried to shield him from all knowledge of evilno easy matter when a boy has been to a public school and to sandhurstholding the approved opinion that ignorance is synonymous with virtue and they could imagine no better safeguard for his innocence in the multicoloured life of india than betrothal with a pure sweet english girl they looked upon mary clibborn already as a daughter and she in jamies absence had been their only solace they loved her gentleness her goodness her simple piety and congratulated themselves on the fact that with her their son could not fail to lead a happy and a godly life  mary during those five years had come to see them every day her own mother and father were rather worldly people and she felt less happy with them than with colonel parsons and his wife the trio talked continually of the absent soldier always reading to one another his letters they laughed together over his jokes mildly as befitted persons for whom a sense of humour might conceivably be a satanic snare and trembled together at his dangers marys affection was free from anything so degrading as passion and she felt no bashfulness in reading jamies loveletters to his parents she was too frank to suspect that there might be in them anything for her eyes alone and too candid to feel any delicacy  but a lumbering fly rolled in at the gate and the good people happy at last sprang to the door  jamie  trembling with joy they brought him in and sat him down they knew no words to express their delight and stood looking at him openmouthed smiling  well here you are we were surprised to get your telegram when did you land  when they found their tongues it was only to say commonplace things such as they might have spoken to a casual friend who had come from london for the day they were so used to controlling themselves that when their emotion was overpowering they were at a loss to express it  would you like to go upstairs and wash your hands  they both accompanied him  you see its all just as it was we thought youd like your old room if you want anything you can ring the bell  they left him and going downstairs sat opposite one another by the fire the diningroom was furnished with a saddlebag suite and colonel parsons sat in the gentlemans chair which had arms while mrs parsons sat in the ladys chair which had none nor did either dream under any circumstances of using the others seat they were a little overcome  how thin he is said mrs parsons  we must feed him up answered the colonel  and then till the soldier came they remained in silence mrs parsons rang the bell for the chops as soon as he appeared and they sat down but james ate alone his people were too happy to do anything but watch him  i have had tea made said mrs parsons but you can have some claret if you prefer it  five years absence had not dulled jamies memory of his fathers wine and he chose the tea  i think a strong cup of tea will do you most good said his mother and she poured it out for him as when he was a boy with plenty of milk and sugar  his tastes had never been much consulted things had been done in the kindest manner possible solely for his good james detested sweetness  no sugar please mother he said as she dived into the sugarbasin  nonsense jamie answered mrs parsons with her goodhumoured indulgent smile sugars good for you and she put in two big lumps  you dont ask after mary said colonel parsons  how is she said james where is she  if you wait a little shell be here  then mrs parsons broke in  i dont know what we should have done without her shes been so good and kind to us and such a comfort were simply devoted to her arent we richmond  shes the nicest girl ive ever seen  and shes so good she works among the poor like a professional nurse we told you that she lived with us for six months while colonel and mrs clibborn went abroad she was never put out at anything but was always smiling and cheerful she has the sweetest character  the good people thought they were delighting their son by these eulogies he looked at them gravely  im glad you like her he said  supper was finished and mrs parsons went out of the room for a moment james took out his case and offered a cigar to his father  i dont smoke jamie replied the colonel  james lit up the old man looked at him with a start but said nothing he withdrew his chair a little and tried to look unconcerned when mrs parsons returned the room was full of smoke she gave a cry of surprise  james she said in a tone of reproach your father objects to smoking  it doesnt matter just this once said the colonel goodhumouredly  but james threw his cigar into the fire with a laugh  i quite forgot im so sorry  you never told us youd started smoking observed mrs parsons almost with disapprobation would you like the windows open to let the smell out richmond  there was a ring at the door and marys voice was heard  has captain parsons arrived  there she is jamie said the colonel rush out to her my boy  but james contented himself with rising to his feet he turned quite pale and a singular expression came over his grave face  mary entered  i ran round as soon as i got your note she said well jamie  she stopped smiling and a blush brightened her healthy cheeks her eyes glistened with happiness and for a moment strong as she was mary thought she must burst into tears  arent you going to kiss her jamie said the father you neednt be bashful before us  james went up to her and taking her hands kissed the cheek she offered  the impression that mary clibborn gave was of absolute healthiness moral and physical her appearance was not distinguished but she was well set up with strong hands and solid feet you knew at once that a tenmile walk invigorated rather than tired her her arms were muscular and energetic she was in no way striking a typical countrybred girl with a fine digestion and an excellent conscience if not very pretty obviously good her face showed a happy mingling of strength and cheerfulness her blue eyes were guileless and frank her hair even was rather pretty arranged in the simplest manner her skin was tanned by wind and weather the elements were friendly and she enjoyed a long walk in a gale with the rain beating against her cheeks she was dressed simply and without adornment as befitted her character  i am sorry i wasnt at home when you arrived jamie she said but the polsons asked me to go and play golf at tunbridge wells i went round in bogy colonel parsons  did you my dear thats very good  the colonel and his wife looked at her with affectionate satisfaction  im going to take off my hat  she gave james to put in the hall her sailor hat and her rough tweed cloak she wore a bicycling skirt and heavy squaretoed boots  say youre glad to see us jamie she cried laughing  her voice was rather loud clear and strong perhaps wanting variety of inflection she sat by jamies side and broke into a cheerful rather humorous account of the days excursion  how silent you are jamie she cried at last  you havent given me a chance to get a word in yet he said smiling gravely  they all laughed ready to be pleased at the smallest joke and banter was the only form of humour they knew  are you tired asked mary her cheerful eyes softening  a little  well i wont worry you tonight but tomorrow you must be put through your paces  mary will stand no nonsense said the colonel laughing gently we all have to do as she tells us shell turn you round her little finger  will she said james glancing down at the solid boots which the short bicycle skirt rather obtrusively exposed to view  dont frighten him the moment he comes home cried mary as a matter of fact i shant be able to come tomorrow morning ive got my districtvisiting to do and i dont think jamie is strong enough to go with me yet does your wound hurt you still jamie  no he said i cant use my arm much though itll be all right soon  you must tell us about the great event tomorrow said mary referring to the deed which had won him the decoration youve put us all out by coming sooner than you were expected  have i im sorry  didnt you notice anything when you drove in this evening  no it was quite dark  good heavens why weve put up a triumphal arch and there was going to be a great celebration all the school children were coming to welcome you  im very glad i missed it said james laughing i should have hated it  oh i dont know that you have missed it yet we must see  then mary rose to go  well at all events were all coming to dinner tomorrow at one  they went to the door to let her out and the elder couple smiled again with pleasure when james and mary exchanged a brotherly and sisterly kiss      at last james found himself alone in his room he gave a sigh of reliefa sigh which was almost a groan of pain he took out his pipe unconsciously and filled it but then remembering where he was put it down he knew his fathers sensitiveness of smell if he began to smoke there would quickly be a knock at the door and the inquiry theres such a smell of burning in the house theres nothing on fire in your room is there jamie  he began to walk up and down and then in exhaustion sank on a chair he opened the window and looked into the night he could see nothing the sky was dark with unmoving clouds but the fresh air blew gratefully against his face laden with the scent of the vernal country a light rain was falling noiselessly and the earth seemed languid and weary accepting the moisture with little shuddering gasps of relief  after an event which has been long expected there is always something in the nature of reaction james had looked forward to this meeting partly with terror partly with eagerness and now that it was over his brain confused and weary would not help him to order his thoughts he clenched his hands trying to force himself to think clearly he knew he must decide upon some course at once and a terrible indecision paralysed his ideas he loved his people so tenderly he was so anxious to make them happy and yetand yet if he loved one better than the other it was perhaps his father because of the pitiful weakness because of the fragility which seemed to call for a protective gentleness the old man had altered little in the five years james could not remember him other than thin and bent and frail with long wisps of silvery hair brushed over the crown to conceal his baldness with the cheeks hollow and wrinkled and a white moustache ineffectually concealing the weak goodnatured mouth ever since james could recollect his father had appeared old and worn as now and there had always been that gentle look in the blue eyes that manner which was almost painful in its diffidence colonel parsons was a man who made people love him by a modesty which seemed to claim nothing he was like a child compelling sympathy on account of its utter helplessness so unsuited to the wear and tear of life that he aroused his fellows instincts of protection  and james knew besides what a bitter humiliation it was to his father that he had been forced to leave the service he remembered like a deadly incurable pain suffered by a friend the occasion on which the old soldier had told him the cause of his disgrace a sweat of agony standing on his brow the scene had eaten into jamies mind alongside of that other when he had first watched a man die livid with pain his eyes glazed and sightless he had grown callous to such events since then  colonel parsons had come to grief on account of the very kindness of heart on account of the exquisite humanity which endeared him to the most casual acquaintance james swore that he would do anything to save him from needless suffering nor did he forget his mother for through the harder manner he saw her gentleness and tender love he knew that he was all in the world to both of them that in his hands lay their happiness and their misery their love made them feel every act of his with a force out of reason to the circumstance he had seen in their letters piercing through the assumed cheerfulness a mortal anxiety when he was in danger an anguish of mind that seemed hardly bearable they had gone through so much for his sake they deprived themselves of luxury so that in the various expenses of his regiment he should not need to economise all his life they had surrounded him with loving care and what their hearts were set upon now was that he should marry mary clibborn quickly  james turned from the window and put his head between his hands swaying to and fro  oh i cant he groaned i cant     iii   in the morning after breakfast james went for a walk he wanted to think out clearly what he had better do feeling that he must make up his mind at once hesitation would be fatal and yet to speak immediately seemed so cruel so brutally callous  wishing to be absolutely alone he wandered through the garden to a little wood of beechtrees which in his boyhood had been a favourite haunt the day was fresh and sweet after the happy rain of april the sky so clear that it affected one like a very beautiful action  james stood still when he came into the wood inhaling the odour of moist soil the voluptuous scents of our mother the earth gravid with silent life for a moment he was intoxicated by the paradise of verdure the beechtrees rose very tall with their delicate branches singularly black amid the young leaves of the spring tender and vivid the eye could not pierce the intricate greenery it was more delicate than the summer rain subtler than the mists of the sunset it was a scene to drive away all thought of the sadness of life of the bitterness its exquisite fresh purity made james feel pure also and like a little child he wandered over the undulating earth broken by the tortuous courses of the streamlets of winter  the ground was soft covered with brown dead leaves and he tried to see the rabbit rustling among them or the hasty springing of a squirrel the long branches of the briar entangled his feet and here and there in sheltered corners blossomed the primrose and the violet he listened to the chant of the birds so joyous that it seemed impossible they sang in a world of sorrow hidden among the leaves aloft in the beeches the linnet sang with fullthroated melody and the blackbird and the thrush in the distance a cuckoo called its mysterious note and far away like an echo a fellowbird called back  all nature was rejoicing in the delight of the sunshine all nature was rejoicing and his heart alone was heavy as lead he stood by a firtree which rose far above the others immensely tall like the mast of a solitary ship it was straight as a life without reproach but cheerless cold and silent his life too was without reproach thought jameswithout reproach till now he had loved mary clibborn but was it love or was it merely affection habit esteem she was the only girl he knew and they had grown up together when he came from school for his holidays or later from sandhurst on leave mary was his constant friend without whom he would have been miserably dull she was masculine enough to enter into his boyish games and even their thoughts were common there were so few people in little primpton that those who lived there saw one another continually and though tunbridge wells was only four miles away the distance effectually prevented very close intimacy with its inhabitants it was natural then that james should only look forward to an existence in which mary took part without that pleasant companionship the road seemed long and dreary when he was appointed to a regiment in india and his heart softened at the prospect of the first long parting from all he cared for it was the separation from mary that seemed hardest to bear  i dont know what i shall do without you mary he said  you will forget all about us when youve been in india a month  but her lips twitched and he noticed that she found difficulty in speaking quite firmly she hesitated a moment and spoke again  its different for us she said those who go forget but those who stayremember we shall be always doing the same things to remind us of you oh you wont forget me jamie  the last words slipped out against the girls intention  mary he cried  and then he put his arms round her and mary rested her face on his shoulder and began to cry he kissed her trying to stop her tears he pressed her to his heart he really thought he loved her then with all his strength  mary he whispered mary do you care for me will you marry me  then quickly he explained that it would make it so much better for both if they became engaged  i shant be able to marry you for a long time but will you wait for me mary  she began to smile through her tears  i would wait for you to the end of my life  during the first two years in india the tie had been to james entirely pleasurable and if among the manifold experiences of his new life he bore marys absence with greater equanimity than he had thought possible he was always glad to receive her letters with their delicate aroma of the english country and it pleased him to think that his future was comfortably settled the engagement was a sort of ballast and he felt that he could compass his journey without fear and without disturbance james did not ask himself whether his passion was very ardent for his whole education had led him to believe that passion was hardly moral the proper and decent basis of marriage was similarity of station and the good solid qualities which might be supposed endurable from his youth the wisdom of the world had been instilled into him through many proverbs showing the advisability of caution the transitoriness of beauty and desire and on the other hand the lasting merit of honesty virtue domesticity and good temper  but we all know that nature is a goddess with no sense of decency for whom the proprieties are simply nonexistent men and women in her eyes have but one point of interest and she walks abroad with her fashioning fingers setting in order the only work she cares for all the rest is subsidiary and she is callous to suffering and to death indifferent to the ten commandments and even to the code of good society  james at last made the acquaintance of a certain mrs pritchardwallace the wife of a man in a native regiment a little darkhatred person with an olive skin and big brown eyesrather common but excessively pretty she was the daughter of a ridingmaster by a portuguese woman from goa and it had been something of a scandal when pritchardwallace who was an excellent fellow had married her against the advice of all the regimental ladies but if those charitable persons had not ceased to look upon her with doubtful eyes her wit and her good looks for others counterbalanced every disadvantage and she did not fail to have a little court of subalterns and the like hanging perpetually about her skirts at first mrs wallace merely amused james her absolute frivolity her cynical tongue her lightheartedness were a relief after the rather puritanical atmosphere in which he had passed his youth he was astonished to hear the gay contempt which she poured upon all the things that he had held most sacredthings like the tower of london and the british constitution prejudices and cherished beliefs were dissipated before her sharptongued raillery she was a woman with almost a witty way of seeing the world with a peculiarly feminine gift for putting old things in a new absurd light to mrs wallace james seemed a miracle of ingenuousness and she laughed at him continually then she began to like him and took him about with her at which he was much flattered  james had been brought up in the belief that women were fashioned of different clay from men less gross less earthly he thought not only that they were pious sweet and innocent ignorant entirely of disagreeable things but that it was mans first duty to protect them from all knowledge of the realities of life to him they were an ethereal blending of milkandwater with high principles it had never occurred to him that they were flesh and blood and sense and fire and nervesespecially nerves most topics of course could not be broached in their presence in fact almost the only safe subject of conversation was the weather  but mrs pritchardwallace prided herself on frankness which is less common in pretty women than in plain and she had no hesitation in discussing with james matters that he had never heard discussed before she was hugely amused at the embarrassment which made him hesitate and falter trying to find polite ways of expressing the things which his whole training had taught him to keep rigidly to himself then sometimes from pure devilry mrs wallace told stories on purpose to shock him and revelled in his forced polite smile and in his strong look of disapproval  what a funny boy you are she said but you must take care you know you have all the makings of a perfect prig  dyou think so  you must try to be less moral the moral young man is rather funny for a change but he palls after a time  if i bore you you have only to say so and i wont bother you again  and moral young men shouldnt get cross its very bad manners she answered smiling  before he knew what had happened james found himself madly in love with mrs wallace but what a different passion was this resembling not at all that pallid flame which alone he had experienced how could he recognise the gentle mingling of friendship and of commonsense which he called love in that destroying violence which troubled his days like a fever he dreamed of the woman at night he seemed only to live when he was with her the mention of her name made his heart beat and meeting her he trembled and turned cold by her side he found nothing to say he was like wax in her hands without will or strength the touch of her fingers sent the blood rushing through his veins insanely and understanding his condition she took pleasure in touching him to watch the little shiver of desire that convulsed his frame in a very selfrestrained man love works ruinously and it burnt james now this invisible unconscious fire till he was consumed utterlytill he was mad with passion and then suddenly at some chance word he knew what had happened he knew that he was in love with the wife of his good friend pritchardwallace and he thought of mary clibborn  there was no hesitation now nor doubt james had only been in danger because he was unaware of it he never thought of treachery to his friend or to mary he was horrorstricken hating himself he looked over the brink of the precipice at the deadly sin and recoiled shuddering he bitterly reproached himself taking for granted that some error of his had led to the catastrophe but his duty was obvious he knew he must kill the sinful love whatever pain it cost him he must crush it as he would some noxious vermin  james made up his mind never to see mrs wallace again and he thought that god was on his side helping him since with her husband she was leaving in a month for england he applied for leave he could get away for a few weeks and on his return mrs wallace would be gone he managed to avoid her for several days but at last she came across him by chance and he could not escape  i didnt know you were so fond of hideandseek she said i think its rather a stupid game  i dont understand replied james growing pale  why have you been dodging round corners to avoid me as if i were a dun and inventing the feeblest excuses not to come to me  james stood for a moment not knowing what to answer his knees trembled and he sweated with the agony of his love it was an angry furious passion that made him feel he could almost seize the woman by the throat and strangle her  did you know that i am engaged to be married he asked at length  ive never known a sub who wasnt its the most objectionable of all their vicious habits what then she looked at him smiling she knew very well the power of her dark eyes fringed with long lashes dont be silly she added come and see me and bring her photograph and you shall talk to me for two hours about her will you come  its very kind of you i dont think i can  why not youre really very rude  im extremely busy  nonsense you must come dont look as if i were asking you to do something quite horrible i shall expect you to tea  she bound him by his word and james was forced to go when he showed the photograph mrs pritchardwallace looked at it with a curious expression it was the work of a country photographer awkward and ungainly with the head stiffly poised and the eyes hard and fixed the general impression was ungraceful and devoid of charm mrs wallace noticed the country fashion of her clothes  its extraordinary that subalterns should always get engaged to the same sort of girl  james flushed its not a very good one of her  they always photograph badly murmured mrs wallace  shes the best girl in the world you cant think how good and kind and simple she is she reminds me always of an english breeze  i dont like east winds myself said mrs wallace but i can see she has all sorts of admirable qualities  dyou know why i came to see you today  because i forced you said mrs wallace laughing  i came to say goodbye ive got a months leave  oh but i shall be gone by the time you come back  i know it is for that reason  mrs wallace looked at him quickly hesitated then glanced away  is it so bad as that  oh dont you understand cried james breaking suddenly from his reserve i must tell you i shall never see you again and it cant matter i love you with all my heart and soul i didnt know what love was till i met you god help me it was only friendship i had for mary this is so different oh i hate myself i cant help it the mere touch of your hand sends me mad with passion i darent see you againim not a blackguard i know its quite hopeless and ive given my word to mary  the look of her eyes the sound of her voice sent half his fine intentions flying before the wind he lost command over himselfbut only for a moment the old habits were strong  i beg your pardon i oughtnt to have spoken dont be angry with me for what ive said i couldnt help it you thought me a fool because i ran away from you it was all i could do i couldnt help loving you you understand now dont you i know that you will never wish to see me again and its better for both of us goodbye  he stretched out his hand  i didnt know it was so bad as that she said looking at him with kindly eyes  didnt you see me tremble when the hem of your dress touched me by accident didnt you hear that i couldnt speak the words were dried up in my throat he sank into a chair weakly but then immediately gathering himself together sprang up goodbye he said let me go quickly  she gave him her hand and then partly in kindness partly in malice bent forward and kissed his lips james gave a cry a sob now he lost command over himself entirely he took her in his arms roughly and kissed her mouth her eyes her hairso passionately that mrs wallace was frightened she tried to free herself but he only held her closer madly kissing her lips  take care she said what are you doing let me go and she pushed him away  she was a cautious woman who never allowed flirtation to go beyond certain decorous lengths and she was used to a milder form of philandering  youve disarranged my hair you silly boy she went to the glass to put it in order and when she turned back found that james had gone what an odd creature she muttered  to mrs pritchardwallace the affair was but an incident such as might have been the love of phædra had she flourished in an age when the art of living consists in not taking things too seriously but for hippolitus a tragedy of one sort or another is inevitable james was not a man of easy affections he made the acquaintance of people with a feeling of hostility rather than with the more usual sensation of friendly curiosity he was shy and even with his best friends could not lessen his reserve some persons are able to form close intimacies with admirable facility but james felt always between himself and his fellows a sort of barrier he could not realise that deep and sudden sympathy was even possible and was apt to look with mistrust upon the appearance thereof he seemed frigid and perhaps supercilious to those with whom he came in contact he was forced to go his way hiding from all eyes the emotions he felt and when at last he fell passionately in love it meant to him ten times more than to most men it was a sudden freedom from himself he was like a prisoner who sees for the first time in his life the trees and the hurrying clouds and all the various movement of the world for a little while james had known a wonderful liberty an ineffable bliss which coloured the whole universe with new strange colours but then he learnt that the happiness was only sin and he returned voluntarily to his cold prison till he tried to crush it he did not know how strong was this passion he did not realise that it had made of him a different man it was the only thing in the world to him beside which everything else was meaningless he became ruthless towards himself undergoing every torture which he fancied might cleanse him of the deadly sin  and when mrs wallace against his will forced herself upon his imagination he tried to remember her vulgarity her underbred manners her excessive use of scent she had merely played with him without thinking or caring what the result to him might be she was bent on as much enjoyment as possible without exposing herself to awkward consequences common scandal told him that he was not the first callow youth that she had entangled with her provoking glances and her witty tongue the epithet by which his brother officers qualified her was expressive though impolite james repeated these things a hundred times he said that mrs wallace was not fit to wipe marys boots he paraded before himself like a set of unread schoolbooks all marys excellent qualities he recalled her simple piety her goodnature and kindly heart she had every attribute that a man could possibly want in his wife and yetand yet when he slept he dreamed he was talking to the other all day her voice sang in his ears her gay smile danced before his eyes he remembered every word she had ever said he remembered the passionate kisses he had given her how could he forget that ecstasy he writhed trying to expel the importunate image but nothing served  time could not weaken the impression since then he had never seen mrs wallace but the thought of her was still enough to send the blood racing through his veins he had done everything to kill the mad hopeless passion and always like a rank weed it had thriven with greater strength james knew it was his duty to marry mary clibborn and yet he felt he would rather die as the months passed on and he knew he must shortly see her he was never free from a sense of terrible anxiety doubt came to him and he could not drive it away the recollection of her was dim cold formless his only hope was that when he saw her love might rise up again and kill that other passion which made him so utterly despise himself but he had welcomed the war as a respite and the thought came to him that its chances might easily solve the difficulty then followed the months of hardship and of fighting and during these the image of mrs wallace had been less persistent so that james fancied he was regaining the freedom he longed for and when he lay wounded and ill his absolute weariness made him ardently look forward to seeing his people again a hotter love sprang up for them and the hope became stronger that reunion with mary might awaken the dead emotion he wished for it with all his heart  but he had seen mary and he felt it hopeless she left him cold almost hostile and with a mocking laugh james heard mrs wallaces words  subalterns always get engaged to the same type of girl they photograph so badly      and now he did not know what to do the long recalling of the past had left james more uncertain than ever some devil within him cried wait wait something may happen it really seemed better to let things slide a little perhapswho could tellin a day or two the old habit might render mary as dear to him as when last he had wandered with her in that green wood james sighed and looked about him the birds still sang merrily the squirrel leaped from tree to tree even the blades of grass stood with a certain conscious pleasure as the light breeze rustled through them in the midday sun all things took pleasure in their life and all nature appeared full of joy coloured and various and insouciant he alone was sad     iv   when james went home he found that the vicar of little primpton and his wife had already arrived they were both of them little driedup persons with an earnest manner and no sense of humour quite excellent in a rather unpleasant way they resembled one another like peas but none knew whether the likeness had grown from the propinquity of twenty years or had been the original attraction deeply impressed with their sacred callingfor mrs jackson would never have acknowledged that the vicars wife held a position inferior to the vicarsthey argued that the whole world was gods and they gods particular ministrants so that it was their plain duty to concern themselves with the business of their fellowsand it must be confessed that they never shrank from this duty they were neither welleducated nor experienced nor tactful but blissfully ignorant of these defects they shepherded their flock with little moral barks and gave them rather selfconsciously a good example in the difficult way to eternal life they were eminently worthy people who thought lightheartedness somewhat indecent they did endless good in the most disagreeable manner possible and in their fervour not only bore unnecessary crosses themselves but saddled them on to everyone else as the only certain passport to the golden city  the reverend archibald jackson had been appointed to the living of little primpton while james was in india and consequently had never seen him  i was telling your father said mrs jackson on shaking hands that i hoped you were properly grateful for all the mercies that have been bestowed upon you  james stared at her a little were you  he hated the fashion these people had of discussing matters which he himself thought most private  mr jackson was asking if youd like a short prayer offered up next sunday james said his mother  i shouldnt at all  why not asked the vicar i think its your duty to thank your maker for your safe return and i think your parents should join in the thanksgiving  were probably none of us less grateful said james because we dont want to express our feelings before the united congregation  jamies parents looked at him with relief for the same thought filled their minds but thinking it their duty to submit themselves to the spiritual direction of the vicar and his wife they had not thought it quite right to decline the proposal mrs jackson glanced at her husband with pained astonishment but further argument was prevented by the arrival of colonel and mrs clibborn and mary  colonel clibborn was a tall man with oily black hair and fierce eyebrows both dyed aggressively military and reminiscent he had been in a cavalry regiment where he had come to the philosophic conclusion that all men are dustexcept cavalrymen and he was able to look upon jamies prowessthe prowess of an infantrymanfrom superior heights he was a great authority upon war and could tell anyone what were the mistakes in south africa and how they might have been avoided likewise he had known in the service half the peers of the realm and talked of them by their christian names he spent three weeks every season in london and dined late at seven oclock so he had every qualification for considering himself a man of fashion  i dont know what theyd do in little primpton without us he said its only us who keep it alive  but mrs clibborn missed society  the only people i can speak to are the parsons she told her husband plaintively theyre very good peoplebut only infantry reggie  of course theyre only infantry agreed colonel clibborn  mrs clibborn was a regimental beautyof fifty who had grown stout but not for that ceased to use the weapons which nature had given her against the natural enemies of the sex in her dealings with several generations of adorers she had acquired such a habit of languishing glances that now she used them unconsciously whether ordering meat from the butcher or discussing parochial matters with mr jackson mrs clibborns tone and manner were such that she might have been saying the most tender things she had been very popular in the service because she was the type of philandering woman who required no beating about the bush her neighbour at the dinnertable even if he had not seen her before need never have hesitated to tell her with the soup that she was the handsomest creature he had ever seen and with the entrée that he adored her  on coming in mrs clibborn for a moment looked at james quite speechless her head on one side and her eyes screwing into the corner of the room  oh how wonderful she said at last i suppose i mustnt call you jamie now she spoke very slowly and every word sounded like a caress then she looked at james again in silent ecstasy colonel parsons how proud you must be and when i think that soon he will be my son how thin you look james  and how well you look dear lady  it was understood that everyone must make compliments to mrs clibborn otherwise she grew cross and when she was cross she was horrid  she smiled to show her really beautiful teeth  i should like to kiss you james may i mrs parsons  certainly replied jamies mother who didnt approve of mrs clibborn at all  she turned her cheek to james and assumed a seraphic expression while he lightly touched it with his lips  im only an old woman she murmured to the company in general  she seldom made more than one remark at a time and at the end of each assumed an appropriate attitudecoy madonnalike resigned as the circumstances might require mr jackson came forward to shake hands and she turned her languishing glance on him  oh mr jackson how beautiful your sermon was      they sat down to dinner and ate their oxtail soup it is terrible to think of the subtlety with which the evil one can insinuate himself among the most pious for soup at middleday is one of his most dangerous wiles and it is precisely with the simpleminded inhabitants of the country and of the suburbs that this vice is most prevalent  james was sitting next to mrs clibborn and presently she looked at him with the melancholy smile which had always seemed to her so effective  we want you to tell us how you won your victoria cross jamie  the others eager to hear the story from the heros lips had been notwithstanding too tactful to ask but they were willing to take advantage of mrs clibborns lack of that quality  weve all been looking forward to it said the vicar  i dont think theres anything to tell replied james  his father and mother were looking at him with happy eyes and the colonel nodded to mary  please jamie tell us she said we only saw the shortest account in the papers and you said nothing about it in your letters  dyou think its very good form of me to tell you about it asked james smiling gravely  were all friends here said the vicar  and colonel clibborn added making sheeps eyes at his wife  you cant refuse a lady  im an old woman sighed mrs clibborn with a doleful glance i cant expect him to do it for me  the only clever thing mrs clibborn had done in her life was to acknowledge to old age at thirty and then she did not mean it it had been one of her methods in flirtation covering all excesses under a maternal aspect she must have told hundreds of young officers that she was old enough to be their mother and she always said it looking plaintively at the ceiling when they squeezed her hand  it wasnt a very wonderful thing i did said james at last and it was completely useless  no fine deed is useless said the vicar sententiously  james looked at him a moment but proceeded with his story  it was only that i tried to save the life of a sub whod just joinedand didnt  would you pass me the salt said mrs clibborn  mamma cried mary with a look as near irritation as her gentle nature permitted  go on jamie theres a good boy said mrs parsons  and james seeing his fathers charming pathetic look of pride told the story to him alone the others did not care how much they hurt him so long as they could gape in admiration but in his father he saw the most touching sympathy  it was a chap called larcher a boy of eighteen with fair hair and blue eyes who looked quite absurdly young his people live somewhere round here near ashford  larcher did you say asked mrs clibborn ive never heard the name its not a county family  go on jamie said mary with some impatience  well hed only been with us three or four weeks but i knew him rather well oddly enough hed taken a sort of fancy to me he was such a nice bright boy so enthusiastic and simple i used to tell him that he ought to have been at school rather than roughing it at the cape  mrs clibborn sat with an idiotic smile on her lips and a fixed expression of girlish innocence  well we knew we should be fighting in a day or so and the evening before the battle young larcher was talking to me how dyou feel i said he didnt answer quite so quickly as usual dyou know he said im so awfully afraid that i shall funk it you neednt mind that i said and i laughed the first time we most of us do funk it for five minutes or so you just have to cling on to your eyelashes to prevent yourself from running away and then you feel all right and you think its rather sport ive got a sort of presentiment that i shall be killed he said dont be an ass i answered weve all got a presentiment that we shall be killed the first time were under fire if all the people were killed who had presentiments half the army would have gone to kingdom come long ago  you should have told him to lay his trust in the hands of him who has power to turn the bullet and to break the sword said mrs jackson  he wasnt that sort replied james drily i laughed at him thinking it the better way well next day we did really fight we were sent to take an unoccupied hill our maxim was that a hill is always unoccupied unless the enemy are actually firing from it of course the place was chock full of boers they waited till we had come within easy range for a toypistol and then fired murderously we did all we could we tried to storm the place but we hadnt a chance men tumbled down like ninepins ive never seen anything like it the order was given to fire and there was nothing to fire at but the naked rocks we had to retirewe couldnt do anything else and presently i found that poor larcher had been wounded well i thought he couldnt be left where he was so i went back for him i asked him if he could move no he said i think im hurt in the leg i knelt down and bandaged him up as well as i could he was simply bleeding like a pig and meanwhile brother boer potted at us for all he was worth how dyou feel i asked bit dicky but comfortable i didnt funk it did i no of course not you juggins i said can you walk dyou think ill try i lifted him up and put my arm round him and we got along for a bit then he became awfully white and groaned i do feel so bad parsons and then he fainted so i had to carry him and we went a bit farther and thenand then i was hit in the arm i say i cant carry you now i said for gods sake buck up he opened his eyes and i prevented him from falling i think i can stand he said and as he spoke a bullet got him in the neck and his blood splashed over my face he gave a gasp and died  james finished and his mother and mary wiped the tears from their eyes mrs clibborn turned to her husband  reggie im sure the larchers are not a county family  there was a sapper of that name whom we met at simla once my dear replied the colonel  i thought id heard it before said mrs clibborn with an air of triumph as though shed found out a very difficult puzzle had he a red moustache  have you heard from the young mans people captain parsons asked mrs jackson  i had a letter from mrs larcher the boys mother asking me to go over and see her  she must be very grateful to you jamie  why she has no reason to be  you did all you could to save him  it would have been better if id left him alone dont you see that if he had remained where he was he might have been alive now he would have been taken prisoner and sent to pretoria but that is better than rotting on the veldt he was killed because i tried to save him  there are worse things than death said colonel parsons i have often thought that those fellows who surrendered did the braver thing it is easy to stand and be shot down but to hoist the white flag so as to save the lives of the men under onethat requires courage  it is a sort of courage which seemed not uncommon answered james drily and they had a fairly pleasant time in pretoria eventually i believe wars will be quite bloodless rival armies will perambulate and whenever one side has got into a good position the other will surrender wholesale campaigns will be conducted like manoeuvres and the special correspondents will decide which lot has won  if they were surrounded and couldnt escape it would have been wicked not to hoist the white flag said mrs jackson  i daresay you know more about it than i replied james  but the vicars lady insisted  if you were so placed that on one hand was certain death for yourself and all your men and on the other hand surrender which would you chose  one can never tell and in those matters it is wiser not to boast certain death is an awful thing but our fathers preferred it to surrender  war is horrible said mary shuddering  oh no cried james shaking himself out of his despondency war is the most splendid thing in the world i shall never forget those few minutes now and then when we got on top of the boers and fought with them man to man in the old way ah life seemed worth living then one day i remember theyd been giving it us awfully hot all the morning and wed lost frightfully at last we rushed their position and by jove we let em have it how we did hate them you should have heard the tommies cursing as they killed i shall never forget the exhilaration of it the joy of thinking that we were getting our own again by gad it beat cockfighting  jamies cheeks were flushed and his eyes shone but he had forgotten where he was and his fathers voice came to him through a mist of blood and a roar of sound  i have fought too said colonel parsons looking at his son with troubled eyesi have fought too but never with anger in my heart nor lust of vengeance i hope i did my duty but i never forgot that my enemy was a fellowcreature i never felt joy at killing but pain and grief war is inevitable but it is horrible horrible it is only the righteous cause that can excuse it and then it must be tempered with mercy and forgiveness  cause every cause is righteous i can think of no war in which right has not been fairly equal on both sides in every question there is about as much to be said on either part and in none more than in war each country is necessarily convinced of the justice of its own cause  they cant both be right  oh yes they can its generally six to one and half a dozen of the other  do you mean to say that you a military man think the boers were justified asked colonel clibborn with some indignation  james laughed  you must remember that if any nation but ourselves had been engaged our sympathies would have been entirely with the sturdy peasants fighting for their independence the two great powers in the affairs of the world are sentiment and selfinterest the boers are the smaller weaker nation and they have been beaten it is only natural that sympathy should be with them it was with the french for the same reason after the francoprussian war but we who were fighting couldnt think of sentiment to us it was really a matter of life and death i was interested to see how soon the english put aside their ideas of fair play and equal terms when we had had a few reverses they forgot that one englishman was equal to ten foreigners and insisted on sending out as many troops as possible i fancy you were badly panicstricken over here  james saw that his listeners looked at him with surprise even with consternation and he hastened to explain  of course i dont blame them they were quite right to send as many men as possible the object of war is not to do glorious actions but to win other things being equal it is obviously better to be ten to one it is less heroic but more reasonable  you take from war all the honour and all the chivalry cried mary the only excuse for war is that it brings out the noblest qualities of manselfsacrifice unselfishness endurance  but war doesnt want any excuse replied james smiling gently many people say that war is inhuman and absurd many people are uncommonly silly when they think war can be abolished they show a phenomenal ignorance of the conditions of all development war in one way and another is at the very root of life war is not conducted only by fire and sword it is in all nature it is the condition of existence for all created things even the wild flowers in the meadow wage war and they wage it more ruthlessly even than man for with them defeat means extermination the law of nature is that the fit should kill the unfit the lord is the lord of hosts the lame and the halt and the blind must remain behind while the strong man goes his way rejoicing  how hard you are said mary have you no pity james  dyou know ive got an idea that theres too much pity in the world people seem to be losing their nerve reality shocks them and they live slothfully in the shoddy palaces of sham ideals the sentimentalists the cowards and the cranks have broken the spirit of mankind the general in battle now is afraid to strike because men may be killed sometimes it is worth while to lose men when we become soldiers we know that we cease to be human beings and are merely the instruments for a certain work we know that sometimes it may be part of a generals deliberate plan that we should be killed i have no confidence in a leader who is tenderhearted compassion weakens his brain and the result too often is disaster  but as he spoke james realised with a start how his father would take what he was saying he could have torn out his tongue he would have given anything that the words should remain unspoken his father in pity and in humanity had committed just such a fatal mistake and trying tenderheartedly to save life had brought about death and disaster he would take the thoughtless words as a deliberate condemnation the wound barely closed was torn open by his very son and he must feel again the humiliation which had nearly killed him  colonel parsons sat motionless as though he were stunned his eyes fixed on james with horror and pain he looked like some hunted animal terrorstricken and yet surprised wondering that man should be so cruel  what can i do thought james how can i make it good for him  the conversation was carried on by the clibborns and by the vicar all happily unconscious that a tragedy was acting under their noses james looked at his father he wanted to show how bitterly he regretted the pain he had caused but knew not what to say he wanted to give a sign of his eager love and tortured himself knowing the impossibility of showing in any way his devotion  fortunately the maid came in to announce that the school children were without to welcome captain parsons and they all rose from the table     v   colonel parsons and his wife had wished no function to celebrate the homecoming of james but gave in to the persuasions of mary and of mr dryland the curate who said that a public ceremony would be undoubtedly a stimulus to the moral welfare of little primpton no man could escape from his obligations and captain parsons owed it to his fellowcountrymen of little primpton to let them show their appreciation of his great deed  the vicar went so far as to assert that a hearty greeting to the hero would be as salutory to the parishioners as a sermon of his own while it would awaken james a young man and possibly thoughtless to a proper sense of his responsibilities but the sudden arrival of james had disturbed the arrangements and mr dryland in some perplexity went to see mary  what are we to do miss clibborn the school children will be so disappointed  the original plan had been to meet the hero as he drove towards primpton house from the station and the curate was unwilling to give it up  dyou think captain parsons would go into tunbridge wells and drive in at two oclock as if he were just arriving  im afraid he wouldnt replied mary doubtfully and i think hed only laugh if i asked him he seemed glad when he thought he had escaped the celebration  did he indeed how true it is that real courage is always modest but it would be an eternal disgrace to little primpton if we did not welcome our hero especially now that everything is prepared it must not be said that little primpton neglects to honour him whom the empire has distinguished  after turning over many plans they decided that the procession should come to primpton house at the appointed hour when captain parsons would receive it from the triumphal arch at the gate when the servant announced that the function was ready to begin an announcement emphasised by the discordant notes of the brass band mary hurriedly explained to james what was expected of him and they all made for the front door  primpton house faced the green and opposite the little village shops were gay with bunting at the side against the highroad that led to groombridge the church and the publichouse stood together in friendly neighbourhood decorated with union jacks the whole scene with its great chestnuttrees and the stretch of greenery beyond was pleasantly rural oldfashioned and very english and to complete it the sun shone down comfortably like a goodnatured mild old gentleman the curate with a fine sense of order had arranged on the right the schoolboys nicely scrubbed and redolent of pomatum and on the left the girls supported by their teachers in the middle stood the choir the brass band and mr dryland the village yokels were collected round in openmouthed admiration the little party from the house took their places under the triumphal arch the clibborns assuming an expression of genteel superciliousness and as they all wore their sunday clothes they made quite an imposing group  seeing that they were ready mr dryland stepped forward turned his back so as to command the musicians and coughed significantly he raised above his head his large white clerical hand stretching out the indexfinger and began to beat time he bellowed aloud and the choir a bar or so late followed lustily the band joined in with a hearty braying of trumpets      see the conquering hero comes     sound the trumpets beat the drums  but growing excited at the music issuing from his throat the curate raised the other hand which held his soft felt hat and beat time energetically with that also  at the end of the verse the performers took a rapid breath as though afraid of being left behind and then galloped on a little less evenly until one by one they reached the highlydecorated amen  when the last note of the last cornet had died away on the startled air mr dryland made a sign to the head boy of the school who thereupon advanced and waved his cap shouting  three cheers for capting parsons vc  then the curate wiping his heated brow turned round and cleared his throat  captain parsons he said in a loud voice so that none should miss his honeyed words we the inhabitants of little primpton welcome you to your home i need not say that it is with great pleasure that we have gathered together this day to offer you our congratulations on your safe return to those that love you i need not remind you that there is no place like home hear hear from the vicar we are proud to think that our fellowparishioner should have gained the coveted glory of the victoria cross little primpton need not be ashamed now to hold up its head among the proudest cities of the empire you have brought honour to yourself but you have brought honour to us also you have shown that englishmen know how to die you have shown the rival nations of the continent that the purity and the godliness of old england still bear fruit but i will say no more i wished only to utter a few words to welcome you on behalf of those who cannot perhaps express themselves so well as i can i will say no more captain parsons we hope that you will live long to enjoy your honour and glory side by side with her who is to shortly become your wife i would only assure you that your example has not been lost upon us we all feel better nobler and more truly christian and we say to you now that you have overcome all dangers and tribulation now that you have returned to the bosom of your beloved family take her who has also given us an example of resignation of courage and ofand of resignation take her we say and be happy confident in the respect esteem and affection of the people of little primpton james brown who has the honour to bear the same christian name as yourself and is also the top boy of the parish school will now recite a short poem entitled casabianca  mr dryland had wished to compose an ode especially for the occasion it would evidently have been effective to welcome the hero to glorify his deed and to point the moral in a few original verses but unhappily the muse was froward which was singular since the élite of little primpton had unimpeachable morals ideals of the most approved character and principles enough to build a church with nor was an acquaintance with literature wanting they all read the daily papers and mr and mrs jackson in addition read the church times mary even knew by heart whole chunks of sir lewis morris and mr dryland recited tennyson at penny readings but when inspiration is wanting a rhyming dictionary for which the curate sent to london will not help to any great extent and finally the unanimous decision was reached to give some wellknown poem apposite to the circumstance it shows in what charming unity of spirit these simple godfearing people lived and how fine was their sense of literary excellence that without hesitation they voted in chorus for casabianca  the head boy stepped forwardhe had been carefully trained by mr drylandand with appropriate gestures recited the immortal verses of felicia hemans      the boy stood on the burning deck       whence all but e ad fled       the flame that lit the battles wreck       shone round im oer the dead  when he finished amid the discreet applause of the little party beneath the archway mr dryland again advanced  polly game the top girl of the parish school will now present miss clibborn with a bouquet step forward polly game  this was a surprise arranged by the curate and he watched with pleasure marys look of delighted astonishment  polly game stepped forward and made a little speech in the ingenuous words which mr dryland had thought natural to her character and station  please miss clibborn we the girls of little primpton wish to present you with this bouquet as a slight token of our esteem we wish you a long life and a appy marriage with the choice of your eart  she then handed a very stiff bunch of flowers surrounded with frilled paper like the knuckle of a leg of mutton  we will now sing hymn number one hundred and thirtyseven said mr dryland  the verses were given vigorously while mrs clibborn with a tender smile murmured to mrs parsons that it was beautiful to see such a nice spirit among the lower classes the strains of the brass band died away on the summer breeze and there was a momentary pause then the vicar with a discreet cough to clear his throat came forward  captain parsons ladies and gentlemen parishioners of little primpton i wish to take the opportunity to say a few words  the vicar made an admirable speech the sentiments were hackneyed the observations selfevident and the moral obvious his phrases had the wellknown ring which distinguishes the true orator mr jackson was recognised everywhere to be a fine platform speaker but his varied excellence could not be appreciated in a summary and he had a fine verbosity it is sufficient to say that he concluded by asking for more cheers which were heartily given  james found the whole affair distasteful and ridiculous and indeed scarcely noticed what was going on for his thoughts were entirely occupied with his father at first colonel parsons seemed too depressed to pay attention to the ceremony and his eyes travelled every now and again to james with that startled unhappy expression which was horribly painful to see but his age and weakness prevented him from feeling very intensely for more than a short while time had brought its own good medicine and the old mans mind was easily turned presently he began to smile and the look of pride and happiness returned to his face  but james was not satisfied he felt he must make active reparation when the vicar finished and he understood that some reply was expected it occurred to him that he had an opportunity of salving the bitter wound he had caused the very hatred he felt at making open allusion to his feelings made him think it a just punishment none knew but himself how painful it was to talk in that strain to stupid curious people  i thank you very much for the welcome you have all given me he said  his voice trembled in his nervousness so that he could hardly command it and he reddened it seemed to james a frightful humiliation to have to say the things he had in mind it made them all ugly and vulgar he was troubled also by his inability to express what he felt he noticed a reporter for the local newspaper rapidly taking notes  i have been very much touched by your kindness of course i am extremely proud to have won the victoria cross but i feel it is really more owing to my father than to any deed of mine you all know my father and you know what a brave and gallant soldier he was it was owing to his fine example and to his teaching and to his constant loving care that i was able to do the little i did and i should like to say that it is to him and to my mother that i owe everything it is the thought of his unblemished and exquisite career of the beautiful spirit which brightly coloured all his actions that has supported me in times of difficulty and my earnest desire has always been to prove myself worthy of my father and the name he has handed on to me you have cheered me very kindly now i should like to ask you for three cheers for my father  colonel parsons looked at his son as he began to speak when he realised jamies meaning tears filled his eyes and streamed down his cheekstears of happiness and gratitude all recollection of the affront quickly vanished and he felt an ecstatic joy such as he had never known before the idea came to him in his weakness now i can die happy he was too overcome to be ashamed of his emotion and taking out his handkerchief quite unaffectedly wiped his eyes  the band struck up rule britannia and god save the queen and in orderly fashion as mr dryland had arranged they all marched off the group under the triumphal arch broke up and the jacksons and colonel and mrs clibborn went their ways  mary came into the house she took jamies hands her eyes wet with tears  oh jamie she said you are good it was charming of you to speak as you did of your father you dont know how happy youve made him  im very glad you are pleased he said gravely and bending forward put his arm round her waist and kissed her  for a moment she leant her head against his shoulder but with her emotion was a thing soon vanquished she wished above all things to be manly as befitted a soldiers wife she shook herself and withdrew from jamies arms  but i must be running off or mamma will be angry with me goodbye for the present      james went into the diningroom where his father exhausted by the varied agitations of the day was seeking composure in the leading articles of the morning paper mrs parsons sat on her usual chair knitting and she greeted him with a loving smile james saw that they were both pleased with his few awkward words which still rang in his own ears as shoddy and sentimental and he tasted somewhat ruefully the delight of making the kind creatures happy  has mary gone asked mrs parsons  yes she said her mother would be angry if she stayed  i saw that mrs clibborn was put out i suppose because someone besides herself attracted attention i do think she is the wickedest woman ive ever known  frances frances expostulated the colonel  she is richmond shes a thoroughly bad woman the way she treats mary is simply scandalous  poor girl said the colonel  oh jamie it makes my blood boil when i think of it sometimes the poor thing used to come here quite upset and simply cry as if her heart was breaking  but what does mrs clibborn do asked james surprised  oh i cant tell you shes dreadfully unkind she hates mary because shes grown up and because she sometimes attracts attention shes always making little cruel remarks you only see her when shes on her good behaviour but when shes alone with mary mrs clibborn is simply horrible she abuses her she tells her shes ugly and that she dresses badly how can she dress any better when mrs clibborn spends all the money on herself ive heard her myself say to mary how stupid and clumsy you are im ashamed to take you anywhere and marys the very soul of goodness she teaches in the sunday school and she trains the choirboys and she visits the poor and yet mrs clibborn complains that shes useless i wanted richmond to talk to colonel clibborn about it  mary particularly asked me not to said colonel parsons she preferred to bear anything rather than create unhappiness between her father and mother  shes a perfect angel of goodness cried mrs parsons enthusiastically shes simply a martyr and all the time shes as kind and affectionate to her mother as if she were the best woman in the world she never lets anyone say a word against her  sometimes murmured colonel parsons she used to say that her only happiness was in the thought of you jamie  the thought of me said james and then hesitatingly do you think she is very fond of me mother  fond of you mrs parsons laughed she worships the very ground you tread on you cant imagine all you are to her  youll make the boy vain said colonel parsons laughing  often the only way we could comfort her was by saying that you would come back some day and take her away from here  we shall have to be thinking of weddings soon i suppose said colonel parsons looking at james with a bantering smile  james turned white its rather early to think of that just yet  we spoke of june said his mother  we must see  youve waited so long said colonel parsons im sure you dont want to wait any longer  she will make you a good wife jamie you are lucky to have found such a dear sweet girl its a blessing to us to think that you will be so happy  as i was saying to mary the other day added colonel parsons laughing gently you must begin thinking of your trousseau my dear i said if i know anything of jamie hell want to get married in a week these young fellows are always impatient  mrs parsons smiled  well its a great secret and mary would be dreadfully annoyed if she thought you knew but when we heard you were coming home she started to order things her father has given her a hundred pounds to begin with  they had no mercy thought james they were horribly cruel in their lovingkindness in their affectionate interest for his welfare     vi   james had been away from england for five years and in that time a curious change long silently proceeding had made itself openly feltbecoming manifest like an insidious disease only when every limb and every organ were infected a new spirit had been in action eating into the foundations of the national character it worked through the masses of the great cities unnerved by the three poisons of drink the salvation army and popular journalism a mighty force of hysteria and sensationalism was created seething ready to burst its bonds  the canker spread through the countryside the boundaries of class and class are now so vague that quickly the whole population was affected the current literature of the day flourished upon it the people of england neurotic from the stress of the last sixty years became unstable as water and with the petty reverses of the beginning of the war the last barriers of shame were broken down their arrogance was dissipated and suddenly the english became timorous as a conquered nation deprecating apologetic like frightened women they ran to and fro wringing their hands reserve restraint selfpossession were swept away  and now we are frankly emotional reeds tottering in the wind our boast is that we are not even reeds that think we cry out for idols who is there that will set up a golden ass that we may fall down and worship we glory in our shame in our swelling hearts in our eyes heavy with tears we want sympathy at all costs we run about showing our bleeding vitals asking one another whether they are not indeed a horrible sight englishmen now are proud of being womanish and nothing is more manly than to weep to be a man of feeling is better than to be a gentlemanit is certainly much easier the halt of mind the maim the blind of wit have come by their own and the poor in spirit have inherited the earth  james had left england when this emotional state was contemptible found chiefly in the dregs of the populace it was ascribed to ignorance and to the abuse of stimulants when he returned it had the public conscience behind it he could not understand the change the persons he had known sober equalminded and restrained now seemed violently hysterical james still shuddered remembering the curates allusions to his engagement and he wondered that mary far from thinking them impertinent had been vastly gratified she seemed to take pleasure in publicly advertising her connection in giving her private affairs to the inspection of all and sundry the whole ceremony had been revolting he loathed the adulation and the fulsome sentiment his own emotions seemed vulgar now that he had been forced to display them to the gaping crowd  but the function of the previous day had the effect also of sealing his engagement everyone knew of it jamies name was indissolubly joined with marys he could not break the tie now without exposing her to the utmost humiliation and how could he offer her such an affront when she loved him devotedly it was not vanity that made him think so his mother had told him outright and he saw it in every look of marys eyes in the least inflection of her voice james asked himself desperately why mary should care for him he was not goodlooking he was silent he was not amusing he had no particular attraction  james was sitting in his room and presently heard marys voice calling from the hall  jamie jamie  he got up and came downstairs  why jamie said his father you ought to have gone to fetch mary instead of waiting here for her to come to you  you certainly ought jamie said mary laughing and then looking at him with sudden feeling but how seedy you look  james had hardly slept troubling over his perplexity and he looked haggard and tired  im all right he said im not very strong yet and i was rather exhausted yesterday  mary thought you would like to go with her this morning while she does her district visiting  its a beautiful morning jamie it will do you good cried mary  i should like it very much  they started out mary wore her everyday costumea serge gown a sailor hat and solid squaretoed boots she walked fast with long steps and firm carriage james set himself to talk asking her insignificant questions about the people she visited mary answered with feeling and at length but was interrupted by arriving at a cottage  youd better not come in here she said blushing slightly although i want to take you in to some of the people i think it will be a lesson to them  a lesson in what  oh i cant tell you to your face i dont want to make you conceited but you can guess while youre waiting for me  marys patient was about to be confined and thinking her condition rather indecent quite rightly mary had left james outside but the good lady since it was all in the way of nature was not so ashamed of herself as she should have been and insisted on coming to the door to show miss clibborn out  take care he doesnt see you cried mary in alarm pushing her back  well theres no harm in it im a married woman youll have to go through it yourself one day miss  mary rejoined her lover suffused in blushes hoping he had seen nothing  its very difficult to teach these people propriety somehow the lower classes seem to have no sense of decency  whats the matter  oh nothing i can tell you replied mary modestly then to turn the conversation she asked after my young man and was very anxious to see you  was she how did she know you had a young man asked james grimly  oh everyone knows that you cant keep secrets in primpton and besides im not ashamed of it are you  i havent got a young man  mary laughed  they walked on the morning was crisp and bright sending a healthy colour through marys cheeks the blue sky and the bracing air made her feel more selfreliant better assured than ever of her upright purpose and her candid heart the road firm underfoot and delightful to walk upon stretched before them in a sinuous line a pleasant odour came from the adjoining fields from the farmyards as they passed them the larks soared singing with happy heart while the sparrows chirruped in the hedges the hawthorn was bursting into leaf all bright and green and here and there the wild flowers were showing themselves the buttercup and the speedwell but while the charm of nature made james anxious to linger to lean on a gate and look for a while at the cows lazily grazing mary had too sound a constitution to find in it anything but a stimulus to renewed activity  we mustnt dawdle you lazy creature she cried merrily i shall never get through my round before one oclock if we dont put our best foot foremost  cant you see them some other time  the limpid air softened his heart he thought for a moment that if he could wander aimlessly with mary gossiping without purpose they might end by understanding one another the sun the wild flowers the inconstant breeze might help to create a new feeling  but mary turned to him with grave tenderness  you know id do anything to please you jamie but even for you i cannot neglect my duty  james froze  of course youre quite right he said it really doesnt matter  they came to another cottage and this time mary took james in  its a poor old man she said im so sorry for him hes always so grateful for what i do  they found him lying in bed writhing with pain his head supported by a pillow  oh how uncomfortable you look cried mary you poor thing who on earth arranged your pillows like that  my daughter miss  i must talk to her she ought to know better  miss clibborn drew away the pillows very gently smoothed them out and replaced them  i cant bear em like that miss the other is the only way im comfortable  nonsense john cried mary brightly you couldnt be comfortable with your head all on one side youre much better as you are  james saw the look of pain in the mans face and ventured to expostulate  dont you think youd better put them back in the old way he seemed much easier  nonsense jamie you must know that the head ought to be higher than the body  please miss i cant bear the pillow like this  oh yes you can you must show more forbearance and fortitude remember that god sends you pain in order to try you think of our lord suffering silently on the cross  youre putting him to quite unnecessary torture mary said james he must know best how hes comfortable  its only because hes obstinate those people are always complaining really you must permit me to know more about nursing than you do jamie  jamies face grew dark and grim but he made no answer  i shall send you some soup john said mary as they went out you know one can never get these people to do anything in a rational way she added to james its perfectly heartrending trying to teach them even such a natural thing as making themselves comfortable  james was silent  they walked a few yards farther and passed a man in a dogcart mary turned very red staring in front of her with the fixed awkwardness of one not adept in the useful art of cutting  oh she said with vexation hes going to john  who is it  its dr higginsa horrid vulgar man hes been dreadfully rude to me and i make a point of cutting him  really  oh he behaved scandalously i cant bear doctors theyre so dreadfully interfering and they seem to think no one can know anything about doctoring but themselves he was attending one of my patients it was a woman and of course i knew what she wanted she was ill and weak and needed strengthening so i sent her down a bottle of port well dr higgins came to the house and asked to see me hes not a gentleman you know and he was so rude ive come to see you about mrs gandy he said i particularly ordered her not to take stimulants and i find youve sent her down port i thought she wanted it i said she told me that you had said she wasnt to touch anything but i thought a little port would do her good then he said i wish to goodness you wouldnt interfere with what you know nothing about i should like you to remember that youre speaking to a gentlewoman i said i dont care twopence he answered in the rudest way im not going to allow you to interfere with my patients i took the port away and i wish you to understand that youre not to send any more  then i confess i lost my temper i suppose you took it away to drink yourself i said then what dyou think he did he burst out laughing and said a bottle of port that cost two bob at the local grocers the saints preserve us  james repressed a smile  you impertinent man i said you ought to be ashamed to talk to a woman like that i shall at once send mrs gandy another bottle of port and its no business of yours how much it cost if you do he said and anything happens by god ill have you up for manslaughter i rang the bell leave the house i said and never dare come here again now dont you think i was right jamie  my dear mary you always are  james looked back at the doctor entering the cottage it was some comfort to think that he would put the old man into a comfortable position  when i told papa added mary he got in a most fearful rage he insisted on going out with a horsewhip and said he meant to thrash dr higgins he looked for him all the morning but couldnt find him and then your mother and i persuaded him it was better to treat such a vulgar man with silent contempt  james had noticed that the doctor was a burly broadshouldered fellow and he could not help thinking colonel clibborns resolution distinctly wise how sad it is that in this world right is so often subordinate to brute force  but hes not received anywhere we all cut him and i get everyone i can not to employ him  ah murmured james  marys next patient was feminine and james was again left to cool his heels in the road but not alone for mr dryland came out of the cottage the curate was a big stout man with reddish hair and a complexion like squashed strawberries and cream his large heavy face hairless except for scanty red eyebrows gave a disconcerting impression of nakedness his eyes were blue and his mouth small with the expression which young ladies eighty years back strove to acquire by repeating the words prune and prism he had a fat full voice with unctuous modulations not entirely under his control so that sometimes unintentionally he would utter the most commonplace remark in a tone fitted for a benediction mr dryland was possessed by the laudable ambition to be all things to all men and he tried without conspicuous success always to suit his conversation to his hearers with old ladies he was bland with sportsmen slangy with yokels he was broadly humorous and with young people aggressively juvenile but above all he wished to be manly and cultivated a boisterous laugh and a jovial manner  i dont know if you remember me he cried with a ripple of fat laughter going up to james i had the pleasure of addressing a few words to you yesterday in my official capacity miss clibborn told me you were waiting and i thought i would introduce myself my name is dryland  i remember quite well  im the vicars bottlewasher you know added the curate with a guffaw change for yougoing round to the sick and needy of the parishafter fighting the good fight i hear you were wounded  i was rather badly  i wish i could have gone out and had a smack at the boers nothing i should have liked better but of course im only a parson you know it wouldnt have been thought the correct thing mr dryland from his superior height beamed down on james i dont know whether you remember the few words which i was privileged to address to you yesterday  perfectly put in james  impromptu you know but they expressed my feelings that is one of the best things the war has done for us it has permitted us to express our emotions more openly i thought it a beautiful sight to see the noble tears coursing down your fathers furrowed cheeks those few words of yours have won all our hearts i may say that our little endeavours were nothing beside that short unstudied speech i hope there will be a full report in the tunbridge wells papers  i hope not cried james  youre too modest captain parsons that is what i said to miss clibborn yesterday true courage is always modest but it is our duty to see that it does not hide its light under a bushel i hope you wont think it a liberty but i myself gave the reporter a few notes  will miss clibborn be long asked james looking at the cottage  ah what a good woman she is captain parsons my dear sir i assure you shes an angel of mercy  its very kind of you to say so  not at all its a pleasure the good she does is beyond praise shes a wonderful help in the parish she has at heart the spiritual welfare of the people and i may say that she is a moral force of the first magnitude  im sure thats a very delightful thing to be  you know i cant help thinking laughed mr dryland fatly that she ought to be the wife of a clergyman rather than of a military man  mary came out  ive been telling mrs gray that i dont approve of the things her daughter wears in church she said i dont think its nice for people of that class to wear such bright colours  i dont know what we should do in the parish without you replied the curate unctuously its so rare to find someone who knows what is right and isnt afraid of speaking out  mary said that she and james were walking home and asked mr dryland whether he would not accompany them  i shall be delighted if im not de trop  he looked with laughing significance from one to the other  i wanted to talk to you about my girls said mary  she had a class of village maidens to whom she taught sewing respect for their betters and other useful things  i was just telling captain parsons that you were an angel of mercy miss clibborn  im afraid im not that replied mary gravely but i try to do my duty  ah cried mr dryland raising his eyes so that he looked exactly like a codfish how few of us can say that  im seriously distressed about my girls they live in nasty little cottages and eat filthy things they pass their whole lives under the most disgusting conditions and yet theyre happy i cant get them to see that they ought to be utterly miserable  oh i know sighed the curate it makes me sad to think of it  surely if theyre happy you can want nothing better said james rather impatiently  but i do they have no right to be happy under such circumstances i want to make them feel their wretchedness  what a brutal thing to do cried james  its the only way to improve them i want them to see things as i see them  and how dyou know that you see them any more correctly than they do  my dear jamie cried mary and then as the humour of such a suggestion dawned upon her she burst into a little shout of laughter  what dyou think is the good of making them dissatisfied asked james grimly  i want to make them better nobler worthier i want to make their lives more beautiful and holy  if you saw a man happily wearing a tinsel crown would you go to him and say my good friend youre making a fool of yourself your crown isnt of real gold and you must throw it away i havent a golden crown to give you instead but youre wicked to take pleasure in that sham thing theyre just as comfortable after their fashion in a hovel as you in your fine house they enjoy the snack of fat pork they have on sunday just as much as you enjoy your boiled chickens and blancmanges theyre happy and thats the chief thing  happiness is not the chief thing in this world james said mary gravely  isnt it i thought it was  captain parsons is a cynic said mr dryland with a slightly supercilious smile  because i say its idiotic to apply your standards to people who have nothing in common with you i hate all this interfering for gods sake let us go our way and if we can get a little pleasure out of dross and tinsel let us keep it  i want to give the poor high ideals said mary  i should have thought bread and cheese would be more useful  my dear jamie said mary goodnaturedly i think youre talking of things you know nothing about  you must remember that miss clibborn has worked nobly among the poor for many years  my own conscience tells me im right pursued mary and you see mr dryland agrees with me i know you mean well jamie but i dont think you quite understand the matter and i fancy we had better change the conversation     vii   next day mary went into primpton house colonel parsons nodded to her as she walked up the drive and took off his spectacles the front door was neither locked nor bolted in that confiding neighbourhood and mary walked straight in  well my dear said the colonel smiling with pleasure for he was as fond of her as of his own son  i thought id come and see you alone jamies still out isnt he i saw him pass our house i was standing at the window but he didnt look up  i daresay he was thinking hes grown very thoughtful now  mrs parsons came in and her quiet face lit up too as she greeted mary she kissed her tenderly  jamies out you know  mary has come to see us said the colonel she doesnt want us to feel neglected now that she has the boy  we shall never dream that you can do anything unkind dear mary replied mrs parsons stroking the girls hair its natural that you should think more of him than of us  mary hesitated a moment  dont you think jamie has changed  mrs parsons looked at her quickly  i think he has grown more silent but hes been through so much and then hes a man now he was only a boy when we saw him last  dyou think he cares for me any more asked mary with a rapid tremor in her voice  mary  of course he does he talks of you continually said colonel parsons and always as if he were devoted doesnt he frances  the old mans deep love for mary had prevented him from seeing in jamies behaviour anything incongruous with that of a true lover  what makes you ask that question mary said mrs parsons  her feminine tact had led her to notice a difference in jamies feeling towards his betrothed but she had been unwilling to think that it amounted even to coldness such a change could be explained in a hundred natural ways and might indeed exist merely in her own imagination  oh hes not the same as he was cried mary i dont know what it is but i feel it in his whole manner yesterday evening he barely said a word  james had dined with the clibborns in solemn state  i daresay hes not very well yet his wound troubles him still  i try to put it down to that said mary but he seems to force himself to speak to me hes not natural ive got an awful fear that he has ceased to care for me  she looked from colonel parsons to his wife who stared at her in dismay  dont be angry with me she said i couldnt talk like this to anyone else but i know you love me i look upon you already as my father and mother i dont want to be unkind to mamma but i couldnt talk of it to her she would only sneer at me and im afraid its making me rather unhappy  of course we want you to treat us as your real parents mary we both love you as we love jamie we have always looked upon you as our daughter  youre so good to me  has your mother said anything to annoy you  mary faltered  last night when he went away she said she didnt think he was devoted to me  oh i knew it was your mother whod put this in your head she has always been jealous of you i suppose she thinks hes in love with her  mrs parsons cried mary in a tone of entreaty  i know you cant bear anything said against your mother and its wicked of me to vex you but she has no right to suggest such things  its not only that its what i feel  im sure jamie is most fond of you said colonel parsons kindly youve not seen one another for five years and you find yourselves altered even we feel a little strange with jamie sometimes dont we frances what children they are frances colonel parsons laughed in that irresistibly sweet fashion of his why it was only the day before yesterday that jamie came to us with a long face and asked if you cared for him  did he asked mary with pleased surprise anxious to believe what the colonel suggested oh he must see that i love him perhaps he finds me unresponsive how could i help caring for him i think if he ceased to love me i should die  my dearest mary cried mrs parsons the tears rising to her eyes dont talk like that im sure he cant help loving you either youre so good and sweet youre both of you fanciful and hes not well be patient jamie is shy and reserved he hasnt quite got used to us yet he doesnt know how to show his feelings it will all come right soon  of course he loves you said colonel parsons who could help it why if i were a young fellow i should be mad to marry you  and what about me richmond asked mrs parsons smiling  well i think i should have to commit bigamy and marry you both  they laughed at the colonels mild little joke happy to break through the cloud of doubt which oppressed them  youre a dear thing said mary kissing the old man and im a very silly girl its wrong of me to give way to whims and fancies  you must be very brave when youre the wife of a vc said the colonel patting her hand  oh it was a beautiful action cried mary and hes as modest about it as though he had done nothing that any man might not do i think there can be no sight more pleasing to god than that of a brave man risking his life to save a comrade  and that ought to be an assurance to you mary that james will never do anything unkind or dishonourable trust him and forgive his little faults of manner im sure he loves you and soon youll get married and be completely happy  marys face darkened once more  hes been here three days and hes not said a word about getting married oh i cant help it im so frightened i wish hed say somethingjust one word to show that he really cares for me he seems to have forgotten that were even engaged  colonel parsons looked at his wife begging her by his glance to say something that would comfort mary mrs parsons looked down uncertain ill at ease  you dont despise me for talking like this mrs parsons  despise you my dear how can i when i love you so dearly shall i speak to jamie im sure when he understands that hes making you unhappy hell be different he has the kindest heart in the world ive never known him do an unkind thing in his life  no dont say anything to him replied mary i daresay its all nonsense i dont want him to be driven into making love to me      meanwhile james wandered thoughtfully the country was undulating and little hill rose after little hill affording spacious views of the fat kentish fields encircled by oak trees and by chestnuts owned by rich landlords each generation had done its best and the fruitful land was tended like a garden but it had no abandonment no freedom the hand of man was obvious perpetually in the trimness and in the careful arrangement so that the landscape in its formality reminded one of those set pieces chosen by the classic painters but the fields were fresh with the tall young grass of the new year the buttercups flaunted themselves gaily careless of the pitiless night rejoicing in the sunshine as before they had rejoiced in the enlivening rain the pleasant raindrops still lingered on the daisies the feathery ball of the dandelion carried by the breeze floated past like a symbol of the life of mana random thing resistless to the merest breath with no mission but to spread its seed upon the fertile earth so that things like unto it should spring up in the succeeding summer and flower uncared for and reproduce themselves and die  james decided finally that he must break that very evening his engagement with mary he could not put it off every day made his difficulty greater and it was impossible any longer to avoid the discussion of their marriage nor could he continue to treat mary with nothing better than friendliness he realised all her good qualities she was frank and honest and simple anxious to do right charitable according to her light kindness itself james felt sincerely grateful for the affectionate tenderness which mary showed to his father and mother he was thankful for that and for much else and was prepared to look upon her as a very good friend even as a sister but he did not love her he could not look upon the prospect of marriage without repulsion nor did mary he said really love him he knew what love wassomething different entirely from that pallid flame of affection and esteem of which alone she was capable mary loved him for certain qualities of mind because his station in life was decent his manners passable his morals beyond reproach  she might as well marry the ten commandments he cried impatiently  mary cared for him from habit from a sense of decorum and for the fitness of things but that was not love he shrugged his shoulders scornfully looking for some word to express the mildly pleasant unagitating emotion james who had been devoured by it who had struggled with it as with a deadly sin who had killed it finally while like a serpent of evil it clung to his throat drinking his lifes blood james knew what love wasa fire in the veins a divine affliction a passion a frenzy a madness the love he knew was the love of the body of flesh and blood the love that engenders the love that kills at the bottom of it is sex and sex is not ugly or immoral for sex is the root of life the woman is fair because man shall love her body her lips are red and passionate that he may kiss them her hair is beautiful that he may take it in his handsa river of living gold  james stopped and the dead love rose again and tore his entrails like a beast of prey he gasped with agony with bitter joy ah that was the true love what did he care that the woman lacked this and that he loved her because he loved her he loved her for her faults and in spite of the poignant anguish he thanked her from the bottom of his heart for she had taught him love she had caused him endless pain but she had given him the strength to bear it she had ruined his life perhaps but had shown him that life was worth living what were the agony the torture the despair beside that radiant passion which made him godlike it is only the lover who lives and of his life every moment is intense and fervid james felt that his most precious recollection was that ardent month during which at last he had seen the world in all its dazzling movement in its manifold colour singing with his youth and laughing to his joy  and he did not care that hideous names have been given to that dear passion to that rich desire the vulgar call it lust and blush and hide their faces in their folly is the shame in their prurience the disgrace they do not know that the appetite which shocks them is the very origin of the highest qualities of man it is they weaklings afraid to look life in the face dotards and sentimentalists who have made the body unclean they have covered the nakedness of aphrodite with the rags of their own impurity they have disembowelled the great lovers of antiquity till cleopatra serves to adorn a prudish tale and lancelot to point a moral oh mother nature give us back our freedom with its strength of sinew and its humour for lack of it we perish in false shame and our figleaves point our immodesty to all the world teach us that love is not a tawdry sentiment but a fire divine in order to the procreation of children teach us not to dishonour our bodies for they are beautiful and pure and all thy works are sweet teach us again in thy merciful goodness that man is made for woman his body for her body and that the flesh cannot sin  teach us also not to rant too much even in thy service and though we do set up for prophets and the like let us not forget occasionally to laugh at our very august selves      then harking back jamies thoughts returned to the dinner of the previous evening at the clibborns he was the only guest and when he arrived found mary and the colonel by themselves in the drawingroom it was an old habit of mrs clibborns not to appear till after her visitors thinking that so she created a greater effect the colonel wore a very high collar which made his head look like some queer flower on a long white stalk hair and eyebrows were freshly dyed and glistened like the oiled locks of a young jewess he was the perfect dandy even to his bejewelled fingers and his scented handkerchief his manner was a happy mixture of cordiality and condescension by the side of which marys unaffected simplicity contrasted oddly she seemed less at home in an evening dress than in the walking costume she vastly preferred her free rather masculine movements were ungainly in the silk frock badly made and countrified while lace and ribbons suited her most awkwardly she was out of place too in that room decorated with all the abominations of pseudofashion with draperies and tissuepaper uncomfortable little chairs and rickety tables in every available place stood photographs of mrs clibbornmrs clibborn sitting standing lying mrs clibborn full face threequarter face side face mrs clibborn in this costume or in that costumegrave gay thoughtful or smiling mrs clibborn showing her beautiful teeth her rounded arms her vast shoulders mrs clibborn dressed to the nines and mrs clibborn as undressed as she dared  finally the beauty swept in with a great rustle of silk displaying to the full her very opulent charms her hair was lightly powdered and honestly she looked remarkably handsome  dont say ive kept you waiting she murmured i could never forgive myself  james made some polite reply and they went down to dinner the conversation was kept at the high level which one naturally expects from persons fashionable enough to dine late they discussed literature by which they meant the last novel but one art by which they meant the royal academy and society by which they meant their friends who kept carriages mrs clibborn said that of course she could not expect james to pay any attention to her since all his thoughts must be for mary and then proceeded entirely to absorb him  you must find it very dull here she moaned im afraid youll be bored to death and she looked at mary with her most smilingly cruel expression oh mary why did you put on that dreadfully dowdy frock ive asked you over and over again to give it away but you never pay attention to your poor mother  its all right said mary looking down at it laughing and blushing a little  mrs clibborn turned again to james  i think its such a mistake for women not to dress well im an old woman now but i always try to look my best reggie has never seen me in a dowdy gown have you reggie  any dress would become you my love  oh reggie dont say that before james he looks upon his future mother as an old woman  then at the end of dinner  dont sit too long over your wine i shall be so dull with nobody but mary to amuse me  mrs clibborn had been fond enough of mary when she was a little girl who could be petted on occasion and sent away when necessary but as she grew up and exhibited a will of her own she found her almost an intolerable nuisance the girl developed a conscience and refused indignantly to tell the little fibs which her mother occasionally suggested she put her sense of right and wrong before mrs clibborns wishes which that lady considered undutiful if not entirely wicked it seemed nothing short of an impertinence that mary should disapprove of theatres when there was nothing to which the elder woman was more devoted and mrs clibborn felt that the girl saw through all her little tricks and artful dodges often speaking out strongly when her mother proposed to do something particularly underhand it was another grievance that mary had inherited no good looks and the faded beauty in her vanity was convinced that the girl spitefully observed every fresh wrinkle that appeared upon her face but mrs clibborn was also a little afraid of her daughter such meekness and such good temper were difficult to overcome and when she snubbed her it was not only to chasten a proud spirit but also to reassure herself  when the ladies had retired the colonel handed james an execrable cigar  now im going to give you some very special port ive got he said  he poured out a glass with extreme care and passed it over with evident pride james remembered marys story of the doctor and having tasted the wine entirely sympathised with him it was no wonder that invalids did not thrive upon it  fine wine isnt it said colonel clibborn had it in my cellar for years he shook it so as to inhale the aroma i got it from my old friend the duke of st olpherts reggie my boy he saidreggie do you want some good port good port bill i criedi always called him bill you know his christian name was williami should think i do billy old boy well said the duke ive got some i can let you have  he was a winemerchant was he asked james  winemerchant my dear fellow he was the duke of st olpherts hed bought up the cellar of an austrian nobleman and he had more port than he wanted  and this is some of it asked james gravely holding the murky fluid to the light  then the colonel stretched his legs and began to talk of the war james rather tired of the subject sought to change the conversation but colonel clibborn was anxious to tell one who had been through it how the thing should have been conducted so his guest with a mixture of astonishment and indignation resigned himself to listen to the most pitiful inanities he marvelled that a man should have spent his life in the service and yet apparently be ignorant of the very elements of warfare but having already learnt to hold his tongue he let the colonel talk and was presently rewarded by a break something reminded the gallant cavalryman of a hoary anecdote and he gave james that dreary round of stories which have dragged their heavy feet for thirty years from garrison to garrison then naturally he proceeded to the account of his own youthful conquests the colonel had evidently been a devil with the ladies for he knew all about the forgotten balletdancers of the seventies and related with gusto a number of scabrous tales  ah my boy in my day we went the pace i tell you in confidence i was a deuce of a rake before i got married  when they returned to the drawingroom mrs clibborn was ready with her langorous smile and made james sit beside her on the sofa in a few minutes the colonel as was his habit closed his eyes dropped his chin and fell comfortably asleep mrs clibborn slowly turned to mary  will you try and find me my glasses darling she murmured theyre either in my workbasket or on the morningroom table and if you cant see them there perhaps theyre in your fathers study i want to read jamie a letter  ill go and look mother  mary went out and mrs clibborn put her hand on jamies arm  do you dislike me very much jamie she murmured softly  on the contrary  im afraid your mother doesnt care for me  im sure she does  women have never liked me i dont know why i cant help it if im not exactlyplain im as god made me  james thought that the almighty in that case must have an unexpected familiarity with the rougepot and the powderpuff  do you know that i did all i could to prevent your engagement to mary  you cried james thunderstruck i never knew that  i thought i had better tell you myself you mustnt be angry with me it was for your own good if i had had my way you would never have become engaged i thought you were so much too young  five years ago dyou meanwhen it first happened  you were only a boya very nice boy jamie i always liked you i dont approve of long engagements and i thought youd change your mind most young men are a little wild its right that they should be  james looked at her wondering suddenly whether she knew or divined anything it was impossible she was too silly  youre very wise  oh dont say that cried mrs clibborn with a positive groan it sounds so middleaged i always thought mary was too old for you a woman should be ten years younger than her husband  tell me all about it insisted james  they wouldnt listen to me they said you had better be engaged they thought it would benefit your morals i was very much against it i think boys are so much nicer when they havent got encumbrancesor morals  at that moment mary came in  i cant find your glasses mamma  oh it doesnt matter replied mrs clibborn smiling softly ive just remembered that i sent them into tunbridge wells yesterday to be mended     viii   james knew he would see mary at the teaparty which mrs jackson that afternoon was giving at the vicarage society in little primpton was exclusive with the result that the same people met each other day after day and the only intruders were occasional visitors of irreproachable antecedents from tunbridge wells respectability is a plant which in that fashionable wateringplace has been so assiduously cultivated that it flourishes now in the open air like the yellow gorse it is found in every corner thriving hardily under the most unfavourable conditions and the keener the wind the harder the frost the more proudly does it hold its head but on this particular day the gathering was confined to the immediate neighbours and when the parsons arrived they found beside their hosts only the clibborns and the inevitable curate there was a prolonged shaking of hands inquiries concerning the health of all present and observations suggested by the weather then they sat down in a circle and set themselves to discuss the questions of the day  oh mr dryland cried mary thanks so much for that book i am enjoying it  i thought youd like it replied the curate smiling blandly i know you share my admiration for miss corelli  mr dryland has just lent me the master christian mary explained turning to mrs jackson  oh i was thinking of putting it on the list for my next book  they had formed a club in little primpton of twelve persons each buying a sixshilling book at the beginning of the year and passing it on in return for another after a certain interval so that at the end of twelve months all had read a dozen masterpieces of contemporary fiction  i thought id like to buy it at once said mr dryland i always think one ought to possess marie corellis books shes the only really great novelist we have in england now  mr dryland was a man of taste and authority so that his literary judgments could always be relied on  of course i dont pretend to know much about the matter said mary modestly there are more important things in life than books but i do think shes splendid i cant help feeling im wasting my time when i read most novels but i never feel that with marie corelli  no one would think she was a woman said the vicar  to which the curate answered le genie na pas de sexe  the others being no scholars did not quite understand the remark but they looked intelligent  i always think its so disgraceful the way the newspapers sneer at her said mrs jackson and im sure merely because shes a woman  and because she has genius my dear put in the vicar some minds are so contemptibly small that they are simply crushed by greatness it requires an eagle to look at the sun  and the excellent people looked at one another with a certain selfsatisfaction for they had the fearless gaze of the king of birds in face of that brilliant orb  the critics are willing to do anything for money miss corelli has said herself that there is a vile conspiracy to blacken her and for my part i am quite prepared to believe it theyre all afraid of her because she dares to show them up  besides most of the critics are unsuccessful novelists added mr dryland and they are as envious as they can be  it makes one boil with indignation cried mary to think that people can be so utterly base those who revile her are not worthy to unloose the latchet of her shoes  it does one good to hear such wholehearted admiration replied the curate beaming but you must remember that genius has always been persecuted look at keats and shelley the critics abused them just as they abuse marie corelli even shakespeare was slandered but time has vindicated our immortal william time will vindicate as brightly our gentle marie  i wonder how many of us here could get through hamlet without yawning meditatively said the vicar  i see your point cried mr dryland opening his eyes while we could all read the sorrows of satan without a break ive read it three times and each perusal leaves me more astounded miss corelli has her revenge in her own hand what can she care for the petty snarling of critics when the wreath of immortality is on her brow i dont hesitate to say it im not ashamed of my opinion i consider miss corelli every bit as great as william shakespeare ive gone into the matter carefully and if i may say so im speaking of what i know something about my deliberate opinion is that in wit and humour and language shes every bit his equal  her language is beautiful said mrs jackson when i read her i feel just as if i were listening to hymns  and where i should like to know continued the curate raising his voice can you find in a play of shakespeares such a gallery of portraits as in the master christian  and there is one thing you must never forget said the vicar gravely she has a deep religious feeling which you will find in none of shakespeares plays every one of her books has a lofty moral purpose that is the justification of fiction the novelist has a high vocation if he could only see it he can inculcate submission to authority hope charity obediencein fact all the higher virtues he can become a handmaid of the church and now when irreligion and immorality and scepticism are rampant we must not despise the humblest instruments  how true that is said mrs jackson  if all novelists were like marie corelli i should willingly hold them out my hand i think every christian ought to read barabbas it gives an entirely new view of christ it puts the incidents of the gospel in a way that one had never dreamed i was never so impressed in my life  but all her books are the same in that way cried mary they all make me feel so much better and nobler and more truly christian  i think shes vulgar and blasphemous murmured mrs clibborn quietly as though she were making the simplest observation  mamma cried mary deeply shocked and among the others there was a little movement of indignation and disgust  mrs clibborn was continually mortifying her daughter by this kind of illiterate gaucherie but the most painful part of it was that the good lady always remained perfectly unconscious of having said anything incredibly silly and continued with perfect selfassurance  ive never been able to finish a book of hers i began one about electricity which i couldnt understand and then i tried another i forget what it was but there was something in it about a bed of roses and i thought it very improper i dont think it was a nice book for mary to read but girls seem to read everything now  there was a pained hush such as naturally occurs when someone has made a very horrible faux pas they all looked at one another awkwardly while mary ashamed at her mothers want of taste kept her eyes glued to the carpet but mrs clibborns folly was so notorious that presently anger was succeeded by contemptuous amusement and the curate came to the rescue with a loud guffaw  of course you know your marie corelli by heart captain parsons  im afraid ive never read one of them  not they all cried in surprise  oh ill send them to you to primpton house said mr dryland i have them all why no ones education is complete till hes read marie corelli  this was considered a very good hit at mrs clibborn and the dear people smiled at one another significantly even mary could scarcely keep a straight face  the tea then appeared and was taken more or less silently with the exception of the fashionable mrs clibborn they were all more used to making a sitdown meal of it and the care of holding a cup with a piece of cake unsteadily balanced in the saucer prevented them from indulging in very brilliant conversational feats they found one gymnastic exercise quite sufficient at a time but when the teacups were safely restored to the table mrs jackson suggested a little music  will you open the proceedings mary  the curate went up to miss clibborn with a bow gallantly offering his arm to escort her to the piano mary had thoughtfully brought her music and began to play a song without words by mendelssohn she was considered a fine pianist in little primpton she attacked the notes with marked resolution keeping the loud pedal down throughout her eyes were fixed on the music with an intense determined air in which you saw an eagerness to perform a social duty and her lips moved as conscientiously she counted time mary played the whole piece without making a single mistake and at the end was much applauded  theres nothing like classical music is there cried the curate enthusiastically as mary stopped rather out of breath for she played as she did everything else with energy and thoroughness  its the only music i really love  and those songs without words are beautiful said colonel parsons who was standing on marys other side  mendelssohn is my favourite composer she replied hes so full of soul  ah yes murmured mr dryland his heart seems to throb through all his music its strange that he should have been a jew  but then our lord was a jew wasnt he said mary  yes one is so apt to forget that  mary turned the leaves and finding another piece which was familiar to her set about it it was a satisfactory thing to listen to her performance in marys decided touch one felt all the strength of her character with its simple unaffected candour and its eminent sense of propriety in her execution one perceived the high purpose which animated her whole conduct it was pure and wholesome and thoroughly english and her pianoplaying served also as a moral lesson for none could listen without remembering that life was not an affair to be taken lightly but a strenuous endeavour the world was a battlefield this one realised more particularly when mary forgot for a page or so to take her foot off the pedal each one of us had a mission to perform a duty to do a function to fulfil  meanwhile james was trying to make conversation with mrs clibborn  how well mary plays  dyou think so i cant bear amateurs i wish they wouldnt play  james looked at mrs clibborn quickly it rather surprised him that she the very silliest woman he had ever known should say the only sensible things he had heard that day nor could he forget that she had done her best to prevent his engagement  i think youre a very wonderful woman he said  oh jamie  mrs clibborn smiled and sighed slipping forward her hand for him to take but james was too preoccupied to notice the movement  im beginning to think you really like me murmured mrs clibborn cooing like an amorous dove  then james was invited to sing and refused  please do jamie cried mary smiling for my sake you used to sing so nicely  he still tried to excuse himself but finding everyone insistent went at last with very bad grace to the piano he not only sang badly but knew it and was irritated that he should be forced to make a fool of himself mr dryland sang badly but perfectly satisfied with himself needed no pressing when his turn came he made a speciality of old english songs and thundered out in his most ecclesiastical manner a jovial ditty entitled down among the dead men  the afternoon was concluded by an adjournment to the diningroom to play bagatelle the most inane of games to which the billiardplayer goes with contempt changed quickly to wrath when he cannot put the balls into absurd little holes mary was an adept and took pleasure in showing james how the thing should be done he noticed that she and the curate managed the whole affair between them arranging partners and advising freely mrs clibborn alone refused to play saying frankly it was too idiotic a pastime  at last the party broke up and in a group bade their farewells  ill walk home with you mary if you dont mind said james and smoke a pipe  mary suddenly became radiant and colonel parsons gave her a happy little smile and a friendly nod at last james had his opportunity he lingered while mary gathered together her music and waited again to light his pipe so that when they came out of the vicarage gates the rest of the company were no longer in sight the day had become overcast and sombre on the even surface of the sky floated little ragged black clouds like the fragments cast to the wind of some widowed ample garment it had grown cold and james accustomed to a warmer air shivered a little the country suddenly appeared cramped and circumscribed in the fading light a dulness of colour came over tree and hedgerow which was singularly depressing they walked in silence while james looked for words all day he had been trying to find some manner to express himself but his mind perplexed and weary refused to help him the walk to marys house could not take more than five minutes and he saw the distance slipping away rapidly if he meant to say anything it must be said at once and his mouth was dry he felt almost a physical inability to speak he did not know how to prepare the way how to approach the subject and he was doubly tormented by the absolute necessity of breaking the silence  but it was mary who spoke first  dyou know ive been worrying a little about you jamie  why  im afraid i hurt your feelings yesterday dont you remember when we were visiting my patientsi think i spoke rather harshly i didnt mean to im very sorry  i had forgotten all about it he said looking at her i have no notion what you said to offend me  im glad of that she answered smiling but it does me good to apologise will you think me very silly if i say something to you  of course not  well i want to say that if i ever do anything you dont like or dont approve of i wish you would tell me  after that how could he say immediately that he no longer loved her and wished to be released from his engagement  im afraid you think im a very terrifying person answered james  her words had made his announcement impossible another day had gone and weakly he had let it pass  what shall i do he murmured under his breath what a coward i am  they came to the door of the clibborns house and mary turned to say goodbye she bent forward smiling and blushing and he quickly kissed her      in the evening james was sitting by the fire in the diningroom thinking of that one subject which occupied all his thoughts colonel parsons and his wife were at the table engaged upon the game of backgammon which invariably filled the interval between supper and prayers the rattle of dice came to james indistinctly as in a dream and he imagined fantastically that unseen powers were playing for his life he sat with his head between his hands staring at the flames as though to find in them a solution to his difficulty but mockingly they spoke only of mrs wallace and the caress of her limpid eyes he turned away with a gesture of impatience the game was just finished and mrs parsons catching the expression on his face asked  what are you thinking of jamie  i he answered looking up quickly as though afraid that his secret had been divined nothing  mrs parsons put the backgammon board away making up her mind to speak for she too suffered from a shyness which made the subjects she had nearest at heart precisely those that she could least bear to talk about  when do you think of getting married jamie  james started  why you asked me that yesterday he tried to make a joke of it upon my word youre very anxious to get rid of me  i wonder if its occurred to you that youre making mary a little unhappy  james stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece his face upon his hand  i should be sorry to do that mother  youve been home four days and youve not said a word to show you love her  im afraid im not very demonstrative  thats what i said cried the colonel triumphantly  cant you try to say a word or two to prove you care for her jamie she is so fond of you continued his mother i dont want to interfere with your private concerns but i think its only thoughtlessness on your part and im sure you dont wish to make mary miserable poor thing shes so unhappy at home she yearns for a little affection wont you say something to her about your marriage  has she asked you to speak to me inquired james  no dear you know that she would never do anything of the kind she would hate to think that i had said anything  james paused a moment  i will speak to her tomorrow mother  thats right said the colonel cheerfully i know shes going to be in all the morning colonel and mrs clibborn are going into tunbridge wells  it will be a good opportunity     ix   in the morning mrs parsons was in the hall arranging flowers when james passed through to get his hat  are you going to see mary now  yes mother  thats a good boy  she did not notice that her sons usual gravity was intensified or that his very lips were pallid and his eyes careworn and lustreless  it was raining the young fresh leaves in the colourless day had lost their verdure and the massive shapes of the elm trees were obscured in the mist the sky had so melancholy a tone that it seemed a work of mana lifeless hue of infinite sorrow dreary and cheerless  james arrived at the clibborns house  miss mary is in the drawingroom he was told by a servant who smiled on him the accepted lover with obtrusive friendliness  he went in and found her seated at the piano industriously playing scales she wore the weatherbeaten straw hat without which she never seemed comfortable  oh im glad youve come she said im alone in the house and i was taking the opportunity to have a good practice she turned round on the musicstool and ran one hand chromatically up the piano smiling the while with pleasure at jamies visit would you like to go for a walk she asked i dont mind the rain a bit  i would rather stay here if you dont mind  james sat down and began playing with a paperknife still he did not know how to express himself he was torn asunder by rival emotions he felt absolutely bound to speak and yet could not bear the thought of the agony he must cause he was very tenderhearted he had never in his life consciously given pain to any living creature and would far rather have inflicted hurt upon himself  ive been wanting to have a long talk with you alone ever since i came back  have you why didnt you tell me  because what i want to say is very difficult mary and im afraid it must be verydistressing to both of us  what do you mean  mary suddenly became grave james glanced at her and hesitated but there was no room for hesitation now somehow he must get to the end of what he had to say attempting only to be as gentle as possible he stood up and leant against the mantelpiece still toying with the paperknife mary also changed her seat and took a chair by the table  do you know that weve been engaged for over five years now mary  yes  she looked at him steadily and he dropped his eyes  i want to thank you for all youve done for my sake mary i know how good you have been to my people it was very kind of you i cannot think how they would have got along without you  i love them as i love my own father and mother jamie i tried to act towards them as though i was indeed their daughter  he was silent for a while  we were both very young when we became engaged he said at last  he looked up quickly but she did not answer she stared with frightened eyes as if already she understood it was harder even than he thought james asked himself desperately whether he could not stop there taking back what he had said the cup was too bitter but what was the alternative he could not go on pretending one thing when he felt another he could not live a constant horrible lie he felt there was only one course open to him like a man with an ill that must be fatal unless instantly treated he was bound to undergo everything however great the torture  and its a very bad return im making you for all your kindness you have done everything for me mary youve waited for me patiently and lovingly youve sacrificed yourself in every way and im afraid i must make you very unhappyoh dont think im not grateful to you i can never thank you sufficiently  he wished mary would say something to help him but she kept silent she merely dropped her eyes and now her face seemed quite expressionless  i have asked myself day and night what i ought to do and i can see no way clear before me ive tried to say this to you before but ive funked it you think im braveim not im a pitiful coward sometimes i can only loathe and despise myself i want to do my duty but i cant tell what my duty is if i only knew for sure which way i ought to take i should have strength to take it but it is all so uncertain  james gave mary a look of supplication but she did not see it her glance was still riveted to the ground  i think its better to tell you the whole truth mary im afraid im speaking awfully priggishly i feel im acting like a cad and yet i dont know how else to act god help me  ive known almost from the beginning that you no longer cared for me said mary quietly her face showing no expression her voice hushed till it was only a whisper  forgive me mary ive tried to love you oh how humiliating that must sound i hardly know what im saying try to understand me if my words are harsh and ugly its because i dont know how to express myself but i must tell you the whole truth the chief thing is that i should be honest with you its the only return i can make for all youve done for me  mary bent her head a little lower and heavy tears rolled down her cheeks  oh mary dont cry said james his voice breaking and he stepped forward with outstretched arms as though to comfort her  im sorry she said i didnt mean to  she took out her handkerchief and dried her eyes trying to smile her courageous selfcommand was like a stab in jamies heart  i am an absolute cad he said hoarsely  mary made no gesture she sat perfectly still rigid not seeking to hide her emotion but merely to master it one could see the effort she made  im awfully sorry mary please forgive mei dont ask you to release me all i want to do is to explain exactly what i feel and then leave you to decide  are youare you in love with anyone else  no  the smile of mrs wallace flashed scornfully across his mind but he set his teeth he hated and despised her he would not love her  is there anything in me that you dont like which i might be able to correct  her humility was more than he could bear  no no no he cried i can never make you understand you must think me simply brutal you have all that a man could wish for i know how kind you are and how good you are i think you have every quality which a good woman should have i respect you entirely i can never help feeling for you the most intense gratitude and affection  in his own ears the words he spoke rang hollow awkward even impertinent he could say nothing which did not seem hideously supercilious and yet he wanted to abase himself he knew that marys humiliation must be very very bitter  im afraid that i am distressing you frightfully and i dont see how i can make things easier  oh i knew you didnt love me i felt it dyou think i could talk to you for five minutes without seeing the constraint in your manner they told me i was foolish and fanciful but i knew better  i must have caused you very great unhappiness  mary did not answer and james looked at her with pity and remorse at last he broke out passionately  i cant command my love its not a thing i have at my beck and call if it were do you think i should give you this pain love is outside all calculation you think love can be tamed and led about on a chain like a dog you think its a gentle sentiment that one can subject to considerations of propriety and decorum and god knows what oh you dont know love is a madness that seizes one and shakes one like a leaf in the wind i cant counterfeit love i cant pretend to have it i cant command the nerves of my body  do you think i dont know what love is james how little you know me  james sank on a chair and hid his face  we none of us understand one another were all alike and yet so different i dont even know myself dont think im a prig when i say that ive tried with all my might to love you i would have given worlds to feel as i felt five years ago but i cant god help me oh you must hate and despise me mary  i my dear she shook her head sadly i shall never do that i want you to speak frankly it is much better that we should try to understand one another  that is what i felt i did not think it honest to marry you with a lie in my heart i dont know whether we can ever be happy but our only chance is to speak the whole truth  mary looked helplessly at him cowed by her grief  i knew it was coming every day i dreaded it  the pain in her eyes was more than james could bear it was cruel to make her suffer so much he could not do it he felt an intense pity and the idea came to him that there might be a middle way which would lessen the difficulty he hesitated a moment and then looking down spoke in a low voice  i am anxious to do my duty mary i have promised to marry you i do not wish to break my word i dont ask you to release me will you take what i can offer i will be a good husband to you i will do all i can to make you happy i can give you affection and confidencefriendship but i cant give you love it is much better that i should tell you than that you should find out painfully by yourselfperhaps when it is too late  you came to ask me to release you why do you hesitate now do you think i shall refuse  james was silent  you cannot think that i will accept a compromise do you suppose that because i am a woman i am not made of flesh and blood you said you wished to be frank  i had not thought of the other way till just now  do you imagine that it softens the blow how could i live with you as your wife and yet not your wife what are affection and esteem to me without love you must think me a very poor creature james when you want to make me a sort of legal housekeeper  im sorry i didnt think you would look upon it as an impertinence i didnt mean to say anything offensive it struck me as a possible way out of the difficulty you would at all events be happier than you are here  it is you who despise me now  mary  i can bear pain its not the first humiliation i have suffered it is very simple and theres no reason why we should make a fuss about it you thought you loved me and you asked me to marry you i dont know whether you ever really loved me you certainly dont now and you wish me to release you you know that i cannot and will not refuse  i see no way out of it mary he said hoarsely i wish to god i did its frightfully cruel to you  i can bear it i dont blame you its not your fault god will give me strength mary thought of her mothers cruel sympathy her parents would have to be told that james had cast her aside like a plaything he was tired of god will give me strength  im so sorry mary cried james kneeling by her side youll have to suffer dreadfully and i cant think how to make it any better for you  there is no way we must tell them the whole truth and let them say what they will  would you like me to go away from primpton  why  it might make it easier for you  nothing can make it easier i can face it out and i dont want you to run away and hide yourself as if you had done something to be ashamed of and your people want you oh jamie you will be as gentle with them as you can wont you im afraid it willdisappoint them very much  they had set their hearts upon our marriage  im afraid theyll feel it a good deal but it cant be helped anything is better than a loveless marriage  james was profoundly touched that at the time of her own bitter grief mary could think of the pain of others  i wish i had your courage mary ive never seen such strength  its well that i have some qualities i havent the power to make you love me and i deserve something to make up  oh mary dont speak like that i do love you theres no one for whom i have a purer more sincere affection why wont you take me with what i can offer i promise that you will never regret it you know exactly what i am nowweak but anxious to do right why shouldnt we be married perhaps things may change who can tell what time may bring about  its impossible you ask me to do more than i can and i know very well that you only make the offer out of charity even from you i cannot accept charity  my earnest wish is to make you happy  and i know you would sacrifice yourself willingly for that but i can sacrifice myself too you think that if we got married love might arise but it wouldnt you would feel perpetually that i was a reproach to you you would hate me  i should never do that  how can you tell we are the same age now but each year i should seem older at forty i should be an old woman and you would still be a young man only the deepest love can make that difference endurable but the love would be all on my sideif i had any then i should probably have grown bitter and illhumoured ah no jamie you know it is utterly impracticable you know it as well as i do let us part altogether i give you back your word it is not your fault that you do not love me i dont blame you one gets over everything in this world eventually all i ask you is not to trouble too much about me i shant die of it  she stretched out her hand and he took it his eyes all blurred unable to speak  and i thank you she continued for having come to me frankly and openly and told me everything it is still something that you have confidence in me you need never fear that i shall feel bitter towards you i can see that you have sufferedperhaps more than you have made me suffer goodbye  is there nothing i can do mary  nothing she said trying to smile except not to worry  goodbye he said and dont think too ill of me  she could not trust herself to answer she stood perfectly quiet till he had gone out of the room then with a moan sank to the floor and hid her face bursting into tears she had restrained herself too long the composure became intolerable she could have screamed as though suffering some physical pain that destroyed all selfcontrol the heavy sobs rent her chest and she did not attempt to stop them she was heartbroken  oh how could he she groaned how could he  her vision of happiness was utterly gone in james she had placed the joy of her life in him had found strength to bear every displeasure mary had no thought in which he did not take part her whole future was inextricably mingled with his but now the years to come which had seemed so bright and sunny turned suddenly grey as the melancholy sky without she saw her life at little primpton continuing as in the past years monotonous and dulla dreary round of little duties of little vexations of little pleasures  oh god help me she cried  and lifting herself painfully to her knees she prayed for strength to bear the woeful burden for courage to endure it steadfastly for resignation to believe that it was gods will     x   james felt no relief he had looked forward to a sensation of freedom such as a man might feel when he had escaped from some tyrannous servitude and was at liberty again to breathe the buoyant air of heaven he imagined that his depression would vanish like an evil spirit exorcised so soon as ever he got from mary his release but instead it sat more heavily upon him unconvinced even yet that he had acted rightly he went over the conversation word for word it seemed singularly ineffectual wishing to show mary that he did not break with her from caprice or frivolous reason but with sorrowful reluctance and full knowledge of her suffering he had succeeded only in being futile and commonplace  he walked slowly towards primpton house he had before him the announcement to his mother and father and he tried to order his thoughts  mrs parsons her household work finished was knitting the inevitable socks while the colonel sat at the table putting new stamps into his album he chattered delightedly over his treasures getting up now and then gravely to ask his wife some question or to point out a surcharge she good woman showed interest by appropriate rejoinders  theres no one in tunbridge wells who has such a fine collection as i have  general newsmith showed me his the other day but its not nearly so good as yours richmond  im glad of that i suppose his mauritius are fine replied the colonel with some envy for the general had lived several years on the island  theyre fair said mrs parsons reassuringly but not so good as one would expect  it takes a clever man to get together a good collection of stamps although i shouldnt say it  they looked up when james entered  ive just been putting in those free states you brought me jamie they look very well  the colonel leant back to view them with the satisfied look with which he might have examined an old master  it was very thoughtful of jamie to bring them said mrs parsons  ah i knew he wouldnt forget his old father dont you remember frances i said to you ill be bound the boy will bring some stamps with him theyll be valuable in a year or two thats what i always say with regard to postage stamps you cant waste your money now jewellery for instance gets oldfashioned and china breaks but you run no risk with stamps when i buy stamps i really feel that im as good as investing my money in consols  well hows mary this morning  ive been having a long talk with her  settled the day yet asked the colonel with a knowing little laugh  no  upon my word frances i think we shall have to settle it for them things werent like this when we were young why jamie your mother and i got married six weeks after i was introduced to her at a croquet party  we were married in haste richmond said mrs parsons laughing  well weve taken a long time to repent of it my dear its over thirty years  i fancy its too late now  the colonel took her hand and patted it  if you get such a good wife as i have jamie i dont think youll have reason to complain will he my dear  its not for me to say richmond replied mrs parsons smiling contentedly  do you want me to get married very much father  of course i do ive set my heart upon it i want to see what the new generations of parsons are like before i die  listen richmond jamie has something to tell us  mrs parsons had been looking at her son and was struck at last by the agony of his expression  what is it jamie she asked  im afraid youll be dreadfully disappointed im so sorrymary and i are no longer engaged to be married  for a minute there was silence in the room the old colonel looked helplessly from wife to son  what does he mean frances he said at last  mrs parsons did not answer and he turned to james  youre not in earnest jamie youre joking with us  james went over to his father as the weaker of the two and put his arm round his shoulders  im awfully sorry to have to grieve you father its quite trueworse luck it was impossible for me to marry mary  dyou mean that youve broken your engagement with her after shes waited five years for you said mrs parsons  i couldnt do anything else i found i no longer loved her we should both have been unhappy if we had married  the colonel recovered himself slowly he turned round and looked at his son  jamie jamie what have you done  oh you can say nothing that ive not said to myself dyou think its a step i should have taken lightly i feel nothing towards mary but friendship i dont love her  but the colonel stopped and then a light shone in his face and he began to laugh oh its only a lovers quarrel frances theyve had a little tiff and they say theyll never speak to one another again i warrant theyre both heartily sorry already and before night theyll be engaged as fast as ever  james by a look implored his mother to speak she understood and shook her head sadly  no richmond im afraid its not that its serious  but mary loves him frances  i know said james thats the tragedy of it if i could only persuade myself that she didnt care for me it would be all right  colonel parsons sank into his chair suddenly collapsing he seemed smaller than ever wizened and frail the wisp of white hair that concealed his baldness fell forward grotesquely his face assumed again that expression which was almost habitual of anxious fear  oh father dont look like that i cant help it dont make it harder for me than possible you talk to him mother explain that its not my fault there was nothing else i could do  colonel parsons sat silent with his head bent down but mrs parsons asked  what did you say to mary this morning  i told her exactly what i felt  you said you didnt love her  i had to  poor thing  they all remained for a while without speaking each one thinking his painful thoughts  richmond said mrs parsons at last we mustnt blame the boy its not his fault he cant help it if he doesnt love her  you wouldnt have me marry her without love father  the question was answered by mrs parsons  no if you dont love her you mustnt marry her but whats to be done i dont know poor thing poor thing how unhappy she must be  james sat with his face in his hands utterly wretched beginning already to see the great circle of confusion that he had caused mrs parsons looked at him and looked at her husband presently she went up to james  jamie will you leave us for a little your father and i would like to talk it over alone  yes mother  james got up and putting her hands on his shoulders she kissed him  when james had gone mrs parsons looked compassionately at her husband he glanced up and catching her eye tried to smile but it was a poor attempt and it finished with a sigh  whats to be done richmond  colonel parsons shook his head without answering  i ought to have warned you that something might happen i saw there was a difference in jamies feelings but i fancied it would pass over i believed it was only strangeness mary is so fond of him i thought he would soon love her as much as ever  but its not honourable what hes done frances said the old man at last his voice trembling with emotion its not honourable  he cant help it if he doesnt love her  its his duty to marry her shes waited five years shes given him the best of her youthand he jilts her he cant frances he must behave like a gentleman  the tears fell down mrs parsons careworn cheeksthe slow sparse tears of the woman who has endured much sorrow  dont let us judge him richmond were so ignorant of the world you and i are oldfashioned  there are no fashions in honesty  let us send for william perhaps hell be able to advise us  william was major forsyth the brother of mrs parsons he was a bachelor living in london and considered by his relatives a typical man of the world  hell be able to talk to the boy better than we can  very well let us send for him  they were both overcome by the catastrophe but as yet hardly grasped the full extent of it all their hopes had been centred on this marriage all their plans for the future had been in it so intricately woven that they could not realise the total overthrow they felt as a man might feel who was crippled by a sudden accident and yet still pictured his life as though he had free use of his limbs mrs parsons wrote a telegram and gave it to the maid the servant went out of the room but as she did so stepped back and announced  miss clibborn maam  mary  the girl came in and lifted the veil which she had put on to hide her pallor and her eyes red and heavy with weeping  i thought id better come round and see you quietly she said i suppose youve heard  mary mary  mrs parsons took her in her arms kissing her tenderly mary pretended to laugh and hastily dried the tears which came to her eyes  youve been crying mrs parsons you mustnt do that let us sit down and talk sensibly  she took the colonels hand and gently pressed it  is it true mary he asked i cant believe it  yes its quite true weve decided that we dont wish to marry one another i want to ask you not to think badly of jamie hes verycut up about it hes not to blame  were thinking of you my dear  oh i shall be all right i can bear it  its not honourable what hes done mary said the colonel  oh dont say that please that is why i came round to you quickly i want you to think that jamie did what he considered right for my sake dont think ill of him he cant help it if he doesnt love me im not very attractive he must have known in india girls far nicer than i how could i hope to keep him all these years i was a fool to expect it  i am so sorry mary cried mrs parsons weve looked forward to your marriage with all our hearts you know jamies been a good son to us hes never given us any worry we did want him to marry you were so fond of you and we know how really good you are we felt that whatever happened after thatif we diedjamie would be safe and happy  it cant be helped things never turn out in this world as one wants them dont be too distressed about it and above all things dont let jamie see that you think he hasnt actedas he might have done  how can you think of him now when your heart must be almost breaking  you see ive thought of him for years answered mary smiling sadly i cant help it now oh i dont want him to suffer his worrying can do no good i should like him to be completely happy  colonel parsons sighed  hes my son and hes behaved dishonourably  dont say that its not fair to him he did not ask me for his release but i couldnt marry him when i knew he no longer cared for me  he might have learned to love you mary said mrs parsons  no no i could see as he pressed me to marry him notwithstanding he was hoping with all his might that i would refuse he would have hated me no its the end we have separated for ever and i will do my best to get over it  they fell into silence and presently mary got up i must go home now and tell mamma  shell probably have hysterics said mrs parsons with a little sniff of contempt  no shell be delighted returned mary i know her so well  oh how much you will have to suffer dearest  itll do me good i was too happy  dont you think you could wait a little before telling anyone else asked the colonel major forsyth is coming down he may be able to arrange it hes a man of the world  can he make jamie love me ah no its no good waiting let me get it over quickly while i have the courage and it helps me to think i have something to do it only means a few sneers and a little false sympathy  a great deal of real sympathy  people are always rather glad when some unhappiness befalls their friends oh i didnt mean that i dont want to be bitter dont think badly of me either i shall be different tomorrow  we can never think of you without the sincerest fondest love  at that moment james who did not know that mary was there came into the room he started when he saw her and turned red but mary with a womans selfpossession braced herself together  oh jamie ive just been having a little chat with your people  im sorry i interrupted you he answered awkwardly i didnt know you were here  you need not avoid me because weve broken off our engagement at all events you have no reason to be afraid of me now goodbye im just going home  she went out and james looked uncertainly at his parents his father did not speak staring at the ground but mrs parsons said  mary has been asking us not to be angry with you jamie she says its not your fault  its very kind of her  oh how could you how could you     xi   not till luncheon was nearly finished did mary brace herself for the further ordeal and in a steady unmoved voice tell colonel and mrs clibborn what had happened the faded beauty merely smiled and lifted her eyes to the chandelier with the expression that had melted the hearts of a thousand and one impressionable subalterns  i knew it she murmured i knew it you cant deceive a woman and a mother  but the colonel for a moment was speechless his face grew red and his dyed eyebrows stood up in a fury of indignation  impossible he spluttered at last  youd better drink a little water reggie dear said his wife you look as if you were going to have a fit  i wont have it he shouted bringing his fist down on the table so that the cheeseplates clattered and the biscuits danced a rapid jig ill make him marry you he forgets he has me to deal with i disapproved of the match from the beginning didnt i clara i said i would never allow my daughter to marry beneath her  papa  dont talk to me mary do you mean to deny that james parsons is infantry or that his father was infantry before him but he shall marry you now by george he shall marry you if i have to lead him to the altar by the scruff of his neck  neglecting his cheese the colonel sprang to his feet and walked to and fro vehemently giving his opinion of james his father and all his ancestors of the regiments to which they had belonged and all else that was theirs he traced their origin from a pork butchers shop and prophesied their end ignominiously in hell every now and then he assured mary that she need have no fear the rascal should marry her or die a violent death  but theres nothing more to be said now papa weve agreed quite amicably to separate all i want you to do is to treat him as if nothing had happened  ill horsewhip him said colonel clibborn hes insulted you and ill make him beg your pardon on his bended knees clara wheres my horsewhip  papa do be reasonable  i am reasonable mary roared the gallant soldier becoming a rich purple i know my duty thank god and im going to do it when a man insults my daughter its my duty as a gentleman and an officer to give him a jolly good thrashing when that twopenny sawbones of a doctor was rude to you i licked him within an inch of his life i kicked him till he begged for mercy and if more men had the courage to take the law into their own hands thered be fewer damned blackguards in the world  as a matter of fact the colonel had neither thrashed nor kicked the doctor but it pleased him to think he had moralists teach us that the intention is praiseworthy rather than the brutal act consequently there could be no objection if the fearless cavalryman took credit for things which he had thought of doing but from circumstances beyond his control had not actually done  mary felt no great alarm at her fathers horrid threats for she knew him well but still was doubtful about her mother  you will treat james as you did before wont you mamma  mrs clibborn smiled a portly seraph  my dear i trust i am a gentlewoman  he shall never darken my doors again cried the colonel i tell you clara keep him out of my way if i meet him i wont be responsible for my actions i shall knock him down  reggie dear youll have such dreadful indigestion if you dont calm down you know it always upsets you to get excited immediately after meals  its disgraceful i suppose he forgets all those halfcrowns i gave him when he was a boy and the cigars and the port wine hes had since i opened a special bottle for him only the night before last ill never sit down to dinner with him againdont ask me to clara its the confounded impertinence of it which gets over me but he shall marry you my dear or ill know the reason why  you cant have him up for breach of promise reggie cooed mrs clibborn  a gentleman takes the law in his own hands in these matters ah its a pity the good old days have gone when they settled such things with cold steel  and the colonel to emphasise his words flung himself into the appropriate attitude throwing his left hand up behind his head and lunging fiercely with the right  go and look for my pincenez my dear said mrs clibborn turning to mary i think theyre in my workbasket or in your fathers study  mary was glad to leave the room about which the colonel stamped in an everincreasing rage pausing now and then to take a mouthful of bread and cheese the request for the glasses was mrs clibborns usual way of getting rid of mary a typical subterfuge of a woman who never except by chance put anything straightforwardly when the door was closed the buxom lady clasped her hands and cried  reginald reginald i have a confession to make  whats the matter with you said the colonel stopping short  i am to blame for this reginald mrs clibborn threw her head on one side and looked at the ceiling as the only substitute for heaven james parsons has jilted maryon my account  what the devil have you been doing now  oh forgive me reginald she cried sliding off the chair and falling heavily on her knees its not my fault he loves me  fiddlesticks said her husband angrily walking on again  it isnt reginald how unjust you are to me  the facile tears began to flow down mrs clibborns wellpowdered cheeks  i know he loves me you cant deceive a woman and a mother  youre double his age  these boys always fall in love with women older than themselves ive noticed it so often and hes almost told me in so many words though im sure ive given him no encouragement  fiddlesticks clara  you wouldnt believe me when i told you that poor algy turner loved me and he killed himself  nothing of the kind he died of cholera  reginald retorted mrs clibborn with asperity his death was most mysterious none of the doctors understood it if he didnt poison himself he died of a broken heart and i think youre very unkind to me  with some difficulty being a heavy woman she lifted herself from the floor and by the time she was safely on her feet mrs clibborn was blowing and puffing like a grampus  the colonel whose mind had wandered to other things suddenly bethought himself that he had a duty to perform  wheres my horsewhip clara i command you to give it me  reginald if you have the smallest remnant of affection for me you will not hurt this unfortunate young man remember that algy turner killed himself you cant blame him for not wanting to marry poor mary my dear she has absolutely no figure and men are so susceptible to those things  the colonel stalked out of the room and mrs clibborn sat down to meditate  i thought my day for such things was past she murmured i knew it all along the way he looked at me was enoughwe women have such quick perceptions poor boy how he must suffer  she promised herself that no harsh word of hers should drive james into the early grave where lay the lovelorn algy turner and she sighed thinking what a curse it was to possess that fatal gift of beauty      when little primpton heard the news little primpton was agitated certainly it was distressed and even virtuously indignant but at the same time completely unable to divest itself of that little flutter of excitement which was so rare yet so enchanting a variation from the monotony of its daily course the wellinformed walked with a lighter step and held their heads more jauntily for life had suddenly acquired a novel interest with something new to talk about something fresh to think over with a legitimate object of sympathy and resentment the torpid blood raced through their veins as might that of statesmen during some crisis in national affairs let us thank god who has made our neighbours frail and in his infinite mercy caused husband and wife to quarrel tom dick and harry to fall more or less discreditably in love this dear friend of ours to lose his money and that her reputation in all humility let us be grateful for the scandal which falls at our feet like ripe fruit for the divorce court and for the newspapers that with a witty semblance of horror report for us the spicy details if at certain intervals propriety obliges us to confess that we are miserable sinners has not the lord sought to comfort us in the recollection that we are not half so bad as most people  mr dryland went to the vicarage to enter certificates in the parish books the vicar was in his study and gave his curate the keys of the iron safe  sophie bunch came last night to put up her banns he said  shes going to marry out of the parish isnt she  yes a tunbridge wells man  the curate carefully blotted the entries he had made and returned the heavy books to their place  will you come into the diningroom dryland said the vicar with a certain solemnity mrs jackson would like to speak to you  certainly  mrs jackson was reading the church times her thin sharp face wore an expression of strong disapproval her tightlyclosed mouth her sharp nose even the angular lines of her body signified clearly that her moral sense was outraged she put her hand quickly to her massive fringe to see that it was straight and rose to shake hands with mr dryland his heavy red face assumed at once a grave look his moral sense was outraged too  isnt this dreadful news mr dryland  oh very sad very sad  in both their voices hidden below an intense sobriety there was discernible a slight ring of exultation  the moment i saw him i felt he would give trouble said mrs jackson shaking her head i told you archibald that i didnt like the look of him  im bound to say you did admitted her lord and master  mary clibborn is much too good for him added mrs jackson decisively shes a saint  the fact is that hes suffering from a swollen head remarked the curate who used slang as a proof of manliness  there archibald cried the lady triumphantly what did i tell you  mrs jackson thought he was conceited  i dont think it im sure of it hes odiously conceited all the time i was talking to him i felt he considered himself superior to me no niceminded man would have refused our offer to say a short prayer on his behalf during morning service  those army men always have a very good opinion of themselves said mr dryland taking advantage of his seat opposite a lookingglass to arrange his hair  he spoke in such a round full voice that his shortest words carried a sort of polysyllabic weight  i cant see what he has done to be so proud of said mrs jackson anyone would have done the same in his position im sure its no more heroic than what clergymen do every day of their lives without making the least fuss about it  they say that true courage is always modest answered mr dryland  the remark was not very apposite but sounded damaging  i didnt like the way he had when he came to tea hereas if he were dreadfully bored im sure hes not so clever as all that  no clever man would act in an ungentlemanly way said the curate and then smiled for he thought he had unconsciously made an epigram  i couldnt express in words what i feel with regard to his treatment of mary cried mrs jackson and then proceeded to do soand in many to boot  they had all been a little oppressed by the greatness which much against his will they had thrust upon the unfortunate james they had set him on a pedestal and then were disconcerted because he towered above their heads and the halo with which they had surrounded him dazzled their eyes they had wished to make a lion of james and his modest resistance wounded their selfesteem it was a relief to learn that he was not worth making a lion of halo and pedestal were quickly demolished for the golden idol had feet of clay and his late adorers were ready to reproach him because he had not accepted with proper humility the gifts he did not want their little vanities were comforted by the assurance that far from being a hero james was in fact distinctly inferior to themselves for there is no superiority like moral superiority a man who stands akimbo on the top of the ten commandments need bow the knee to no earthly potentate  little primpton was conscious of its virtue and did not hesitate to condemn  he has lowered himself dreadfully  yes its very sad it only shows how necessary it is to preserve a meek and contrite spirit in prosperity pride always goes before a fall  the jacksons and mr dryland discussed the various accounts which had reached them mary and mrs parsons were determinedly silent but mrs clibborn was loquacious and it needed little artifice to extract the whole story from colonel parsons  one thing is unfortunately certain said mrs jackson with a sort of pious vindictiveness captain parsons has behaved abominably and its our duty to do something  colonel clibborn threatens to horsewhip him  it would do him good cried mrs jackson and i should like to be there to see it  they paused a moment to gloat over the imaginary scene of jamies chastisement  hes a wicked man fancy throwing the poor girl over when shes waited five years i think he ought to be made to marry her  im bound to say that no gentleman would have acted like that said the vicar  i wanted archibald to go and speak seriously to captain parsons he ought to know what we think of him and its obviously our duty to tell him  his parents are very much distressed one can see that although they say so little  its not enough to be distressed they ought to have the strength of mind to insist upon his marrying mary clibborn but they stick up for everything he does they think hes perfect im sure its not respectful to god to worship a human being as they do their son  they certainly have a very exaggerated opinion of him assented mr dryland  and i should like to know why hes not goodlooking  very ordinary agreed mr dryland with a rapid glance at the convenient mirror i dont think his appearance is manly  whatever the curates defects of personand he flattered himself that he was modest enough to know his bad pointsno one he fancied could deny him manliness it is possible that he was not deceived put him in a bowlerhat and a bellbottomed coat and few could have distinguished him from a cabdriver  i dont see anything particular in his eyes or hair pursued mrs jackson  his features are fairly regular but that always strikes me as insipid in a man  and hes not a good conversationalist  im bound to confess ive never heard him say anything clever remarked the vicar  no smiled the curate one could hardly call him a brilliant epigrammatist  i dont think hes well informed  oh well you know one doesnt expect knowledge from army men said the curate with a contemptuous smile and a shrug of the shoulders i must say i was rather amused when he confessed he hadnt read marie corelli  i can hardly believe that i think it was only pose  im sorry to say that my experience of young officers is that there are absolutely no bounds to their ignorance  they had satisfactorily stripped james of every quality mental and physical which could have made him attractive in marys eyes and the curates next remark was quite natural  im afraid it sounds a conceited thing to say but i cant help asking myself what miss clibborn saw in him  love is blind replied mrs jackson she could have done much better for herself  they paused to consider the vagaries of the tender passion and the matches which mary might have made had she been so inclined  archibald said mrs jackson at last with the decision characteristic of her ive made up my mind as vicar of the parish you must go to captain parsons  i my dear  yes archibald you must insist upon him fulfilling his engagement with mary say that you are shocked and grieved and ask him if his own conscience does not tell him that he has done wrong  im not sure that hed listen to reason nervously remarked the vicar  its your duty to try archibald were so afraid of being called busybodies that even when we ought to step in we hesitate no motives of delicacy should stop one when a wicked action is to be prevented its often the clergys duty to interfere with other peoples affairs for my part i will never shrink from doing my duty people may call me a busybody if they like hard words break no bones  captain parsons is very reserved he might think it an impertinence if i went to him  how could he isnt it our business if he breaks his word with a parishioner of ours if you dont talk to him i shall so there archibald  why dont you mrs jackson  nothing would please me better i should thoroughly enjoy giving him a piece of my mind it would do him good to be told frankly that hes not quite so great as he thinks himself i will never shrink from doing my duty  my dear remonstrated the vicar if you really think i ought to speak  perhaps mrs jackson would do better a women can say many things that a man cant  this was a grateful suggestion to the vicar who could not rid himself of the discomforting thought that james incensed and hottempered might use the strength of his armsor legsin lieu of argument mr jackson would have affronted horrid tortures for his faith but shrank timidly before the least suspicion of ridicule his wife was braver or less imaginative  very well ill go she said its true he might be rude to archibald and he couldnt be rude to a lady and whats more i shall go at once  mrs jackson kept her hat on a peg in the hall and was quickly ready she put on her black kid gloves determination sat upon her mouth and christian virtue rested between her brows setting out with a brisk step the conviction was obvious in every movement that duty called and to that clarion note maria jackson would never turn a deaf ear she went like a hebrew prophet conscious that the voice of the lord was in her     xii   james was wandering in the garden of primpton house while mrs jackson thither went her way since the termination of his engagement with mary three days back the subject had not been broached between him and his parents but he divined their thoughts he knew that they awaited the arrival of his uncle major forsyth to set the matter right they did not seek to reconcile themselves with the idea that the break was final it seemed too monstrous a thing to be true james smiled with bitter amusement at their simple trust in the man of the world who was due that day  major forsyth was fiftythree a haunter of military clubs a busy sluggard who set his pride in appearing dissipated and yet led the blameless life of a clergymans daughter preserving a spotless virtue nothing pleased him more than to be thought a rake he had been on halfpay for many years and blamed the war office on that account rather than his own incompetence ever since retiring he had told people that advancement in these degenerate days was impossible without influence he was indeed one of those men to whom powerful friends offer the only chance of success and possessing none inveighed constantly against the corrupt officialism of those in authority but to his jeremiads upon the decay of the public services he added a keen interest in the world of fashion it is always well that a man should have varied activities it widens his horizon and gives him a greater usefulness if his attention had been limited to redtape major forsyth even in his own circle might have been thought a little onesided but his knowledge of etiquette and tailors effectually prevented the reproach he was pleased to consider himself in society he read assiduously those papers which give detailed accounts of the goingson in the hupper succles and could give you with considerable accuracy the whereabouts of titled people if he had a weakness it was by his manner of speaking to insinuate that he knew certain noble persons whom as a matter of fact he had never set eyes on he would not have told a direct lie on the subject but his conscience permitted him a slight equivocation major forsyth was well up in all the gossip of the clubs and if he could not call himself a man of the world he had not the least notion who could but for all that he had the strictest principles he was true brother to mrs parsons and though he concealed the fact like something disreputable regularly went to church on sunday mornings there was also a certain straitness in his income which confined him to the paths shared by the needy and the pure at heart  major forsyth had found no difficulty in imposing upon his sister and her husband  of course william is rather rackety they said its a pity he hasnt a wife to steady him but he has a good heart  for them major forsyth had the double advantage of a wiliness gained in the turmoil of the world and an upright character they scarcely knew how in the present juncture he could help but had no doubt that from the boundless store of his worldly wisdom he would invent a solution to their difficulty  james had found his uncle out when he was quite a boy and seeing his absurdity had treated him ever since with goodnatured ridicule  i wonder what they think he can say he asked himself  james was profoundly grieved at the unhappiness which bowed his father down his parents had looked forward with such ecstatic pleasure to his arrival and what sorrow had he not brought them  i wish id never come back he muttered  he thought of the flowing undulating plains of the orange country and the blue sky with its sense of infinite freedom in that trim kentish landscape he felt hemmed in when the clouds were low it seemed scarcely possible to breathe and he suffered from the constraint of his father and mother who treated him formally as though he had become a stranger there was always between them and him that painful topic which for the time was carefully shunned they did not mention marys name and the care they took to avoid it was more painful than would have been an open reference they sat silent and sad trying to appear natural and dismally failing their embarrassed manner was such as they might have adopted had he committed some crime the mention of which for his sake must never be made but whose recollection perpetually haunted them in every action was the belief that james must be suffering from remorse and that it was their duty not to make his burden heavier james knew that his father was convinced that he had acted dishonourably and hewhat did he himself think  james asked himself a hundred times a day whether he had acted well or ill and though he forced himself to answer that he had done the only possible thing deep down in his heart was a terrible a perfectly maddening uncertainty he tried to crush it and would not listen for his intelligence told him clearly it was absurd but it was stronger than intelligence an incorporeal shape through which passed harmlessly the swordcuts of his reason it was a little devil curled up in his heart muttering to all his arguments are you sure  sometimes he was nearly distracted and then the demon laughed so that the mocking shrillness rang in his ears  are you sure my friendare you sure and where pray is the honour which only a while ago you thought so much of      james walked to and fro restlessly impatient angry with himself and with all the world  but then on the breath of the wind on the perfume of the roses yellow and red came suddenly the irresistible recollection of mrs wallace why should he not think of her now he was free he could do her no harm he would never see her again the thought of her was the only sunshine in his life he was tired of denying himself every pleasure why should he continue the pretence that he no longer loved her it was indeed a consolation to think that the long absence had not dulled his passion the strength of it was its justification it was useless to fight against it for it was part of his very soul he might as well have fought against the beating of his heart and if it was torture to remember those old days in india he delighted in it it was a pain more exquisite than the suffocating odours of tropical flowers a voluptuous agony such as might feel the fakir lacerating his flesh in a divine possession every little occurrence was clear as if it had taken place but a day before  james repeated to himself the conversations they had had of no consequence the idle gossip of a stray halfhour but each word was opulent in the charming smile in the caressing glance of her eyes he was able to imagine mrs wallace quite close to him wearing the things that he had seen her wear and with her movements he noticed the excessive scent she used he wondered whether she had overcome that failing whether she still affected the artificiality which was so adorable a relief from the primness of manner which he had thought the natural way of women  if her cheeks were not altogether innocent of rouge or her eyebrows of pencil what did he care he delighted in her very faults he would not have her different in the very slightest detail everything was part of that complex elusive fascination and james thought of the skin which had the even softness of fine velvet and the little hands he called himself a fool for his shyness what could have been the harm if he had taken those hands and kissed them now in imagination he pressed his lips passionately on the warm palms he liked the barbaric touch in the many rings which bedecked her fingers  why do you wear so many rings he asked your hands are too fine  he would never have ventured the question but now there was no danger her answer came with a little goodhumoured laugh she stretched out her fingers looking complacently at the brilliant gems  i like to be gaudy i should like to be encrusted with jewels i want to wear bracelets to my elbow and diamond spangles on my arms and jewelled belts and jewels in my hair and on my neck i should like to flash from head to foot with exotic stones  then she looked at him with amusement  of course you think its vulgar what do i care you all of you think its vulgar to be different from other people i want to be unique  you want everybody to look at you  of course i do is it sinful oh i get so impatient with all of you with your good taste and your delicacy and your insupportable dulness when you admire a woman you think it impertinent to tell her shes beautiful when you have good looks you carry yourselves as though you were ashamed  and in a bold moment he replied  yet you would give your soul to have no drop of foreign blood in your veins  i she cried her eyes flashing with scorn im proud of my eastern blood its not blood i have in my veins its firea fire of gold its because of it that i have no prejudices and know how to enjoy my life  james smiled and did not answer  you dont believe me she asked  no  well perhaps i should like to be quite english i should feel more comfortable in my scorn of these regimental ladies if i thought they could find no reason to look down on me  i dont think they look down on you  oh dont they they despise and loathe me  when you were ill they did all they could for you  foolish creature dont you know that to do good to your enemy is the very best way of showing your contempt  and so james could go on questioning replying putting little jests into her mouth or halfcynical repartees sometimes he spoke aloud and then mrs wallaces voice sounded in his ears clear and rich and passionate as though she were really standing in the flesh beside him but always he finished by taking her in his arms and kissing her lips and her closed eyes the lids transparent like the finest alabaster he knew no pleasure greater than to place his hands on that lustrous hair what could it matter now he was not bound to mary he could do no harm to mrs wallace ten thousand miles away      but colonel parsons broke into the charming dream bent and weary he came across the lawn to find his son the wan pathetic figure brought back to james all the present bitterness he sighed and advanced to meet him  youre very reckless to come out without a hat father ill fetch you one shall i  no im not going to stay the colonel could summon up no answering smile to his boys kind words i only came to tell you that mrs jackson is in the drawingroom and would like to see you  what does she want  shell explain herself she has asked to see you alone  jamies face darkened as some notion of mrs jacksons object dawned upon him  i dont know what she can have to talk to me about alone  please listen to her jamie shes a very clever woman and you cant fail to benefit by her advice  the colonel never had an unfriendly word to say of anyone and even for mrs jacksons unwarrantable interferences could always find a goodnatured justification he was one of those deprecatory men who in every difference of opinion are convinced that they are certainly in the wrong he would have borne with the most cheerful submission any rebuke of his own conduct and been indeed vastly grateful to the vicars wife for pointing out his error  james found mrs jackson sitting bolt upright on a straightbacked chair convinced such was her admirable sense of propriety that a lounging attitude was incompatible with the performance of a duty she held her hands on her lap gently clasped and her tight lips expressed as plainly as possible her conviction that though the way of righteousness was hard she thank god had strength to walk it  how dyou do mrs jackson  good morning she replied with a stiff bow  james though there was no fire went over to the mantelpiece and leant against it waiting for the lady to speak  captain parsons i have a very painful duty to perform  those were her words but it must have been a dense person who failed to perceive that mrs jackson found her duty anything but painful there was just that hard resonance in her voice that an inquisitor might have in condemning to the stake a jew to whom he owed much money  i suppose you will call me a busybody  oh im sure you would never interfere with what does not concern you replied james slowly  certainly not said mrs jackson i come here because my conscience tells me to what i wish to talk to you about concerns us all  shall i call my people im sure theyd be interested  i asked to see you alone captain parsons answered mrs jackson frigidly and it was for your sake when one has to tell a person hometruths he generally prefers that there should be no audience  so youre going to tell me some hometruths mrs jackson said james with a laugh you must think me very goodnatured how long have i had the pleasure of your acquaintance  mrs jacksons grimness did not relax  one learns a good deal about people in a week  dyou think so i have an idea that ten years is a short time to get to know them you must be very quick  actions often speak  actions are the most lying things in the world they are due mostly to adventitious circumstances which have nothing to do with the character of the agent i would never judge a man by his actions  i didnt come here to discuss abstract things with you captain parsons  why not the abstract is so much more entertaining than the concrete it affords opportunities for generalisation which is the salt of conversation  im a very busy woman retorted mrs jackson sharply thinking that james was not treating her with proper seriousness he was not so easy to tackle as she had imagined  its very good of you then to spare time to come and have a little chat with me said james  i did not come for that purpose captain parsons  oh i forgothometruths wasnt it i was thinking of shakespeare and the musical glasses  would you kindly remember that i am a clergymans wife captain parsons i daresay you are not used to the society of such  pardon me i even know an archdeacon quite well he has a great gift of humour a man wants it when he wears a silk apron  captain parsons said mrs jackson sternly there are some things over which it is unbecoming to jest i wish to be as gentle as possible with you but i may remind you that flippancy is not the best course for you to pursue  james looked at her with a goodtempered stare  upon my word he said to himself i never knew i was so patient  i cant beat about the bush any longer continued the vicars lady i have a very painful duty to perform  that quite excuses your hesitation  you must guess why i have asked to see you alone  i havent the least idea  does your conscience say nothing to you  my conscience is very wellbred it never says unpleasant things  then im sincerely sorry for you  james smiled  oh my good woman he thought if you only knew what a troublesome spirit i carry about with me  but mrs jackson saw only hardness of heart in the grave face she never dreamed that behind those quiet eyes was a turmoil of discordant passions tearing rending burning  im sorry for you she repeated i think its very sad very sad indeed that you should stand there and boast of the sluggishness of your conscience conscience is the voice of god captain parsons if it does not speak to you it behoves others to speak in its place  and supposing i knew what you wanted to say do you think i should like to hear  im afraid not  then dont you think discretion points to silence  no captain parsons there are some things which one is morally bound to say however distasteful they may be  the easiest way to get through life is to say pleasant things on all possible occasions  that is not my way and that is not the right way  i think it rash to conclude that a course is right merely because it is difficult likewise an uncivil speech is not necessarily a true one  i repeat that i did not come here to bandy words with you  my dear mrs jackson i have been wondering why you did not come to the point at once  you have been wilfully interrupting me  im so sorry i thought i had been making a series of rather entertaining observations  captain parsons what does your conscience say to you about mary clibborn  james looked at mrs jackson very coolly and she never imagined with what difficulty he was repressing himself  i thought you said your subject was of national concern upon my word i thought you proposed to hold a thanksgiving service in little primpton church for the success of the british arms  well you know different now retorted mrs jackson with distinct asperity i look upon your treatment of mary clibborn as a matter which concerns us all  then as politely as possible i must beg to differ from you i really cannot permit you to discuss my private concerns you have doubtless much evil to say of me say it behind my back  i presumed that you were a gentleman captain parsons  you certainly presumed  and i should be obliged if you would treat me like a lady  james smiled he saw that it was folly to grow angry  well do our best to be civil to one another mrs jackson but i dont think you must talk of what really is not your business  dyou think you can act shamefully and then slink away as soon as you are brought to book do you know what youve done to mary clibborn  whatever ive done you may be sure that i have not acted rashly really nothing you can say will make the slightest difference dont you think we had better bring our conversation to an end  james made a movement towards the door  your father and mother wish me to speak with you colonel parsons said mrs jackson and they wish you to listen to what i have to say  james paused very well  he sat down and waited mrs jackson felt unaccountably nervous it had never occurred to her that a mere soldier could be so hard to deal with and it was she who hesitated now jamies stern eyes made her feel singularly like a culprit but she cleared her throat and straightened herself  its very sad she said to find how much weve been mistaken in you captain parsons when we were making all sorts of preparations to welcome you we never thought that you would repay us like this it grieves me to have to tell you that you have done a very wicked thing i was hoping that your conscience would have something to say to you but unhappily i was mistaken you induced mary to become engaged to you you kept her waiting for years you wrote constantly pretending to love her deceiving her odiously you let her waste the best part of her life and then without excuse and without reason you calmly say that youre sick of her and wont marry her i think it is horrible and brutal and most ungentlemanly even a common man wouldnt have behaved in that way of course it doesnt matter to you but it means the ruin of marys whole life how can she get a husband now when shes wasted her best years youve spoilt all her chances youve thrown a slur upon her which people will never forget youre a cruel wicked man and however you won the victoria cross i dont know im sure you dont deserve it  mrs jackson stopped  is that all asked james quietly  its quite enough  quite in that case i think we may finish our little interview  have you nothing to say asked mrs jackson indignantly realising that she had not triumphed after all  i nothing  mrs jackson was perplexed and still those disconcerting eyes were fixed upon her she angrily resented their polite contempt  well i think its disgraceful she cried you must be utterly shameless  my dear lady you asked me to listen to you and i have if you thought i was going to argue im afraid you were mistaken but since you have been very frank with me you can hardly mind if i am equally frank with you i absolutely object to the way in which not only you but all the persons who took part in that ridiculous function the other day talk of my private concerns i am a perfect stranger to you and you have no business to speak to me of my engagement with miss clibborn or the rupture of it finally i would remark that i consider your particular interference a very gross piece of impertinence i am sorry to have to speak so directly but apparently nothing but the very plainest language can have any effect upon you  then mrs jackson lost her temper  captain parsons i am considerably older than you and you have no right to speak to me like that you forget that i am a lady and if i didnt know your father and mother i should say that you were no gentleman and you forget also that i come here on the part of god you are certainly no christian youve been very rude to me indeed  i didnt mean to be replied james smiling  if id known you would be so rude to a lady i should have sent archibald to speak with you  perhaps its fortunate you didnt i might have kicked him  captain parsons hes a minister of the gospel  surely it is possible to be that without being a malicious busybody  youre heartless and vain youre odiously conceited  i should have thought it a proof of modesty that for half an hour i have listened to you with some respect and with great attention  i must say in my heart im glad that providence has stepped in and prevented mary from marrying you you are a bad man and i leave you now to the mercies of your own conscience i am a christian woman thank heaven and i forgive you but i sincerely hope that god will see fit to punish you for your wickedness  mrs jackson bounced to the door which james very politely opened  oh dont trouble she said with a sarcastic shake of the head i can find my way out alone and i shant steal the umbrellas     xiii   major forsyth arrived in time for tea redfaced dapper and immaculate he wore a check suit very new and very pronounced with a beautiful line down each trouserleg and his collar and his tie were of the latest mode his scanty hair was carefully parted in the middle and his moustache bristled with a martial ardour he had lately bought a fine set of artificial teeth which with pardonable pride he constantly exhibited to the admiration of all and sundry major forsyths consuming desire was to appear juvenile he affected slang and carried himself with a youthful jauntiness he vowed he felt a mere boy and flattered himself that on his good days with the light behind him he might pass for fiveandthirty  a woman he repeateda woman is as old as she looks but a man is as old as he feels  the dandiness which in a crammers pupmost overdressed of all the human racewould merely have aroused a smile looked oddly with the majors wrinkled skin and his old eyes there was something almost uncanny in the exaggerated boyishness he reminded one of some figure in a dance of death of a living skeleton holloweyed strutting gaily by the side of a gallant youth  it was not difficult to impose upon the parsons and major forsyth had gained over them a complete ascendancy they took his opinion on every possible matter accepting whatever he said with gratified respect he was a man of the world and well acquainted with the goingson of society they had an idea that he disappointed duchesses to come down to little primpton and always felt that it was a condescension on his part to put up with their simple manners they altered their hours luncheon was served at the middle of the day and dinner in the evening  mrs parsons put on a sabbath garment of black silk to receive her brother and round her neck a lace fichu when he arrived with colonel parsons from the station she went into the hall to meet him  well william have you had a pleasant journey  oh yes yes i came down with the prettiest woman ive seen for many a long day i made eyes at her all the way but she wouldnt look at me  william william expostulated mr parsons smiling  you see he hasnt improved since we saw him last frances laughed the colonel leading the way into the drawingroom  no harm in looking at a pretty woman you know im a bachelor still thank the lord that reminds me of a funny story i heard at the club  oh were rather frightened of your stories william said mrs parsons  yes youre very risky sometimes assented the colonel goodhumouredly shaking his head  major forsyth was anecdotal as is only decent in an old bachelor and he made a speciality of stories which he thought wicked but which as a matter of fact would not have brought a blush to any cheek less innocent than that of colonel parsons  theres no harm in a little spice said uncle william and youre a married woman frances  he told an absolutely pointless story of how a man had helped a young woman across the street and seen her ankle in the process he told it with immense gusto laughing and repeating the point at least six times  william william laughed colonel parsons heartily you should keep those things for the smokingroom  what dyou think of it frances asked the gallant major still hugely enjoying the joke  mrs parsons blushed a little and for decencys sake prevented herself from smiling she felt rather wicked  i dont want to hear any more of your tales william  ha ha laughed uncle william i knew youd like it and that one i told you in the fly richmondyou know about the petticoat  shsh said the colonel smiling you cant tell that to a lady  praps id better not but its a good story though  they both laughed  i think its dreadful the things you men talk about as soon as youre alone said mrs parsons  the two godfearing old soldiers laughed again admitting their wickedness  one must talk about something said uncle william and upon my word i dont know anything better to talk about than the fair sex  soon james appeared and shook hands with his uncle  youre looking younger than ever uncle william you make me feel quite old  oh i never age bless you why i was talking to my old friend lady green the other dayshe was a miss lake you knowand she said to me upon my word major forsyth youre wonderful i believe youve found the secret of perpetual youth the fact is i said i never let myself grow old if you once give way to it youre done how do you manage it she said madam i answered its the simplest thing in the world i keep regular hours and i wear flannel next to my skin  come come uncle william said james with a smile you didnt mention your underlinen to a lady  upon my word im telling you exactly what i said  youre very free in your conversation  well you know i find the women expect it from me of course i never go beyond the line  then major forsyth talked of the fashions and of his clothes of the scandal of the day and the ancestry of the persons concerned of the war  you can say what you like he remarked but my opinion is that roberts is vastly overrated i met at the club the other day a man whose first cousin has served under roberts in indiahis first cousin mind you so its good authorityand this chap told me in strict confidence of course that his first cousin had no opinion of roberts thats what a man says who has actually served under him  it is certainly conclusive said james i wonder your friends first cousin didnt go to the war office and protest against bobs being sent out  whats the good of going to the war office theyre all corrupt and incompetent there if i had my way id make a clean sweep of them talking of redtape ill just give you an instance now this is a fact it was told me by the brotherinlaw of the uncle of the man it happened to  major forsyth told his story at great length finishing up with the assertion that if the army wasnt going to the dogs he didnt know what going to the dogs meant  james meanwhile catching the glances which passed between his mother and colonel parsons understood that they were thinking of the great subject upon which uncle william was to be consulted half scornfully he gave them their opportunity  im going for a stroll he said through groombridge i shant be back till dinnertime  how lucky remarked colonel parsons naively when james had gone we wanted to talk with you privately william youre a man of the world  i think theres not much that i dont know replied the major shooting his linen  tell him frances  mrs parsons accustomed to the part of spokeswoman gave her tale interrupted now and again by a long whistle with which the major signified his shrewdness or by an energetic nod which meant that the difficulty was nothing to him  youre quite right he said at last one has to look upon these things from the point of view of the man of the world  we knew youd be able to help us said colonel parsons  of course i shall settle the whole thing in five minutes you leave it to me  i told you he would frances cried the colonel with a happy smile you think that james ought to marry the girl dont you  certainly whatever his feelings are he must act as a gentleman and an officer just you let me talk it over with him he has great respect for all i say ive noticed that already  mrs parsons looked at her brother doubtfully  we havent known what to do she murmured weve prayed for guidance havent we richmond were anxious not to be hard on the boy but we must be just  leave it to me repeated uncle william im a man of the world and im thoroughly at home in matters of this sort      according to the little plan which in his subtlety major forsyth had suggested mrs parsons soon after dinner fetched the backgammon board  shall we have our usual game richmond  colonel parsons looked significantly at his brotherinlaw  if william doesnt mind  no no of course not ill have a little chat with jamie  the players sat down at the corner of the table and rather nervously began to set out the men james stood by the window silent as ever looking at the day that was adying with a milkblue sky and tenuous clouds copper and gold major forsyth took a chair opposite him and pulled his moustache  well jamie my boy what is all this nonsense i hear about you and mary clibborn  colonel parsons started at the expected question and stole a hurried look at his son his wife noisily shook the dicebox and threw the dice on the board  nine she said  james turned to look at his uncle noting a little contemptuously the change of his costume and its extravagant juvenility  a lot of stuff and nonsense isnt it  dyou think so asked james wearily weve been taking it very seriously  youre a set of old fogies down here you want a man of the world to set things right  ah well youre a man of the world uncle william replied james smiling  the dicebox rattled obtrusively as colonel parsons and his wife played on with elaborate unconcern of the conversation  a gentleman doesnt jilt a girl when hes been engaged to her for five years  james squared himself to answer major forsyth the interview with mrs jackson in the morning had left him extremely irritated he was resolved to say now all he had to say and have done with it hoping that a complete explanation would relieve the tension between his people and himself  it is with the greatest sorrow that i broke off my engagement with mary clibborn it seemed to me the only honest thing to do since i no longer loved her i can imagine nothing in the world so horrible as a loveless marriage  of course its unfortunate but the first thing is to keep ones word  no answered james that is prejudice there are many more important things  colonel parsons stopped the pretence of his game  do you know that mary is breaking her heart he asked in a low voice  im afraid shes suffering very much i dont see how i can help it  leave this to me richmond interrupted the major impatiently youll make a mess of it  but colonel parsons took no notice  she looked forward with all her heart to marrying you shes very unhappy at home and her only consolation was the hope that you would soon take her away  am i managing this or are you richmond im a man of the world  if i married a woman i did not care for because she was rich you would say i had dishonoured myself the discredit would not be in her wealth but in my lack of love  thats not the same thing replied major forsyth you gave your word and now you take it back  i promised to do a thing over which i had no control when i was a boy before i had seen anything of the world before i had ever known a woman besides my mother i promised to love mary clibborn all my life oh it was cruel to let me be engaged to her you blame me dont you think all of you are a little to blame as well  what could we have done  why didnt you tell me not to be hasty why didnt you say that i was too young to become engaged  we thought it would steady you  but a young man doesnt want to be steadied let him see life and taste all it has to offer it is wicked to put fetters on his wrists before ever he has seen anything worth taking what is the virtue that exists only because temptation is impossible  i cant understand you jamie said mrs parsons sadly you talk so differently from when you were a boy  did you expect me to remain all my life an ignorant child youve never given me any freedom youve hemmed me in with every imaginable barrier youve put me on a leadingstring and thanked god that i did not stray  we tried to bring you up like a good man and a true christian  if im not a hopeless prig its only by miracle  james thats not the way to talk to your mother said major forsyth  oh mother im sorry i dont want to be unkind to you but we must talk things out freely weve lived in a hothouse too long  i dont know what you mean you became engaged to mary of your own free will we did nothing to hinder it nothing to bring it about but i confess we were heartily thankful thinking that no influence could be better for you than the love of a pure sweet english girl  it would have been kinder and wiser if you had forbidden it  we could not have taken the responsibility of crossing your affections  mrs clibborn did  could you expect us to be guided by her  she was the only one who showed the least common sense  how you have changed jamie  i would have obeyed you if you had told me i was too young to become engaged after all you are more responsible than i am i was a child it was cruel to let me bind myself  i never thought you would speak to us like that  all thats ancient history said major forsyth with what he flattered himself was a very good assumption of jocularity it was his idea to treat the matter lightly as a man of the world naturally would but his interruption was unnoticed  we acted for the best you know that we have always had your interests at heart  james did not speak for his only answer would have been bitter throughout they had been unwilling to let him live his own life but desirous rather that he should live theirs they loved him tyrannically on the condition that he should conform to all their prejudices though full of affectionate kindness they wished him always to dance to their pipinga marionette of which they pulled the strings  what would you have me do  keep your word james answered his father  i cant i cant i dont understand how you can wish me to marry mary clibborn when i dont love her that seems to me dishonourable  it would be nothing worse than a mariage de convenance said uncle william many people marry in that sort of way and are perfectly happy  i couldnt said james that seems to me nothing better than prostitution it is no worse for a streetwalker to sell her body to any that care to buy  james remember your mother is present  for gods sake let us speak plainly you must know what life is one can do no good by shutting ones eyes to everything that doesnt square with a shoddy false ideal on one side i must break my word on the other i must prostitute myself there is no middle way you live here surrounded by all sorts of impossible ways of looking at life how can your outlook be sane when it is founded on a sham morality you think the body is indecent and ugly and that the flesh is shameful oh you dont understand im sick of this prudery which throws its own hideousness over all it sees the soul and the body are one indissoluble soul is body and body is soul love is the godlike instinct of procreation you think sexual attraction is something to be ignored and in its place you put a bloodless sentimentalitythe vulgar rhetoric of a penny novelette if i marry a woman it is that she may be the mother of children passion is the only reason for marriage unless it exists marriage is ugly and beastly its worse than beastly the beasts of the field are clean dont you understand why i cant marry mary clibborn  what you call love james said colonel parsons is what i call lust  i well believe it replied james bitterly  love is something higher and purer  i know nothing purer than the body nothing higher than the divine instincts of nature  but that sort of love doesnt last my dear said mrs parsons gently in a very little while it is exhausted and then you look for something different in your wife you look for friendship and companionship confidence consolation in your sorrows sympathy with your success beside all that the sexual love sinks into nothing  it may be the passion arises for the purposes of nature and dies away when those purposes are fulfilled it seems to me that the recollection of it must be the surest and tenderest tie between husband and wife and there remains for them then the fruit of their love the children whom it is their blessed duty to rear till they are of fit age to go into the world and continue the endless cycle  there was a pause while major forsyth racked his brain for some apposite remark but the conversation had run out of his depth  colonel parsons at last got up and put his hands on jamies shoulders  and cant you bring yourself to marry that poor girl when you think of the terrible unhappiness she suffers  james shook his head  you were willing to sacrifice your life for a mere stranger and cannot you sacrifice yourself for mary who has loved you long and tenderly and unselfishly  i would willingly risk my life if she were in danger but you ask more  colonel parsons was silent for a little looking into his sons eyes then he spoke with trembling voice  i think you love me james ive always tried to be a good father to you and god knows ive done all i could to make you happy if i did wrong in letting you become engaged i beg your pardon no let me go on this he said in answer to jamies movement of affectionate protest i dont say it to reproach you but your mother and i have denied ourselves in all we could so that you should be happy and comfortable its been a pleasure to us for we love you with all our hearts you know what happened to me when i left the army i told you years ago of the awful disgrace i suffered i could never have lived except for my trust in god and my trust in you i looked to you to regain the honour which i had lost ah you dont know how anxiously i watched you and the joy with which i said to myself there is a good and honourable man and now you want to stain that honour oh james james im old and i cant live long if you love me if you think you have cause for gratitude to me do this one little thing i ask you for my sake my dear keep your word to mary clibborn  youre asking me to do something immoral father  then colonel parsons helplessly dropped his hands from jamies shoulders and turned to the others his eyes full of tears  i dont understand what he means he groaned  he sank on a chair and hid his face     xiv   major forsyth was not at all discouraged by the issue of his intervention  now i see how the land lies he said its all plain sailing reconnoitre first and then wire in  he bravely attacked james next day when they were smoking in the garden after breakfast uncle william smoked nothing but goldtipped cigarettes which excited his nephews open scorn  ive been thinking about what you said yesterday james he began  for heavens sake uncle william dont talk about it any more im heartily sick of the whole thing ive made up my mind and i really shall not alter it for anything you may say  major forsyth changed the conversation with what might have been described as a strategic movement to the rear he said that jamies answer told him all he wished to know and he was content now to leave the seeds which he had sown to spring up of their own accord  im perfectly satisfied he told his sister complacently youll see that if itll all come right now  meanwhile mary conducted herself admirably she neither avoided james nor sought him but when chance brought them together was perfectly natural her affection had never been demonstrative and now there was in her manner but little change she talked frankly as though nothing had passed between them with no suspicion of reproach in her tone she was indeed far more at ease than james he could not hide the effort it was to make conversation nor the nervous discomfort which in her presence he felt he watched her furtively asking himself whether she still suffered but marys face betrayed few of her emotions tanned by exposure to all weathers her robust colour remained unaltered and it was only in her eyes that james fancied he saw a difference they had just that perplexed sorrowful expression which a dog has unjustly beaten james imaginative and consciencestricken tortured himself by reading in their brown softness all manner of dreadful anguish he watched them unlit by the smile which played upon the lips looking at him against their will with a pitiful longing he exaggerated the pain he saw till it became an obsession intolerable and ruthless if mary desired revenge she need not have been dissatisfied but that apparently was the last thing she thought of he was grateful to hear of her anger with mrs jackson whose sympathy had expressed itself in round abuse of him his mother repeated the words  i will never listen to a word against captain parsons mrs jackson whatever he did he had a perfect right to do hes incapable of acting otherwise than as an honourable gentleman  but if marys conduct aroused the admiration of all that knew her it rendered james still more blameworthy  the heroworship was conveniently forgotten and none strove to conceal the dislike even the contempt which he felt for the fallen idol james had outraged the moral sense of the community his name could not be mentioned without indignation everything he did was wrong even his very real modesty was explained as overweening conceit  and curiously enough james was profoundly distressed by the general disapproval a silent shy man he was unreasonably sensitive to the opinion of his fellows and though he told himself that they were stupid ignorant and narrow their hostility nevertheless made him miserable even though he contemned them he was anxious that they should like him he refused to pander to their prejudices and was too proud to be conciliatory yet felt bitterly wounded when he had excited their aversion now he set to tormenting himself because he had despised the adulation of little primpton and could not equally despise its censure      sunday came and the good people of little primpton trooped to church mrs clibborn turned round and smiled at james when he took his seat but the colonel sat rigid showing by the stiffness of his backbone that his indignation was supreme  the service proceeded and in due course mr jackson mounted the pulpit steps he delivered his text the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate  the vicar of little primpton was an earnest man and he devoted much care to the composition of his sermons he was used to expound twice a sunday the more obvious parts of holy scripture making in twenty minutes or half an hour for the benefit of the vulgar a number of trite reflections and it must be confessed that he had great facility for explaining at decorous length texts which were plain to the meanest intelligence  but having a fair acquaintance with the thought of others mr jackson flattered himself that he was a thinker and on suitable occasions attacked from his village pulpit the scarlet weed of heresy expounding to an intelligent congregation of yokels and small boys the manifold difficulties of the athanasian creed he was at his best in pouring vials of contempt upon the false creed of atheists romanists dissenters and men of science the theory of evolution excited his bitterest scorn and he would set up like a row of ninepins the hypotheses of the greatest philosophers of the century triumphantly to knock them down by the force of his own fearless intellect his congregation were inattentive and convinced beyond the need of argument so they remained pious members of the church of england  but this particular sermon after mature consideration the vicar had made up his mind to devote to a matter of more pressing interest he repeated the text mrs jackson who knew what was coming caught the curates eye and looked significantly at james the homily in fact was directed against him his were the pride the arrogancy and the evil way he was blissfully unconscious of these faults and for a minute or two the application missed him but the vicar of little primpton intent upon what he honestly thought his duty meant that there should be no mistake he crossed his ts and dotted his is with the scrupulous accuracy of the scandalmonger telling a malicious story about some person whom charitably he does not name yet wishes everyone to identify  colonel parsons started when suddenly the drift of the sermon dawned upon him and then bowed his head with shame his wife looked straight in front of her two flaming spots upon her pale cheeks mary in the next pew dared not move hardly dared breathe her heart sank with dismay and she feared she would faint  how he must be suffering she muttered  they all felt for james intensely the form of mr jackson hooded and surpliced had acquired a new authority and his solemn invective was sulphurous with the fires of hell they wondered how james could bear it  he hasnt deserved this thought mrs parsons  but the colonel bent his head still lower accepting for his son the reproof taking part of it himself the humiliation seemed merited and the only thing to do was to bear it meekly james alone appeared unconcerned the rapid glances at him saw no change in his calm indifferent face his eyes were closed and one might have thought him asleep mr jackson noted the attitude and attributed it to a wicked obstinacy for the repentant sinner acknowledging his fault he would have had entire forgiveness but james showed no contrition stiffnecked and sinhardened he required a further chastisement  courage what is courage asked the preacher there is nothing more easy than to do a brave deed when the blood is hot but to conduct ones life simply modestly with a meek spirit and a christlike submission that is ten times more difficult courage unaccompanied by moral worth is the quality of a brutebeast  he showed how much more creditable were the artless virtues of honesty and truthfulness how better it was to keep ones word to be kindhearted and dutiful becoming more pointed he mentioned the case which had caused them so much sorrow warning the delinquent against conceit and selfassurance  pride goeth before a fall he said and he that is mighty shall be abased      they walked home silently colonel parsons and his wife with downcast eyes feeling that everyone was looking at them their hearts were too full for them to speak to one another and they dared say nothing to james but major forsyth had no scruples of delicacy he attacked his nephew the moment they sat down to dinner  well james what did you think of the sermon feel a bit sore  why should i  i fancy it was addressed pretty directly to you  so i imagine replied james goodhumouredly smiling i thought it singularly impertinent but otherwise uninteresting  mr jackson doesnt think much of you said uncle william with a laugh ignoring his sisters look which implored him to be silent  i can bear that with equanimity i never set up for a very wonderful person  he was wrong to make little of your attempt to save young larcher said mrs parsons gently  why asked james he was partly right physical courage is more or less accidental in battle one takes ones chance one soon gets used to shells flying about theyre not so dangerous as they look and after a while one forgets all about them now and then one gets hit and then its too late to be nervous  but you went backinto the very jaws of deathto save that boy  ive never been able to understand why it didnt occur to me that i might get killed it seemed the natural thing to do it wasnt really brave because i never realised that there was danger      in the afternoon james received a note from mrs clibborn asking him to call upon her mary and her father were out walking she said so there would be no one to disturb them and they could have a pleasant little chat the invitation was a climax to jamies many vexations and he laughed grimly at the prospect of that very foolish ladys indignation still he felt bound to go it was after a fashion a point of honour with him to avoid none of the annoyances which his act had brought upon him it was partly in order to face every infliction that he insisted on remaining at little primpton  why havent you been to see me james mrs clibborn murmured with a surprisingly tender smile  i thought you wouldnt wish me to  james  she sighed and cast up her eyes to heaven  i always liked you i shall never feel differently towards you  its very kind of you to say so replied james somewhat relieved  you must come and see me often itll comfort you  im afraid you and colonel clibborn must be very angry with me  i could never be angry with you james poor reginald he doesnt understand but you cant deceive a woman mrs clibborn put her hand on jamies arm and gazed into his eyes i want you to tell me something do you love anyone else  james looked at her quickly and hesitated  if you had asked me the other day i should have denied it with all my might but nowi dont know  mrs clibborn smiled  i thought so she said you can tell me you know  she was convinced that james adored her but wanted to hear him say so it is notorious that to a handsome woman even the admiration of a crossingsweeper is welcome  oh its no good any longer trying to conceal it from myself cried james forgetting almost to whom he was speaking im sorry about mary no one knows how much but i do love someone else and i love her with all my heart and soul and i shall never get over it now  i knew it sighed mrs clibborn complacently i knew it then looking coyly at him tell me about her  i cant i know my love is idiotic and impossible but i cant help it its fate  youre in love with a married woman james  how dyou know  my poor boy dyou think you can deceive me and is it not the wife of an officer  yes  a very old friend of yours  its just that which makes it so terrible  i knew it  oh mrs clibborn i swear youre the only woman here whos got two ounces of gumption if theyd only listened to you five years ago we might all have been saved this awful wretchedness  he could not understand that mrs clibborn whose affectations were manifest whose folly was notorious should alone have guessed his secret he was tired of perpetually concealing his thoughts  i wish i could tell you everything he cried  dont youd only regret it and i know all you can tell me  you cant think how hard ive struggled when i found i loved her i nearly killed myself trying to kill my love but its no good its stronger than i am  and nothing can ever come of it you know said mrs clibborn  oh i know of course i know im not a cad the only thing is to live on and suffer  im so sorry for you  mrs clibborn thought that even poor algy turner who had killed himself for love of her had not been so desperately hit  its very kind of you to listen to me said james i have nobody to speak to and sometimes i feel i shall go mad  youre such a nice boy james what a pity it is you didnt go into the cavalry  james scarcely heard he stared at the floor brooding sorrowfully  fate is against me he muttered  if things had only happened a little differently poor reggie  mrs clibborn was thinking that if she were a widow she could never have resisted the unhappy young mans pleading  james got up to go  its no good he said talking makes it no better i must go on trying to crush it and the worst of it is i dont want to crush it i love my love though it embitters my whole life i would rather die than lose it goodbye mrs clibborn thank you for being so kind you cant imagine what good it does me to receive a little sympathy  i know youre not the first who has told me that he is miserable i think its fate too  james looked at her perplexed not understanding what she meant with her sharp feminine intuition mrs clibborn read in his eyes the hopeless yearning of his heart and for a moment her rigid virtue faltered  i cant be hard on you jamie she said with that effective sad smile of hers i dont want you to go away from here quite wretched  what can you do to ease the bitter aching of my heart  mrs clibborn quickly looking at the window noticed that she could not possibly be seen by anyone outside she stretched out her hand  jamie if you like you may kiss me  she offered her powdered cheek and james rather astonished pressed it with his lips  i will always be a mother to you you can depend on me whatever happens now go away theres a good boy  she watched him as he walked down the garden and then sighed deeply wiping away a tear from the corner of her eyes  poor boy she murmured  mary was surprised when she came home to find her mother quite affectionate and tender mrs clibborn indeed intoxicated with her triumph could afford to be gracious to a fallen rival     xv   a few days later mary was surprised to receive a little note from mr dryland       my dear miss clibbornwith some trepidation i take up my pen to      address you on a matter which to me at least is of the very      greatest importance we have so many sympathies in common that my      meaning will hardly escape you i daresay you will find my      diffidence ridiculous but under the circumstances i think it is      not unpardonable it will be no news to you when i confess that i      am an exceptionally shy man and that must be my excuse in sending      you this letter in short i wish to ask you to grant me a brief      interview we have so few opportunities of seeing one another in      private that i can find no occasion of saying to you what i wish      indeed for a long period my duty has made it necessary for me to      crush my inclination now however that things have taken a      different turn i venture as i said to ask you to give me a few      minutes conversationi am my dear miss clibborn your very      sincere       thomas dryland       psi open this letter to say that i have just met your father      on the green who tells me that he and mrs clibborn are going into      tunbridge wells this afternoon unless therefore i hear from you      to the contrary i shall dv present myself at your house at 3      pm  what can he want to see me about exclaimed mary the truth occurring to her only to be chased away as a piece of egregious vanity it was more reasonable to suppose that mr dryland had on hand some charitable scheme in which he desired her to take part  anyhow she thought philosophically i suppose i shall know when he comes  at one and the same moment the church clock struck three and mr dryland rang the clibborns bell  he came into the diningroom in his best coat his honest red face shining with soap and with a consciousness that he was about to perform an heroic deed  this is kind of you miss clibborn do you know i feared the servant was going to say you were not at home  oh i never let her say that when im in mamma doesnt think it wrong but one cant deny that its an untruth  what a beautiful character you have cried the curate with enthusiasm  im afraid i havent really but i like to be truthful  were you surprised to receive my letter  im afraid i didnt understand it  i was under the impression that i expressed myself with considerable perspicacity remarked the curate with a genial smile  i dont pretend to be clever  oh but you are miss clibborn theres no denying it  i wish i thought so  youre so modest i have always thought that your mental powers were very considerable indeed i can assure you it has been a great blessing to me to find someone here who was capable of taking an intelligent interest in art and literature in these little country places one misses intellectual society so much  im not ashamed to say that ive learnt a lot from you mr dryland  no that is impossible all i lay claim to is that i was fortunate enough to be able to lend you the works of ruskin and marie corelli  that reminds me that i must return you the master christian  please dont hurry over it i think its a book worth pondering over quite unlike the average trashy novel  i havent had much time for reading lately  ah miss clibborn i understand im afraid youve been very much upset i wanted to tell you how sorry i was but i felt it would be perhaps indelicate  it is very kind of you to think of me  besides i must confess that i cannot bring myself to be very sorry its an ill wind that blows nobody good  im afraid i dont understand what you mean mr dryland  miss clibborn i have come here today to converse with you on a matter which i venture to think of some importance at least it is to me i will not beat about the bush in these matters it is always best i believe to come straight to the point the curate cleared his throat and assumed his best clerical manner miss clibborn i have the honour to solemnly ask you for your hand  oh  mary blushed scarlet and her heart went pitapat in the most alarming fashion  i think i should tell you that i am thirtythree years of age i have some private means small but sufficient with my income and economy to support a wife my father was for over a quarter of a century vicar of easterham  mary by this time had recovered herself  i feel very much honoured by your proposal mr dryland and no one can be more convinced than i of my unworthiness but im afraid i must refuse  i dont press for an immediate answer miss clibborn i know at first blush it must surprise you that i should come forward with an offer so soon after the rupture of your engagement with captain parsons but if you examine the matter closely you will see that it is less surprising than it seems while you were engaged to captain parsons it was my duty to stifle my feelings but now i cannot indeed i have not the right to conceal from you that for a long time they have been of the tenderest description  i feel very much flattered  not at all reassuringly answered mr dryland i can honestly say that you are deserving of the very highesteradmiration and esteem miss clibborn i have loved you in secret almost ever since i came to the parish the moment i saw you i felt an affinity between us our tastes are so similar we both understand art and literature when you played to me the divine melodies of mendelssohn when i read to you the melodious verses of lord tennyson i felt that my happiness in life would be a union with you  im afraid i can never be unfaithful to my old love  perhaps im a little previous  no time can make no possible difference im very grateful to you  you have no need to be i have always tried to do my duty and while you were engaged to another i allowed not even a sigh to escape my lips but now i venture to think that the circumstances are altered i know i am not a gallant officer i have done no doughty deeds and the victoria cross does not adorn my bosom i am comparatively poor but i can offer an honest heart and a very sincere and respectful love oh miss clibborn cannot you give me hope that as time wears on you will be able to look upon my suit with favour  im afraid my answer must be final  i hope to be soon appointed to a living and i looked forward ardently to the life of usefulness and of christian fellowship which we might have lived together you are an angel of mercy miss clibborn i cannot help thinking that you are eminently suitable for the position which i make so bold as to offer you  i wont deny that nothing could attract me more than to be the wife of a clergyman one has such influence for good such power of improving ones fellowmen but i love captain parsons even if he has ceased to care for me i could never look upon him with other feelings  even though it touches me to the quick miss clibborn said the curate earnestly i respect and admire you for your sentiments you are wonderful i wonder if youd allow me to make a little confession the curate hesitated and reddened the fact is i have written a few verses comparing you to penelope which if you will allow me i should very much like to send you  i should like to see them very much said mary blushing a little and smiling  of course im not a poet im too busy for that but they are the outpouring of an honest loving heart  im sure said mary encouragingly that its better to be sincere and upright than to be the greatest poet in the world  its very kind of you to say so i should like to ask one question miss clibborn have you any objection to me personally  oh no cried mary how can you suggest such a thing i have the highest respect and esteem for you mr dryland i can never forget the great compliment you have paid me i shall always think of you as the best friend i have  can you say nothing more to me than that asked the curate despondently  mary stretched out her hand i will be a sister to you  oh miss clibborn how sad it is to think that your affections should be unrequited why am i not captain parsons miss clibborn can you give me no hope  i should not be acting rightly towards you if i did not tell you at once that so long as captain parsons lives my love for him can never alter  i wish i were a soldier murmured mr dryland  oh its not that i think theres nothing so noble as a clergyman if it is any consolation to you i may confess that if i had never known captain parsons things might have gone differently  well i suppose i had better go away now i must try to bear my disappointment  mary gave him her hand and bending down with the utmost gallantry the curate kissed it then taking up his low clerical hat hurriedly left her      mrs jackson was a woman of singular penetration so that it was not strange if she quickly discovered what had happened mr dryland was taking tea at the vicarage whither with characteristic manliness he had gone to face his disappointment not for him was the solitary moping nor the privacy of a bedchamber his robust courage sent him rather into the field of battle or what was under the circumstances the only equivalent mrs jacksons drawingroom  but even he could not conceal the torments of unsuccessful love he stirred his tea moodily and his usual appetite for plumcake had quite deserted him  whats the matter with you mr dryland asked the vicars wife with those sharp eyes which could see into the best hidden family secret  mr dryland started at the question nothing  youre very funny this afternoon  ive had a great disappointment  oh replied mrs jackson in a tone which halfadozen marks of interrogation could inadequately express  its nothing life is not all beer and skittles ha ha  did you say youd been calling on mary clibborn this afternoon  mr dryland blushed and to cover his confusion filled his mouth with a large piece of cake  yes he said as soon as he could i paid her a little call  mr dryland you cant deceive me youve proposed to mary clibborn  he swallowed his food with a gulp its quite true  and shes refused you  yes  mr dryland it was a noble thing to do i must tell archibald  oh please dont mrs jackson i dont want it to get about  oh but i shall we cant let you hide your light under a bushel fancy you proposing to that poor dear girl but its just what i should have expected of you thats what i always say the clergy are constantly doing the most beautiful actions that no one hears anything about you ought to receive a moral victoria cross im sure you deserve it far more than that wicked and misguided young man  i dont think i ought to take any credit for what ive done modestly remonstrated the curate  it was a beautiful action you dont know how much it means to that poor jilted girl  its true my indignation was aroused at the heartless conduct of captain parsons but i have long loved her mrs jackson  i knew it i knew it when i saw you together i said to archibald what a good pair theyd make im sure you deserve her far more than that worthless creature  i wish she thought so  ill go and speak to her myself i think she ought to accept you youve behaved like a knighterrant mr dryland youre a true christian saint  oh mrs jackson you embarrass me  the news spread like wildfire and with it the opinion that the curate had vastly distinguished himself neither pagan hero nor christian martyr could have acted more becomingly the consideration which had once been jamies was bodily transferred to mr dryland he was the man of the hour and the contemplation of his gallant deed made everyone feel nobler purer the curate accepted with quiet satisfaction the homage that was laid at his feet modestly denying that he had done anything out of the way with james all unconscious of what had happened he was mildly patronising with mary tender respectful subdued if he had been an archbishop he could not have behaved with greater delicacy manliness and decorum  i dont care what anyone says cried mrs jackson i think hes worth ten captain parsons hes so modest and gentlemanly why captain parsons simply used to look bored when one told him he was brave  hes a conceited creature  but in primpton house the proposal was met with consternation  suppose she accepted him said colonel parsons anxiously  shed never do that  major forsyth suggested that james should be told in the belief that his jealousy would be excited  ill tell him said mrs parsons  she waited till she was alone with her son and then without stopping her needlework said suddenly  james have you heard that mr dryland has proposed to mary  he looked up nonchalantly has she accepted him  james cried his mother indignantly how can you ask such a question have you no respect for her you must know that for nothing in the world would she be faithless to you  i should like her to marry the curate i think it would be a very suitable match  you need not insult her james     xvi   the tension between james and his parents became not less but greater that barrier which almost from the beginning they had watched with pain rise up between them now seemed indestructible and all their efforts only made it more obvious and more stable it was like some tropical plant which for being cut down grew ever with greater luxuriance and there was a mischievous devil present at all their conversations that made them misunderstand one another as completely as though they spoke in different tongues notwithstanding their love they were like strangers together they could look at nothing from the same point of view  the parsons had lived their whole lives in an artificial state illeducated as most of their contemporaries in that particular class they had just enough knowledge to render them dogmatic and intolerant it requires a good deal of information to discover ones own ignorance but to the consciousness of this the good people had never arrived they felt they knew as much as necessary and naturally on the most debatable questions were most assured their standpoint was inconceivably narrow they had the best intentions in the world of doing their duty but what their duty was they accepted on trust frivolously they walked round and round in a narrow circle hemmed in by false ideals and by ugly prejudices putting for the love of god unnecessary obstacles in their path and convinced that theirs was the only possible way while all others led to damnation they had never worked out an idea for themselves never done a single deed on their own account but invariably acted and thought according to the rule of their caste they were not living creatures but dogmatic machines  james going into the world quickly realised that he had been brought up to a state of things which did not exist he was like a sailor who has put out to sea in an ornamental boat and finds that his sail is useless the ropes not made to work and the rudder immovable the long buoyant wind of the world blew away like thistledown the conventions which had seemed so secure a foundation but he discovered in himself a wonderful curiosity an eagerness for adventure which led him boldly to affront every peril and the unknown lands of the intellect are every bit as dangerously fascinating as are those of sober fact he read omnivorously saw many and varied things the universe was spread out before him like an enthralling play knowledge is like the root of a tree attaching man by its tendrils to the life about him james found in existence new beauties new interests new complexities and he gained a lighter heart and above all an exquisite sense of freedom at length he looked back with something like horror at that old life in which the fetters of ignorance had weighed so terribly upon him  on his return to little primpton he found his people as he had left them doing the same things repeating at every wellknown juncture the same trite observations their ingenuousness affected him as a negro civilised and educated on visiting after many years his native tribe might be affected by their noserings and yellow ochre james was astounded that they should ignore matters which he fancied common knowledge and at the same time accept beliefs that he had thought completely dead he was willing enough to shrug his shoulders and humour their prejudices but they had made of them a rule of life which governed every action with an iron tyranny it was in accordance with all these outworn conventions that they conducted the daily round and presently james found that his father and mother were striving to draw him back into the prison unconsciously even with the greatest tenderness they sought to place upon his neck again that irksome yoke which he had so difficultly thrown off  if james had learnt anything it was at all hazards to think for himself accepting nothing on authority questioning doubting it was to look upon life with a critical eye trying to understand it and to receive no readymade explanations above all he had learnt that every question has two sides now this was precisely what colonel parsons and his wife could never acknowledge for them one view was certainly right and the other as certainly wrong there was no middle way to doubt what they believed could only be ascribed to arrant folly or to wickedness sometimes james was thrown into a blind rage by the complacency with which from the depths of his nescience his father dogmatised no man could have been more unassuming than he and yet on just the points which were most uncertain his attitude was almost inconceivably arrogant  and james was horrified at the pettiness and the prejudice which he found in his home reading no books for they thought it waste of time to read the minds of his father and mother had sunk into such a narrow sluggishness that they could interest themselves only in trivialities their thoughts were occupied by their neighbours and the humdrum details of the life about them flattering themselves on their ideals and their high principles they vegetated in stupid sloth and in a less than animal vacuity every topic of conversation above the most commonplace they found dull or incomprehensible james learned that he had to talk to them almost as if they were children and the tedium of those endless days was intolerable  occasionally he was exasperated that he could not avoid the discussions which his father with a weak mans obstinacy forced upon him some unhappy baneful power seemed to drive colonel parsons to widen the rift the existence of which caused him such exquisite pain his natural kindliness was obscured by an uncontrollable irritation one day he was reading the paper  i see weve had another unfortunate reverse he said looking up  oh  i suppose youre delighted jamie  im very sorry why should i be otherwise  you always stick up for the enemies of your country turning to his brotherinlaw he explained james says that if hed been a cape dutchman hed have fought against us  well he deserves to be courtmartialled for saying so cried major forsyth  i dont think he means to be taken seriously said his mother  oh yes i do it constantly annoyed james that when he said anything that was not quite an obvious truism they should think he was speaking merely for effect why my dear mother if youd been a boer woman youd have potted at us from behind a haystack with the best of them  the boers are robbers and brigands  thats just what they say we are  but were right  and theyre equally convinced that they are  god cant be on both sides james  the odd thing is the certainty with which both sides claim his exclusive protection  i should think it wicked to doubt that god is with us in a righteous war said mrs parsons  if the boers werent deceived by that old villain kruger theyd never have fought us  the boers are strange people replied james they actually prefer their independence to all the privileges and advantages of subjection the wonderful thing to me is that people should really think mr kruger a hypocrite a ruler who didnt honestly believe in himself and in his mission would never have had such influence if a man wants power he must have selffaith but then he may be narrow intolerant and vicious his fellows will be like wax in his hands  if kruger had been honest he wouldnt have put up with bribery and corruption  the last thing i expect is consistency in an animal of such contrary instincts as man  every true englishman im thankful to say thinks him a scoundrel and a blackguard  in a hundred years he will probably think him a patriot and a hero in that time the sentimental view will be the only one of interest and the sentimental view will put the transvaal in the same category as poland  youre nothing better than a proboer james  im nothing of the kind but seeing how conflicting was current opinion i took some trouble to find for myself a justification of the war i couldnt help wondering why i went and killed people to whom i was personally quite indifferent  i hope because it was your duty as an officer of her majesty the queen  not exactly i came to the conclusion that i killed people because i liked it the fighting instinct is in my blood and im never so happy as when im shooting things killing tigers is very good sport but its not in it with killing men that is my justification so far as i personally am concerned as a member of society i wage war for a different reason war is the natural instinct of all creatures not only do progress and civilisation arise from it but it is the very condition of existence men beasts and plants are all in the same position unless they fight incessantly theyre wiped out theres no sitting on one side and looking on when a state wants a neighbours land it has a perfect right to take itif it can success is its justification we english wanted the transvaal for our greater numbers for our trade for the continuance of our power that was our right to take it the only thing that seems to me undignified is the rather pitiful set of excuses we made up  if those are your ideas i think they are utterly ignoble  i believe theyre scientific  dyou think men go to war for scientific reasons  no of course not they dont realise them the great majority are incapable of abstract ideas but fortunately theyre emotional and sentimental and the pill can be gilded with high falutin its for them that the union jack and the honour of old england are dragged through every newspaper and brandished in every music hall its for them that all these atrocities are inventedmost of them bunkum men are only savages with a thin veneer of civilisation which is rather easily rubbed off and then they act just like red indians but as a general rule theyre well enough behaved the boer isnt a bad sort and the englishman isnt a bad sort but theres not room for both of them on the earth and one of them has to go  my father fought for duty and honours sake and so fought his father before him  men have always fought really for the same reasonsfor selfprotection and gain but perhaps they have not seen quite so clearly as now the truth behind all their big words the world and mankind havent altered suddenly in the last few years      afterwards when colonel parsons and his wife were alone together and she saw that he was brooding over his sons words she laid her hand on his shoulder and said  dont worry richmond itll come right in the end if we trust and pray  i dont know what to make of him he returned sadly shaking his head its not our boy frances he couldnt be callous and unscrupulous anddishonourable god forgive me for saying it  dont be hard on him richmond i daresay he doesnt mean all he says and remember that hes been very ill hes not himself yet  the colonel sighed bitterly  when we looked forward so anxiously to his return we didnt know that he would be like this  james had gone out he wandered along the silent roads taking in large breaths of the fresh air for his home affected him like a hothouse the atmosphere was close and heavy so that he could neither think freely nor see things in any reasonable light he felt sometimes as though a weight were placed upon his head that pressed him down and pressed him down till he seemed almost forced to his knees  he blamed himself for his lack of moderation why remembering ever his fathers unhappiness and his infirmities could he not humour him he was an old man weak and frail it should not have been so difficult to use restraint towards him james knew he had left them in primpton house distressed and angry but the only way to please them was to surrender his whole personality giving up to their bidding all his thoughts and all his actions they wished to exercise over him the most intolerable of all tyrannies the tyranny of love it was a heavy return they demanded for their affection if he must abandon his freedom body and soul he earnestly wished to make them happy but that was too hard a price to pay and then with sudden rage james asked himself why they should be so selfsufficiently certain that they were right what an outrageous assumption it was that age must be infallible their idea of filial duty was that he should accept their authority not because they were wise but because they were old when he was a child they had insisted on the utmost submission and now they expected the same submissionto their prejudice intolerance and lack of knowledge they had almost ridiculously that calm quiet wellsatisfied assurance which a king by right divine might have in the certainty that he could do no wrong  and james with bitter painful scorn thought of that frightful blunder which had forced colonel parsons to leave the service at first his belief in his father had been such that james could not conceive the possibility even that he had acted wrongly the mere fact that his father had chosen a certain course was proof of its being right and proper and the shame lay with his chief who had used him ill but when he examined the affair and thought over it the truth became only too clear it came to him like a blow and for a while he was overcome with shame the fact was evidentalas only too evidenthis father was incapable of command james was simply astounded he tried not to hear the cruel words that buzzed in his ears but he could not help itimbecility crass idiocy madness it was worse than madness the folly of it was almost criminal he thought now that his father had escaped very easily  james hastened his step trying to rid himself of the irritating thoughts he walked along the fat and fertile kentish fields by the neat iron railing with which they were enclosed all about him was visible the care of man nothing was left wild the trees were lopped into proper shape cut down where their presence seemed inelegant planted to complete the symmetry of a group nature herself was under the power of the formal influence and flourished with a certain rigidity and decorum after a while the impression became singularly irksome it seemed to emphasise mans lack of freedom reminding one of the iron conventions with which he is inevitably bound in the sun the valley all green and wooded was pleasantly cool but when the clouds rolled up from the west heavily brushing the surrounding hills the aspect was so circumscribed that james could have cried out as with physical pain the primness of the scene then was insufferable the sombre wellordered elms the meadows so carefully kept seemed the garden of some great voluptuous prison and the air was close with servitude  james panted for breath he thought of the vast distances of south africa bush and prairie stretching illimitably and above the blue sky vaster still there at least one could breathe freely and stretch ones limbs  why did i ever come back he cried  the blood went thrilling through his veins at the mere thought of those days in which every minute had been intensely worth living then indeed was no restraint or pettiness then men were hard and firm and strong by comparison people in england appeared so pitifully weak vain paltry insignificant what were the privations and the hardships beside the sense of mastery the happy adventure and the carelessness of life  but the grey clouds hung over the valley pregnant with rain it gave him a singular feeling of discomfort to see them laden with water and yet painfully holding it up  i cant stay in this place he muttered i shall go mad  a sudden desire for flight seized him the clouds sank lower and lower till he imagined he must bend his head to avoid them if he could only get away for a little he might regain his calm at least absence he thought bitterly was the only way to restore the old affection between him and his father  he went home and announced that he was going to london     xvii   after the quiet of little primpton the hurry and the noise of victoria were a singular relief to james waiting for his luggage he watched the various movements of the scenethe trollies pushed along with warning cries the porters lifting heavy packages on to the bellied roof of hansoms the people running to and fro the crowd of cabs and driving out he was exhilarated by the confusion in the station yard and the intense life half gay half sordid of the wilton road he took a room in jermyn street according to major forsyths recommendation and walked to his club james had been out of london so long that he came back with the emotions of a stranger common scenes the glitter of shops the turmoil of the circus affected him with pleased surprise and with a childs amusement he paused to stare at the advertisements on a hoarding he looked forward to seeing old friends and on his way down piccadilly even expected to meet one or two of them sauntering along  as a matter of form james asked at his club whether there were any letters for him  i dont think so sir said the porter but turned to the pigeonholes and took out a bundle he looked them over and then handed one to james  hulloa whos this from  suddenly something gripped his heart he felt the blood rush to his cheeks and a cold tremor ran through all his limbs he recognised the handwriting of mrs pritchardwallace and there was a penny stamp on the envelope she was in england the letter had been posted in london  he turned away and walked towards a table that stood near the window of the hall a thousand recollections surged across his memory tumultuously the paper was scented how characteristic that was of her and in what bad taste he saw at once her smile and the look of her eyes he had a mad desire passionately to kiss the letter a load of weariness fell from his heart he felt insanely happy as though angry stormclouds had been torn asunder and the sun in its golden majesty shone calmly upon the earth then with sudden impulse he tore the unopened letter into a dozen pieces and threw them away he straightened himself and walked into the smokingroom  james looked round and saw nobody he knew quietly took a magazine from the table and sat down but the bloodvessels in his brain throbbed so violently that he thought something horrible would happen to him he heard the regular quick beating like the implacable hammering of gnomes upon some hidden distant anvil  shes in london he repeated  when had the letter been posted at least he might have looked at the mark on the envelope was it a year ago was it lately the letter did not look as though it had been lying about the club for many months had it not still the odour of those dreadful parma violets she must have seen in the paper his return from africa wounded and ill and what did she say did she merely write a few cold words of congratulation ormore  it was terrible that after three years the mere sight of her handwriting should have power to throw him into this state of eager passionate anguish he was seized with the old panic the terrified perception of his surrender of his utter weakness which made flight the only possible resistance that was why he had destroyed the letter unread when mrs wallace was many thousand miles away there had been no danger in confessing that he loved her but now it was different what did she say in the letter had she in some feminine mysterious fashion discovered his secret did she ask him to go and see her james remembered one of their conversations  oh i love going to london she had cried opening her arms with the charming exotic gesticulation which distinguished her from all other women i enjoy myself awfully  what do you do  everything and i write to poor dick three times a week and tell him all i havent done  i cant bear the grasswidow said james  poor boy you cant bear anything thats amusing i never knew anyone with such an ideal of woman as you havea gloomy mixture of frumpishness and angularity  james did not answer  dont you wish we were in london now she went on you and i together i really believe i should have to take you about youre as innocent as a babe  dyou think so said james rather hurt  now if we were in town on our own what would you do  oh i dont know i suppose make a little party and dine somewhere and go to the savoy to see the mikado  mrs wallace laughed  i know a party of fouryourself and me and two maiden aunts and we should be very prim and talk about the weather and go in a growler for proprietys sake i know that sort of evening and after the maiden aunts had seen me safety home i should simply howl from boredom my dear boy im respectable enough here when im on my own i want to go on the loose now ill tell you what i want to do if ever we are in town together will you promise to do it  if i possibly can  all right well you shall fetch me in the fastest hansom you can find and remember to tell the driver to go as quick as ever he dare well dine alone please at the most expensive restaurant in london youll engage a table in the middle of the room and you must see that the people all round us are very smart and very shady it always makes me feel so virtuous to look at disreputable women do i shock you  not more than usual  how absurd you are then well go to the empire and after that well go somewhere else and have supper where the people are still smarter and still shadier and then well go to covent garden ball oh you dont know how i long to go on the rampage sometimes i get so tired of propriety  and what will p w say to all this  oh ill write and tell him that i spent the evening with some of his poor relations and give eight pages of corroborative evidence  james thought of pritchardwallace gentlest and besthumoured of men he was a great big fellow with a heavy moustache and kind eyes always ready to stand by anyone in difficulties always ready with comfort or with cheery advice whoever wanted help went to him as though it were the most natural thing in the world and it was touching to see the doglike devotion to his wife he had such confidence in her that he never noticed her numerous flirtations pritchardwallace thought himself rather a dull stick and he wanted her to amuse herself so brilliant a creature could not be expected to find sufficient entertainment in a quiet man of easygoing habits  go your own way my girl he said i know youre all right and so long as you keep a place for me in the bottom of your heart you can do whatever you like  of course i dont care two straws for anyone but you silly old thing  and she pulled his moustache and kissed his lips and he went off on his business his heart swelling with gratitude because providence had given him the enduring love of so beautiful and enchanting a little woman  p w is worth ten of you james told her indignantly one day when he had been witness to some audacious deception  well he doesnt think so and thats the chief thing      james dared not see her it was obviously best to have destroyed the letter after all it was probably nothing more than a curt formal congratulation and its coldness would nearly have broken his heart he feared also lest in his neverceasing thought he had crystallised his beloved into something quite different from reality his imagination was very active and its constant play upon those few recollections might easily have added many a false delight to meet mrs wallace would only bring perhaps a painful disillusion and of that james was terrified for without this passion which occupied his whole soul he would be now singularly alone in the world it was a fantastic charming figure that he had made for himself and he could worship it without danger and without reproach was it not better to preserve his dream from the sullen irruption of fact but why would that perfume come perpetually entangling itself with his memory it gave the image new substance and when he closed his eyes the woman seemed so near that he could feel against his face the fragrance of her breath  he dined alone and spent the hours that followed in reading by some chance he was able to find no one he knew and he felt rather bored he went to bed with a headache feeling already the dreariness of london without friends  next morning james wandered in the park fresh and delightful with the rhododendrons but the people he saw hurt him by their almost aggressive happinessvivacious cheerful and careless they were all evidently of opinion that no reasonable creature could complain with the best of all possible worlds the girls that hurried past on ponies or on bicycles up and down the wellkept road gave him an impression of lightheartedness which was fascinating yet made his own solitude more intolerable their cheeks glowed with healthiness in the summer air and their gestures their laughter were charmingly animated he noticed the smile which a slender amazon gave to a man who raised his hat and read suddenly in their eyes a happy successful tenderness once galloping towards him he saw a woman who resembled mrs wallace and his heart stood still he had an intense longing to behold her just once more unseen of her but he was mistaken the rider approached and passed and it was no one he knew  then tired and sore at heart james went back to his club the day passed monotonously and the day after he was seized by the peculiar discomfort of the lonely sojourner in great cities the thronging busy crowd added to his solitariness when he saw acquaintances address one another in the club or walk along the streets in conversation he could hardly bear his own friendlessness the interests of all these people seemed so fixed and circumscribed their lives were already so full that they could only look upon a newcomer with hostility he would have felt less lonely on a desert island than in the multitudinous city surrounded by hurrying strangers he scarcely knew how he managed to drag through the day tired of the eternal smokingroom tired of wandering about the lodgings which major forsyth had recommended were like barracks a tall narrow house in which james had a room at the top looking on to a blank wall they were dreadfully cheerless and as james climbed the endless stairs he felt an irritation at the joyous laughter that came from other rooms behind those closed forbidding doors people were happy and light of heart only he was alone and must remain perpetually imprisoned within himself he went to the theatre but here again half insanely he felt a barrier between himself and the rest of the audience for him the piece offered no illusions he could only see painted actors strutting affectedly in unnatural costumes the scenery was mere painted cloth and the dialogue senseless inanity with all his might james wished that he were again in africa with work to do and danger to encounter there the solitude was never lonely and the nights were blue and silent rich with the countless stars  he had been in london a week one day towards evening while he walked down piccadilly looking aimlessly at the people and asking himself what their inmost thoughts could be he felt a hand on his shoulder and a cheery voice called out his name  i knew it was you parsons where the devil have you sprung from  he turned round and saw a man he had known in india jamies solitude and boredom had made him almost effusive  by jove i am glad to see you he said wringing the fellows hand come and have a drink ive seen no one for days and im dying to have some one to talk to  i think i can manage it ive got a train to catch at eight im just off to scotland  jamies face fell  i was going to ask you to dine with me  im awfully sorry im afraid i cant  they talked of one thing and another till jamies friend said he must go immediately they shook hands  oh by the way said the man suddenly remembering i saw a pal of yours the other day whos clamouring for you  for me  james reddened knowing at once instinctively that it could only be one person  dyou remember mrs pritchardwallace shes in london i saw her at a party and she asked me if i knew anything about you shes staying in half moon street at 201 youd better go and see her goodbye i must simply bolt  he left james hurriedly and did not notice the effect of his few words she still thought of him she asked for him she wished him to go to her the gods in their mercy had sent him the address with beating heart and joyful step james immediately set out the throng in his way vanished and he felt himself walking along some roadway of ethereal fire straight to his passionate lovea roadway miraculously fashioned for his feet leading only to her every thought left him but that the woman he adored was waiting waiting ready to welcome him with that exquisite smile with the hands which were like the caresses of aphrodite turned to visible flesh but he stopped short  whats the good he cried bitterly  before him the sun was setting like a vision of love colouring with softness and with quiet the manifold life of the city james looked at it his heart swelling with sadness for with it seemed to die his short joy and the shadows lengthening were like the sad facts of reality which crept into his soul one by one silently  i wont go he cried i darent oh god help me and give me strength  he turned into the green park where lovers sat entwined upon the benches and in the pleasant warmth the idlers and the weary slept upon the grass james sank heavily upon a seat and gave himself over to his wretchedness  the night fell and the lamps upon piccadilly were lit and in the increasing silence the roar of london sounded more intensely from the darkness as if it were the scene of a play james watched the cabs and buses pass rapidly in the light the endless procession of people like disembodied souls drifting aimlessly before the wind it was a comfort and a relief to sit there unseen under cover of the night he observed the turmoil with a new disinterested curiosity feeling strangely as if he were no longer among the living he found himself surprised that they thought it worth while to hurry and to trouble the couples on the benches remained in silent ecstasy and sometimes a dark figure slouched past sorrowful and mysterious  at last james went out surprised to find it was so late the theatres had disgorged their crowds and piccadilly was thronged gay vivacious and insouciant for a moment there was a certain luxury about its vice the harlot gained the pompousness of a roman courtesan and the vulgar debauchee had for a little while the rich corrupt decadence of art and splendour  james turned into half moon street which now was all deserted and silent and walked slowly with anguish tearing at his heart towards the house in which lodged mrs wallace one window was still lit and he wondered whether it was hers it would have been an exquisite pleasure if he could but have seen her form pass the drawn blind ah he could not have mistaken it presently the light was put out and the whole house was in darkness he waited on for no reasonpleased to be near her he waited half the night till he was so tired he could scarcely drag himself home  in the morning james was ill and tired and disillusioned his head ached so that he could hardly bear the pain and in all his limbs he felt a strange and heavy lassitude he wondered why he had troubled himself about the woman who cared nothingnothing whatever for him he repeated about her the bitter scornful things he had said so often he fancied he had suddenly grown indifferent  i shall go back to primpton he said london is too horrible     xviii   the lassitude and the headache explained themselves for the day after jamies arrival at little primpton he fell ill and the doctor announced that he had enteric fever he explained that it was not uncommon for persons to develop the disease after their return from the cape in their distress the first thought of mrs parsons and the colonel was to send for mary they knew her to be quick and resourceful  dr radley says we must have a nurse down jamie is never to be left alone and i couldnt manage by myself  mary hesitated and reddened  oh i wish jamie would let me nurse him you and i could do everything much better than a strange woman dyou think hed mind  mrs parsons looked at her doubtfully  its very kind of you mary im afraid hes not treated you so as to deserve that and it would exhaust you dreadfully  im very strong i should like it so much wont you ask jamie he can only refuse  very well  mrs parsons went up to her son by whom sat the colonel looking at him wistfully james lay on his back breathing quickly dull listless and apathetic every now and then his dark dry lips contracted as the unceasing pain of his head became suddenly almost insufferable  jamie dear said mrs parsons dr radley says you must have a second nurse and we thought of getting one from tunbridge wells would you mind if mary came instead  james opened his eyes bright and unnatural and the dilated pupils gave them a strangely piercing expression  does she want to  it would make her very happy  does she know that enteric is horrid to nurse  for your sake she will do everything willingly  then let her he smiled faintly its an ill wind that blows nobody good thats what the curate said  he had sufficient strength to smile to mary when she came up and to stretch out his hand  its very good of you mary  nonsense she said cheerily you mustnt talk and you must do whatever i tell you and let yourself be treated like a little boy  for days james remained in the same condition with aching head his face livid in its pallor except for the bright the terrifying flush of the cheeks and the lips were dark with the sickly darkness of death he lay on his back continually apathetic and listless his eyes closed now and again he opened them and their vacant brilliancy was almost unearthly he seemed to see horrible things impossible to prevent staring in front of him with the ghastly intensity of the blind  meanwhile mrs parsons and mary nursed him devotedly mary was quite splendid in her loving quickness she forestalled all jamies wants so that they were satisfied almost before he had realised them she was always bright and goodtempered and fresh she performed with constant cheerfulness the little revolting services which the disease necessitates nothing was too difficult or too harassing or too unpleasant for her to do she sacrificed herself with delight taking upon her shoulders the major part of the work leaving james only when mrs parsons forced her to rest she sat up night after night uncomplainingly having sent for her clothes and notwithstanding mrs clibborns protests taken up her abode altogether at primpton house  mrs clibborn said it was a most improper proceeding that a trained nurse would be more capable and the parsons could well afford it and also that it was indelicate for mary to force herself upon james when he was too ill to defend himself  i dont know what we should do without you mary said colonel parsons with tears in his eyes if we save him it will be your doing  of course we shall save him all i ask you is to say nothing of what ive done its been a pleasure to me to serve him and i dont deserve and i dont want gratitude  but it became more than doubtful whether it would be possible to save james weakened by his wound and by the privations of the campaign the disease grew worse he was constantly delirious and his prostration extreme his cheeks sank in and he seemed to have lost all power of holding himself together he lay low down in the bed as if he had given up trying to save himself his face became dusky so that it was terrifying to look upon  the doctor could no longer conceal his anxiety and at last mrs parsons alone with him insisted upon knowing the truth  is there any chance she asked tremulously i would much rather know the worst  im afraid very very little  mrs parsons shook hands silently with dr radley and returned to the sick room where mary and the colonel were sitting at the bedside  well  mrs parsons bent her head and the silent tears rolled down her cheeks the others understood only too well  the lords will be done whispered the father blessed be the name of the lord  they looked at james with aching hearts all their bitterness had long gone and they loved him again with the old devotion of past time  dyou think i was hard on him dear said the colonel  mary took his hand and held it affectionately  dont worry about that she said im sure he never felt any bitterness towards you  james now was comatose but sometimes a reflex movement would pass through him a sort of quiver which seemed horribly as though the soul were parting from his body and feebly he clutched at the bedclothes  was it for this that he was saved from war and pestilence muttered the colonel hopelessly      but the fates love nothing better than to mock the poor little creatures whose destinies ceaselessly they weave refusing the wretched hearts desire till long waiting has made it listless and giving with both hands only when the gift entails destruction james did not die the passionate love of those three persons who watched him day by day and night by night seemed to have exorcised the might of death he grew a little better his vigorous frame battled for life with all the force of that unknown mysterious power which cements into existence the myriad wandering atoms he was listless indifferent to the issue but the will to live fought for him and he grew better quickly he was out of danger  his father and mary and mrs parsons looked at one another almost with surprise hardly daring to believe that they had saved him they had suffered so much all three of them that they hesitated to trust their good fortune superstitiously fearing that if they congratulated themselves too soon some dreadful thing would happen to plunge back their beloved into deadly danger but at last he was able to get up to sit in the garden now luxuriant with the ripe foliage of august and they felt the load of anxiety gradually lift itself from their shoulders they ventured again to laugh and to talk of little trivial things and of the future they no longer had that panic terror when they looked at him pale and weak and emaciated  then again the old couple thanked mary for what she had done and one day in secret went off to tunbridge wells to buy a little present as a proof of their gratitude colonel parsons suggested a bracelet but his wife was sure that mary would prefer something useful so they brought back with them a very elaborate and expensive writingcase which with a few shy words they presented to her mary poor thing was overcome with pleasure  its awfully good of you she said ive done nothing that i wouldnt have done for any of the cottagers  we know it was you who saved him youyou snatched him from the very jaws of death  mary paused and held out her hand  will you promise me one thing  what is it asked colonel parsons unwilling to give his word rashly  well promise that you will never tell james that he owes anything to me i couldnt bear him to think i had forced myself on him so as to have a sort of claim please promise me that  i should never be able to keep it cried the colonel  i think shes right richmond well promise mary besides james cant help knowing  the hopes of the dear people were reviving and they began to look upon jamies illness piously as a blessing of providence in disguise while mrs parsons was about her household work in the morning the colonel would sometimes come in rubbing his hands gleefully  ive been watching them from the kitchen garden he said  james lay on a long chair in a sheltered shady place and mary sat beside him reading aloud or knitting  oh you shouldnt have done that richmond said his wife with an indulgent smile its very cruel  i couldnt help it my dear theyre sitting there together just like a pair of turtledoves  are they talking or reading  shes reading to him and hes looking at her he never takes his eyes off her  mrs parsons sighed with a happy sadness  god is very good to us richmond      james was surprised to find how happily he could spend his days with mary he was carried into the garden as soon as he got up and remained there most of the day mary as ever was untiring in her devotion thoughtful anxious to obey his smallest whim he saw very soon the thoughts which were springing up again in the minds of his father and mother intercepting the little significant glances which passed between them when mary went away on some errand and he told her not to be long when they exchanged gentle chaff or she arranged the cushions under his head the neighbours had asked to visit him but this he resolutely declined and appealed to mary for protection  im quite happy alone here with you and if anyone else comes i swear ill fall ill again  and with a little flush of pleasure and a smile mary answered that she would tell them all he was very grateful for their sympathy but didnt feel strong enough to see them  i dont feel a bit grateful really he said  then you ought to  her manner was much gentler now that james was ill and her rigid moral sense relaxed a little in favour of his weakness marys common sense became less aggressive and if she was practical and unimaginative as ever she was less afraid than before of giving way to him she became almost tolerant allowing him little petulances and little evasionspetty weaknesses which in complete health she would have felt it her duty not to compromise with she treated him like a child with whom it was possible to be indulgent without a surrender of principle he could still claim to be spoiled and petted and made much of  and james found that he could look forward with something like satisfaction to the condition of things which was evolving he did not doubt that if he proposed to mary again she would accept him and all their difficulties would be at an end after all why not he was deeply touched by the loving ceaseless care she had taken of him indeed no words from his father were needed to make him realise what she had gone through she was kindness itself tender considerate cheerful he felt an utter prig to hesitate and now that he had got used to her again james was really very fond of mary in his physical weakness her strength was peculiarly comforting he could rely upon her entirely and trust her he admired her rectitude and her truthfulness she reminded him of a granite cross standing alone in a desolate scotch island steadfast to wind and weather unyielding even to time erect and stern and yet somehow pathetic in its solemn loneliness  was it a lot of nonsense that he had thought about the immaculacy of the flesh the world in general found his theories ridiculous or obscene the world might be right after all the majority is not necessarily wrong jamies illness interfered like a blank space between his present self and the old one with its strenuous ideals of a purity of body which vulgar persons knew nothing of weak and ill dependent upon the strength of others his former opinions seemed singularly uncertain how much more easy and comfortable was it to fall back upon the ideas of all and sundry one cannot help being a little consciencestricken sometimes when one thinks differently from others that is why society holds together conscience is its most efficient policeman but when one shares common opinions the whole authority of civilisation backs one up and the reward is an ineffable selfcomplacency it is the easiest thing possible to wallow in the prejudices of all the world and the most eminently satisfactory for nineteen hundred years we have learnt that the body is shameful a pitfall and a snare to the soul it is to be hoped we have one for our bodies since we began worrying about our souls leave much to be desired the common idea is that the flesh is beastly the spirit divine and it sounds reasonable enough if it means little one need not care for the world has turned eternally to one senseless formula after another all one can be sure about is that in the things of this world there is no absolute certainty  james in his prostration felt only indifference and his old strenuousness with its tragic despair seemed not a little ridiculous his eagerness to keep clean from what he thought prostitution was melodramatic and silly his idea of purity mere foolishness if the body was excrement as from his youth he had been taught what could it matter how one used it did anything matter when a few years would see the flesh he had thought divine corrupt and wormeaten james was willing now to float along the stream sociably with his fellows and had no doubt that he would soon find a set of highsounding phrases to justify his degradation what importance could his actions have who was an obscure unit in an ephemeral race it was much better to cease troubling and let things come as they would people were obviously right when they said that mary must be an excellent helpmate how often had he not told himself that she would be all that a wife shouldkind helpful trustworthy was it not enough  and his marriage would give such pleasure to his father and mother such happiness to mary if he could make a little return for all her goodness was he not bound to do so he smiled with bitter scorn at his dead lofty ideals the workaday world was not fit for them it was much safer and easier to conform oneself to its terrestrial standard and the amusing part of it was that these new opinions which seemed to him a falling away to others meant precisely the reverse they thought it purer and more ethereal that a man should marry because a woman would be a housekeeper of good character than because the divine instincts of nature irresistibly propelled him  james shrugged his shoulders and turned to look at mary who was coming towards him with letters in her hand  three letters for you jamie  whom are they from  look she handed him one  thats a bill i bet he said open it and see  she opened and read out an account for boots  throw it away  mary opened her eyes  it must be paid jamie  of course it must but not for a long time yet let him send it in a few times more now the next one  he looked at the envelope and did not recognise the handwriting  you can open that too  it was from the larchers repeating their invitation to go and see them  i wonder if theyre still worrying about the death of their boy  oh well its six months ago isnt it replied mary  i suppose in that time one gets over most griefs i must go over some day now the third  he reddened slightly recognising again the handwriting of mrs wallace but this time it affected him very little he was too weak to care and he felt almost indifferent  shall i open it said mary  james hesitated  no he said tear it up and then in reply to her astonishment he added smiling its all right im not off my head tear it up and dont ask questions theres a dear  of course ill tear it up if you want me to said mary looking rather perplexed  now go to the hedge and throw the pieces in the field  she did so and sat down again  shall i read to you  no im sick of the antiquary why the goodness they cant talk english like rational human beings heaven only knows  well we must finish it now weve begun  dyou think something dreadful will happen to us if we dont  if one begins a book i think one should finish it however dull it is one is sure to get some good out of it  my dear youre a perfect monster of conscientiousness  well if you dont want me to read i shall go on with my knitting  i dont want you to knit either i want you to talk to me  mary looked almost charming in the subdued light of the sun as it broke through the leaves giving a softness of expression and a richness of colour that james had never seen in her before and the summer frock she wore made her more girlish and irresponsible than usual  youve been very very good to me all this time mary said james suddenly  mary flushed i  i can never thank you enough  nonsense your father has been telling you a lot of rubbish and he promised he wouldnt  no hes said nothing did you make him promise that was very nice and just like you  i was afraid hed say more than he ought  dyou think i havent been able to see for myself i owe my life to you  you owe it to god jamie  he smiled and took her hand  im very very grateful  its been a pleasure to nurse you jamie i never knew youd make such a good patient  and for all youve done ive made you wretched and miserable can you ever forgive me  theres nothing to forgive dear you know i always think of you as a brother  ah thats what you told the curate cried james laughing  mary reddened  how dyou know  he told mrs jackson and she told father  youre not angry with me  i think you might have made it second cousin said james with a smile  mary did not answer but tried to withdraw her hand he held it fast  mary ive treated you vilely if you dont hate me its only because youre a perfect angel  mary looked down blushing deep red  i can never hate you she whispered  oh mary can you forgive me can you forget it sounds almost impertinent to ask you againwill you marry me mary  she withdrew her hand  its very kind of you jamie youre only asking me out of gratitude because ive helped a little to look after you but i want no gratitude it was all pleasure and im only too glad that youre getting well  im perfectly in earnest mary i wouldnt ask you merely from gratitude i know i have humiliated you dreadfully and i have done my best to kill the love you had for me but i really honestly love you nowwith all my heart if you still care for me a little i beseech you not to dismiss me  if i still care for you cried mary hoarsely oh my god  mary forgive me i want you to marry me  she looked at him distractedly the fire burning through her heart he took both her hands and drew her towards him  mary say yes  she sank helplessly to her knees beside him  it would make me very happy she murmured with touching humility  then he bent forward and kissed her tenderly  lets go and tell them he said theyll be so pleased  mary smiling and joyful helped him to his feet and supporting him as best she could they went towards the house  colonel parsons was sitting in the diningroom twirling his old panama in a great state of excitement he had interrupted his wife at her accounts and she was looking at him goodhumouredly over her spectacles  im sure somethings happening he said i went out to take jamie his beeftea and he was holding marys hand i coughed as loud as i could but they took no notice at all so i thought id better not disturb them  here they come said mrs parsons  mother said james mary has something to tell you  i havent anything of the sort cried mary blushing and laughing jamie has something to tell you  well the fact is ive asked mary to marry me and shes said she would     xix   james was vastly relieved his peoples obvious delight marys quiet happiness were very grateful to him and if he laughed at himself a little for feeling so virtuous he could not help thoroughly enjoying the pleasure he had given he was willing to acknowledge now that his conscience had been uneasy after the rupture of his engagement although he had assured himself so vehemently that reason was upon his side the common disapproval and the influence of all his bringingup had affected him in his own despite  when shall we get married mary he asked when the four of them were sitting together in the garden  quickly cried colonel parsons  well shall we say in a month or six weeks  dyou think youll be strong enough replied mary looking affectionately at him and then blushing a little i can get ready very soon  the night before she had gone home and taken out the trousseau which with tears had been put away she smoothed out the things unfolded them and carefully folded them up never in her life had she possessed such dainty linen mary cried a while with pleasure to think that she could begin again to collect her little store no one knew what agony it had been to write to the shops at tunbridge wells countermanding her orders and now she looked forward with quiet delight to buying all that remained to get  finally it was decided that the wedding should take place at the beginning of october mrs parsons wrote to her brother who answered that he had expected the event all along being certain that his conversation with james would eventually bear fruit he was happy to be able to congratulate himself on the issue of his diplomacy it was wonderful how easily all difficulties were settled if one took them from the point of view of a man of the world mrs jackson likewise flattered herself that the renewed engagement was due to her intervention  i saw he was paying attention to what i said she told her husband i knew all he wanted was a good straight talking to  i am sorry for poor dryland said the vicar  yes i think we ought to do our best to console him dont you think he might go away for a month archibald  mr dryland came to tea and the vicars wife surrounded him with little attentions she put an extra lump of sugar in his tea and cut him even a larger piece of seedcake than usual  of course youve heard mr dryland she said solemnly  are you referring to miss clibborns engagement to captain parsons he asked with a gloomy face bad news travels fast  you have all our sympathies we did everything we could for you  i cant deny that its a great blow to me i confess i thought that time and patience on my part might induce miss clibborn to change her mind but if shes happy i cannot complain i must bear my misfortune with resignation  but will she be happy asked mrs jackson with foreboding in her voice  i sincerely hope so anyhow i think it my duty to go to captain parsons and offer him my congratulations  will you do that mr dryland cried mrs jackson that is noble of you  if youd like to take your holiday now dryland said the vicar i daresay we can manage it  oh no thanks im not the man to desert from the field of battle  mrs jackson sighed  things never come right in this world thats what i always say the clergy are continually doing deeds of heroism which the world never hears anything about  the curate went to primpton house and inquired whether he might see captain parsons  ill go and ask if hes well enough answered the colonel with his admirable respect for the cloth  do you think he wants to talk to me about my soul asked james smiling  i dont know but i think youd better see him  very well  mr dryland came forward and shook hands with james in an ecclesiastical and suave manner trying to be dignified as behoved a rejected lover in the presence of his rival and at the same time cordial as befitted a christian who could bear no malice  captain parsons you will not be unaware that i asked miss clibborn to be my wife  the fact was fairly generally known in the village replied james trying to restrain a smile  mr dryland blushed  i was annoyed at the publicity which the circumstance obtained the worst of these little places is that people will talk  it was a very noble deed said james gravely repeating the common opinion  not at all answered the curate with characteristic modesty but since it was not to be since miss clibborns choice has fallen on you i think it my duty to inform you of my hearty goodwill i wish in short to offer you again my sincerest congratulations  im sure thats very kind of you      two days later mrs jackson called on a similar errand  she tripped up to james and frankly held out her hand neatly encased as ever in a shining black kid glove  captain parsons let us shake hands and let bygones be bygones you have taken my advice and if in the heat of the moment we both said things which we regret after all were only human  surely mrs jackson i was moderation itselfeven when you told me i should infallibly go to hell  you were extremely irritating said the vicars lady smiling but i forgive you after all you paid more attention to what i said than i expected you would  it must be very satisfactory for you to think that  you know i have no illfeeling towards you at all i gave you a piece of my mind because i thought it was my duty if you think i stepped over the limits ofmoderation i am willing and ready to apologise  what a funny woman you are said james looking at her with a goodhumoured but rather astonished smile  im sure i dont know what makes you think so she answered bridling a little  it never occurred to me that you honestly thought you were acting rightly when you came and gave me a piece of your mind as you call it i thought your motives were simply malicious and uncharitable  i have a very high ideal of my duties as a clergymans wife  the human animal is very odd  i dont look upon myself as an animal captain parsons  james smiled  i wonder why we all torture ourselves so unnecessarily it really seems as if the chief use we made of our reason was to inflict as much pain upon ourselves and upon one another as we possibly could  im sure i dont know what you mean captain parsons  when you do anything are you ever tormented by a doubt whether you are doing right or wrong  never she answered firmly there is always a right way and a wrong way and im thankful to say god has given me sufficient intelligence to know which is which and obviously i choose the right way  what a comfortable idea i can never help thinking that every right way is partly wrong and every wrong way partly right theres always so much to be said on both sides to me its very hard to know which is which  only a very weak man could think like that  possibly i have long since ceased to flatter myself on my strength of mind i find it is chiefly a characteristic of unintelligent persons      it was marys way to take herself seriously it flattered her to think that she was not blind to jamies faults she loved him none the less on their account but determined to correct them he had an unusual way of looking at things and an occasional flippancy in his conversation both of which she hoped in time to eradicate with patience gentleness and dignity a woman can do a great deal with a man  one of marys friends had a husband with a bad habit of swearing which was cured in a very simple manner whenever he swore his wife swore too for instance he would say thats a damned bad job and his wife answered smiling yes damned bad he was rather surprised but quickly ceased to employ objectionable words story does not relate whether he also got out of the habit of loving his wife but that doubtless is a minor detail mary always looked upon her friend as a pattern  james is not really cynical she told herself he says things not because he means them but because he likes to startle people  it was inconceivable that james should not think on all subjects as she had been brought up to do and the least originality struck her naturally as a sort of pose but on account of his illness mary allowed him a certain latitude and when he said anything she did not approve of instead of arguing the point merely smiled indulgently and changed the subject there was plenty of time before her and when james became her husband she would have abundant opportunity of raising him to that exalted level upon which she was so comfortably settled the influence of a simple christian woman could not fail to have effect at bottom james was as good as gold and she was clever enough to guide him insensibly along the right path  james perceiving this scarcely knew whether to be incensed or amused sometimes he could see the humour in marys ingenuous conceit and in the dogmatic assurance with which she uttered the most astounding opinions but at others when she waved aside superciliously a remark that did not square with her prejudices or complacently denied a statement because she had never heard it before he was irritated beyond all endurance and it was nothing very outrageous he said but merely some commonplace of science which all the world had accepted for twenty years mary however entrenched herself behind the impenetrable rock of her selfsufficiency  im not clever enough to argue with you she said but i know im right and im quite satisfied  generally she merely smiled  what nonsense you talk jamie you dont really believe what you say  but my dear mary its a solemn fact theres no possibility of doubting it its a truism  then with admirable selfcommand remembering that james was still an invalid she would pat his hand and say  well it doesnt matter of course youre much cleverer than i am it must be almost time for your beeftea  james sank back baffled marys ignorance was an impenetrable cuirass she would not try to understand she could not even realise that she might possibly be mistaken quite seriously she thought that what she ignored could be hardly worth knowing people talk of the advance of education there may be a little among the lower classes but it is inconceivable that the english gentry can ever have been more illiterate than they are now throughout the country in the comfortable villa or in the stately mansion you will find as much prejudice and superstition in the drawingroom as in the kitchen and you will find the masters less receptive of new ideas than their servants and into the bargain presumptuously satisfied with their own nescience  james saw that the only way to deal with mary and with his people was to give in to all their prejudices he let them talk and held his tongue he shut himself off from them recognising that there was and could be no bond between them they were strangers to him their ways of looking at every detail of life were different from his they had not an interest not a thought in common the preparations for the marriage went on  one day mary decided that it was her duty to speak with james about his religion some of his remarks had made her a little uneasy and he was quite strong enough now to be seriously dealt with  tell me jamie she said in reply to an observation which she was pleased to consider flippant you do believe in god dont you  but james had learnt his lesson well  my dear that seems to me a private affair of my own  are you ashamed to say she asked gravely  no but i dont see the advantage of discussing the matter  i think you ought to tell me as im going to be your wife i shouldnt like you to be an atheist  atheism is exploded mary only very ignorant persons are certain of what they cannot possibly know  then i dont see why you should be afraid to tell me  im not only i think you have no right to ask we both think that in marriage each should leave the other perfect freedom i used to imagine the ideal was that married folk should not have a thought nor an idea apart but that is all rot the best thing is evidently for each to go his own way and respect the privacy of the other complete trust entails complete liberty  i think that is certainly the noblest way of looking at marriage  you may be quite sure i shall not intrude upon your privacy mary  im sorry i asked you any question i suppose its no business of mine  james returned to his book he had fallen into the habit again of reading incessantly finding therein his only release from the daily affairs of life but when mary left him he let his novel drop and began to think he was bitterly amused at what he had said the parrot words which he had so often heard on marys lips sounded strangely on his own he understood now why the view of matrimony had become prevalent that it was an institution in which two casual persons lived together for the support of one and the material comfort of the other without love it was the most natural thing that husband and wife should seek all manner of protection from each other with love none was needed it harmonised well with the paradox that a marriage of passion was rather indecent while lukewarm affection and paltry motives of convenience were elevating and noble  poor mary james knew that she loved him with all her soul such as it was a delicate conscience and a collection of principles are not enough to make a great lover and again he acknowledged to himself that he could give her only friendship it had been but an ephemeral tenderness which drew him to her for the second time due to weakness of body and to gratitude if he ever thought it was love he knew by now that he had been mistaken still what did it matter he supposed they would get along very wellas well as most people better even than if they adored one another for passion is not conducive to an even life fortunately she was cold and reserved little given to demonstrative affection she made few demands upon him and occupied with her work in the parish and the collection of her trousseau was content that he should remain with his books  the day fixed upon for the marriage came nearer  but at last james was seized with a wild revolt his father was sitting by him  marys weddingdress is nearly ready he said suddenly  so soon cried james his heart sinking  shes afraid that something may happen at the last moment and it wont be finished in time  what could happen  oh i mean something at the dressmakers  is that all i imagine theres little danger  there was a pause broken again by the colonel  im so glad youre going to be happily married jamie  his son did not answer  but man is never satisfied i used to think that when i got you spliced i should have nothing else to wish for but now im beginning to want little grandsons to rock upon my knees  jamies face grew dark  we should never be able to afford children  but they come if one wants them or not and i shall be able to increase your allowance a little you know i dont want you to go short of anything  james said nothing but he thought if i had children by her i should hate them and then with sudden dismay losing all the artificial indifference of the last week he rebelled passionately against his fate oh i hate and loathe her  he felt he could no longer continue the pretence he had been makingfor it was all pretence the effort to be loving and affectionate was torture so that all his nerves seemed to vibrate with exasperation sometimes he had to clench his hands in order to keep himself under restraint he was acting all the time james asked himself what madness blinded mary that she did not see he remembered how easily speech had come in the old days when they were boy and girl together they could pass hours side by side without a thought of time talking of little insignificant things silent often and always happy but now he racked his brain for topics of conversation and the slightest pause seemed irksome and unnatural he was sometimes bored to death savagely cruelly so that he was obliged to leave mary for fear that he would say bitter and horrible things without his books he would have gone mad she must be blind not to see then he thought of their married life how long would it last the years stretched themselves out endlessly passing one after another in dreary monotony could they possibly be happy sooner or later mary would learn how little he cared for her and what agony must she suffer then but it was inevitable now whatever happened he could not draw back it was too late for explanations would love come he felt it impossible he felt rather that the physical repulsion which vainly he tried to crush would increase till he abhorred the very sight of his wife  passionately he cried out against fate because he had escaped death so often the gods played with him as a cat plays with a mouse he had been through dangers innumerable twice he had lain on the very threshold of eternal night and twice he had been snatched back far rather would he have died the soldiers death gallantly than live on to this humiliation and despair a friendly bullet could have saved him many difficulties and much unhappiness and why had he recovered from the fever what an irony it was that mary should claim gratitude for doing him the greatest possible disservice  i cant help it he cried i loathe her  the strain upon him was becoming intolerable james felt that he could not much longer conceal the anguish which was destroying him but what was to be done nothing nothing nothing  james held his head in his hands cursing his pitiful weakness why did he not realise in his convalescence that it was but a passing emotion which endeared mary to him he had been so anxious to love her so eager to give happiness to all concerned that he had welcomed the least sign of affection but he knew what love was and there could be no excuse he should have had the courage to resist his gratitude  why should i sacrifice myself he cried my life is as valuable as theirs why should it be always i from whom sacrifice is demanded  but it was no use rebelling marys claims were too strong and if he lived he must satisfy them yet some respite he could not do without away from primpton he might regain his calm james hated london but even that would be better than the horrible oppression the constraint he was forced to put upon himself  he walked up and down the garden for a few minutes to calm down and went in to his mother he spoke as naturally as he could  father tells me that marys weddingdress is nearly ready  yes its a little early but its well to be on the safe side  its just occurred to me that i can hardly be married in rags i think i had better go up to town for a few days to get some things  must you do that  i think so and theres a lot i want to do  oh well i daresay mary wont mind if you dont stay too long but you must take care not to tire yourself     xx   on his second visit to london james was more fortunate for immediately he got inside his club he found an old friend a man named barker late adjutant of his regiment barker had a great deal to tell james of mutual acquaintance and the pair dined together going afterwards to a musichall james felt in better spirits than for some time past and his good humour carried him well into the following day in the afternoon while he was reading a paper barker came up to him  i say old chap he said i quite forgot to tell you yesterday you remember mrs wallace dont youpritchard of that ilk shes in town and in a passion with you she says shes written to you twice and youve taken no notice  really i thought nobody was in town now  she is i forget why she told me a long story but i didnt listen as i knew it would be mostly fibs shes probably up to some mischief lets go round to her place and have tea shall we  i hardly think i can replied james reddening ive got an engagement at four  rotcome on shes just as stunning as ever by gad you should have seen her in her weeds  in her weeds what the devil do you mean  didnt you know p w was bowled over at the beginning of the warafter colenso i think  by godi didnt know i never saw  oh well i didnt know till i came home lets stroll along shall we shes looking out for number two but she wants money so theres no danger for us  james rose mechanically and putting on his hat accompanied barker all unwitting of the thunderblow that his words had been mrs wallace was at home james went upstairs forgetting everything but that the woman he loved was freefree his heart beat so that he could scarcely breathe he was afraid of betraying his agitation and had to make a deliberate effort to contain himself  mrs wallace gave a little cry of surprise on seeing james she had not changed the black gown she wore fashionable but slightly fantastic set off the dazzling olive clearness of her skin and the rich colour of her hair james turned pale with the passion that consumed him he could hardly speak  you wretch she cried her eyes sparkling ive written to you twiceonce to congratulate you and then to ask you to come and see meand you took not the least notice  barker has just told me you wrote i am so sorry  oh well i thought you might not receive the letters ill forgive you  she wore indian anklets on her wrists and a barbaric chain about her neck so that even in the london lodginghouse she preserved a mysterious oriental charm in her movements there was a sinuous feline grace which was delightful and yet rather terrifying one fancied that she was not quite human but some cruel animal turned into the likeness of a woman vague stories floated through the mind of lamia and the unhappy end of her lovers  the three of them began to talk chattering of the old days in india of the war mrs wallace bemoaned her fate in having to stay in town when all smart people had left barker told stories james did not know how he joined in the flippant conversation he wondered at his selfcommand in saying insignificant things in laughing heartily when his whole soul was in a turmoil at length the adjutant went away and james was left alone with mrs wallace  dyou wish me to go he asked you can turn me out if you do  oh i shouldwithout hesitation she retorted laughing but im bored to death and i want you to amuse me  strangely enough james felt that the long absence had created no barrier between them thinking of mrs wallace incessantly sometimes against his will sometimes with a fierce delight holding with her imaginary conversations he felt on the contrary that he knew her far more intimately than he had ever done there seemed to be a link between them as though something had passed which prevented them from ever again becoming strangers james felt he had her confidence and he was able to talk frankly as before in his timidity he had never ventured he treated her with the loving friendliness with which he had been used to treat the imaginary creature of his dreams  you havent changed a bit he said looking at her  did you expect me to be haggard and wrinkled i never let myself grow old one only needs strength of mind to keep young indefinitely  im surprised because youre so exactly as ive thought of you  have you thought of me often  the fire flashed to jamies eyes and it was on his lips to break out passionately telling her how he had lived constantly with her recollection how she had been meat and drink to him life and breath and soul but he restrained himself  sometimes he answered smiling  mrs wallace smiled too  i seem to remember that you vowed once to think of me always  one vows all sorts of things he hoped she could not hear the trembling in his voice  youre very cool friend jimand much less shy than you used to be you were a perfect monster of bashfulness and your conscience was a most alarming animal it used to frighten me out of my wits i hope you keep it now under lock and key like the beasts in the zoo  james was telling himself that it was folly to remain that he must go at once and never return the recollection of mary came back to him in the straw hat and the soiled serge dress sitting in the diningroom with his father and mother she had brought her knitting so as not to waste a minute and while they talked of him her needles clicked rapidly to and fro mrs wallace was lying in a long chair coiled up in a serpentine characteristic attitude every movement wafted to him the oppressive perfume she wore the smile on her lips the caress of her eyes were maddening he loved her more even than he had imagined his love was a fury blind and destroying he repeated to himself that he must fly but the heaviness in his limbs chained him to her side he had no will no strength he was a reed bending to every word she spoke and to every look her fascination was not human the calm voluptuous look of her eyes was too cruel and she was poised like a serpent about to spring  at last however james was obliged to take his leave  ive stayed an unconscionable time  have you ive not noticed it  did she care for him he took her hand to say goodbye and the pressure sent the blood racing through his veins he remembered vividly the passionate embrace of their last farewell he thought then that he should never see her again and it was fate which had carried him to her feet oh how he longed now to take her in his arms and to cover her soft mouth with his kisses  what are you doing this evening she said  nothing  would you like to take me to the carlton you remember you promised  oh that is good of you of course i should like it  at last he could not hide the fire in his heart and the simple words were said so vehemently that mrs wallace looked up in surprise she withdrew the hand which he was still holding  very well you may fetch me at a quarter to eight      after taking mrs wallace home james paced the streets for an hour in a turmoil of wild excitement they had dined at the carlton expensively as was her wish and then driving to the empire james had taken a box through the evening he had scarcely known how to maintain his calm how to prevent himself from telling her all that was in his heart after the misery he had gone through he snatched at happiness with eager grasp determined to enjoy to the full every single moment of it he threw all scruples to the wind he was sick and tired of holding himself in he had checked himself too long and now at all hazards must let himself go bridle and curb now were of no avail he neither could nor would suppress his passion though it devoured him like a raging fire he thought his conscientiousness absurd why could he not like other men take the brief joy of life why could he not gather the roses without caring whether they would quickly fade let me eat drink and be merry he cried for tomorrow i die  it was wednesday and on the saturday he had promised to return to little primpton but he put aside all thought of that except as an incentive to make the most of his time he had wrestled with temptation and been overcome and he gloried in his defeat he would make no further effort to stifle his love his strength had finally deserted him and he had no will to protect himself he would give himself over entirely to his passion and the future might bring what it would  im a fool to torment myself he cried after all what does anything matter but love  mrs wallace was engaged for the afternoon of the next day but she had invited him to dine with her  they feed you abominably at my place she said but ill do my best and we shall be able to talk  until then he would not live and all sorts of wild mad thoughts ran through his head  is there a greater fool on earth than the virtuous prig he muttered savagely  he could not sleep but tossed from side to side thinking ever of the soft hands and the red lips that he so ardently wished to kiss in the morning he sent to half moon street a huge basket of flowers      it was good of you said mrs wallace when he arrived pointing to the roses scattered through the room she wore three in her hair trailing behind one ear in an exotic charming fashion  its only you who could think of wearing them like that  do they make me look very barbaric she was flattered by the admiration in his eyes you certainly have improved since i saw you last  now shall we stay here or go somewhere she asked after dinner when they were smoking cigarettes  let us stay here  mrs wallace began talking the old nonsense which in days past had delighted james it enchanted him to hear her say in the tone of voice he knew so well just those things which he had a thousand times repeated to himself he looked at her with a happy smile his eyes fixed upon her taking in every movement  i dont believe youre listening to a word im saying she cried at last why dont you answer  go on i like to see you talk its long since ive had the chance  you spoke yesterday as though you hadnt missed me much  i didnt mean it you knew i didnt mean it  she smiled mockingly  i thought it doubtful if it had been true you could hardly have said anything so impolite  ive thought of you always thats why i feel i know you so much better now i dont change what i felt once i feel always  i wonder what you mean by that  i mean that i love you as passionately as when last i saw you oh i love you ten times more  and the girl with the bun and the strenuous look you were engaged when i knew you last  james was silent for a moment  im going to be married to her on the 10th of october he said finally in an expressionless voice  you dont say that as if you were wildly enthusiastic  why did you remind me cried james i was so happy oh i hate her  then why on earth are you marrying her  i cant help it i must youve brought it all back how could you be so cruel when i came back from the cape i broke the engagement off i made her utterly miserable and i took all the pleasure out of my poor fathers life i knew id done right i knew that unless i loved her it was madness to marry i felt even that it was unclean oh you dont know how ive argued it all out with myself time after time i was anxious to do right and i felt such a cad i cant escape from my bringingup you cant imagine what are the chains that bind us in england were wrapped from our infancy in the swaddlingclothes of prejudice ignorance and false ideas and when we grow up though we know theyre all absurd and horrible we cant escape from them theyve become part of our very flesh then i grew illi nearly died and mary nursed me devotedly i dont know what came over me i felt so ill and weak i was grateful to her the old self seized me again and i was ashamed of what id done i wanted to make them all happy i asked her again to marry me and she said she would i thought i could love her but i canti cant god help me  jamies passion was growing uncontrollable he walked up and down the room and then threw himself heavily on a chair  oh i know it was weakness i used to pride myself on my strength of mind but im weak im weaker than a woman im a poor reedvacillating uncertain purposeless i dont know my own mind i havent the courage to act according to my convictions im afraid to give pain they all think im brave but im simply a pitiful coward  i feel that mary has entrapped me and i hate her i know she has good qualitiesheaps of thembut i cant see them i only know that the mere touch of her hand curdles my blood she excites absolute physical repulsion in me i cant help it i know its madness to marry her but i cant do anything else i darent inflict a second time the humiliation and misery upon her or the unhappiness upon my people  mrs wallace now was serious  and do you really care for anyone else  he turned savagely upon her  you know i do you know i love you with all my heart and soul you know ive loved you passionately from the first day i saw you didnt you feel even when we were separated that my love was inextinguishable didnt you feel it always with you oh my dear my dear you must have known that death was too weak to touch my love i tried to crush it because neither you nor i was free your husband was my friend i couldnt do anything blackguardly i ran away from you what a fool you must have thought me and now i know that at last we were both free i might have made you love me i had my chance of happiness at last what id longed for cursing myself for treachery had come to pass but i never knew in my weakness i surrendered my freedom o god what shall i do  he hid his face in his hands and groaned with agony mrs wallace was silent for a while  i dont know if it will be any consolation for you she said at last youre sure to know sooner or later and i may as well tell you now im engaged to be married  what cried james springing up its not true its not true  why not of course its true  you cantoh my dearest be kind to me  dont be silly theres a good boy youre going to be married yourself in a month and you really cant expect me to remain single because you fancy you care for me i shouldnt have told you only i thought it would make things easier for you  you never cared two straws for me i knew that you neednt throw it in my face  after all i was a married woman  i wonder how much you minded when you heard your husband was lying dead on the veldt  my dear boy he wasnt he died of fever at durbanquite comfortably in a bed  were you sorry  of course i was he was extremely satisfactoryand not at all exacting  james did not know why he asked the questions they came to his lips unbidden he was sick at heart angry contemptuous  im going to marry a mr bryantbut of course not immediately she went on occupied with her own thoughts and pleased to talk of them  what is he  nothing hes a landed proprietor she said this with a certain pride  james looked at her scornfully his love all through had been mingled with contrary elements and trying to subdue it he had often insisted upon the womans vulgarity and lack of taste and snobbishness he thought bitterly now that the daughter of the portuguese and of the ridingmaster had done very well for herself  really i think youre awfully unreasonable she said you might make yourself pleasant  i cant he said gravely let me go away you dont know what ive felt for you in my madness i fancied that you must realise my love i thought even that you might care for me a little in return  youre quite the nicest boy ive ever known i like you immensely  but you like the landed proprietor better youre very wise he can marry you goodbye  i dont want you to think im horrid she said going up to him and taking his arm it was an instinct with her to caress people and make them fond of her after all its not my fault  have i blamed you im sorry i had no right to  what are you going to do  i dont knowi can always shoot myself if things get unendurable thank god theres always that refuge  oh i hope you wont do anything silly  it would be unlike me james murmured grimly im so dreadfully prosaic and matteroffact goodbye  mrs wallace was really sorry for james and she took his hand affectionately she always thought it cost so little to be amiable  we may never meet again she said but we shall still be friends jim  are you going to say that youll be a sister to me as mary told the curate  wont you kiss me before you go  james shook his head not trusting himself to answer the light in his life had all gone the ray of sunshine was hidden the heavy clouds had closed in and all the rest was darkness but he tried to smile at mrs wallace as he touched her hand he hardly dared look at her again knowing from old experience how every incident and every detail of her person would rise tormentingly before his recollection but at last he pulled himself together  im sorry ive made a fool of myself he said quietly i hope youll be very happy please forget all ive said to you it was only nonsense goodbye ill send you a bit of my weddingcake     xxi   james was again in little primpton ill at ease and unhappy the scene with mrs wallace had broken his spirit and he was listless now indifferent to what happened the world had lost its colour and the sun its light in his quieter moments he had known that it was impossible for her to care anything about him he understood her character fairly well and realised that he had been only a toy a pastime to a woman who needed admiration as the breath of her nostrils but notwithstanding some inner voice had whispered constantly that his love could not be altogether in vain it seemed strong enough to travel the infinite distance to her heart and awaken at least a kindly feeling he was humble and wanted very little sometimes he had even felt sure that he was loved the truth rent his heart and filled it with bitterness the woman who was his whole being had forgotten him and the woman who loved him he hated he tried to read striving to forget but his trouble overpowered him and he could think of nothing but the future dreadful and inevitable the days passed slowly monotonously and as each night came he shuddered at the thought that time was flying he was drifting on without hope tortured and uncertain  oh im so weak he cried im so weak  he knew very well what he should do if he were strong of will a firm man in his place would cut the knot brutallya letter to mary a letter to his people and flight after all why should he sacrifice his life for the sake of others the catastrophe was only partly his fault it was unreasonable that he alone should suffer  if his colonel came to hear of the circumstance and disapproving questioned him he could send in his papers james was bored intensely by the dull routine of regimental life in time of peace it was a question of performing day after day the same rather unnecessary duties seeing the same people listening to the same chatter the same jokes the same chaff and added to the incurable dulness of the mess was the irksome feeling of being merely an overgrown schoolboy at the beck and call of every incompetent and foolish senior life was too short to waste in such solemn trifling masquerading in a ridiculous costume which had to be left at home when any work was to be done but he was young with the world before him there were many careers free to the man who had no fear of death africa opened her dusky arms to the adventurer ruthless and desperate the world was so large and manifold there was ample scope for all his longing if there were difficulties he could overcome them perils would add salt to the attempt freedom would be like strong wine ah that was what he desired freedomfreedom to feel that he was his own master that he was not enchained by the love and hate of others by the ties of convention and of habit every bond was tedious he had nothing to lose and everything to win but just those ties which every man may divide of his own free will are the most oppressive they are unfelt unseen till suddenly they burn the wrists like fetters of fire and the poor wretch who wears them has no power to help himself  james knew he had not strength for this fearless disregard of others he dared not face the pain he would cause he was acting like a fool his kindness was only cowardly but to be cruel required more courage than he possessed if he went away his anguish would never cease his vivid imagination would keep before his minds eye the humiliation of mary the unhappiness of his people he pictured the consternation and the horror when they discovered what he had done at first they would refuse to believe that he was capable of acting in so blackguardly a way they would think it a joke or that he was mad and then the shame when they realised the truth how could he make such a return for all the affection and the gentleness be had received his father whom he loved devotedly would be utterly crushed  it would kill him muttered james  and then he thought of his poor mother affectionate and kind but capable of hating him if he acted contrary to her code of honour her immaculate virtue made her very hard she exacted the highest from herself and demanded no less from others james remembered in his boyhood how she punished his petty crimes by refusing to speak to him going about in cold and angry silence he had never forgotten the icy indignation of her face when once she had caught him lying oh these good people how pitiless they can be  he would never have courage to confront the unknown dangers of a new life unloved unknown unfriended he was too merciful his heart bled at the pain of others he was constantly afraid of soiling his hands it required a more unscrupulous man than he to cut all ties and push out into the world with no weapons but intelligence and a ruthless heart above all he dreaded his remorse he knew that he would brood over what he had done till it attained the proportions of a monomania his conscience would never give him peace so long as he lived the claims of mary would call to him and in the furthermost parts of the earth he would see her silent agony james knew himself too well  and the only solution was that which in a moment of passionate bitterness had come thoughtlessly to his lips  i can always shoot myself  i hope you wont do anything silly mrs wallace had answered  it would be silly after all one has only one life but sometimes one has to do silly things      the whim seized james to visit the larchers and one day he set out for ashford near which they lived he was very modest about his attempt to save their boy and told himself that such courage as it required was purely instinctive he had gone back without realising in the least that there was any danger seeing young larcher wounded and helpless it had seemed the obvious thing to get him to a place of safety in the heat of action fellows were constantly doing reckless things everyone had a sort of idea that he at least would not be hit and james by no means oppressed with his own heroism knew that courageous deeds without number were performed and passed unseen it was a mere chance that the incident in which he took part was noticed  again he had from the beginning an absolute conviction that his interference was nothing less than disastrous probably the boer sharpshooters would have let alone the wounded man and afterwards their doctors would have picked him up and properly attended to him  james could not forget that it was in his very arms that larcher had been killed and he repeated if i had minded my own business he might have been alive to this day it occurred to him also that with his experience he was much more useful than the callow ignorant boy so that to risk his more valuable life to save the others from the point of view of the general good was foolish rather than praiseworthy but it appealed to his sense of irony to receive the honour which he was so little conscious of deserving  the larchers had been anxious to meet james and he was curious to know what they were like there was at the back of his mind also a desire to see how they conducted themselves whether they were still prostrate with grief or reconciled to the inevitable reggie had been an only sonjust as he was james sent no message but arrived unexpectedly and found that they lived some way from the station in a new redbrick villa as he walked to the front door he saw people playing tennis at the side of the house  he asked if mrs larcher was at home and being shown into the drawingroom the lady came to him from the tennislawn he explained who he was  of course i know quite well she said i saw your portrait in the illustrated papers  she shook hands cordially but james fancied she tried to conceal a slight look of annoyance he saw his visit was inopportune  were having a little tennisparty she said it seems a pity to waste the fine weather doesnt it  a shout of laughter came from the lawn and a number of voices were heard talking loudly mrs larcher glanced towards them uneasily she felt that james would expect them to be deeply mourning for the dead son and it was a little incongruous that on his first visit he should find the whole family so boisterously gay  shall we go out to them said mrs larcher were just going to have tea and im sure you must be dying for some if youd let us know you were coming we should have sent to meet you  james had divined that if he came at a fixed hour they would all have tuned their minds to a certain key and he would see nothing of their natural state  they went to the lawn and james was introduced to a pair of buxom healthylooking girls panting a little after their violent exercise they were dressed in white in a rather masculine fashion and the only sign of mourning was the black tie that each wore in a sailors knot they shook hands vigorously it was a family trait and then seemed at a loss for conversation james as was his way did not help them and they plunged at last into a discussion about the weather and the dustiness of the road from ashford to their house  presently a looselimbed young man strolled up and was presented to james he appeared on friendly terms with the two girls who called him bobbikins  how long have you been back he asked i was out in the imperial yeomanryonly i got fever and had to come home  james stiffened himself a little with the instinctive dislike of the regular for the volunteer  oh yes did you go as a trooper  yes and pretty rough it was i can tell you  he began to talk of his experience in a resonant voice apparently wellpleased with himself while the redfaced girls looked at him admiringly james wondered whether the youth intended to marry them both  the conversation was broken by the appearance of mr larcher a rosycheeked and bewhiskered man dapper and suave he had been picking flowers and handed a bouquet to one of his guests james fancied he was a prosperous merchant who had retired and set up as a country gentleman but if he was the least polished of the family he was also the most simple he greeted the visitor very heartily and offered to take him over his new conservatory  my husband takes everyone to the new conservatory said mrs larcher laughing apologetically  its the biggest round ashford explained the worthy man  james thinking he wished to talk of his son consented and as they walked away mr larcher pointed out his fruit trees his pigeons he was a fancier said he and attended to the birds entirely himself then in the conservatory made james admire his orchids and the luxuriance of his maidenhair  i suppose these sort of things grow in the open air at the cape he asked  i believe everything grows there  of his son he said absolutely nothing and presently they rejoined the others the larchers were evidently estimable persons healthyminded and normal but a little common james asked himself why they had invited him if they wished to hear nothing of their boys tragic death could they be so anxious to forget him that every reference was distasteful he wondered how reggie had managed to grow up so simple frank and charming amid these surroundings there was a certain pretentiousness about his people which caused them to escape complete vulgarity only by a hairsbreadth but they appeared anxious to make much of james and in his absence had explained who he was to the remaining visitors and these beheld him now with an awe which the hero found rather comic  mrs larcher invited him to play tennis and when he declined seemed hardly to know what to do with him once when her younger daughter laughed more loudly than usual at the very pointed chaff of the imperial yeoman she slightly frowned at her with a scarcely perceptible but significant glance in jamies direction to her relief however the conversation became general and james found himself talking with miss larcher of the cricket week at canterbury  after all he could not be surprised at the familys general happiness six months had passed since reggies death and they could not remain in perpetual mourning it was very natural that the living should forget the dead otherwise life would be too horrible and it was possibly only the larchers nature to laugh and to talk more loudly than most people james saw that it was a united affectionate household homely and kind cursed with no particular depth of feeling and if they had not resigned themselves to the boys death they were doing their best to forget that he had ever lived it was obviously the best thing and it would be crueltoo cruelto expect people never to regain their cheerfulness  i think i must be off said james after a while the trains run so awkwardly to tunbridge wells  they made polite efforts to detain him but james fancied they were not sorry for him to go  you must come and see us another day when were alone said mrs larcher we want to have a long talk with you  its very kind of you to ask me he replied not committing himself  mrs larcher accompanied him back to the drawingroom followed by her husband  i thought you might like a photograph of reggie she said  this was her first mention of the dead son and her voice neither shook nor had in it any unwonted expression  i should like it very much  it was on jamies tongue to say how fond he had been of the boy and how he regretted his sad end but he restrained himself thinking if the wounds of grief were closed it was cruel and unnecessary to reopen them  mrs larcher found the photograph and gave it to james her husband stood by saying nothing  i think thats the best we have of him  she shook hands and then evidently nerved herself to say something further  were very grateful to you captain parsons for what you did and were glad they gave you the victoria cross  i suppose you didnt bring it today inquired mr larcher  im afraid not  they showed him out of the front door  mind you come and see us again but let us know beforehand if you possibly can      shortly afterwards james received from the larchers a golden cigarettecase with a victoria cross in diamonds on one side and an inscription on the other it was much too magnificent for use evidently expensive and not in very good taste  i wonder whether they take that as equal in value to their son said james  mary was rather dazzled  isnt it beautiful she cried of course its too valuable to use but itll do to put in our drawingroom  dont you think it should be kept under a glass case asked james with his grave smile  itll get so dirty if we leave it out wont it replied mary seriously  i wish there were no inscription it wont fetch so much if we get hardup and have to pop our jewels  oh james cried mary shocked you surely wouldnt do a thing like that  james was pleased to have seen the larchers it satisfied and relieved him to know that human sorrow was not beyond human endurance as the greatest of their gifts the gods have vouchsafed to man a happy forgetfulness  in six months the boys family were able to give parties to laugh and jest as if they had suffered no loss at all and the thought of this cleared his way a little if the worst came to the worstand that desperate step of which he had spoken seemed his only refugehe could take it with less apprehension pain to those he loved was inevitable but it would not last very long and his death would trouble them far less than his dishonour  time was pressing and james still hesitated hoping distractedly for some unforeseen occurrence that would at least delay the marriage the house of death was dark and terrible and he could not walk rashly to its dreadful gates something would surely happen he wanted time to thinktime to see whether there was really no escape how horrible it was that one could know nothing for certain he was torn and rent by his indecision  major forsyth had been put off by several duchesses and was driven to spend a few economical weeks at little primpton he announced that since jamies wedding was so near he would stay till it was over finding also that his nephew had not thought of a best man he offered himself he had acted as such many timesat the most genteel functions and with a pleasant confusion of metaphor assured james that he knew the ropes right down to the ground  three weeks today my boy he said heartily to james one morning on coming down to breakfast  is it replied james  getting excited  wildly  upon my word jamie youre the coolest lover ive ever seen why ive hardly known how to keep in some of the fellows ive been best man to  im feeling a bit seedy today uncle william  james thanked his stars that illhealth was deemed sufficient excuse for all his moodiness mary spared him the rounds among her sick and needy whom notwithstanding the approaching event she would on no account neglect she told uncle william he was not to worry her lover but leave him quietly with his books and no one interfered when he took long solitary walks in the country jamies reading now was a pretence his brain was too confused he was too harassed and uncertain to understand a word and he spent his time face to face with the eternal problem trying to see a way out when before him was an impassable wall still hoping blindly that something would happen some catastrophe which should finish at once all his perplexities and everything else besides     xxii   in solitary walks james had found his only consolation he knew even in that populous district unfrequented parts where he could wander without fear of interruption among the trees and the flowers in the broad meadows he forgot himself and his senses sharpened by long absence he learnt for the first time the exquisite charm of english country he loved the spring with its yellow countless buttercups spread over the green fields like a cloth of gold whereon might fitly walk the angels of messer perugino the colours were so delicate that one could not believe it possible for paints and paintbrush to reproduce them the atmosphere visibly surrounded things softening their outlines sometimes from a hill higher than the rest james looked down at the plain bathed in golden sunlight the fields of corn the fields of clover the roads and the rivulets formed themselves in that flood of light into an harmonious pattern luminous and ethereal a pleasant reverie filled his mind unanalysable a waking dream of halfvoluptuous sensation  on the other side of the common james knew a wood of tall fir trees dark and ragged their sombre green veiled in a silvery mist as though like a chill vapour the hoarfrost of a hundred winters still lingered among their branches at the edge of the hill up which they climbed in serried hundreds stood here and there an oak tree just bursting into leaf clothed with its newborn verdure like the bride of the young god spring and the everlasting youth of the oak trees contrasted wonderfully with the undying age of the firs then later in the height of the summer james found the pine wood cool and silent fitting his humour it was like the forest of life the grey and sombre labyrinth where wandered the poet of hell and death the tall trees rose straight and slender like the barren masts of sailing ships the gentle aromatic odour the light subdued the purple mist so faint as to be scarcely discernible a mere tinge of warmth in the dayall gave him an exquisite sense of rest here he could forget his trouble and give himself over to the love which seemed his real life here the recollection of mrs wallace gained flesh and blood seeming so real that he almost stretched out his arms to seize her his footfall on the brown needles was noiseless and the tread was soft and easy the odours filled him like an eastern drug with drowsy intoxication  but all that now was gone when unbidden the wellknown laugh rang again in his ears or he felt on his hands the touch of the slender fingers james turned away with a gesture of distaste now mrs wallace brought him only bitterness and he tortured himself insanely trying to forget her with tenfold force the sensation returned which had so terribly oppressed him before his illness he felt that nature had become intolerably monotonous the circumscribed prim country was horrible on every inch of it the hand of man was apparent it was a prison and his hands and feet were chained with heavy iron the dark immovable clouds were piled upon one another in giant massesso distinct and sharply cut so rounded that one almost saw the impressure of the fingers of some titanic sculptor and they hung low down overwhelming so that james could scarcely breathe the sombre elms were too wellordered the meadows too carefully tended all round the hills were dark and drear and that very fertility that fat kentish luxuriance added to the oppression it was a task impossible to escape from that iron circle all power of flight abandoned him oh he loathed it  the past centuries of people living in a certain way with certain standards influenced by certain emotions were too strong for him james was like a foolish birda bird born in a cage without power to attain its freedom his lust for a free life was futile he acknowledged with cruel selfcontempt that he was weaker than a womanineffectual he could not lead the life of his little circle purposeless and untrue and yet he had not power to lead a life of his own uncertain vacillating torn between the old and the new his reason led him his conscience drew him back but the ties of his birth and ancestry were too strong he had not the energy even of the poor tramp who carries with him his whole fortune and leaves in the lap of the gods the uncertain future james envied with all his heart the beggar boy wandering homeless and penniless but free he at least had not these inhuman fetters which it was death to suffer and death to cast off he indeed could make the world his servant freedom freedom if one were only unconscious of captivity what would it matter it is the knowledge that kills and james walked again by the neat iron railing which enclosed the fields his head aching with the rigidity and decorum wishing vainly for just one piece of barren unkept land to remind him that all the world was not a prison  already the autumn had come the rich mouldering colours were like an air melancholy with the approach of inevitable death but in those passionate tints in the red and gold of the apples in the many tones of the firstfallen leaves there was still something which forbade one to forget that in the death and decay of nature there was always the beginning of other life yet to james the autumn heralded death with no consoling afterthought he had nothing to live for since he knew that mrs wallace could never love him his love for her had borne him up and sustained him but now it was hateful and despicable after all his life was his own to do what he liked with the love of others had no right to claim his selfrespect if he had duties to them he had duties to himself also and more vehemently than ever james felt that such a union as was before him could only be a degradation he repeated with new emotion that marriage without love was prostitution if death was the only way in which he could keep clean that body ignorantly despised why he was not afraid of death he had seen it too often for the thought to excite alarm it was but a common mechanical process quickly finished and not more painful than could be borne the flesh is all which is certainly immortal the dissolution of consciousness is the signal of new birth out of corruption springs fresh life like the roses from a roman tomb and the body one with the earth pursues the eternal round  but one day james told himself impatiently that all these thoughts were mad and foolish he could only have them because he was still out of health life after all was the most precious thing in the world it was absurd to throw it away like a broken toy he rebelled against the fate which seemed forcing itself upon him he determined to make the effort and come what might break the hateful bonds it only required a little courage a little strength of mind if others suffered he had suffered too the sacrifice they demanded was too great but when he returned to primpton house the inevitability of it all forced itself once again upon him he shrugged his shoulders despairingly it was no good  the whole atmosphere oppressed him so that he felt powerless some hidden influence surrounded james sucking from his blood as it were all manliness dulling his brain he became a mere puppet acting in accordance to principles that were not his own automatic willless his father sat as ever in the diningroom by the fire for only in the warmest weather could he do without artificial heat and he read the paper sometimes aloud making little comments his mother at the table on a stiffbacked chair was knittingeverlastingly knitting outwardly there was in them a placid content and a gentleness which made them seem pliant as wax but really they were iron james knew at last how pitiless was their love how inhumanly cruel their intolerance and of the two his father seemed more implacable more horribly relentless his mothers anger was bearable but the colonels very weakness was a deadly weapon his despair his dumb sorrow his entire dependence on the forbearance of others were more tyrannical than the most despotic power james was indeed a bird beating himself against the imprisoning cage and its bars were lovingkindness and trust tears silent distress bitter disillusion and old age  wheres mary asked james  shes in the garden walking with uncle william  how well they get on together said the colonel smiling  james looked at his father and thought he had never seen him so old and feeble his hands were almost transparent his thin white hair his bowed shoulders gave an impression of utter weakness  are you very glad the wedding is so near father asked james placing his hand gently on the old mans shoulder  i should think i was  you want to get rid of me so badly  a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh we shall have to do without you  i wonder whether you are fonder of mary than of me  the colonel did not answer but mrs parsons laughed  my impression is that your father has grown so devoted to mary that he hardly thinks you worthy of her  really and yet you want me to marry her dont you daddy  its the wish of my heart  were you very wretched when our engagement was broken off  dont talk of it now its all settled jamie i can tell you that id sooner see you dead at my feet than that you should break your word to mary  james laughed  and you mother he asked lightly  she did not answer but looked at him earnestly  what you too would you rather see me dead than not married to mary what a bloodthirsty pair you are  james laughing spoke so gaily it never dawned on them that his words meant more than was obvious and yet he felt that they loving but implacable had signed his deathwarrant with smiling faces they had thrown open the portals of that house and he smiling was ready to enter  mary at that moment came in followed by uncle william  well jamie there you are she cried in that hard metallic voice which to james betrayed so obviously the meanness of her spirit and her selfcomplacency where on earth have you been  she stood by the table straight uncompromising selfreliant by her immaculate virtue by the strength of her narrow will she completely domineered the others she felt herself capable of managing them all and in fact had been giving uncle william a friendly little lecture upon some action of which she disapproved mary had left off her summer things and wore again the plain serge skirt and because it was rainy the battered straw hat of the preceding winter she was using up her old things and having got all possible wear out of them intended on the day before her marriage generously to distribute them among the poor  is my face very red she asked theres a lot of wind today  to james she had never seemed more unfeminine that physical repulsion which at first had terrified him now was grown into an ungovernable hate everything mary did irritated and exasperated him he wondered she did not see the hatred in his eyes as he looked at her answering her question  oh no he said to himself i would rather shoot myself than marry you  his dislike was unreasonable but he could not help it and the devotion of his parents made him detest her all the more he could not imagine what they saw in her with hostile glance he watched her movements as she took off her hat and arranged her hair grimly drawn back and excessively neat she fetched her knitting from mrs parsonss workbasket and sat down all her actions had in them an insufferable air of patronage and she seemed more than usually pleased with herself james had an insane desire to hurt her to ruffle that selfsatisfaction and he wanted to say something that should wound her to the quick and all the time he laughed and jested as though he were in the highest spirits  and what were you doing this morning mary asked colonel parsons  oh i biked in to tunbridge wells with mr dryland to play golf he plays a rattling good game  did he beat you  well no she answered modestly it so happened that i beat him but he took his thrashing remarkably wellsome men get so angry when theyre beaten by a girl  the curate has many virtues said james  he was talking about you jamie he said he thought you disliked him but i told him i was certain you didnt hes really such a good man one cant help liking him he said hed like to teach you golf  and is he going to  certainly not i mean to do that myself  there are many things you want to teach me mary youll have your hands full  oh by the way father told me to remind you and uncle william that you were shooting with him the day after tomorrow youre to fetch him at ten  i hadnt forgotten replied james uncle william we shall have to clean our guns tomorrow  james had come to a decision at last and meant to waste no time indeed there was none to waste and to remind him how near was the date fixed for the wedding were the preparations almost complete one or two presents had already arrived with all his heart he thanked his father and mother for having made the way easier for him he thought what he was about to do the kindest thing both to them and to mary under no circumstances could he marry her that would be adding a greater lie to those which he had already been forced into and the misery was more than he could bear but his death was the only other way of satisfying her undoubted claims he had little doubt that in six months he would be as well forgotten as poor reggie larcher and he did not care he was sick of the whole business and wanted the quiet of death his love for mrs wallace would never give him peace upon earth it was utterly futile and yet unconquerable  james saw his opportunity in colonel clibborns invitation to shoot he was most anxious to make the affair seem accidental and that in cleaning his gun was easy he had been wounded before and knew that the pain was not very great he had therefore nothing to fear  now at last he regained his spirits he did not read or walk but spent the day talking with his father he wished the last impression he would leave to be as charming as possible and took great pains to appear at his best  he slept well that night and in the morning dressed himself with unusual care at primpton house they breakfasted at eight and afterwards james smoked his pipe reading the newspaper he was a little astonished at his calm for doubt no longer assailed him and the indecision which paralysed all his faculties had disappeared  it is the beginning of my freedom he thought all human interests had abandoned him except a vague sensation of amusement he saw the humour of the comedy he was acting and dispassionately approved himself because he did not give way to histrionics  well uncle william he said at last what dyou say to setting to work on our guns  im always ready for everything said major forsyth  come on then  they went into what they called the harnessroom and james began carefully to clean his gun  i think ill take my coat off he said i can work better without  the gun had not been used for several months and james had a good deal to do he leant over and rubbed a little rust off the lock  upon my word said uncle william ive never seen anyone handle a gun so carelessly as you dyou call yourself a soldier  i am a bit slack replied james laughing people are always telling me that  well take care for goodness sake it may be loaded  oh no theres no danger its not loaded and besides its locked  still you oughtnt to hold it like that  it would be rather comic if i killed myself accidentally i wonder what mary would say  well youve escaped death so often by the skin of your teeth i think youre pretty safe from everything but old age  presently james turned to his uncle  i say this is rotten oil i wish we could get some fresh  i was just thinking that  well youre a pal of the cook go and ask her for some theres a good chap  shell do anything for me said major forsyth with a selfsatisfied smile it was his opinion that no woman countess or scullerymaid could resist his fascinations and taking the cup he trotted off  james immediately went to the cupboard and took out a cartridge he slipped it in rested the butt on the ground pointed the barrel to his heart andfired     epilogue   a letter from mrs clibborn to general sir charles clow kcb 8 gladhorn terrace bath       dear charlesi am so glad to hear you are settled in your new      house in bath and it is most kind to ask us down i am devoted      to bath one meets such nice people there and all ones friends      whom one knew centuries ago it is such a comfort to see how      fearfully old theyre looking i dont know whether we can manage      to accept your kind invitation but i must say i should be glad of      a change after the truly awful things that have happened here i      have been dreadfully upset all the winter and have had several      touches of rheumatism which is a thing i never suffered from      before       i wrote and told you of the sudden and mysterious death of poor      james parsons a fortnight before he was going to marry my dear      mary he shot himself accidentally while cleaning a gunthat is to      say every one thinks it was an accident but i am certain it      was nothing of the kind ever since the dreadful thing      happenedsix months agoit has been on my conscience and i      assure you that the whole time i have not slept a wink my      sufferings have been horrible you will be surprised at the      change in me i am beginning to look like an old woman i tell      you this in strict confidence i believe he committed suicide he      confessed that he loved me charles of course i told him i was      old enough to be his mother but love is blind when i think of the      tragic end of poor algy turner who poisoned himself in india for      my sake i dont know how i shall ever forgive myself i never gave      james the least encouragement and when he said that he loved me i      was so taken aback that i nearly fainted i am convinced that he      shot himself rather than marry a woman he did not love and what is      more my daughter you can imagine my feelings i have taken care      not to breathe a word of this to reginald whose gout is making him      more irritable every day or to anyone else so no one suspects the      truth       but i shall never get over it i could not bear to think of poor      algy turner and now i have on my head as well the blood of james      parsons they were dear boys both of them i think i am the only      one who is really sorry for him if it had been my son who was      killed i should either have gone raving mad or had hysterics for      a week but mrs parsons merely said the lord has given and the      lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord i cannot      help thinking it was rather profane and most unfeeling i was      dreadfully upset and mary had to sit up with me for several      nights i dont believe mary really loved him i hate to say      anything against my own daughter but i feel bound to tell the      truth and my private opinion is that she loved herself better      she loved her constancy and the good opinion of little primpton      the fuss the parsons have made of her im sure is very bad for      anyone it cant be good for a girl to be given way to so much and      i never really liked the parsons theyre very good people of      course but only infantry       i am happy to say that poor jamies death was almost      instantaneous when they found him he said it was an accident i      didnt know the gun was loaded most improbable i think its      wonderful how theyve all been taken in but then they didnt know      his secret a few minutes later just before he died he said      tell mary shes to marry the curate       if my betrothed had died nothing would have induced me to marry      anybody else i would have remained an old maid but so few      people have any really nice feeling mr dryland the curate      had already proposed to mary and she had refused him he is a      pleasantspoken young man with a rather fine presencenot my      ideal at all but that of course doesnt matter well a month      after the funeral mary told me that he had asked her again and      she had declined i think it was very bad taste on his part but      mary said she thought it most noble       it appears that colonel and mrs parsons both pressed her very      much to accept the curate they said it was jamies dying wish and      that his last thought had been for her happiness there is no doubt      that mr dryland is an excellent young man but if the parsons had      really loved their son they would never have advised mary to get      married i think it was most heartless       well a few days ago mr dryland came and told us that he had      been appointed vicar of stone fairley in kent i went to see mrs      jackson the wife of our vicar and she looked it out in the clergy      list the stipend is £300 a year and i am told that there is a      good house of course its not very much but better than nothing      this morning mr dryland called and asked for a private interview      with mary he said he must of course leave little primpton and      his vicarage would sadly want a mistress and finally for the      third time begged her on his bended knees to marry her he had      previously been to the parsons and the colonel sent for mary and      told her that he hoped she would not refuse mr dryland for their      sake and that they thought it was her duty to marry the result is      that mary accepted him and is to be married very quietly by      special license in a month the widow of the late incumbent of      stone fairley moves out in six weeks so this will give them time      for a fortnights honeymoon before settling down they think of      spending it in paris       i think on the whole it is as good a match as poor mary could      expect to make the stipend is paid by the ecclesiastical      commissioners which of course is much safer than glebe she is      no longer a young girl and i think it was her last chance      although she is my own daughter i cannot help confessing that she      is not the sort of girl that wears well she has always been      plainno one would think she was my daughterand as time goes      on she will grow plainer when i was eighteen my mothers maid      used to say why miss theres many a married woman of thirty who      would be proud to have your bust but our poor dear mary has      no figure she will do excellently for the wife of a country      vicar shes so fond of giving people advice and of looking after      the poor and it wont matter that shes dowdy she has no idea of      dressing herself although ive always done my best for her       mr dryland is of course in the seventh heaven of delight he      has gone into tunbridge wells to get a ring and as an engagement      present has just sent round a complete edition of the works of mr      hall caine he is evidently generous i think they will suit one      another very well and i am glad to get my only daughter married      she was always rather a tie on reginald and me we are so devoted      to one another that a third person has often seemed a little in the      way although you would not believe it and we have been married      for nearly thirty years nothing gives us more happiness than to      sit holding one anothers hands i have always been sentimental      and i am not ashamed to own it reggie is sometimes afraid that i      shall get an attack of my rheumatism when we sit out together at      night but i always take care to wrap myself up well and i      invariably make him put a muffler on       give my kindest regards to your wife and tell her i hope to see      her soonyours very sincerely  clara de tulleville clibborn    the end  printed by cowan  co limited perth
