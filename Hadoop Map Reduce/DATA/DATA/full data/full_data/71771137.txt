71771137	main street  by sinclair lewis    to james branch cabell and joseph hergesheimer     this is americaa town of a few thousand in a region of wheat and corn and dairies and little groves  the town is in our tale called gopher prairie minnesota but its main street is the continuation of main streets everywhere the story would be the same in ohio or montana in kansas or kentucky or illinois and not very differently would it be told up york state or in the carolina hills  main street is the climax of civilization that this ford car might stand in front of the bon ton store hannibal invaded rome and erasmus wrote in oxford cloisters what ole jenson the grocer says to ezra stowbody the banker is the new law for london prague and the unprofitable isles of the sea whatsoever ezra does not know and sanction that thing is heresy worthless for knowing and wicked to consider  our railway station is the final aspiration of architecture sam clarks annual hardware turnover is the envy of the four counties which constitute gods country in the sensitive art of the rosebud movie palace there is a message and humor strictly moral  such is our comfortable tradition and sure faith would he not betray himself an alien cynic who should otherwise portray main street or distress the citizens by speculating whether there may not be other faiths    chapter i  i  on a hill by the mississippi where chippewas camped two generations ago a girl stood in relief against the cornflower blue of northern sky she saw no indians now she saw flourmills and the blinking windows of skyscrapers in minneapolis and st paul nor was she thinking of squaws and portages and the yankee furtraders whose shadows were all about her she was meditating upon walnut fudge the plays of brieux the reasons why heels run over and the fact that the chemistry instructor had stared at the new coiffure which concealed her ears  a breeze which had crossed a thousand miles of wheatlands bellied her taffeta skirt in a line so graceful so full of animation and moving beauty that the heart of a chance watcher on the lower road tightened to wistfulness over her quality of suspended freedom she lifted her arms she leaned back against the wind her skirt dipped and flared a lock blew wild a girl on a hilltop credulous plastic young drinking the air as she longed to drink life the eternal aching comedy of expectant youth  it is carol milford fleeing for an hour from blodgett college  the days of pioneering of lassies in sunbonnets and bears killed with axes in piney clearings are deader now than camelot and a rebellious girl is the spirit of that bewildered empire called the american middlewest    ii   blodgett college is on the edge of minneapolis it is a bulwark of sound religion it is still combating the recent heresies of voltaire darwin and robert ingersoll pious families in minnesota iowa wisconsin the dakotas send their children thither and blodgett protects them from the wickedness of the universities but it secretes friendly girls young men who sing and one lady instructress who really likes milton and carlyle so the four years which carol spent at blodgett were not altogether wasted the smallness of the school the fewness of rivals permitted her to experiment with her perilous versatility she played tennis gave chafingdish parties took a graduate seminar in the drama went twosing and joined half a dozen societies for the practise of the arts or the tense stalking of a thing called general culture  in her class there were two or three prettier girls but none more eager she was noticeable equally in the classroom grind and at dances though out of the three hundred students of blodgett scores recited more accurately and dozens bostoned more smoothly every cell of her body was alivethin wrists quinceblossom skin ingenue eyes black hair  the other girls in her dormitory marveled at the slightness of her body when they saw her in sheer negligee or darting out wet from a showerbath she seemed then but half as large as they had supposed a fragile child who must be cloaked with understanding kindness psychic the girls whispered and spiritual yet so radioactive were her nerves so adventurous her trust in rather vaguely conceived sweetness and light that she was more energetic than any of the hulking young women who with calves bulging in heavyribbed woolen stockings beneath decorous blue serge bloomers thuddingly galloped across the floor of the gym in practise for the blodgett ladies basketball team  even when she was tired her dark eyes were observant she did not yet know the immense ability of the world to be casually cruel and proudly dull but if she should ever learn those dismaying powers her eyes would never become sullen or heavy or rheumily amorous  for all her enthusiasms for all the fondness and the crushes which she inspired carols acquaintances were shy of her when she was most ardently singing hymns or planning deviltry she yet seemed gently aloof and critical she was credulous perhaps a born heroworshipper yet she did question and examine unceasingly whatever she might become she would never be static  her versatility ensnared her by turns she hoped to discover that she had an unusual voice a talent for the piano the ability to act to write to manage organizations always she was disappointed but always she effervesced anewover the student volunteers who intended to become missionaries over painting scenery for the dramatic club over soliciting advertisements for the college magazine  she was on the peak that sunday afternoon when she played in chapel out of the dusk her violin took up the organ theme and the candlelight revealed her in a straight golden frock her arm arched to the bow her lips serious every man fell in love then with religion and carol  throughout senior year she anxiously related all her experiments and partial successes to a career daily on the library steps or in the hall of the main building the coeds talked of what shall we do when we finish college even the girls who knew that they were going to be married pretended to be considering important business positions even they who knew that they would have to work hinted about fabulous suitors as for carol she was an orphan her only near relative was a vanillaflavored sister married to an optician in st paul she had used most of the money from her fathers estate she was not in lovethat is not often nor ever long at a time she would earn her living  but how she was to earn it how she was to conquer the worldalmost entirely for the worlds own goodshe did not see most of the girls who were not betrothed meant to be teachers of these there were two sorts careless young women who admitted that they intended to leave the beastly classroom and grubby children the minute they had a chance to marry and studious sometimes bulbousbrowed and popeyed maidens who at class prayermeetings requested god to guide their feet along the paths of greatest usefulness neither sort tempted carol the former seemed insincere a favorite word of hers at this era the earnest virgins were she fancied as likely to do harm as to do good by their faith in the value of parsing caesar  at various times during senior year carol finally decided upon studying law writing motionpicture scenarios professional nursing and marrying an unidentified hero  then she found a hobby in sociology  the sociology instructor was new he was married and therefore taboo but he had come from boston he had lived among poets and socialists and jews and millionaire uplifters at the university settlement in new york and he had a beautiful white strong neck he led a giggling class through the prisons the charity bureaus the employment agencies of minneapolis and st paul trailing at the end of the line carol was indignant at the prodding curiosity of the others their manner of staring at the poor as at a zoo she felt herself a great liberator she put her hand to her mouth her forefinger and thumb quite painfully pinching her lower lip and frowned and enjoyed being aloof  a classmate named stewart snyder a competent bulky young man in a gray flannel shirt a rusty black bow tie and the greenandpurple class cap grumbled to her as they walked behind the others in the muck of the south st paul stockyards these college chumps make me tired theyre so toplofty they ought to of worked on the farm the way i have these workmen put it all over them  i just love common workmen glowed carol  only you dont want to forget that common workmen dont think theyre common  youre right i apologize carols brows lifted in the astonishment of emotion in a glory of abasement her eyes mothered the world stewart snyder peered at her he rammed his large red fists into his pockets he jerked them out he resolutely got rid of them by clenching his hands behind him and he stammered  i know you get people most of these darn coedssay carol you could do a lot for people  ohoh wellyou knowsympathy and everythingif you weresay you were a lawyers wife youd understand his clients im going to be a lawyer i admit i fall down in sympathy sometimes i get so doggone impatient with people that cant stand the gaff youd be good for a fellow that was too serious make him moremoreyou knowsympathetic  his slightly pouting lips his mastiff eyes were begging her to beg him to go on she fled from the steamroller of his sentiment she cried oh see those poor sheepmillions and millions of them she darted on  stewart was not interesting he hadnt a shapely white neck and he had never lived among celebrated reformers she wanted just now to have a cell in a settlementhouse like a nun without the bother of a black robe and be kind and read bernard shaw and enormously improve a horde of grateful poor  the supplementary reading in sociology led her to a book on villageimprovementtreeplanting town pageants girls clubs it had pictures of greens and gardenwalls in france new england pennsylvania she had picked it up carelessly with a slight yawn which she patted down with her fingertips as delicately as a cat  she dipped into the book lounging on her windowseat with her slim lislestockinged legs crossed and her knees up under her chin she stroked a satin pillow while she read about her was the clothy exuberance of a blodgett college room cretonnecovered windowseat photographs of girls a carbon print of the coliseum a chafingdish and a dozen pillows embroidered or beaded or pyrographed shockingly out of place was a miniature of the dancing bacchante it was the only trace of carol in the room she had inherited the rest from generations of girl students  it was as a part of all this commonplaceness that she regarded the treatise on villageimprovement but she suddenly stopped fidgeting she strode into the book she had fled halfway through it before the three oclock bell called her to the class in english history  she sighed thats what ill do after college ill get my hands on one of these prairie towns and make it beautiful be an inspiration i suppose id better become a teacher then buti wont be that kind of a teacher i wont drone why should they have all the garden suburbs on long island nobody has done anything with the ugly towns here in the northwest except hold revivals and build libraries to contain the elsie books ill make em put in a village green and darling cottages and a quaint main street  thus she triumphed through the class which was a typical blodgett contest between a dreary teacher and unwilling children of twenty won by the teacher because his opponents had to answer his questions while their treacherous queries he could counter by demanding have you looked that up in the library well then suppose you do  the history instructor was a retired minister he was sarcastic today he begged of sporting young mr charley holmberg now charles would it interrupt your undoubtedly fascinating pursuit of that malevolent fly if i were to ask you to tell us that you do not know anything about king john he spent three delightful minutes in assuring himself of the fact that no one exactly remembered the date of magna charta  carol did not hear him she was completing the roof of a halftimbered town hall she had found one man in the prairie village who did not appreciate her picture of winding streets and arcades but she had assembled the town council and dramatically defeated him    iii   though she was minnesotaborn carol was not an intimate of the prairie villages her father the smiling and shabby the learned and teasingly kind had come from massachusetts and through all her childhood he had been a judge in mankato which is not a prairie town but in its gardensheltered streets and aisles of elms is white and green new england reborn mankato lies between cliffs and the minnesota river hard by traverse des sioux where the first settlers made treaties with the indians and the cattlerustlers once came galloping before hellforleather posses  as she climbed along the banks of the dark river carol listened to its fables about the wide land of yellow waters and bleached buffalo bones to the west the southern levees and singing darkies and palm trees toward which it was forever mysteriously gliding and she heard again the startled bells and thick puffing of highstacked river steamers wrecked on sandreefs sixty years ago along the decks she saw missionaries gamblers in tall pot hats and dakota chiefs with scarlet blankets    far off whistles at night round the river bend plunking paddles reechoed by the pines and a glow on black sliding waters  carols family were selfsufficient in their inventive life with christmas a rite full of surprises and tenderness and dressingup parties spontaneous and joyously absurd the beasts in the milford hearthmythology were not the obscene night animals who jump out of closets and eat little girls but beneficent and brighteyed creaturesthe tam htab who is woolly and blue and lives in the bathroom and runs rapidly to warm small feet the ferruginous oil stove who purrs and knows stories and the skitamarigg who will play with children before breakfast if they spring out of bed and close the window at the very first line of the song about puellas which father sings while shaving  judge milfords pedagogical scheme was to let the children read whatever they pleased and in his brown library carol absorbed balzac and rabelais and thoreau and max muller he gravely taught them the letters on the backs of the encyclopedias and when polite visitors asked about the mental progress of the little ones they were horrified to hear the children earnestly repeating aand andaus ausbis biscal calcha  carols mother died when she was nine her father retired from the judiciary when she was eleven and took the family to minneapolis there he died two years after her sister a busy proper advisory soul older than herself had become a stranger to her even when they lived in the same house  from those early brown and silver days and from her independence of relatives carol retained a willingness to be different from brisk efficient bookignoring people an instinct to observe and wonder at their bustle even when she was taking part in it but she felt approvingly as she discovered her career of townplanning she was now roused to being brisk and efficient herself    iv   in a month carols ambition had clouded her hesitancy about becoming a teacher had returned she was not she worried strong enough to endure the routine and she could not picture herself standing before grinning children and pretending to be wise and decisive but the desire for the creation of a beautiful town remained when she encountered an item about smalltown womens clubs or a photograph of a straggling main street she was homesick for it she felt robbed of her work  it was the advice of the professor of english which led her to study professional librarywork in a chicago school her imagination carved and colored the new plan she saw herself persuading children to read charming fairy tales helping young men to find books on mechanics being ever so courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapersthe light of the library an authority on books invited to dinners with poets and explorers reading a paper to an association of distinguished scholars    v   the last faculty reception before commencement in five days they would be in the cyclone of final examinations  the house of the president had been massed with palms suggestive of polite undertaking parlors and in the library a tenfoot room with a globe and the portraits of whittier and martha washington the student orchestra was playing carmen and madame butterfly carol was dizzy with music and the emotions of parting she saw the palms as a jungle the pinkshaded electric globes as an opaline haze and the eyeglassed faculty as olympians she was melancholy at sight of the mousey girls with whom she had always intended to get acquainted and the half dozen young men who were ready to fall in love with her  but it was stewart snyder whom she encouraged he was so much manlier than the others he was an even warm brown like his new readymade suit with its padded shoulders she sat with him and with two cups of coffee and a chicken patty upon a pile of presidential overshoes in the coatcloset under the stairs and as the thin music seeped in stewart whispered  i cant stand it this breaking up after four years the happiest years of life  she believed it oh i know to think that in just a few days well be parting and well never see some of the bunch again  carol you got to listen to me you always duck when i try to talk seriously to you but you got to listen to me im going to be a big lawyer maybe a judge and i need you and id protect you  his arm slid behind her shoulders the insinuating music drained her independence she said mournfully would you take care of me she touched his hand it was warm solid  you bet i would wed have lord wed have bully times in yankton where im going to settle  but i want to do something with life  whats better than making a comfy home and bringing up some cute kids and knowing nice homey people  it was the immemorial male reply to the restless woman thus to the young sappho spake the melonvenders thus the captains to zenobia and in the damp cave over gnawed bones the hairy suitor thus protested to the woman advocate of matriarchy in the dialect of blodgett college but with the voice of sappho was carols answer  of course i know i suppose thats so honestly i do love children but theres lots of women that can do housework but iwell if you have got a college education you ought to use it for the world  i know but you can use it just as well in the home and gee carol just think of a bunch of us going out on an auto picnic some nice spring evening  yes  and sleighriding in winter and going fishing  blarrrrrrr the orchestra had crashed into the soldiers chorus and she was protesting no no youre a dear but i want to do things i dont understand myself but i wanteverything in the world maybe i cant sing or write but i know i can be an influence in library work just suppose i encouraged some boy and he became a great artist i will i will do it stewart dear i cant settle down to nothing but dishwashing  two minutes latertwo hectic minutesthey were disturbed by an embarrassed couple also seeking the idyllic seclusion of the overshoecloset  after graduation she never saw stewart snyder again she wrote to him once a weekfor one month    vi   a year carol spent in chicago her study of librarycataloguing recording books of reference was easy and not too somniferous she reveled in the art institute in symphonies and violin recitals and chamber music in the theater and classic dancing she almost gave up library work to become one of the young women who dance in cheesecloth in the moonlight she was taken to a certified studio party with beer cigarettes bobbed hair and a russian jewess who sang the internationale it cannot be reported that carol had anything significant to say to the bohemians she was awkward with them and felt ignorant and she was shocked by the free manners which she had for years desired but she heard and remembered discussions of freud romain rolland syndicalism the confederation generale du travail feminism vs haremism chinese lyrics nationalization of mines christian science and fishing in ontario  she went home and that was the beginning and end of her bohemian life  the second cousin of carols sisters husband lived in winnetka and once invited her out to sunday dinner she walked back through wilmette and evanston discovered new forms of suburban architecture and remembered her desire to recreate villages she decided that she would give up library work and by a miracle whose nature was not very clearly revealed to her turn a prairie town into georgian houses and japanese bungalows  the next day in library class she had to read a theme on the use of the cumulative index and she was taken so seriously in the discussion that she put off her career of townplanningand in the autumn she was in the public library of st paul    vii   carol was not unhappy and she was not exhilarated in the st paul library she slowly confessed that she was not visibly affecting lives she did at first put into her contact with the patrons a willingness which should have moved worlds but so few of these stolid worlds wanted to be moved when she was in charge of the magazine room the readers did not ask for suggestions about elevated essays they grunted wanta find the leather goods gazette for last february when she was giving out books the principal query was can you tell me of a good light exciting love story to read my husbands going away for a week  she was fond of the other librarians proud of their aspirations and by the chance of propinquity she read scores of books unnatural to her gay white littleness volumes of anthropology with ditches of footnotes filled with heaps of small dusty type parisian imagistes hindu recipes for curry voyages to the solomon isles theosophy with modern american improvements treatises upon success in the realestate business she took walks and was sensible about shoes and diet and never did she feel that she was living  she went to dances and suppers at the houses of college acquaintances sometimes she onestepped demurely sometimes in dread of lifes slipping past she turned into a bacchanal her tender eyes excited her throat tense as she slid down the room  during her three years of library work several men showed diligent interest in herthe treasurer of a furmanufacturing firm a teacher a newspaper reporter and a petty railroad official none of them made her more than pause in thought for months no male emerged from the mass then at the marburys she met dr will kennicott    chapter ii  it was a frail and blue and lonely carol who trotted to the flat of the johnson marburys for sunday evening supper mrs marbury was a neighbor and friend of carols sister mr marbury a traveling representative of an insurance company they made a specialty of sandwichsaladcoffee lap suppers and they regarded carol as their literary and artistic representative she was the one who could be depended upon to appreciate the caruso phonograph record and the chinese lantern which mr marbury had brought back as his present from san francisco carol found the marburys admiring and therefore admirable  this september sunday evening she wore a net frock with a pale pink lining a nap had soothed away the faint lines of tiredness beside her eyes she was young naive stimulated by the coolness she flung her coat at the chair in the hall of the flat and exploded into the greenplush livingroom the familiar group were trying to be conversational she saw mr marbury a woman teacher of gymnastics in a high school a chief clerk from the great northern railway offices a young lawyer but there was also a stranger a thick tall man of thirtysix or seven with stolid brown hair lips used to giving orders eyes which followed everything goodnaturedly and clothes which you could never quite remember  mr marbury boomed carol come over here and meet doc kennicottdr will kennicott of gopher prairie he does all our insuranceexamining up in that neck of the woods and they do say hes some doctor  as she edged toward the stranger and murmured nothing in particular carol remembered that gopher prairie was a minnesota wheatprairie town of something over three thousand people  pleased to meet you stated dr kennicott his hand was strong the palm soft but the back weathered showing golden hairs against firm red skin  he looked at her as though she was an agreeable discovery she tugged her hand free and fluttered i must go out to the kitchen and help mrs marbury she did not speak to him again till after she had heated the rolls and passed the paper napkins mr marbury captured her with a loud oh quit fussing now come over here and sit down and tell us hows tricks he herded her to a sofa with dr kennicott who was rather vague about the eyes rather drooping of bulky shoulder as though he was wondering what he was expected to do next as their host left them kennicott awoke  marbury tells me youre a high mogul in the public library i was surprised didnt hardly think you were old enough i thought you were a girl still in college maybe  oh im dreadfully old i expect to take to a lipstick and to find a gray hair any morning now  huh you must be frightfully oldprobly too old to be my granddaughter i guess  thus in the vale of arcady nymph and satyr beguiled the hours precisely thus and not in honeyed pentameters discoursed elaine and the worn sir launcelot in the pleached alley  how do you like your work asked the doctor  its pleasant but sometimes i feel shut off from thingsthe steel stacks and the everlasting cards smeared all over with red rubber stamps  dont you get sick of the city  st paul why dont you like it i dont know of any lovelier view than when you stand on summit avenue and look across lower town to the mississippi cliffs and the upland farms beyond  i know butof course ive spent nine years around the twin citiestook my ba and md over at the u and had my internship in a hospital in minneapolis but still oh well you dont get to know folks here way you do up home i feel ive got something to say about running gopher prairie but you take it in a big city of twothree hundred thousand and im just one flea on the dogs back and then i like country driving and the hunting in the fall do you know gopher prairie at all  no but i hear its a very nice town  nice say honestlyof course i may be prejudiced but ive seen an awful lot of townsone time i went to atlantic city for the american medical association meeting and i spent practically a week in new york but i never saw a town that had such upandcoming people as gopher prairie bresnahanyou knowthe famous auto manufacturerhe comes from gopher prairie born and brought up there and its a darn pretty town lots of fine maples and boxelders and theres two of the dandiest lakes you ever saw right near town and weve got seven miles of cement walks already and building more every day course a lot of these towns still put up with plank walks but not for us you bet  really  why was she thinking of stewart snyder  gopher prairie is going to have a great future some of the best dairy and wheat land in the state right near theresome of it selling right now at onefifty an acre and i bet it will go up to two and a quarter in ten years  isdo you like your profession  nothing like it keeps you out and yet you have a chance to loaf in the office for a change  i dont mean that way i meanits such an opportunity for sympathy  dr kennicott launched into a heavy oh these dutch farmers dont want sympathy all they need is a bath and a good dose of salts  carol must have flinched for instantly he was urging what i mean isi dont want you to think im one of these old saltsandquinine peddlers but i mean so many of my patients are husky farmers that i suppose i get kind of casehardened  it seems to me that a doctor could transform a whole community if he wanted toif he saw it hes usually the only man in the neighborhood who has any scientific training isnt he  yes thats so but i guess most of us get rusty we land in a rut of obstetrics and typhoid and busted legs what we need is women like you to jump on us itd be you that would transform the town  no i couldnt too flighty i did used to think about doing just that curiously enough but i seem to have drifted away from the idea oh im a fine one to be lecturing you  no youre just the one you have ideas without having lost feminine charm say dont you think theres a lot of these women that go out for all these movements and so on that sacrifice  after his remarks upon suffrage he abruptly questioned her about herself his kindliness and the firmness of his personality enveloped her and she accepted him as one who had a right to know what she thought and wore and ate and read he was positive he had grown from a sketchedin stranger to a friend whose gossip was important news she noticed the healthy solidity of his chest his nose which had seemed irregular and large was suddenly virile  she was jarred out of this serious sweetness when marbury bounced over to them and with horrible publicity yammered say what do you two think youre doing telling fortunes or making love let me warn you that the doc is a frisky bacheldore carol come on now folks shake a leg lets have some stunts or a dance or something  she did not have another word with dr kennicott until their parting  been a great pleasure to meet you miss milford may i see you some time when i come down again im here quite oftentaking patients to hospitals for majors and so on  why  whats your address  you can ask mr marbury next time you come downif you really want to know  want to know say you wait    ii   of the lovemaking of carol and will kennicott there is nothing to be told which may not be heard on every summer evening on every shadowy block  they were biology and mystery their speech was slang phrases and flares of poetry their silences were contentment or shaky crises when his arm took her shoulder all the beauty of youth first discovered when it is passingand all the commonplaceness of a welltodo unmarried man encountering a pretty girl at the time when she is slightly weary of her employment and sees no glory ahead nor any man she is glad to serve  they liked each other honestlythey were both honest she was disappointed by his devotion to making money but she was sure that he did not lie to patients and that he did keep up with the medical magazines what aroused her to something more than liking was his boyishness when they went tramping  they walked from st paul down the river to mendota kennicott more elasticseeming in a cap and a soft crepe shirt carol youthful in a tamoshanter of mole velvet a blue serge suit with an absurdly and agreeably broad turndown linen collar and frivolous ankles above athletic shoes the high bridge crosses the mississippi mounting from low banks to a palisade of cliffs far down beneath it on the st paul side upon mud flats is a wild settlement of chickeninfested gardens and shanties patched together from discarded signboards sheets of corrugated iron and planks fished out of the river carol leaned over the rail of the bridge to look down at this yangtse village in delicious imaginary fear she shrieked that she was dizzy with the height and it was an extremely human satisfaction to have a strong male snatch her back to safety instead of having a logical woman teacher or librarian sniff well if youre scared why dont you get away from the rail then  from the cliffs across the river carol and kennicott looked back at st paul on its hills an imperial sweep from the dome of the cathedral to the dome of the state capitol  the river road led past rocky field slopes deep glens woods flamboyant now with september to mendota white walls and a spire among trees beneath a hill oldworld in its placid ease and for this fresh land the place is ancient here is the bold stone house which general sibley the king of furtraders built in 1835 with plaster of river mud and ropes of twisted grass for laths it has an air of centuries in its solid rooms carol and kennicott found prints from other days which the house had seentailcoats of robinsegg blue clumsy red river carts laden with luxurious furs whiskered union soldiers in slant forage caps and rattling sabers  it suggested to them a common american past and it was memorable because they had discovered it together they talked more trustingly more personally as they trudged on they crossed the minnesota river in a rowboat ferry they climbed the hill to the round stone tower of fort snelling they saw the junction of the mississippi and the minnesota and recalled the men who had come here eighty years agomaine lumbermen york traders soldiers from the maryland hills  its a good country and im proud of it lets make it all that those old boys dreamed about the unsentimental kennicott was moved to vow  lets  come on come to gopher prairie show us make the townwellmake it artistic its mighty pretty but ill admit we arent any too darn artistic probably the lumberyard isnt as scrumptious as all these greek temples but go to it make us change  i would like to some day  now youd love gopher prairie weve been doing a lot with lawns and gardening the past few years and its so homeythe big trees andand the best people on earth and keen i bet luke dawson  carol but half listened to the names she could not fancy their ever becoming important to her  i bet luke dawson has got more money than most of the swells on summit avenue and miss sherwin in the high school is a regular wonderreads latin like i do english and sam clark the hardware man hes a corkernot a better man in the state to go hunting with and if you want culture besides vida sherwin theres reverend warren the congregational preacher and professor mott the superintendent of schools and guy pollock the lawyerthey say he writes regular poetry andand raymie wutherspoon hes not such an awful boob when you get to know him and he sings swell andand theres plenty of others lym cass only of course none of them have your finesse you might call it but they dont make em any more appreciative and so on come on were ready for you to boss us  they sat on the bank below the parapet of the old fort hidden from observation he circled her shoulder with his arm relaxed after the walk a chill nipping her throat conscious of his warmth and power she leaned gratefully against him  you know im in love with you carol  she did not answer but she touched the back of his hand with an exploring finger  you say im so darn materialistic how can i help it unless i have you to stir me up  she did not answer she could not think  you say a doctor could cure a town the way he does a person well you cure the town of whatever ails it if anything does and ill be your surgical kit  she did not follow his words only the burring resoluteness of them  she was shocked thrilled as he kissed her cheek and cried theres no use saying things and saying things and saying things dont my arms talk to younow  oh please please she wondered if she ought to be angry but it was a drifting thought and she discovered that she was crying  then they were sitting six inches apart pretending that they had never been nearer while she tried to be impersonal  i would like towould like to see gopher prairie  trust me here she is brought some snapshots down to show you  her cheek near his sleeve she studied a dozen village pictures they were streaky she saw only trees shrubbery a porch indistinct in leafy shadows but she exclaimed over the lakes dark water reflecting wooded bluffs a flight of ducks a fisherman in shirt sleeves and a wide straw hat holding up a string of croppies one winter picture of the edge of plover lake had the air of an etching lustrous slide of ice snow in the crevices of a boggy bank the mound of a muskrat house reeds in thin black lines arches of frosty grasses it was an impression of cool clear vigor  howd it be to skate there for a couple of hours or go zinging along on a fast iceboat and skip back home for coffee and some hot wienies he demanded  it might befun  but heres the picture heres where you come in  a photograph of a forest clearing pathetic new furrows straggling among stumps a clumsy log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with hay in front of it a sagging woman with tightdrawn hair and a baby bedraggled smeary gloriouseyed  those are the kind of folks i practise among good share of the time nels erdstrom fine clean young svenska hell have a corking farm in ten years but nowi operated his wife on a kitchen table with my driver giving the anesthetic look at that scared baby needs some woman with hands like yours waiting for you just look at that babys eyes look how hes begging  dont they hurt me oh it would be sweet to help himso sweet  as his arms moved toward her she answered all her doubts with sweet so sweet    chapter iii  under the rolling clouds of the prairie a moving mass of steel an irritable clank and rattle beneath a prolonged roar the sharp scent of oranges cutting the soggy smell of unbathed people and ancient baggage  towns as planless as a scattering of pasteboard boxes on an attic floor the stretch of faded gold stubble broken only by clumps of willows encircling white houses and red barns  no 7 the way train grumbling through minnesota imperceptibly climbing the giant tableland that slopes in a thousandmile rise from hot mississippi bottoms to the rockies  it is september hot very dusty  there is no smug pullman attached to the train and the day coaches of the east are replaced by free chair cars with each seat cut into two adjustable plush chairs the headrests covered with doubtful linen towels halfway down the car is a semipartition of carved oak columns but the aisle is of bare splintery greaseblackened wood there is no porter no pillows no provision for beds but all today and all tonight they will ride in this long steel boxfarmers with perpetually tired wives and children who seem all to be of the same age workmen going to new jobs traveling salesmen with derbies and freshly shined shoes  they are parched and cramped the lines of their hands filled with grime they go to sleep curled in distorted attitudes heads against the windowpanes or propped on rolled coats on seatarms and legs thrust into the aisle they do not read apparently they do not think they wait an earlywrinkled youngold mother moving as though her joints were dry opens a suitcase in which are seen creased blouses a pair of slippers worn through at the toes a bottle of patent medicine a tin cup a papercovered book about dreams which the newsbutcher has coaxed her into buying she brings out a graham cracker which she feeds to a baby lying flat on a seat and wailing hopelessly most of the crumbs drop on the red plush of the seat and the woman sighs and tries to brush them away but they leap up impishly and fall back on the plush  a soiled man and woman munch sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor a large brickcolored norwegian takes off his shoes grunts in relief and props his feet in their thick gray socks against the seat in front of him  an old woman whose toothless mouth shuts like a mudturtles and whose hair is not so much white as yellow like moldy linen with bands of pink skull apparent between the tresses anxiously lifts her bag opens it peers in closes it puts it under the seat and hastily picks it up and opens it and hides it all over again the bag is full of treasures and of memories a leather buckle an ancient bandconcert program scraps of ribbon lace satin in the aisle beside her is an extremely indignant parrakeet in a cage  two facing seats overflowing with a slovene ironminers family are littered with shoes dolls whisky bottles bundles wrapped in newspapers a sewing bag the oldest boy takes a mouthorgan out of his coat pocket wipes the tobacco crumbs off and plays marching through georgia till every head in the car begins to ache  the newsbutcher comes through selling chocolate bars and lemon drops a girlchild ceaselessly trots down to the watercooler and back to her seat the stiff paper envelope which she uses for cup drips in the aisle as she goes and on each trip she stumbles over the feet of a carpenter who grunts ouch look out  the dustcaked doors are open and from the smokingcar drifts back a visible blue line of stinging tobacco smoke and with it a crackle of laughter over the story which the young man in the bright blue suit and lavender tie and light yellow shoes has just told to the squat man in garage overalls  the smell grows constantly thicker more stale    ii   to each of the passengers his seat was his temporary home and most of the passengers were slatternly housekeepers but one seat looked clean and deceptively cool in it were an obviously prosperous man and a blackhaired fineskinned girl whose pumps rested on an immaculate horsehide bag  they were dr will kennicott and his bride carol  they had been married at the end of a year of conversational courtship and they were on their way to gopher prairie after a wedding journey in the colorado mountains  the hordes of the waytrain were not altogether new to carol she had seen them on trips from st paul to chicago but now that they had become her own people to bathe and encourage and adorn she had an acute and uncomfortable interest in them they distressed her they were so stolid she had always maintained that there is no american peasantry and she sought now to defend her faith by seeing imagination and enterprise in the young swedish farmers and in a traveling man working over his orderblanks but the older people yankees as well as norwegians germans finns canucks had settled into submission to poverty they were peasants she groaned  isnt there any way of waking them up what would happen if they understood scientific agriculture she begged of kennicott her hand groping for his  it had been a transforming honeymoon she had been frightened to discover how tumultuous a feeling could be roused in her will had been lordlystalwart jolly impressively competent in making camp tender and understanding through the hours when they had lain side by side in a tent pitched among pines high up on a lonely mountain spur  his hand swallowed hers as he started from thoughts of the practise to which he was returning these people wake em up what for theyre happy  but theyre so provincial no that isnt what i mean theyreoh so sunk in the mud  look here carrie you want to get over your city idea that because a mans pants arent pressed hes a fool these farmers are mighty keen and upandcoming  i know thats what hurts life seems so hard for themthese lonely farms and this gritty train  oh they dont mind it besides things are changing the auto the telephone rural free delivery theyre bringing the farmers in closer touch with the town takes time you know to change a wilderness like this was fifty years ago but already why they can hop into the ford or the overland and get in to the movies on saturday evening quicker than you could get down to em by trolley in st paul  but if its these towns weve been passing that the farmers run to for relief from their bleaknesscant you understand just look at them  kennicott was amazed ever since childhood he had seen these towns from trains on this same line he grumbled why whats the matter with em good hustling burgs it would astonish you to know how much wheat and rye and corn and potatoes they ship in a year  but theyre so ugly  ill admit they arent comfy like gopher prairie but give em time  whats the use of giving them time unless some one has desire and training enough to plan them hundreds of factories trying to make attractive motor cars but these townsleft to chance no that cant be true it must have taken genius to make them so scrawny  oh theyre not so bad was all he answered he pretended that his hand was the cat and hers the mouse for the first time she tolerated him rather than encouraged him she was staring out at schoenstrom a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants at which the train was stopping  a bearded german and his puckermouthed wife tugged their enormous imitationleather satchel from under a seat and waddled out the station agent hoisted a dead calf aboard the baggagecar there were no other visible activities in schoenstrom in the quiet of the halt carol could hear a horse kicking his stall a carpenter shingling a roof  the businesscenter of schoenstrom took up one side of one block facing the railroad it was a row of onestory shops covered with galvanized iron or with clapboards painted red and bilious yellow the buildings were as illassorted as temporarylooking as a miningcamp street in the motionpictures the railroad station was a oneroom frame box a mirey cattlepen on one side and a crimson wheatelevator on the other the elevator with its cupola on the ridge of a shingled roof resembled a broadshouldered man with a small vicious pointed head the only habitable structures to be seen were the florid redbrick catholic church and rectory at the end of main street  carol picked at kennicotts sleeve you wouldnt call this a notsobad town would you  these dutch burgs are kind of slow still at thatsee that fellow coming out of the general store there getting into the big car i met him once he owns about half the town besides the store rauskukle his name is he owns a lot of mortgages and he gambles in farmlands good nut on him that fellow why they say hes worth three or four hundred thousand dollars got a dandy great big yellow brick house with tiled walks and a garden and everything other end of towncant see it from hereive gone past it when ive driven through here yes sir  then if he has all that theres no excuse whatever for this place if his three hundred thousand went back into the town where it belongs they could burn up these shacks and build a dreamvillage a jewel why do the farmers and the townpeople let the baron keep it  i must say i dont quite get you sometimes carrie let him they cant help themselves hes a dumm old dutchman and probably the priest can twist him around his finger but when it comes to picking good farming land hes a regular wiz  i see hes their symbol of beauty the town erects him instead of erecting buildings  honestly dont know what youre driving at youre kind of played out after this long trip youll feel better when you get home and have a good bath and put on the blue negligee thats some vampire costume you witch  he squeezed her arm looked at her knowingly  they moved on from the desert stillness of the schoenstrom station the train creaked banged swayed the air was nauseatingly thick kennicott turned her face from the window rested her head on his shoulder she was coaxed from her unhappy mood but she came out of it unwillingly and when kennicott was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries and had opened a magazine of saffron detective stories she sat upright  hereshe meditatedis the newest empire of the world the northern middlewest a land of dairy herds and exquisite lakes of new automobiles and tarpaper shanties and silos like red towers of clumsy speech and a hope that is boundless an empire which feeds a quarter of the worldyet its work is merely begun they are pioneers these sweaty wayfarers for all their telephones and bankaccounts and automatic pianos and cooperative leagues and for all its fat richness theirs is a pioneer land what is its future she wondered a future of cities and factory smut where now are loping empty fields homes universal and secure or placid chateaux ringed with sullen huts youth free to find knowledge and laughter willingness to sift the sanctified lies or creamyskinned fat women smeared with grease and chalk gorgeous in the skins of beasts and the bloody feathers of slain birds playing bridge with puffy pinknailed jeweled fingers women who after much expenditure of labor and bad temper still grotesquely resemble their own flatulent lapdogs the ancient stale inequalities or something different in history unlike the tedious maturity of other empires what future and what hope  carols head ached with the riddle  she saw the prairie flat in giant patches or rolling in long hummocks the width and bigness of it which had expanded her spirit an hour ago began to frighten her it spread out so it went on so uncontrollably she could never know it kennicott was closeted in his detective story with the loneliness which comes most depressingly in the midst of many people she tried to forget problems to look at the prairie objectively  the grass beside the railroad had been burnt over it was a smudge prickly with charred stalks of weeds beyond the undeviating barbedwire fences were clumps of golden rod only this thin hedge shut them off from the plainsshorn wheatlands of autumn a hundred acres to a field prickly and gray nearby but in the blurred distance like tawny velvet stretched over dipping hillocks the long rows of wheatshocks marched like soldiers in worn yellow tabards the newly plowed fields were black banners fallen on the distant slope it was a martial immensity vigorous a little harsh unsoftened by kindly gardens  the expanse was relieved by clumps of oaks with patches of short wild grass and every mile or two was a chain of cobalt slews with the flicker of blackbirds wings across them  all this working land was turned into exuberance by the light the sunshine was dizzy on open stubble shadows from immense cumulus clouds were forever sliding across low mounds and the sky was wider and loftier and more resolutely blue than the sky of cities    she declared  its a glorious country a land to be big in she crooned  then kennicott startled her by chuckling d you realize the town after the next is gopher prairie home    iii   that one wordhomeit terrified her had she really bound herself to live inescapably in this town called gopher prairie and this thick man beside her who dared to define her future he was a stranger she turned in her seat stared at him who was he why was he sitting with her he wasnt of her kind his neck was heavy his speech was heavy he was twelve or thirteen years older than she and about him was none of the magic of shared adventures and eagerness she could not believe that she had ever slept in his arms that was one of the dreams which you had but did not officially admit  she told herself how good he was how dependable and understanding she touched his ear smoothed the plane of his solid jaw and turning away again concentrated upon liking his town it wouldnt be like these barren settlements it couldnt be why it had three thousand population that was a great many people there would be six hundred houses or more andthe lakes near it would be so lovely shed seen them in the photographs they had looked charming    hadnt they  as the train left wahkeenyan she began nervously to watch for the lakesthe entrance to all her future life but when she discovered them to the left of the track her only impression of them was that they resembled the photographs  a mile from gopher prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge and she could see the town as a whole with a passionate jerk she pushed up the window looked out the arched fingers of her left hand trembling on the sill her right hand at her breast  and she saw that gopher prairie was merely an enlargement of all the hamlets which they had been passing only to the eyes of a kennicott was it exceptional the huddled low wooden houses broke the plains scarcely more than would a hazel thicket the fields swept up to it past it it was unprotected and unprotecting there was no dignity in it nor any hope of greatness only the tall red grainelevator and a few tinny churchsteeples rose from the mass it was a frontier camp it was not a place to live in not possibly not conceivably  the peopletheyd be as drab as their houses as flat as their fields she couldnt stay here she would have to wrench loose from this man and flee  she peeped at him she was at once helpless before his mature fixity and touched by his excitement as he sent his magazine skittering along the aisle stooped for their bags came up with flushed face and gloated here we are  she smiled loyally and looked away the train was entering town the houses on the outskirts were dusky old red mansions with wooden frills or gaunt frame shelters like grocery boxes or new bungalows with concrete foundations imitating stone  now the train was passing the elevator the grim storagetanks for oil a creamery a lumberyard a stockyard muddy and trampled and stinking now they were stopping at a squat red frame station the platform crowded with unshaven farmers and with loafersunadventurous people with dead eyes she was here she could not go on it was the endthe end of the world she sat with closed eyes longing to push past kennicott hide somewhere in the train flee on toward the pacific  something large arose in her soul and commanded stop it stop being a whining baby she stood up quickly she said isnt it wonderful to be here at last  he trusted her so she would make herself like the place and she was going to do tremendous things  she followed kennicott and the bobbing ends of the two bags which he carried they were held back by the slow line of disembarking passengers she reminded herself that she was actually at the dramatic moment of the brides homecoming she ought to feel exalted she felt nothing at all except irritation at their slow progress toward the door  kennicott stooped to peer through the windows he shyly exulted  look look theres a bunch come down to welcome us sam clark and the missus and dave dyer and jack elder and yes sir harry haydock and juanita and a whole crowd i guess they see us now yuh yuh sure they see us see em waving  she obediently bent her head to look out at them she had hold of herself she was ready to love them but she was embarrassed by the heartiness of the cheering group from the vestibule she waved to them but she clung a second to the sleeve of the brakeman who helped her down before she had the courage to dive into the cataract of handshaking people people whom she could not tell apart she had the impression that all the men had coarse voices large damp hands toothbrush mustaches bald spots and masonic watchcharms  she knew that they were welcoming her their hands their smiles their shouts their affectionate eyes overcame her she stammered thank you oh thank you  one of the men was clamoring at kennicott i brought my machine down to take you home doc  fine business sam cried kennicott and to carol lets jump in that big paige over there some boat too believe me sam can show speed to any of these marmons from minneapolis  only when she was in the motor car did she distinguish the three people who were to accompany them the owner now at the wheel was the essence of decent selfsatisfaction a baldish largish leveleyed man rugged of neck but sleek and round of faceface like the back of a spoon bowl he was chuckling at her have you got us all straight yet  course she has trust carrie to get things straight and get em darn quick i bet she could tell you every date in history boasted her husband  but the man looked at her reassuringly and with a certainty that he was a person whom she could trust she confessed as a matter of fact i havent got anybody straight  course you havent child well im sam clark dealer in hardware sporting goods cream separators and almost any kind of heavy junk you can think of you can call me samanyway im going to call you carrie seein s youve been and gone and married this poor fish of a bum medic that we keep round here carol smiled lavishly and wished that she called people by their given names more easily the fat cranky lady back there beside you who is pretending that she cant hear me giving her away is mrs saml clark and this hungrylooking squirt up here beside me is dave dyer who keeps his drug store running by not filling your hubbys prescriptions rightfact you might say hes the guy that put the shun in prescription so well leave us take the bonny bride home say doc ill sell you the candersen place for three thousand plunks better be thinking about building a new home for carrie prettiest frau in g p if you asks me  contentedly sam clark drove off in the heavy traffic of three fords and the minniemashie house free bus  i shall like mr clark    i cant call him sam theyre all so friendly she glanced at the houses tried not to see what she saw gave way in why do these stories lie so they always make the brides homecoming a bower of roses complete trust in noble spouse lies about marriage im not changed and this towno my god i cant go through with it this junkheap  her husband bent over her you look like you were in a brown study scared i dont expect you to think gopher prairie is a paradise after st paul i dont expect you to be crazy about it at first but youll come to like it so muchlifes so free here and best people on earth  she whispered to him while mrs clark considerately turned away i love you for understanding im justim beastly oversensitive too many books its my lack of shouldermuscles and sense give me time dear  you bet all the time you want  she laid the back of his hand against her cheek snuggled near him she was ready for her new home  kennicott had told her that with his widowed mother as housekeeper he had occupied an old house but nice and roomy and wellheated best furnace i could find on the market his mother had left carol her love and gone back to lacquimeurt  it would be wonderful she exulted not to have to live in other peoples houses but to make her own shrine she held his hand tightly and stared ahead as the car swung round a corner and stopped in the street before a prosaic frame house in a small parched lawn    iv   a concrete sidewalk with a parking of grass and mud a square smug brown house rather damp a narrow concrete walk up to it sickly yellow leaves in a windrow with dried wings of boxelder seeds and snags of wool from the cottonwoods a screened porch with pillars of thin painted pine surmounted by scrolls and brackets and bumps of jigsawed wood no shrubbery to shut off the public gaze a lugubrious baywindow to the right of the porch window curtains of starched cheap lace revealing a pink marble table with a conch shell and a family bible  youll find it oldfashionedwhat do you call itmidvictorian i left it as is so you could make any changes you felt were necessary kennicott sounded doubtful for the first time since he had come back to his own  its a real home she was moved by his humility she gaily motioned goodby to the clarks he unlocked the doorhe was leaving the choice of a maid to her and there was no one in the house she jiggled while he turned the key and scampered in    it was next day before either of them remembered that in their honeymoon camp they had planned that he should carry her over the sill  in hallway and front parlor she was conscious of dinginess and lugubriousness and airlessness but she insisted ill make it all jolly as she followed kennicott and the bags up to their bedroom she quavered to herself the song of the fat littlegods of the hearth       i have my own home      to do what i please with      to do what i please with      my den for me and my mate and my cubs      my own  she was close in her husbands arms she clung to him whatever of strangeness and slowness and insularity she might find in him none of that mattered so long as she could slip her hands beneath his coat run her fingers over the warm smoothness of the satin back of his waistcoat seem almost to creep into his body find in him strength find in the courage and kindness of her man a shelter from the perplexing world  sweet so sweet she whispered    chapter iv  i  the clarks have invited some folks to their house to meet us tonight said kennicott as he unpacked his suitcase  oh that is nice of them  you bet i told you youd like em squarest people on earth uh carriewould you mind if i sneaked down to the office for an hour just to see how things are  why no of course not i know youre keen to get back to work  sure you dont mind  not a bit out of my way let me unpack  but the advocate of freedom in marriage was as much disappointed as a drooping bride at the alacrity with which he took that freedom and escaped to the world of mens affairs she gazed about their bedroom and its full dismalness crawled over her the awkward knuckly lshape of it the black walnut bed with apples and spotty pears carved on the headboard the imitation maple bureau with pinkdaubed scentbottles and a petticoated pincushion on a marble slab uncomfortably like a gravestone the plain pine washstand and the garlanded waterpitcher and bowl the scent was of horsehair and plush and florida water  how could people ever live with things like this she shuddered she saw the furniture as a circle of elderly judges condemning her to death by smothering the tottering brocade chair squeaked choke herchoke hersmother her the old linen smelled of the tomb she was alone in this house this strange still house among the shadows of dead thoughts and haunting repressions i hate it i hate it she panted why did i ever  she remembered that kennicotts mother had brought these family relics from the old home in lacquimeurt stop it theyre perfectly comfortable things theyrecomfortable besidesoh theyre horrible well change them right away  then but of course he has to see how things are at the office  she made a pretense of busying herself with unpacking the chintzlined silverfitted bag which had seemed so desirable a luxury in st paul was an extravagant vanity here the daring black chemise of frail chiffon and lace was a hussy at which the deepbosomed bed stiffened in disgust and she hurled it into a bureau drawer hid it beneath a sensible linen blouse  she gave up unpacking she went to the window with a purely literary thought of village charmhollyhocks and lanes and applecheeked cottagers what she saw was the side of the seventhday adventist churcha plain clapboard wall of a sour liver color the ashpile back of the church an unpainted stable and an alley in which a ford deliverywagon had been stranded this was the terraced garden below her boudoir this was to be her scenery for  i mustnt i mustnt im nervous this afternoon am i sick    good lord i hope it isnt that not now how people lie how these stories lie they say the bride is always so blushing and proud and happy when she finds that out butid hate it id be scared to death some day butplease dear nebulous lord not now bearded sniffy old men sitting and demanding that we bear children if they had to bear them i wish they did have to not now not till ive got hold of this job of liking the ashpile out there    i must shut up im mildly insane im going out for a walk ill see the town by myself my first view of the empire im going to conquer  she fled from the house  she stared with seriousness at every concrete crossing every hitchingpost every rake for leaves and to each house she devoted all her speculation what would they come to mean how would they look six months from now in which of them would she be dining which of these people whom she passed now mere arrangements of hair and clothes would turn into intimates loved or dreaded different from all the other people in the world  as she came into the small businesssection she inspected a broadbeamed grocer in an alpaca coat who was bending over the apples and celery on a slanted platform in front of his store would she ever talk to him what would he say if she stopped and stated i am mrs dr kennicott some day i hope to confide that a heap of extremely dubious pumpkins as a windowdisplay doesnt exhilarate me much  the grocer was mr frederick f ludelmeyer whose market is at the corner of main street and lincoln avenue in supposing that only she was observant carol was ignorant misled by the indifference of cities she fancied that she was slipping through the streets invisible but when she had passed mr ludelmeyer puffed into the store and coughed at his clerk i seen a young woman she come along the side street i bet she iss doc kennicotts new bride goodlooker nice legs but she wore a hell of a plain suit no style i wonder will she pay cash i bet she goes to howland  goulds more as she does here what you done with the poster for fluffed oats    ii   when carol had walked for thirtytwo minutes she had completely covered the town east and west north and south and she stood at the corner of main street and washington avenue and despaired  main street with its twostory brick shops its storyandahalf wooden residences its muddy expanse from concrete walk to walk its huddle of fords and lumberwagons was too small to absorb her the broad straight unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie on every side she realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land the skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away at the north end of main street was like the ribs of a dead cow she thought of the coming of the northern winter when the unprotected houses would crouch together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste they were so small and weak the little brown houses they were shelters for sparrows not homes for warm laughing people  she told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor the maples were orange the oaks a solid tint of raspberry and the lawns had been nursed with love but the thought would not hold at best the trees resembled a thinned woodlot there was no park to rest the eyes and since not gopher prairie but wakamin was the countyseat there was no courthouse with its grounds  she glanced through the flyspecked windows of the most pretentious building in sight the one place which welcomed strangers and determined their opinion of the charm and luxury of gopher prairiethe minniemashie house it was a tall lean shabby structure three stories of yellowstreaked wood the corners covered with sanded pine slabs purporting to symbolize stone in the hotel office she could see a stretch of bare unclean floor a line of rickety chairs with brass cuspidors between a writingdesk with advertisements in motherofpearl letters upon the glasscovered back the diningroom beyond was a jungle of stained tablecloths and catsup bottles  she looked no more at the minniemashie house  a man in cuffless shirtsleeves with pink armgarters wearing a linen collar but no tie yawned his way from dyers drug store across to the hotel he leaned against the wall scratched a while sighed and in a bored way gossiped with a man tilted back in a chair a lumberwagon its long green box filled with large spools of barbedwire fencing creaked down the block a ford in reverse sounded as though it were shaking to pieces then recovered and rattled away in the greek candystore was the whine of a peanutroaster and the oily smell of nuts  there was no other sound nor sign of life  she wanted to run fleeing from the encroaching prairie demanding the security of a great city her dreams of creating a beautiful town were ludicrous oozing out from every drab wall she felt a forbidding spirit which she could never conquer  she trailed down the street on one side back on the other glancing into the cross streets it was a private seeing main street tour she was within ten minutes beholding not only the heart of a place called gopher prairie but ten thousand towns from albany to san diego  dyers drug store a corner building of regular and unreal blocks of artificial stone inside the store a

establishments  behind them and mixed with them the houses meek cottages or large comfortable soundly uninteresting symbols of prosperity  in all the town not one building save the ionic bank which gave pleasure to carols eyes not a dozen buildings which suggested that in the fifty years of gopher prairies existence the citizens had realized that it was either desirable or possible to make this their common home amusing or attractive  it was not only the unsparing unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her it was the planlessness the flimsy temporariness of the buildings their faded unpleasant colors the street was cluttered with electriclight poles telephone poles gasoline pumps for motor cars boxes of goods each man had built with the most valiant disregard of all the others between a large new block of twostory brick shops on one side and the firebrick overland garage on the other side was a onestory cottage turned into a millinery shop the white temple of the farmers bank was elbowed back by a grocery of glaring yellow brick one storebuilding had a patchy galvanized iron cornice the building beside it was crowned with battlements and pyramids of brick capped with blocks of red sandstone  she escaped from main street fled home  she wouldnt have cared she insisted if the people had been comely she had noted a young man loafing before a shop one unwashed hand holding the cord of an awning a middleaged man who had a way of staring at women as though he had been married too long and too prosaically an old farmer solid wholesome but not cleanhis face like a potato fresh from the earth none of them had shaved for three days  if they cant build shrines out here on the prairie surely theres nothing to prevent their buying safetyrazors she raged  she fought herself i must be wrong people do live here it cant be as ugly asas i know it is i must be wrong but i cant do it i cant go through with it  she came home too seriously worried for hysteria and when she found kennicott waiting for her and exulting have a walk well like the town great lawns and trees eh she was able to say with a selfprotective maturity new to her its very interesting    iii   the train which brought carol to gopher prairie also brought miss bea sorenson  miss bea was a stalwart corncolored laughing young woman and she was bored by farmwork she desired the excitements of citylife and the way to enjoy citylife was she had decided to go get a yob as hired girl in gopher prairie she contentedly lugged her pasteboard telescope from the station to her cousin tina malmquist maid of all work in the residence of mrs luke dawson  vell so you come to town said tina  ya ay get a yob said bea  vell    you got a fella now  ya yim yacobson  vell im glat to see you how much you vant a veek  sex dollar  there aint nobody pay dat vait dr kennicott i tink he marry a girl from de cities maybe she pay dat vell you go take a valk  ya said bea  so it chanced that carol kennicott and bea sorenson were viewing main street at the same time  bea had never before been in a town larger than scandia crossing which has sixtyseven inhabitants  as she marched up the street she was meditating that it didnt hardly seem like it was possible there could be so many folks all in one place at the same time my it would take years to get acquainted with them all and swell people too a fine big gentleman in a new pink shirt with a diamond and not no washedout blue denim workingshirt a lovely lady in a longery dress but it must be an awful hard dress to wash and the stores  not just three of them like there were at scandia crossing but more than four whole blocks  the bon ton storebig as four barnsmy it would simply scare a person to go in there with seven or eight clerks all looking at you and the mens suits on figures just like human and axel egges like home lots of swedes and norskes in there and a card of dandy buttons like rubies  a drug store with a soda fountain that was just huge awful long and all lovely marble and on it there was a great big lamp with the biggest shade you ever sawall different kinds colored glass stuck together and the soda spouts they were silver and they came right out of the bottom of the lampstand behind the fountain there were glass shelves and bottles of new kinds of soft drinks that nobody ever heard of suppose a fella took you there  a hotel awful high higher than oscar tollefsons new red barn three stories one right on top of another you had to stick your head back to look clear up to the top there was a swell traveling man in thereprobably been to chicago lots of times  oh the dandiest people to know here there was a lady going by you wouldnt hardly say she was any older than bea herself she wore a dandy new gray suit and black pumps she almost looked like she was looking over the town too but you couldnt tell what she thought bea would like to be that waykind of quiet so nobody would get fresh kind ofoh elegant  a lutheran church here in the city thered be lovely sermons and church twice on sunday every sunday  and a movie show  a regular theater just for movies with the sign change of bill every evening pictures every evening  there were movies in scandia crossing but only once every two weeks and it took the sorensons an hour to drive inpapa was such a tightwad he wouldnt get a ford but here she could put on her hat any evening and in three minutes walk be to the movies and see lovely fellows in dresssuits and bill hart and everything  how could they have so many stores why there was one just for tobacco alone and one a lovely onethe art shoppy it was for pictures and vases and stuff with oh the dandiest vase made so it looked just like a tree trunk  bea stood on the corner of main street and washington avenue the roar of the city began to frighten her there were five automobiles on the street all at the same timeand one of em was a great big car that must of cost two thousand dollarsand the bus was starting for a train with five elegantdressed fellows and a man was pasting up red bills with lovely pictures of washingmachines on them and the jeweler was laying out bracelets and wristwatches and everything on real velvet  what did she care if she got six dollars a week or two it was worth while working for nothing to be allowed to stay here and think how it would be in the evening all lighted upand not with no lamps but with electrics and maybe a gentleman friend taking you to the movies and buying you a strawberry ice cream soda  bea trudged back  vell you lak it said tina  ya ay lak it ay tink maybe ay stay here said bea    iv   the recently built house of sam clark in which was given the party to welcome carol was one of the largest in gopher prairie it had a clean sweep of clapboards a solid squareness a small tower and a large screened porch inside it was as shiny as hard and as cheerful as a new oak upright piano  carol looked imploringly at sam clark as he rolled to the door and shouted welcome little lady the keys of the city are yourn  beyond him in the hallway and the livingroom sitting in a vast prim circle as though they were attending a funeral she saw the guests they were waiting so they were waiting for her the determination to be all one pretty flowerlet of appreciation leaked away she begged of sam i dont dare face them they expect so much theyll swallow me in one mouthfulglumplike that  why sister theyre going to love yousame as i would if i didnt think the doc here would beat me up  bbuti dont dare faces to the right of me faces in front of me volley and wonder  she sounded hysterical to herself she fancied that to sam clark she sounded insane but he chuckled now you just cuddle under sams wing and if anybody rubbers at you too long ill shoo em off here we go watch my smokesaml the ladies delight and the bridegrooms terror  his arm about her he led her in and bawled ladies and worser halves the bride we wont introduce her round yet because shell never get your bum names straight anyway now bust up this starchamber  they tittered politely but they did not move from the social security of their circle and they did not cease staring  carol had given creative energy to dressing for the event her hair was demure low on her forehead with a parting and a coiled braid now she wished that she had piled it high her frock was an ingenue slip of lawn with a wide gold sash and a low square neck which gave a suggestion of throat and molded shoulders but as they looked her over she was certain that it was all wrong she wished alternately that she had worn a spinsterish highnecked dress and that she had dared to shock them with a violent brickred scarf which she had bought in chicago  she was led about the circle her voice mechanically produced safe remarks  oh im sure im going to like it here ever so much and yes we did have the best time in coloradomountains and yes i lived in st paul several years euclid p tinker no i dont remember meeting him but im pretty sure ive heard of him  kennicott took her aside and whispered now ill introduce

gives it the pep hes a hustler next to him is dave dyer the druggistyou met him this afternoonmighty good duckshot the tall husk beyond him is jack elderjackson elderowns the planingmill and the

besides ive known nat for years and besides hes a mighty good shot andthats the way it is see next to nat is chet dashaway great fellow for chinning hell talk your arm off about religion or politics or books or anything  carol gazed with a polite approximation to interest at mr dashaway a tan person with a wide mouth oh i know hes the furniturestore man she was much pleased with herself  yump and hes the undertaker youll like him come shake hands with him  oh no no he doesnthe doesnt do the embalming and all thathimself i couldnt shake hands with an undertaker  why not youd be proud to shake hands with a great surgeon just after hed been carving up peoples bellies  she sought to regain her afternoons calm of maturity yes youre right i wantoh my dear do you know how much i want to like the people you like i want to see people as they are  well dont forget to see people as other folks see them as they are they have the stuff did you know that percy bresnahan came from here born and

york or any of those places he doesnt mind chets undertaking  please illill like everybody ill be the community sunbeam  he led her to the dawsons  luke dawson lender of money on mortgages owner of northern cutover land was a hesitant man in unpressed soft gray clothes with bulging eyes in a milky face his wife had bleached cheeks bleached hair bleached voice and a bleached manner she wore her expensive green frock with its passementeried bosom bead tassels and gaps between the buttons down the back as though she had bought it secondhand and was afraid of meeting the former owner they were shy it was professor george edwin mott superintendent of schools a chinese mandarin turned brown who held carols hand and made her welcome  when the dawsons and mr mott had stated that they were pleased to meet her there seemed to be nothing else to say but the conversation went on automatically  do you like gopher prairie whimpered mrs dawson  oh im sure im going to be ever so happy  theres so many nice people mrs dawson looked to mr mott for social and intellectual aid he lectured  theres a fine class of people i dont like some of these retired farmers who come here to spend their last daysespecially the germans they hate to pay schooltaxes they hate to spend a cent but the rest are a fine class of people did you know that percy bresnahan came from here used to go to school right at the old building  i heard he did  yes hes a prince he and i went fishing together last time he was here  the dawsons and mr mott teetered upon weary feet and smiled at carol with crystallized expressions she went on  tell me mr mott have you ever tried any experiments with any of the new educational systems the modern kindergarten methods or the gary system  oh those most of these wouldbe reformers are simply notorietyseekers i believe in manual training but latin and mathematics always will be the backbone of sound americanism no matter what these faddists advocateheaven knows what they do wantknitting i suppose and classes in wiggling the ears  the dawsons smiled their appreciation of listening to a savant carol waited till kennicott should rescue her the rest of the party waited for the miracle of being amused  harry and juanita haydock rita simons and dr terry gouldthe young smart set of gopher prairie she was led to them juanita haydock flung at her in a high cackling friendly voice  well this is so nice to have you here well have some good partiesdances and everything youll have to join the jolly seventeen we play bridge and we have a supper once a month you play of course  nno i dont  really in st paul  ive always been such a bookworm  well have to teach you bridge is half the fun of life juanita had become patronizing and she glanced disrespectfully at carols golden sash which she had previously admired  harry haydock said politely how do you think youre going to like the old burg  im sure i shall like it tremendously  best people on earth here great hustlers too course ive had lots of chances to go live in minneapolis but we like it here real hetown did you know that percy bresnahan came from here  carol perceived that she had been weakened in the biological struggle by disclosing her lack of bridge roused to nervous desire to regain her position she turned on dr terry gould the young and poolplaying competitor of her husband her eyes coquetted with him while she gushed  ill learn bridge but what i really love most is the outdoors cant we all get up a boating party and fish or whatever you do and have a picnic supper afterwards  now youre talking dr gould affirmed he looked rather too obviously at the creamsmooth slope of her shoulder like fishing fishing is my middle name ill teach you bridge like cards at all  i used to be rather good at bezique  she knew that bezique was a game of cardsor a game of something else roulette possibly but her lie was a triumph juanitas handsome highcolored horsey face showed doubt harry stroked his nose and said humbly bezique used to be great gambling game wasnt it  while others drifted to her group carol snatched up the conversation she laughed and was frivolous and rather brittle she could not distinguish their eyes they were a blurry theateraudience before which she selfconsciously enacted the comedy of being the clever little bride of doc kennicott  thesehere celebrated open spaces thats what im going out for ill never read anything but the sportingpage again will converted me on our colorado trip there were so many mousey tourists who were afraid to get out of the motor bus that i decided to be annie oakley the wild western wampire and i bought oh a vociferous skirt which revealed my perfectly nice ankles to the presbyterian glare of all the ioway schoolmaams and i leaped from peak to peak like the nimble chamoys andyou may think that herr doctor kennicott is a nimrod but you ought to have seen me daring him to strip to his b v ds and go swimming in an icy mountain brook  she knew that they were thinking of becoming shocked but juanita haydock was admiring at least she swaggered on  im sure im going to ruin will as a respectable practitioneris he a good doctor dr gould  kennicotts rival gasped at this insult to professional ethics and he took an appreciable second before he recovered his social manner ill tell you mrs kennicott he smiled at kennicott to imply that whatever he might say in the stress of being witty was not to count against him in the commerciomedical warfare theres some people in town that say the doc is a fair to middlin diagnostician and prescriptionwriter but let me whisper this to youbut for heavens sake dont tell him i said sodont you ever go to him for anything more serious than a pendectomy of the left ear or a strabismus of the cardiograph  no one save kennicott knew exactly what this meant but they laughed and sam clarks party assumed a glittering lemonyellow color of brocade panels and champagne and tulle and crystal chandeliers and sporting duchesses carol saw that george edwin mott and the blanched mr and mrs dawson were not yet hypnotized they looked as though they wondered whether they ought to look as though they disapproved she concentrated on them  but i know whom i wouldnt have dared to go to colorado with mr dawson there im sure hes a regular heartbreaker when we were introduced he held my hand and squeezed it frightfully  haw haw haw the entire company applauded mr dawson was beatified he had been called many thingsloanshark skinflint tightwad pussyfootbut he had never before been called a flirt  he is wicked isnt he mrs dawson dont you have to lock him up  oh no but maybe i better attempted mrs dawson a tint on her pallid face  for fifteen minutes carol kept it up she asserted that she was going to stage a musical comedy that she preferred cafe parfait to beefsteak that she hoped dr kennicott would never lose his ability to make love to charming women and that she had a pair of gold stockings they gaped for more but she could not keep it up she retired to a chair behind sam clarks bulk the smilewrinkles solemnly flattened out in the faces of all the other collaborators in having a party and again they stood about hoping but not expecting to be amused  carol listened she discovered that conversation did not exist in gopher prairie even at this affair which brought out the young smart set the hunting squire set the respectable intellectual set and the solid financial set they sat up with gaiety as with a corpse  juanita haydock talked a good deal in her rattling voice but it was invariably of personalities the rumor that raymie wutherspoon was going to send for a pair of patent leather shoes with gray buttoned tops the rheumatism of champ perry the state of guy pollocks grippe and the dementia of jim howland in painting his fence salmonpink  sam clark had been talking to carol about motor cars but he felt his duties as host while he droned his brows popped up and down he interrupted himself must stir em up he worried at his wife dont you think i better stir em up he shouldered into the center of the room and cried  lets have some stunts folks  yes lets shrieked juanita haydock  say dave give us that stunt about the norwegian catching a hen  you bet thats a slick stunt do that dave cheered chet dashaway  mr dave dyer obliged  all the guests moved their lips in anticipation of being called on for their own stunts  ella come on and recite old sweetheart of mine for us demanded sam  miss ella stowbody the spinster daughter of the ionic bank scratched her dry palms and blushed oh you dont want to hear that old thing again  sure we do you bet asserted sam  my voice is in terrible shape tonight  tut come on  sam loudly explained to carol ella is our shark at elocuting shes had professional training she studied singing and oratory and dramatic art and shorthand for a year in milwaukee  miss stowbody was reciting as encore to an old sweetheart of mine she gave a peculiarly optimistic poem regarding the value of smiles  there were four other stunts one jewish one irish one juvenile and nat hickss parody of mark antonys funeral oration  during the winter carol was to hear dave dyers hencatching impersonation seven times an old sweetheart of mine nine times the jewish story and the funeral oration twice but now she was ardent and because she did so want to be happy and simplehearted she was as disappointed as the others when the stunts were finished and the party instantly sank back into coma  they gave up trying to be festive they began to talk naturally as they did at their shops and homes  the men and women divided as they had been tending to do all evening carol was deserted by the men left to a group of matrons who steadily pattered of children sickness and cookstheir own shoptalk she was piqued she remembered visions of herself as a smart married woman in a drawingroom fencing with clever men her dejection was relieved by speculation as to what the men were discussing in the corner between the piano and the phonograph did they rise from these housewifely personalities to a larger world of abstractions and affairs  she made her best curtsy to mrs dawson she twittered i wont have my husband leaving me so soon im going over and pull the wretchs ears she rose with a jeune fille bow she was selfabsorbed and selfapproving because she had attained that quality of sentimentality she proudly dipped across the room and to the interest and commendation of all beholders sat on the arm of kennicotts chair  he was gossiping with sam clark luke dawson jackson elder of the planingmill chet dashaway dave dyer harry haydock and ezra stowbody president of the ionic bank  ezra stowbody was a troglodyte he had come to gopher prairie in 1865 he was a distinguished bird of preyswooping thin nose turtle mouth thick brows portwine cheeks floss of white hair contemptuous eyes he was not happy in the social changes of thirty years three decades ago dr westlake julius flickerbaugh the lawyer merriman peedy the congregational pastor and himself had been the arbiters that was as it should be the fine artsmedicine law religion and financerecognized as aristocratic four yankees democratically chatting with but ruling the ohioans and illini and swedes and germans who had ventured to follow them but westlake was old almost retired julius flickerbaugh had lost much of his practice to livelier attorneys reverend not the reverend peedy was dead and nobody was impressed in this rotten age of automobiles by the spanking grays which ezra still drove the town was as heterogeneous as chicago norwegians and germans owned stores the social leaders were common merchants selling nails was considered as sacred as banking these upstartsthe clarks the haydockshad no dignity they were sound and conservative in politics but they talked about motor cars and pumpguns and heaven only knew what newfangled fads mr stowbody felt out of place with them but his brick house with the mansard roof was still the largest residence in town and he held his position as squire by occasionally appearing among the younger men and reminding them by a wintry eye that without the banker none of them could carry on their vulgar businesses  as carol defied decency by sitting down with the men mr stowbody was piping to mr dawson say luke when wast biggins first settled in winnebago township want it in 1879  why no twant mr dawson was indignant he come out from vermont in 1867no wait in 1868 it must have beenand took a claim on the rum river quite a ways above anoka  he did not roared mr stowbody he settled first in blue earth county him and his father  whats the point at issue carol whispered to kennicott  whether this old duck biggins had an english setter or a llewellyn theyve been arguing it all evening  dave dyer interrupted to give tidings d tell you that clara biggins was in town couple days ago she bought a hotwater bottleexpensive one tootwo dollars and thirty cents  yaaaaaah snarled mr stowbody course shes just like her grandad was never save a cent two dollars and twentythirty was ittwo dollars and thirty cents for a hotwater bottle brick wrapped up in a flannel petticoat just as good anyway  hows ellas tonsils mr stowbody yawned chet dashaway  while mr stowbody gave a somatic and psychic study of them carol reflected are they really so terribly interested in ellas tonsils or even in ellas esophagus i wonder if i could get them away from personalities lets risk damnation and try  there hasnt been much labor trouble around here has there mr stowbody she asked innocently  no maam thank god weve been free from that except maybe with hired girls and farmhands trouble enough with these foreign farmers if you dont watch these swedes they turn socialist or populist or some fool thing on you in a minute of course if they have loans you can make em listen to reason i just have em come into the bank for a talk and tell em a few things i dont mind their being democrats so much but i wont stand having socialists around but thank god we aint got the labor trouble they have in these cities even jack elder here gets along pretty well in the planingmill dont you jack  yep sure dont need so many skilled workmen in my place and its a lot of these cranky wagehogging halfbaked skilled mechanics that start troublereading a lot of this anarchist literature and union papers and all  do you approve of union labor carol inquired of mr elder  me i should say not its like this i dont mind dealing with my men if they think theyve got any grievancesthough lord knows whats come over workmen nowadaysdont appreciate a good job but still if they come to me honestly as man to man ill talk things over with them but im not going to have any outsider any of these walking delegates or whatever fancy names they call themselves nowbunch of rich grafters living on the ignorant workmen not going to have any of those fellows butting in and telling me how to run my business  mr elder was growing more excited more belligerent and patriotic i stand for freedom and constitutional rights if any man dont like my shop he can get up and git same way if i dont like him he gits and thats all there is to it i simply cant understand all these complications and hooptedoodles and government reports and wagescales and god knows what all that these fellows are balling up the labor situation with when its all perfectly simple they like what i pay em or they get out thats all there is to it  what do you think of profitsharing carol ventured  mr elder thundered his answer while the others nodded solemnly and in tune like a shopwindow of flexible toys comic mandarins and judges and ducks and clowns set quivering by a breeze from the open door  all this profitsharing and welfare work and insurance and oldage pension is simply poppycock enfeebles a workmans independenceand wastes a lot of honest profit the halfbaked thinker that isnt dry behind the ears yet and these suffragettes and god knows what all buttinskis there are that are trying to tell a business man how to run his business and some of these college professors are just about as bad the whole kit and bilin of em are nothing in gods world but socialism in disguise and its my bounden duty as a producer to resist every attack on the integrity of american industry to the last ditch yessir  mr elder wiped his brow  dave dyer added sure you bet what they ought to do is simply to hang every one of these agitators and that would settle the whole thing right off dont you think so doc  you bet agreed kennicott  the conversation was at last relieved of the plague of carols intrusions and they settled down to the question of whether the justice of the peace had sent that hobo drunk to jail for ten days or twelve it was a matter not readily determined then dave dyer communicated his carefree adventures on the gipsy trail  yep i get good time out of the flivver bout a week ago i motored down to new wurttemberg thats fortythreeno lets see its seventeen miles to belldale and bout six and threequarters call it seven to torgenquist and its a good nineteen miles from there to new wurttembergseventeen and seven and nineteen that makes uh let me see seventeen and seven s twentyfour plus nineteen well say plus twenty that makes fortyfour well anyway say about fortythree or four miles from here to new wurttemberg we got started about sevenfifteen probly seventwenty because i had to stop and fill the radiator and we ran along just keeping up a good steady gait  mr dyer did finally for reasons and purposes admitted and justified attain to new wurttemberg  onceonly oncethe presence of the alien carol was recognized chet dashaway leaned over and said asthmatically say uh have you been reading this serial two out in tingling tales corking yarn gosh the fellow that wrote it certainly can sling baseball slang  the others tried to look literary harry haydock offered juanita is a great hand for reading highclass stuff like mid the magnolias by this sara hetwiggin butts and riders of ranch reckless books but me he glanced about importantly as one convinced that no other hero had ever been in so strange a plight im so darn busy i dont have much time to read  i never read anything i cant check against said sam clark  thus ended the literary portion of the conversation and for seven minutes jackson elder outlined reasons for believing that the pikefishing was better on the west shore of lake minniemashie than on the eastthough it was indeed quite true that on the east shore nat hicks had caught a pike altogether admirable  the talk went on it did go on their voices were monotonous thick emphatic they were harshly pompous like men in the smokingcompartments of pullman cars they did not bore carol they frightened her she panted they will be cordial to me because my man belongs to their tribe god help me if i were an outsider  smiling as changelessly as an ivory figurine she sat quiescent avoiding thought glancing about the livingroom and hall noting their betrayal of unimaginative commercial prosperity kennicott said dandy interior eh my idea of how a place ought to be furnished modern she looked polite and observed the oiled floors hardwood staircase unused fireplace with tiles which resembled brown linoleum cutglass vases standing upon doilies and the barred shut forbidding unit bookcases that were half filled with swashbuckler novels and unreadlooking sets of dickens kipling o henry and elbert hubbard  she perceived that even personalities were failing to hold the party the room filled with hesitancy as with a fog people cleared their throats tried to choke down yawns the men shot their cuffs and the women stuck their combs more firmly into their back hair  then a rattle a daring hope in every eye the swinging of a door the smell of strong coffee dave dyers mewing voice in a triumphant the eats they began to chatter they had something to do they could escape from themselves they fell upon the foodchicken sandwiches maple cake drugstore ice cream even when the food was gone they remained cheerful they could go home any time now and go to bed  they went with a flutter of coats chiffon scarfs and goodbys  carol and kennicott walked home  did you like them he asked  they were terribly sweet to me  uh carrieyou ought to be more careful about shocking folks talking about gold stockings and about showing your ankles to schoolteachers and all more mildly you gave em a good time but id watch out for that f i were you juanita haydock is such a damn cat i wouldnt give her a chance to criticize me  my poor effort to lift up the party was i wrong to try to amuse them  no no honey i didnt meanyou were the only upandcoming person in the bunch i just meandont get onto legs and all that immoral stuff pretty conservative crowd  she was silent raw with the shameful thought that the attentive circle might have been criticizing her laughing at her  dont please dont worry he pleaded  silence  gosh im sorry i spoke about it i just meantbut they were crazy about you sam said to me that little lady of yours is the slickest thing that ever came to this town he said and ma dawsoni didnt hardly know whether shed like you or not shes such a driedup old bird but she said your bride is so quick and bright i declare she just wakes me up  carol liked praise the flavor and fatness of it but she was so energetically being sorry for herself that she could not taste this commendation  please come on cheer up his lips said it his anxious shoulder said it his arm about her said it as they halted on the obscure porch of their house  do you care if they think im flighty will  me why i wouldnt care if the whole world thought you were this or that or anything else youre mywell youre my soul  he was an undefined mass as solidseeming as rock she found his sleeve pinched it cried im glad its sweet to be wanted you must tolerate my frivolousness youre all i have  he lifted her carried her into the house and with her arms about his neck she forgot main street    chapter v  i   well steal the whole day and go hunting i want you to see the country round here kennicott announced at breakfast id take the carwant you to see how swell she runs since i put in a new piston but well take a team so we can get right out into the fields not many prairie chickens left now but we might just happen to run onto a small covey  he fussed over his huntingkit he pulled his hip boots out to full length and examined them for holes he feverishly counted his shotgun shells lecturing her on the qualities of smokeless powder he drew the new hammerless shotgun out of its heavy tan leather case and made her peep through the barrels to see how dazzlingly free they were from rust  the world of hunting and campingoutfits and fishingtackle was unfamiliar to her and in kennicotts interest she found something creative and joyous she examined the smooth stock the carved hard rubber butt of the gun the shells with their brass caps and sleek green bodies and hieroglyphics on the wads were cool and comfortably heavy in her hands  kennicott wore a brown canvas huntingcoat with vast pockets lining the inside corduroy trousers which bulged at the wrinkles peeled and scarred shoes a scarecrow felt hat in this uniform he felt virile they clumped out to the livery buggy they packed the kit and the box of lunch into the back crying to each other that it was a magnificent day  kennicott had borrowed jackson elders red and white english setter a complacent dog with a waving tail of silver hair which flickered in the sunshine as they started the dog yelped and leaped at the horses heads till kennicott took him into the buggy where he nuzzled carols knees and leaned out to sneer at farm mongrels  the grays clattered out on the hard dirt road with a pleasant song of hoofs ta ta ta rat ta ta ta rat it was early and fresh the air whistling frost bright on the golden rod as the sun warmed the world of stubble into a welter of yellow they turned from the highroad through the bars of a farmers gate into a field slowly bumping over the uneven earth in a hollow of the rolling prairie they lost sight even of the country road it was warm and placid locusts trilled among the dry wheatstalks and brilliant little flies hurtled across the buggy a buzz of content filled the air crows loitered and gossiped in the sky  the dog had been let out and after a dance of excitement he settled down to a steady quartering of the field forth and back forth and back his nose down  pete rustad owns this farm and he told me he saw a small covey of chickens in the west forty last week maybe well get some sport after all kennicott chuckled blissfully  she watched the dog in suspense breathing quickly every time he seemed to halt she had no desire to slaughter birds but she did desire to belong to kennicotts world  the dog stopped on the point a forepaw held up  by golly hes hit a scent come on squealed kennicott he leaped from the buggy twisted the reins about the whipsocket swung her out caught up his gun slipped in two shells stalked toward the rigid dog carol pattering after him the setter crawled ahead his tail quivering his belly close to the stubble carol was nervous she expected clouds of large birds to fly up instantly her eyes were strained with staring but they followed the dog for a quarter of a mile turning doubling crossing two low hills kicking through a swale of weeds crawling between the strands of a barbedwire fence the walking was hard on her pavementtrained feet the earth was lumpy the stubble prickly and lined with grass thistles abortive stumps of clover she dragged and floundered  she heard kennicott gasp look three gray birds were starting up from the stubble they were round dumpy like enormous bumble bees kennicott was sighting moving the barrel she was agitated why didnt he fire the birds would be gone then a crash another and two birds turned somersaults in the air plumped down  when he showed her the birds she had no sensation of blood these heaps of feathers were so soft and unbruisedthere was about them no hint of death she watched her conquering man tuck them into his inside pocket and trudged with him back to the buggy  they found no more prairie chickens that morning  at noon they drove into her first farmyard a private village a white house with no porches save a low and quite dirty stoop at the back a crimson barn with white trimmings a glazed brick silo an excarriageshed now the garage of a ford an unpainted cowstable a chickenhouse a pigpen a corncrib a granary the galvanizediron skeleton tower of a windmill the dooryard was of packed yellow clay treeless barren of grass littered with rusty plowshares and wheels of discarded cultivators hardened trampled mud like lava filled the pigpen the doors of the house were grimerubbed the corners and eaves were rusted with rain and the child who stared at them from the kitchen window was smearyfaced but beyond the barn was a clump of scarlet geraniums the prairie breeze was sunshine in motion the flashing metal blades of the windmill revolved with a lively hum a horse neighed a rooster crowed martins flew in and out of the cowstable  a small spare woman with flaxen hair trotted from the house she was twanging a swedish patoisnot in monotone like english but singing it with a lyrical whine  pete he say you kom pretty soon hunting doctor my dots fine you kom is dis de bride ohhhh ve yoost say las night ve hope maybe ve see her som day my soch a pretty lady mrs rustad was shining with welcome vell vell ay hope you lak dis country vont you stay for dinner doctor  no but i wonder if you wouldnt like to give us a glass of milk condescended kennicott  vell ay should say ay vill you vait har a second and ay run on de milkhouse she nervously hastened to a tiny red building beside the windmill she came back with a pitcher of milk from which carol filled the thermos bottle  as they drove off carol admired shes the dearest thing i ever saw and she adores you you are the lord of the manor  oh no much pleased but still they do ask my advice about things bully people these scandinavian farmers and prosperous too helga rustad shes still scared of america but her kids will be doctors and lawyers and governors of the state and any darn thing they want to  i wonder carol was plunged back into last nights weltschmerz i wonder if these farmers arent bigger than we are so simple and hardworking the town lives on them we townies are parasites and yet we feel superior to them last night i heard mr haydock talking about hicks apparently he despises the farmers because they havent reached the social heights of selling thread and buttons  parasites us whered the farmers be without the town who lends them money whowhy we supply them with everything  dont you find that some of the farmers think they pay too much for the services of the towns  oh of course theres a lot of cranks among the farmers same as there are among any class listen to some of these kickers a fellowd think that the farmers ought to run the state and the whole shootingmatchprobably if they had their way theyd fill up the legislature with a lot of farmers in manurecovered bootsyes and theyd come tell me i was hired on a salary now and couldnt fix my fees thatd be fine for you wouldnt it  but why shouldnt they  why that bunch oftelling meoh for heavens sake lets quit arguing all this discussing may be all right at a party butlets forget it while were hunting  i know the wonderlustprobably its a worse affliction than the wanderlust i just wonder  she told herself that she had everything in the world and after each selfrebuke she stumbled again on i just wonder  they ate their sandwiches by a prairie slew long grass reaching up out of clear water mossy bogs redwinged blackbirds the scum a splash of goldgreen kennicott smoked a pipe while she leaned back in the buggy and let her tired spirit be absorbed in the nirvana of the incomparable sky  they lurched to the highroad and awoke from their sunsoaked drowse at the sound of the clopping hoofs they paused to look for partridges in a rim of woods little woods very clean and shiny and gay silver birches and poplars with immaculate green trunks encircling a lake of sandy bottom a splashing seclusion demure in the welter of hot prairie  kennicott brought down a fat red squirrel and at dusk he had a dramatic shot at a flight of ducks whirling down from the upper air skimming the lake instantly vanishing  they drove home under the sunset mounds of straw and wheatstacks like beehives stood out in startling rose and gold and the greentufted stubble glistened as the vast girdle of crimson darkened the fulfilled land became autumnal in deep reds and browns the black road before the buggy turned to a faint lavender then was blotted to uncertain grayness cattle came in a long line up to the barred gates of the farmyards and over the resting land was a dark glow  carol had found the dignity and greatness which had failed her in main street    ii   till they had a maid they took noon dinner and six oclock supper at mrs gurreys boardinghouse  mrs elisha gurrey relict of deacon gurrey the dealer in hay and grain was a pointednosed simpering woman with irongray hair drawn so tight that it resembled a soiled handkerchief covering her head but she was unexpectedly cheerful and her diningroom with its thin tablecloth on a long pine table had the decency of clean bareness  in the line of unsmiling methodically chewing guests like horses at a manger carol came to distinguish one countenance the pale long spectacled face and sandy pompadour hair of mr raymond p wutherspoon known as raymie professional bachelor manager and one half the salesforce in the shoedepartment of the bon ton store  you will enjoy gopher prairie very much mrs kennicott petitioned raymie his eyes were like those of a dog waiting to be let in out of the cold he passed the stewed apricots effusively there are a great many bright cultured people here mrs wilks the christian science reader is a very bright womanthough i am not a scientist myself in fact i sing in the episcopal choir and miss sherwin of the high schoolshe is such a pleasing bright girli was fitting her to a pair of tan gaiters yesterday i declare it really was a pleasure  gimme the butter carrie was kennicotts comment she defied him by encouraging raymie  do you have amateur dramatics and so on here  oh yes the towns just full of talent the knights of pythias put on a dandy minstrel show last year  its nice youre so enthusiastic  oh do you really think so lots of folks jolly me for trying to get up shows and so on i tell them they have more artistic gifts than they know just yesterday i was saying to harry haydock if he would read poetry like longfellow or if he would join the bandi get so much pleasure out of playing the cornet and our bandleader del snafflin is such a good musician i often say he ought to give up his barbering and become a professional musician he could play the clarinet in minneapolis or new york or anywhere butbut i couldnt get harry to see it at all andi hear you and the doctor went out hunting yesterday lovely country isnt it and did you make some calls the mercantile life isnt inspiring like medicine it must be wonderful to see how patients trust you doctor  huh its me thats got to do all the trusting be damn sight more wonderful f theyd pay their bills grumbled kennicott and to carol he whispered something which sounded like gentleman hen  but raymies pale eyes were watering at her she helped him with so you like to read poetry  oh yes so muchthough to tell the truth i dont get much time for reading were always so busy at the store andbut we had the dandiest professional reciter at the pythian sisters sociable last winter  carol thought she heard a grunt from the traveling salesman at the end of the table and kennicotts jerking elbow was a grunt embodied she persisted  do you get to see many plays mr wutherspoon  he shone at her like a dim blue march moon and sighed no but i do love the movies im a real fan one trouble with books is that theyre not so thoroughly safeguarded by intelligent censors as the movies are and when you drop into the library and take out a book you never know what youre wasting your time on what i like in books is a wholesome really improving story and sometimeswhy once i started a novel by this fellow balzac that you read about and it told how a lady wasnt living with her husband i mean she wasnt his wife it went into details disgustingly and the english was real poor i spoke to the library about it and they took it off the shelves im not narrow but i must say i dont see any use in this deliberately dragging in immorality life itself is so full of temptations that in literature one wants only that which is pure and uplifting  whats the name of that balzac yarn where can i get hold of it giggled the traveling salesman  raymie ignored him but the movies they are mostly clean and their humordont you think that the most essential quality for a person to have is a sense of humor  i dont know i really havent much said carol  he shook his finger at her now now youre too modest im sure we can all see that you have a perfectly corking sense of humor besides dr kennicott wouldnt marry a lady that didnt have we all know how he loves his fun  you bet im a jokey old bird come on carrie lets beat it remarked kennicott  raymie implored and what is your chief artistic interest mrs kennicott  oh aware that the traveling salesman had murmured dentistry she desperately hazarded architecture  thats a real nice art ive always saidwhen haydock  simons were finishing the new front on the bon ton building the old man came to me you know harrys father d h i always call him and he asked me how i liked it and i said to him look here d h i saidyou see he was going to leave the front plain and i said to him its all very well to have modern lighting and a big displayspace i said but when you get that in you want to have some architecture too i said and he laughed and said he guessed maybe i was right and so he had em put on a cornice  tin observed the traveling salesman  raymie bared his teeth like a belligerent mouse well what if it is tin thats not my fault i told d h to make it polished granite you make me tired  leave us go come on carrie leave us go from kennicott  raymie waylaid them in the hall and secretly informed carol that she musnt mind the traveling salesmans coarsenesshe belonged to the hwa pollwa  kennicott chuckled well child how about it do you prefer an artistic guy like raymie to stupid boobs like sam clark and me  my dear lets go home and play pinochle and laugh and be foolish and slip up to bed and sleep without dreaming its beautiful to be just a solid citizeness    iii  from the gopher prairie weekly dauntless   one of the most charming affairs of the season was held tuesday evening at the handsome new residence of sam and mrs clark when many of our most prominent citizens gathered to greet the lovely new bride of our popular local physician dr will kennicott all present spoke of the many charms of the bride formerly miss carol milford of st paul games and stunts were the order of the day with merry talk and conversation at a late hour dainty refreshments were served and the party broke up with many expressions of pleasure at the pleasant affair among those present were mesdames kennicott elder        dr will kennicott for the past several years one of our most popular and skilful physicians and surgeons gave the town a delightful surprise when he returned from an extended honeymoon tour in colorado this week with his charming bride nee miss carol milford of st paul whose family are socially prominent in minneapolis and mankato mrs kennicott is a lady of manifold charms not only of striking charm of appearance but is also a distinguished graduate of a school in the east and has for the past year been prominently connected in an important position of responsibility with the st paul public library in which city dr will had the good fortune to meet her the city of gopher prairie welcomes her to our midst and prophesies for her many happy years in the energetic city of the twin lakes and the future the dr and mrs kennicott will reside for the present at the doctors home on poplar street which his charming mother has been keeping for him who has now returned to her own home at lacquimeurt leaving a host of friends who regret her absence and hope to see her soon with us again    iv   she knew that if she was ever to effect any of the reforms which she had pictured she must have a startingplace what confused her during the three or four months after her marriage was not lack of perception that she must be definite but sheer careless happiness of her first home  in the pride of being a housewife she loved every detailthe brocade armchair with the weak back even the brass watercock on the hotwater reservoir when she had become familiar with it by trying to scour it to brilliance  she found a maidplump radiant bea sorenson from scandia crossing bea was droll in her attempt to be at once a respectful servant and a bosom friend they laughed together over the fact that the stove did not draw over the slipperiness of fish in the pan  like a child playing grandma in a trailing skirt carol paraded uptown for her marketing crying greetings to housewives along the way everybody bowed to her strangers and all and made her feel that they wanted her that she belonged here in city shops she was merely a customera hat a voice to bore a harassed clerk here she was mrs doc kennicott and her preferences in grapefruit and manners were known and remembered and worth discussing    even if they werent worth fulfilling  shopping was a delight of brisk conferences the very merchants whose droning she found the dullest at the two or three parties which were given to welcome her were the pleasantest confidants of all when they had something to talk aboutlemons or cotton voile or flooroil with that skipjack dave dyer the druggist she conducted a long mockquarrel she pretended that he cheated her in the price of magazines and candy he pretended she was a detective from the twin cities he hid behind the prescriptioncounter and when she stamped her foot he came out wailing honest i havent done nothing crooked todaynot yet  she never recalled her first impression of main street never had precisely the same despair at its ugliness by the end of two shoppingtours everything had changed proportions as she never entered it the minniemashie house ceased to exist for her clarks hardware store dyers drug store the groceries of ole jenson and frederick ludelmeyer and howland  gould the meat markets the notions shopthey expanded and hid all other structures when she entered mr ludelmeyers store and he wheezed goot mornin mrs kennicott vell dis iss a fine day she did not notice the dustiness of the shelves nor the stupidity of the girl clerk and she did not remember the mute colloquy with him on her first view of main street  she could not find half the kinds of food she wanted but that made shopping more of an adventure when she did contrive to get sweetbreads at dahl  olesons meat market the triumph was so vast that she buzzed with excitement and admired the strong wise butcher mr dahl  she appreciated the homely ease of village life she liked the old men farmers gar veterans who when they gossiped sometimes squatted on their heels on the sidewalk like resting indians and reflectively spat over the curb  she found beauty in the children  she had suspected that her married friends exaggerated their passion for children but in her work in the library children had become individuals to her citizens of the state with their own rights and their own senses of humor in the library she had not had much time to give them but now she knew the luxury of stopping gravely asking bessie clark whether her doll had yet recovered from its rheumatism and agreeing with oscar martinsen that it would be good fun to go trapping mushrats  she touched the thought it would be sweet to have a baby of my own i do want one tinyno not yet theres so much to do and im still tired from the job its in my bones  she rested at home she listened to the village noises common to all the world jungle or prairie sounds simple and charged with magicdogs barking chickens making a gurgling sound of content children at play a man beating a rug wind in the cottonwood trees a locust fiddling a footstep on the walk jaunty voices of bea and a grocers boy in the kitchen a clinking anvil a pianonot too near  twice a week at least she drove into the country with kennicott to hunt ducks in lakes enameled with sunset or to call on patients who looked up to her as the squires lady and thanked her for toys and magazines evenings she went with her husband to the motion pictures and was boisterously greeted by every other couple or till it became too cold they sat on the porch bawling to passersby in motors or to neighbors who were raking the leaves the dust became golden in the low sun the street was filled with the fragrance of burning leaves    v   but she hazily wanted some one to whom she could say what she thought  on a slow afternoon when she fidgeted over sewing and wished that the telephone would ring bea announced miss vida sherwin  despite vida sherwins lively blue eyes if you had looked at her in detail you would have found her face slightly lined and not so much sallow as with the bloom rubbed off you would have found her chest flat and her fingers rough from needle and chalk and penholder her blouses and plain cloth skirts undistinguished and her hat worn too far back betraying a dry forehead but you never did look at vida sherwin in detail you couldnt her electric activity veiled her she was as energetic as a chipmunk her fingers fluttered her sympathy came out in spurts she sat on the edge of a chair in eagerness to be near her auditor to send her enthusiasms and optimism across  she rushed into the room pouring out im afraid youll think the teachers have been shabby in not coming near you but we wanted to give you a chance to get settled i am vida sherwin and i try to teach french and english and a few other things in the high school  ive been hoping to know the teachers you see i was a librarian  oh you neednt tell me i know all about you awful how much i knowthis gossipy village we need you so much here its a dear loyal town and isnt loyalty the finest thing in the world but its a rough diamond and we need you for the polishing and were ever so humble she stopped for breath and finished her compliment with a smile  if i could help you in any waywould i be committing the unpardonable sin if i whispered that i think gopher prairie is a tiny bit ugly  of course its ugly dreadfully though im probably the only person in town to whom you could safely say that except perhaps guy pollock the lawyerhave you met himoh you musthes simply a darlingintelligence and culture and so gentle but i dont care so much about the ugliness that will change its the spirit that gives me hope its sound wholesome but afraid it needs live creatures like you to awaken it i shall slavedrive you  splendid what shall i do ive been wondering if it would be possible to have a good architect come here to lecture  yees but dont you think it would be better to work with existing agencies perhaps it will sound slow to you but i was thinkingit would be lovely if we could get you to teach sunday school  carol had the empty expression of one who finds that she has been affectionately bowing to a complete stranger oh yes but im afraid i wouldnt be much good at that my religion is so foggy  i know so is mine i dont care a bit for dogma though i do stick firmly to the belief in the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man and the leadership of jesus as you do of course  carol looked respectable and thought about having tea  and thats all you need teach in sunday school its the personal influence then theres the libraryboard youd be so useful on that and of course theres our womens study clubthe thanatopsis club  are they doing anything or do they read papers made out of the encyclopedia  miss sherwin shrugged perhaps but still they are so earnest they will respond to your fresher interest and the thanatopsis does do a good social worktheyve made the city plant ever so many trees and they run the restroom for farmers wives and they do take such an interest in refinement and culture soin fact so very unique  carol was disappointedby nothing very tangible she said politely ill think them all over i must have a while to look around first  miss sherwin darted to her smoothed her hair peered at her oh my dear dont you suppose i know these first tender days of marriagetheyre sacred to me home and children that need you and depend on you to keep them alive and turn to you with their wrinkly little smiles and the hearth and she hid her face from carol as she made an activity of patting the cushion of her chair but she went on with her former briskness  i mean you must help us when youre ready    im afraid youll think im conservative i am so much to conserve all this treasure of american ideals sturdiness and democracy and opportunity maybe not at palm beach but thank heaven were free from such social distinctions in gopher prairie i have only one good qualityoverwhelming belief in the brains and hearts of our nation our state our town its so strong that sometimes i do have a tiny effect on the haughty tenthousandaires i shake em up and make em believe in idealsyes in themselves but i get into a rut of teaching i need young critical things like you to punch me up tell me what are you reading  ive been rereading the damnation of theron ware do you know it  yes it was clever but hard man wanted to tear down not build up cynical oh i do hope im not a sentimentalist but i cant see any use in this highart stuff that doesnt encourage us daylaborers to plod on  ensued a fifteenminute argument about the oldest topic in the world its art but is it pretty carol tried to be eloquent regarding honesty of observation miss sherwin stood out for sweetness and a cautious use of the uncomfortable properties of light at the end carol cried  i dont care how much we disagree its a relief to have somebody talk something besides crops lets make gopher prairie rock to its foundations lets have afternoon tea instead of afternoon coffee  the delighted bea helped her bring out the ancestral folding sewingtable whose yellow and black top was scarred with dotted lines from a dressmakers tracingwheel and to set it with an embroidered lunchcloth and the mauveglazed japanese teaset which she had brought from st paul miss sherwin confided her latest schememoral motion pictures for country districts with light from a portable dynamo hitched to a ford engine bea was twice called to fill the hotwater pitcher and to make cinnamon toast  when kennicott came home at five he tried to be courtly as befits the husband of one who has afternoon tea carol suggested that miss sherwin stay for supper and that kennicott invite guy pollock the muchpraised lawyer the poetic bachelor  yes pollock could come yes he was over the grippe which had prevented his going to sam clarks party  carol regretted her impulse the man would be an opinionated politician heavily jocular about the bride but at the entrance of guy pollock she discovered a personality pollock was a man of perhaps thirtyeight slender still deferential his voice was low it was very good of you to want me he said and he offered no humorous remarks and did not ask her if she didnt think gopher prairie was the livest little burg in the state  she fancied that his even grayness might reveal a thousand tints of lavender and blue and silver  at supper he hinted his love for sir thomas browne thoreau agnes repplier arthur symons claude washburn charles flandrau he presented his idols diffidently but he expanded in carols bookishness in miss sherwins voluminous praise in kennicotts tolerance of any one who amused his wife  carol wondered why guy pollock went on digging at routine lawcases why he remained in gopher prairie she had no one whom she could ask neither kennicott nor vida sherwin would understand that there might be reasons why a pollock should not remain in gopher prairie she enjoyed the faint mystery she felt triumphant and rather literary she already had a group it would be only a while now before she provided the town with fanlights and a knowledge of galsworthy she was doing things as she served the emergency dessert of cocoanut and sliced oranges she cried to pollock dont you think we ought to get up a dramatic club    chapter vi  i  when the first dubious november snow had filtered down shading with white the bare clods in the plowed fields when the first small fire had been started in the furnace which is the shrine of a gopher prairie home carol began to make the house her own she dismissed the parlor furniturethe golden oak table with brass knobs the moldy brocade chairs the picture of the doctor she went to minneapolis to scamper through department stores and small tenth street shops devoted to ceramics and high thought she had to ship her treasures but she wanted to bring them back in her arms  carpenters had torn out the partition between front parlor and back parlor thrown it into a long room on which she lavished yellow and deep blue a japanese obi with an intricacy of gold thread on stiff ultramarine tissue which she hung as a panel against the maize wall a couch with pillows of sapphire velvet and gold bands chairs which in gopher prairie seemed flippant she hid the sacred family phonograph in the diningroom and replaced its stand with a square cabinet on which was a squat blue jar between yellow candles  kennicott decided against a fireplace well have a new house in a couple of years anyway  she decorated only one room the rest kennicott hinted shed better leave till he made a tenstrike  the brown cube of a house stirred and awakened it seemed to be in motion it welcomed her back from shopping it lost its mildewed repression  the supreme verdict was kennicotts well by golly i was afraid the new junk wouldnt be so comfortable but i must say this divan or whatever you call it is a lot better than that bumpy old sofa we had and when i look aroundwell its worth all it cost i guess  every one in town took an interest in the refurnishing the carpenters and painters who did not actually assist crossed the lawn to peer through the windows and exclaim fine looks swell dave dyer at the drug store harry haydock and raymie wutherspoon at the bon ton repeated daily hows the good work coming i hear the house is getting to be real classy  even mrs bogart  mrs bogart lived across the alley from the rear of carols house she was a widow and a prominent baptist and a good influence she had so painfully reared three sons to be christian gentlemen that one of them had become an omaha bartender one a professor of greek and one cyrus n bogart a boy of fourteen who was still at home the most brazen member of the toughest gang in boytown  mrs bogart was not the acid type of good influence she was the soft damp fat sighing indigestive clinging melancholy depressingly hopeful kind there are in every large chickenyard a number of old and indignant hens who resemble mrs bogart and when they are served at sunday noon dinner as fricasseed chicken with thick dumplings they keep up the resemblance  carol had noted that mrs bogart from her side window kept an eye upon the house the kennicotts and mrs bogart did not move in the same setswhich meant precisely the same in gopher prairie as it did on fifth avenue or in mayfair but the good widow came calling  she wheezed in sighed gave carol a pulpy hand sighed glanced sharply at the revelation of ankles as carol crossed her legs sighed inspected the new blue chairs smiled with a coy sighing sound and gave voice  ive wanted to call on you so long dearie you know were neighbors but i thought id wait till you got settled you must run in and see me how much did that big chair cost  seventyseven dollars  sevsakes alive well i suppose its all right for them that can afford it though i do sometimes thinkof course as our pastor said once at baptist churchby the way we havent seen you there yet and of course your husband was raised up a baptist and i do hope he wont drift away from the fold of course we all know there isnt anything not cleverness or gifts of gold or anything that can make up for humility and the inward grace and they can say what they want to about the p e church but of course theres no church that has more history or has stayed by the true principles of christianity better than the baptist church andin what church were you raised mrs kennicott  wwhy i went to congregational as a girl in mankato but my college was universalist  wellbut of course as the bible says is it the bible at least i know i have heard it in church and everybody admits it its proper for the little bride to take her husbands vessel of faith so we all hope we shall see you at the baptist church andas i was saying of course i agree with reverend zitterel in thinking that the great trouble with this nation today is lack of spiritual faithso few going to church and people automobiling on sunday and heaven knows what all but still i do think that one trouble is this terrible waste of money people feeling that theyve got to have bathtubs and telephones in their housesi heard you were selling the old furniture cheap  yes  wellof course you know your own mind but i cant help thinking when wills ma was down here keeping house for himshe used to run in to see me real oftenit was good enough furniture for her but there there i mustnt croak i just wanted to let you know that when you find you cant depend on a lot of these gadding young folks like the haydocks and the dyersand heaven only knows how much money juanita haydock blows in in a yearwhy then you may be glad to know that slow old aunty bogart is always right there and heaven knows a portentous sigh i hope you and your husband wont have any of the troubles with sickness and quarreling and wasting money and all that so many of these young couples do have andbut i must be running along now dearie its been such a pleasure andjust run in and see me any time i hope will is well i thought he looked a wee mite peaked  it was twenty minutes later when mrs bogart finally oozed out of the front door carol ran back into the livingroom and jerked open the windows that woman has left damp fingerprints in the air she said    ii   carol was extravagant but at least she did not try to clear herself of blame by going about whimpering i know im terribly extravagant but i dont seem to be able to help it  kennicott had never thought of giving her an allowance his mother had never had one as a wageearning spinster carol had asserted to her fellow librarians that when she was married she was going to have an allowance and be businesslike and modern but it was too much trouble to explain to kennicotts kindly stubbornness that she was a practical housekeeper as well as a flighty playmate she bought a budgetplan account book and made her budgets as exact as budgets are likely to be when they lack budgets  for the first month it was a honeymoon jest to beg prettily to confess i havent a cent in the house dear and to be told youre an extravagant little rabbit but the budget book made her realize how inexact were her finances she became selfconscious occasionally she was indignant that she should always have to petition him for the money with which to buy his food she caught herself criticizing his belief that since his joke about trying to keep her out of the poorhouse had once been accepted as admirable humor it should continue to be his daily bon mot it was a nuisance to have to run down the street after him because she had forgotten to ask him for money at breakfast  but she couldnt hurt his feelings she reflected he liked the lordliness of giving largess  she tried to reduce the frequency of begging by opening accounts and having the bills sent to him she had found that staple groceries sugar flour could be most cheaply purchased at axel egges rustic general store she said sweetly to axel  i think id better open a charge account here  i dont do no business except for cash grunted axel  she flared do you know who i am  yuh sure i know the doc is good for it but thats yoost a rule i made i make low prices i do business for cash  she stared at his red impassive face and her fingers had the undignified desire to slap him but her reason agreed with him youre quite right you shouldnt break your rule for me  her rage had not been lost it had been transferred to her husband she wanted ten pounds of sugar in a hurry but she had no money she ran up the stairs to kennicotts office on the door was a sign advertising a headache cure and stating the doctor is out back at naturally the blank space was not filled out she stamped her foot she ran down to the drug storethe doctors club  as she entered she heard mrs dyer demanding dave ive got to have some money  carol saw that her husband was there and two other men all listening in amusement  dave dyer snapped how much do you want dollar be enough  no it wont ive got to get some underclothes for the kids  why good lord they got enough now to fill the closet so i couldnt find my hunting boots last time i wanted them  i dont care theyre all in rags you got to give me ten dollars  carol perceived that mrs dyer was accustomed to this indignity she perceived that the men particularly dave regarded it as an excellent jest she waitedshe knew what would comeit did dave yelped wheres that ten dollars i gave you last year and he looked to the other men to laugh they laughed  cold and still carol walked up to kennicott and commanded i want to see you upstairs  whysomething the matter  yes  he clumped after her up the stairs into his barren office before he could get out a query she stated  yesterday in front of a saloon i heard a german farmwife beg her husband for a quarter to get a toy for the babyand he refused just now ive heard mrs dyer going through the same humiliation and iim in the same position i have to beg you for money daily i have just been informed that i couldnt have any sugar because i hadnt the money to pay for it  who said that by god ill kill any  tut it wasnt his fault it was yours and mine i now humbly beg you to give me the money with which to buy meals for you to eat and hereafter to remember it the next time i shant beg i shall simply starve do you understand i cant go on being a slave  her defiance her enjoyment of the role ran out she was sobbing against his overcoat how can you shame me so and he was blubbering doggone it i meant to give you some and i forgot it i swear i wont again by golly i wont  he pressed fifty dollars upon her and after that he remembered to give her money regularly    sometimes  daily she determined but i must have a stated amountbe businesslike system i must do something about it and daily she didnt do anything about it    iii   mrs bogart had by the simpering viciousness of her comments on the new furniture stirred carol to economy she spoke judiciously to bea about leftovers she read the cookbook again and like a child with a picturebook she studied the diagram of the beef which gallantly continues to browse though it is divided into cuts  but she was a deliberate and joyous spendthrift in her preparations for her first party the housewarming she made lists on every envelope and laundryslip in her desk she sent orders to minneapolis fancy grocers she pinned patterns and sewed she was irritated when kennicott was jocular about these frightful big doings that are going on she regarded the affair as an attack on gopher prairies timidity in pleasure ill make em lively if nothing else ill make em stop regarding parties as committeemeetings  kennicott usually considered himself the master of the house at his desire she went hunting which was his symbol of happiness and she ordered porridge for breakfast which was his symbol of morality but when he came home on the afternoon before the housewarming he found himself a slave an intruder a blunderer carol wailed fix the furnace so you wont have to touch it after supper and for heavens sake take that horrible old doormat off the porch and put on your nice brown and white shirt why did you come home so late would you mind hurrying here it is almost suppertime and those fiends are just as likely as not to come at seven instead of eight please hurry  she was as unreasonable as an amateur leading woman on a first night and he was reduced to humility when she came down to supper when she stood in the doorway he gasped she was in a silver sheath the calyx of a lily her piled hair like black glass she had the fragility and costliness of a viennese goblet and her eyes were intense he was stirred to rise from the table and to hold the chair for her and all through supper he ate his bread dry because he felt that she would think him common if he said will you hand me the butter    iv   she had reached the calmness of not caring whether her guests liked the party or not and a state of satisfied suspense in regard to beas technique in serving before kennicott cried from the baywindow in the livingroom here comes somebody and mr and mrs luke dawson faltered in at a quarter to eight then in a shy avalanche arrived the entire aristocracy of gopher prairie all persons engaged in a profession or earning more than twentyfive hundred dollars a year or possessed of grandparents born in america  even while they were removing their overshoes they were peeping at the new decorations carol saw dave dyer secretively turn over the gold pillows to find a pricetag and heard mr julius flickerbaugh the attorney gasp well ill be switched as he viewed the vermilion print hanging against the japanese obi she was amused but her high spirits slackened as she beheld them form in dress parade in a long silent uneasy circle clear round the livingroom she felt that she had been magically whisked back to her first party at sam clarks  have i got to lift them like so many pigs of iron i dont know that i can make them happy but ill make them hectic  a silver flame in the darkling circle she whirled around drew them with her smile and sang i want my party to be noisy and undignified this is the christening of my house and i want you to help me have a bad influence on it so that it will be a giddy house for me wont you all join in an oldfashioned square dance and mr dyer will call  she had a record on the phonograph dave dyer was capering in the center of the floor loosejointed lean small rusty headed pointed of nose clapping his hands and shouting swing y pardnersalamun lef  even the millionaire dawsons and ezra stowbody and professor george edwin mott danced looking only slightly foolish and by rushing about the room and being coy and coaxing to all persons over fortyfive carol got them into a waltz and a virginia reel but when she left them to disenjoy themselves in their own way harry haydock put a onestep record on the phonograph the younger people took the floor and all the elders sneaked back to their chairs with crystallized smiles which meant dont believe ill try this one myself but i do enjoy watching the youngsters dance  half of them were silent half resumed the discussions of that afternoon in the store ezra stowbody hunted for something to say hid a yawn and offered to lyman cass the owner of the flourmill how d you folks like the new furnace lym huh so  oh let them alone dont pester them they must like it or they wouldnt do it carol warned herself but they gazed at her so expectantly when she flickered past that she was reconvinced that in their debauches of respectability they had lost the power of play as well as the power of impersonal thought even the dancers were gradually crushed by the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and wellbehaved and negative minds and they sat down two by two in twenty minutes the party was again elevated to the decorum of a prayermeeting  were going to do something exciting carol exclaimed to her new confidante vida sherwin she saw that in the growing quiet her voice had carried across the room nat hicks ella stowbody and dave dyer were abstracted fingers and lips slightly moving she knew with a cold certainty that dave was rehearsing his stunt about the norwegian catching the hen ella running over the first lines of an old sweetheart of mine and nat thinking of his popular parody on mark antonys oration  but i will not have anybody use the word stunt in my house she whispered to miss sherwin  thats good i tell you why not have raymond wutherspoon sing  raymie why my dear hes the most sentimental yearner in town  see here child your opinions on housedecorating are sound but your opinions of people are rotten raymie does wag his tail but the poor dearlonging for what he calls selfexpression and no training in anything except selling shoes but he can sing and some day when he gets away from harry haydocks patronage and ridicule hell do something fine  carol apologized for her superciliousness she urged raymie and warned the planners of stunts we all want you to sing mr wutherspoon youre the only famous actor im going to let appear on the stage tonight  while raymie blushed and admitted oh they dont want to hear me he was clearing his throat pulling his clean handkerchief farther out of his breast pocket and thrusting his fingers between the buttons of his vest  in her affection for raymies defender in her desire to discover artistic talent carol prepared to be delighted by the recital  raymie sang fly as a bird thou art my dove and when the little swallow leaves its tiny nest all in a reasonably bad offertory tenor  carol was shuddering with the vicarious shame which sensitive people feel when they listen to an elocutionist being humorous or to a precocious child publicly doing badly what no child should do at all she wanted to laugh at the gratified importance in raymies halfshut eyes she wanted to weep over the meek ambitiousness which clouded like an aura his pale face flap ears and sandy pompadour she tried to look admiring for the benefit of miss sherwin that trusting admirer of all that was or conceivably could be the good the true and the beautiful  at the end of the third ornithological lyric miss sherwin roused from her attitude of inspired vision and breathed to carol my that was sweet of course raymond hasnt an unusually good voice but dont you think he puts such a lot of feeling into it  carol lied blackly and magnificently but without originality oh yes i do think he has so much feeling  she saw that after the strain of listening in a cultured manner the audience had collapsed had given up their last hope of being amused she cried now were going to play an idiotic game which i learned in chicago you will have to take off your shoes for a starter after that you will probably break your knees and shoulderblades  much attention and incredulity a few eyebrows indicating a verdict that doc kennicotts bride was noisy and improper  i shall choose the most vicious like juanita haydock and myself as the shepherds the rest of you are wolves your shoes are the sheep the wolves go out into the hall the shepherds scatter the sheep through this room then turn off all the lights and the wolves crawl in from the hall and in the darkness they try to get the shoes away from the shepherdswho are permitted to do anything except bite and use blackjacks the wolves chuck the captured shoes out into the hall no one excused come on shoes off  every one looked at every one else and waited for every one else to begin  carol kicked off her silver slippers and ignored the universal glance at her arches the embarrassed but loyal vida sherwin unbuttoned her high black shoes ezra stowbody cackled well youre a terror to old folks youre like the gals i used to go horsebackriding with back in the sixties aint much accustomed to attending parties barefoot but here goes with a whoop and a gallant jerk ezra snatched off his elasticsided congress shoes  the others giggled and followed  when the sheep had been penned up in the darkness the timorous wolves crept into the livingroom squealing halting thrown out of their habit of stolidity by the strangeness of advancing through nothingness toward a waiting foe a mysterious foe which expanded and grew more menacing the wolves peered to make out landmarks they touched gliding arms which did not seem to be attached to a body they quivered with a rapture of fear reality had vanished a yelping squabble suddenly rose then juanita haydocks high titter and guy pollocks astonished ouch quit youre scalping me  mrs luke dawson galloped backward on stiff hands and knees into the safety of the lighted hallway moaning i declare i nev was so upset in my life but the propriety was shaken out of her and she delightedly continued to ejaculate nev in my life as she saw the livingroom door opened by invisible hands and shoes hurling through it as she heard from the darkness beyond the door a squawling a bumping a resolute heres a lot of shoes come on you wolves ow y would would you  when carol abruptly turned on the lights in the embattled livingroom half of the company were sitting back against the walls where they had craftily remained throughout the engagement but in the middle of the floor kennicott was wrestling with harry haydocktheir collars torn off their hair in their eyes and the owlish mr julius flickerbaugh was retreating from juanita haydock and gulping with unaccustomed laughter guy pollocks discreet brown scarf hung down his back young rita simonss net blouse had lost two buttons and betrayed more of her delicious plump shoulder than was regarded as pure in gopher prairie whether by shock disgust joy of combat or physical activity all the party were freed from their years of social decorum george edwin mott giggled luke dawson twisted his beard mrs clark insisted i did too sami got a shoei never knew i could fight so terrible  carol was certain that she was a great reformer  she mercifully had combs mirrors brushes needle and thread ready she permitted them to restore the divine decency of buttons  the grinning bea brought downstairs a pile of soft thick sheets of paper with designs of lotos blossoms dragons apes in cobalt and crimson and gray and patterns of purple birds flying among seagreen trees in the valleys of nowhere  these carol announced are real chinese masquerade costumes i got them from an importing shop in minneapolis you are to put them on over your clothes and please forget that you are minnesotans and turn into mandarins and coolies andand samurai isnt it and anything else you can think of  while they were shyly rustling the paper costumes she disappeared ten minutes after she gazed down from the stairs upon grotesquely ruddy yankee heads above oriental robes and cried to them the princess winky poo salutes her court  as they looked up she caught their suspense of admiration they saw an airy figure in trousers and coat of green brocade edged with gold a high gold collar under a proud chin black hair pierced with jade pins a languid peacock fan in an outstretched hand eyes uplifted to a vision of pagoda towers when she dropped her pose and smiled down she discovered kennicott apoplectic with domestic prideand gray guy pollock staring beseechingly for a second she saw nothing in all the pink and brown mass of their faces save the hunger of the two men  she shook off the spell and ran down were going to have a real chinese concert messrs pollock kennicott and well stowbody are drummers the rest of us sing and play the fife  the fifes were combs with tissue paper the drums were tabourets and the sewingtable loren wheeler editor of the dauntless led the orchestra with a ruler and a totally inaccurate sense of rhythm the music was a reminiscence of tomtoms heard at circus fortunetelling tents or at the minnesota state fair but the whole company pounded and puffed and whined in a singsong and looked rapturous  before they were quite tired of the concert carol led them in a dancing procession to the diningroom to blue bowls of chow mein with lichee nuts and ginger preserved in syrup  none of them save that cityrounder harry haydock had heard of any chinese dish except chop sooey with agreeable doubt they ventured through the bamboo shoots into the golden fried noodles of the chow mein and dave dyer did a not very humorous chinese dance with nat hicks and there was hubbub and contentment  carol relaxed and found that she was shockingly tired she had carried them on her thin shoulders she could not keep it up she longed for her father that artist at creating hysterical parties she thought of smoking a cigarette to shock them and dismissed the obscene thought before it was quite formed she wondered whether they could for five minutes be coaxed to talk about something besides the winter top of knute stamquists ford and what al tingley had said about his motherinlaw she sighed oh let em alone ive done enough she crossed her trousered legs and snuggled luxuriously above her saucer of ginger she caught pollocks congratulatory still smile and thought well of herself for having thrown a rose light on the pallid lawyer repented the heretical supposition that any male save her husband existed jumped up to find kennicott and whisper happy my lord    no it didnt cost much  best party this town ever saw onlydont cross your legs in that costume shows your knees too plain  she was vexed she resented his clumsiness she returned to guy pollock and talked of chinese religionsnot that she knew anything whatever about chinese religions but he had read a book on the subject as on lonely evenings in his office he had read at least one book on every subject in the world guys thin maturity was changing in her vision to flushed youth and they were roaming an island in the yellow sea of chatter when she realized that the guests were beginning that cough which indicated in the universal instinctive language that they desired to go home and go to bed  while they asserted that it had been the nicest party theyd ever seenmy so clever and original she smiled tremendously shook hands and cried many suitable things regarding children and being sure to wrap up warmly and raymies singing and juanita haydocks prowess at games then she turned wearily to kennicott in a house filled with quiet and crumbs and shreds of chinese costumes  he was gurgling i tell you carrie you certainly are a wonder and guess youre right about waking folks up now youve showed em how they wont go on having the same old kind of parties and stunts and everything here dont touch a thing done enough pop up to bed and ill clear up  his wise surgeonshands stroked her shoulder and her irritation at his clumsiness was lost in his strength    v  from the weekly dauntless   one of the most delightful social events of recent months was held wednesday evening in the housewarming of dr and mrs kennicott who have completely redecorated their charming home on poplar street and is now extremely nifty in modern color scheme the doctor and his bride were at home to their numerous friends and a number of novelties in diversions were held including a chinese orchestra in original and genuine oriental costumes of which ye editor was leader dainty refreshments were served in true oriental style and one and all voted a delightful time    vi   the week after the chet dashaways gave a party the circle of mourners kept its place all evening and dave dyer did the stunt of the norwegian and the hen    chapter vii  i  gopher prairie was digging in for the winter through late november and all december it snowed daily the thermometer was at zero and might drop to twenty below or thirty winter is not a season in the north middlewest it is an industry storm sheds were erected at every door in every block the householders sam clark the wealthy mr dawson all save asthmatic ezra stowbody who extravagantly hired a boy were seen perilously staggering up ladders carrying storm windows and screwing them to secondstory jambs while kennicott put up his windows carol danced inside the bedrooms and begged him not to swallow the screws which he held in his mouth like an extraordinary set of external false teeth  the universal sign of winter was the town handymanmiles bjornstam a tall thick redmustached bachelor opinionated atheist generalstore arguer cynical santa claus children loved him and he sneaked away from work to tell them improbable stories of seafaring and horsetrading and bears the childrens parents either laughed at him or hated him he was the one democrat in town he called both lyman cass the miller and the finn homesteader from lost lake by their first names he was known as the red swede and considered slightly insane  bjornstam could do anything with his handssolder a pan weld an automobile spring soothe a frightened filly tinker a clock carve a gloucester schooner which magically went into a bottle now for a week he was commissioner general of gopher prairie he was the only person besides the repairman at sam clarks who understood plumbing everybody begged him to look over the furnace and the waterpipes he rushed from house to house till after bedtimeten oclock icicles from burst waterpipes hung along the skirt of his brown dogskin overcoat his plush cap which he never took off in the house was a pulp of ice and coaldust his red hands were cracked to rawness he chewed the stub of a cigar  but he was courtly to carol he stooped to examine the furnace flues he straightened glanced down at her and hemmed got to fix your furnace no matter what else i do  the poorer houses of gopher prairie where the services of miles bjornstam were a luxurywhich included the shanty of miles bjornstamwere banked to the lower windows with earth and manure along the railroad the sections of snow fence which had been stacked all summer in romantic wooden tents occupied by roving small boys were set up to prevent drifts from covering the track  the farmers came into town in homemade sleighs with bedquilts and hay piled in the rough boxes  fur coats fur caps fur mittens overshoes buckling almost to the knees gray knitted scarfs ten feet long thick woolen socks canvas jackets lined with fluffy yellow wool like the plumage of ducklings moccasins red flannel wristlets for the blazing chapped wrists of boysthese protections against winter were busily dug out of mothballsprinkled drawers and tarbags in closets and all over town small boys were squealing oh theres my mittens or look at my shoepacks there is so sharp a division between the panting summer and the stinging winter of the northern plains that they rediscovered with surprise and a feeling of heroism this armor of an artic explorer  winter garments surpassed even personal gossip as the topic at parties it was good form to ask put on your heavies yet there were as many distinctions in wraps as in motor cars the lesser sort appeared in yellow and black dogskin coats but kennicott was lordly in a long raccoon ulster and a new seal cap when the snow was too deep for his motor he went off on country calls in a shiny floral steeltipped cutter only his ruddy nose and his cigar emerging from the fur  carol herself stirred main street by a loose coat of nutria her fingertips loved the silken fur  her liveliest activity now was organizing outdoor sports in the motorparalyzed town  the automobile and bridgewhist had not only made more evident the social divisions in gopher prairie but they had also enfeebled the love of activity it was so richlooking to sit and driveand so easy skiing and sliding were stupid and oldfashioned in fact the village longed for the elegance of city recreations almost as much as the cities longed for village sports and gopher prairie took as much pride in neglecting coasting as st paulor new yorkin going coasting carol did inspire a successful skatingparty in midnovember plover lake glistened in clear sweeps of graygreen ice ringing to the skates on shore the icetipped reeds clattered in the wind and oak twigs with stubborn last leaves hung against a milky sky harry haydock did figureeights and carol was certain that she had found the perfect life but when snow had ended the skating and she tried to get up a moonlight sliding party the matrons hesitated to stir away from their radiators and their daily bridgewhist imitations of the city she had to nag them they scooted down a long hill on a bobsled they upset and got snow down their necks they shrieked that they would do it again immediatelyand they did not do it again at all  she badgered another group into going skiing they shouted and threw snowballs and informed her that it was such fun and theyd have another skiing expedition right away and they jollily returned home and never thereafter left their manuals of bridge  carol was discouraged she was grateful when kennicott invited her to go rabbithunting in the woods she waded down stilly cloisters between burnt stump and icy oak through drifts marked with a million hieroglyphics of rabbit and mouse and bird she squealed as he leaped on a pile of brush and fired at the rabbit which ran out he belonged there masculine in reefer and sweater and highlaced boots that night she ate prodigiously of steak and fried potatoes she produced electric sparks by touching his ear with her fingertip she slept twelve hours and awoke to think how glorious was this brave land  she rose to a radiance of sun on snow snug in her furs she trotted uptown frosted shingles smoked against a sky colored like flaxblossoms sleighbells clinked shouts of greeting were loud in the thin bright air and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of woodsawing it was saturday and the neighbors sons were getting up the winter fuel behind walls of corded wood in back yards their sawbucks stood in depressions scattered with canaryyellow flakes of sawdust the frames of their bucksaws were cherryred the blades blued steel and the fresh cut ends of the stickspoplar maple ironwood birchwere marked with engraved rings of growth the boys wore shoepacks blue flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons and mackinaws of crimson lemon yellow and foxy brown  carol cried fine day to the boys she came in a glow to howland  goulds grocery her collar white with frost from her breath she bought a can of tomatoes as though it were orient fruit and returned home planning to surprise kennicott with an omelet creole for dinner  so brilliant was the snowglare that when she entered the house she saw the doorknobs the newspaper on the table every white surface as dazzling mauve and her head was dizzy in the pyrotechnic dimness when her eyes had recovered she felt expanded drunk with health mistress of life the world was so luminous that she sat down at her rickety little desk in the livingroom to make a poem she got no farther than the sky is bright the sun is warm there neer will be another storm  in the midafternoon of this same day kennicott was called into the country it was beas evening outher evening for the lutheran dance carol was alone from three till midnight she wearied of reading pure love stories in the magazines and sat by a radiator beginning to brood  thus she chanced to discover that she had nothing to do    ii   she had she meditated passed through the novelty of seeing the town and meeting people of skating and sliding and hunting bea was competent there was no household labor except sewing and darning and gossipy assistance to bea in bedmaking she couldnt satisfy her ingenuity in planning meals at dahl  olesons meat market you didnt give ordersyou wofully inquired whether there was anything today besides steak and pork and ham the cuts of beef were not cuts they were hacks lamb chops were as exotic as sharks fins the meatdealers shipped their best to the city with its higher prices  in all the shops there was the same lack of choice she could not find a glassheaded picturenail in town she did not hunt for the sort of veiling she wantedshe took what she could get and only at howland  goulds was there such a luxury as canned asparagus routine care was all she could devote to the house only by such fussing as the widow bogarts could she make it fill her time  she could not have outside employment to the village doctors wife it was taboo  she was a woman with a working brain and no work  there were only three things which she could do have children start her career of reforming or become so definitely a part of the town that she would be fulfilled by the activities of church and studyclub and bridgeparties  children yes she wanted them butshe was not quite ready she had been embarrassed by kennicotts frankness but she agreed with him that in the insane condition of civilization which made the rearing of citizens more costly and perilous than any other crime it was inadvisable to have children till he had made more money she was sorryperhaps he had made all the mystery of love a mechanical cautiousness butshe fled from the thought with a dubious some day  her reforms her impulses toward beauty in raw main street they had become indistinct but she would set them going now she would she swore it with soft fist beating the edges of the radiator and at the end of all her vows she had no notion as to when and where the crusade was to begin  become an authentic part of the town she began to think with unpleasant lucidity she reflected that she did not know whether the people liked her she had gone to the women at afternooncoffees to the merchants in their stores with so many outpouring comments and whimsies that she hadnt given them a chance to betray their opinions of her the men smiledbut did they like her she was lively among the womenbut was she one of them she could not recall many times when she had been admitted to the whispering of scandal which is the secret chamber of gopher prairie conversation  she was poisoned with doubt as she drooped up to bed  next day through her shopping her mind sat back and observed dave dyer and sam clark were as cordial as she had been fancying but wasnt there an impersonal abruptness in the h are yuh of chet dashaway howland the grocer was curt was that merely his usual manner  its infuriating to have to pay attention to what people think in st paul i didnt care but here im spied on theyre watching me i mustnt let it make me selfconscious she coaxed herselfoverstimulated by the drug of thought and offensively on the defensive    iii   a thaw which stripped the snow from the sidewalks a ringing iron night when the lakes could be heard booming a clear roistering morning in tam oshanter and tweed skirt carol felt herself a college junior going out to play hockey she wanted to whoop her legs ached to run on the way home from shopping she yielded as a pup would have yielded she galloped down a block and as she jumped from a curb across a welter of slush she gave a student yippee  she saw that in a window three old women were gasping their triple glare was paralyzing across the street at another window the curtain had secretively moved she stopped walked on sedately changed from the girl carol into mrs dr kennicott  she never again felt quite young enough and defiant enough and free enough to run and halloo in the public streets and it was as a nice married woman that she attended the next weekly bridge of the jolly seventeen    iv   the jolly seventeen the membership of which ranged from fourteen to twentysix was the social cornice of gopher prairie it was the country club the diplomatic set the st cecilia the ritz oval room the club de vingt to belong to it was to be in though its membership partly coincided with that of the thanatopsis study club the jolly seventeen as a separate entity guffawed at the thanatopsis and considered it middleclass and even highbrow  most of the jolly seventeen were young married women with their husbands as associate members once a week they had a womens afternoonbridge once a month the husbands joined them for supper and eveningbridge twice a year they had dances at i o o f hall then the town exploded only at the annual balls of the firemen and of the eastern star was there such prodigality of chiffon scarfs and tangoing and heartburnings and these rival institutions were not selecthired girls attended the firemens ball with sectionhands and laborers ella stowbody had once gone to a jolly seventeen soiree in the village hack hitherto confined to chief mourners at funerals and harry haydock and dr terry gould always appeared in the towns only specimens of evening clothes  the afternoonbridge of the jolly seventeen which followed carols lonely doubting was held at juanita haydocks new concrete bungalow with its door of polished oak and beveled plateglass jar of ferns in the plastered hall and in the livingroom a fumed oak morris chair sixteen colorprints and a square varnished table with a mat made of cigarribbons on which was one illustrated gift edition and one pack of cards in a burntleather case  carol stepped into a sirocco of furnace heat they were already playing despite her flabby resolves she had not yet learned bridge she was winningly apologetic about it to juanita and ashamed that she should have to go on being apologetic  mrs dave dyer a sallow woman with a thin prettiness devoted to experiments in religious cults illnesses and scandalbearing shook her finger at carol and trilled youre a naughty one i dont believe you appreciate the honor when you got into the jolly seventeen so easy  mrs chet dashaway nudged her neighbor at the second table but carol kept up the appealing bridal manner so far as possible she twittered youre perfectly right im a lazy thing ill make will start teaching me this very evening her supplication had all the sound of birdies in the nest and easter churchbells and frosted christmas cards internally she snarled that ought to be saccharine enough she sat in the smallest rockingchair a model of victorian modesty but she saw or she imagined that the women who had gurgled at her so welcomingly when she had first come to gopher prairie were nodding at her brusquely  during the pause after the first game she petitioned mrs jackson elder dont you think we ought to get up another bobsled party soon  its so cold when you get dumped in the snow said mrs elder indifferently  i hate snow down my neck volunteered mrs dave dyer with an unpleasant look at carol and turning her back she bubbled at rita simons dearie wont you run in this evening ive got the loveliest new butterick pattern i want to show you  carol crept back to her chair in the fervor of discussing the game they ignored her she was not used to being a wallflower she struggled to keep from oversensitiveness from becoming unpopular by the sure method of believing that she was unpopular but she hadnt much reserve of patience and at the end of the second game when ella stowbody sniffily asked her are you going to send to minneapolis for your dress for the next soireeheard you were carol said dont know yet with unnecessary sharpness  she was relieved by the admiration with which the jeune fille rita simons looked at the steel buckles on her pumps but she resented mrs howlands tart demand dont you find that new couch of yours is too broad to be practical she nodded then shook her head and touchily left mrs howland to get out of it any meaning she desired immediately she wanted to make peace she was close to simpering in the sweetness with which she addressed mrs howland i think that is the prettiest display of beeftea your husband has in his store  oh yes gopher prairie isnt so much behind the times gibed mrs howland some one giggled  their rebuffs made her haughty her haughtiness irritated them to franker rebuffs they were working up to a state of painfully righteous war when they were saved by the coming of food  though juanita haydock was highly advanced in the matters of fingerbowls doilies and bathmats her refreshments were typical of all the afternooncoffees juanitas best friends mrs dyer and mrs dashaway passed large dinner plates each with a spoon a fork and a coffee cup without saucer they apologized and discussed the afternoons game as they passed through the thicket of womens feet then they distributed hot buttered rolls coffee poured from an enamelware pot stuffed olives potato salad and angelsfood cake there was even in the most strictly conforming gopher prairie circles a certain option as to collations the olives need not be stuffed doughnuts were in some houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls but there was in all the town no heretic save carol who omitted angelsfood  they ate enormously carol had a suspicion that the thriftier housewives made the afternoon treat do for evening supper  she tried to get back into the current she edged over to mrs mcganum chunky amiable young mrs mcganum with her breast and arms of a milkmaid and her loud delayed laugh which burst startlingly from a sober face was the daughter of old dr westlake and the wife of westlakes partner dr mcganum kennicott asserted that westlake and mcganum and their contaminated families were tricky but carol had found them gracious she asked for friendliness by crying to mrs mcganum how is the babys throat now and she was attentive while mrs mcganum rocked and knitted and placidly described symptoms  vida sherwin came in after school with miss ethel villets the town librarian miss sherwins optimistic presence gave carol more confidence she talked she informed the circle i drove almost down to wahkeenyan with will a few days ago isnt the country lovely and i do admire the scandinavian farmers down there so their big red barns and silos and milkingmachines and everything do you all know that lonely lutheran church with the tincovered spire that stands out alone on a hill its so bleak somehow it seems so brave i do think the scandinavians are the hardiest and best people  oh do you think so protested mrs jackson elder my husband says the svenskas that work in the planingmill are perfectly terribleso silent and cranky and so selfish the way they keep demanding raises if they had their way theyd simply ruin the business  yes and theyre simply ghastly hired girls wailed mrs dave dyer i swear i work myself to skin and bone trying to please my hired girlswhen i can get them i do everything in the world for them they can have their gentleman friends call on them in the kitchen any time and they get just the same to eat as we do if theres any left over and i practically never jump on them  juanita haydock rattled theyre ungrateful all that class of people i do think the domestic problem is simply becoming awful i dont know what the countrys coming to with these scandahoofian clodhoppers demanding every cent you can save and so ignorant and impertinent and on my word demanding bathtubs and everythingas if they werent mighty good and lucky at home if they got a bath in the washtub  they were off riding hard carol thought of bea and waylaid them  but isnt it possibly the fault of the mistresses if the maids are ungrateful for generations weve given them the leavings of food and holes to live in i dont want to boast but i must say i dont have much trouble with bea shes so friendly the scandinavians are sturdy and honest  mrs dave dyer snapped honest do you call it honest to hold us up for every cent of pay they can get i cant say that ive had any of them steal anything though you might call it stealing to eat so much that a roast of beef hardly lasts three days but just the same i dont intend to let them think they can put anything over on me i always make them pack and unpack their trunks downstairs right under my eyes and then i know they arent being tempted to dishonesty by any slackness on my part  how much do the maids get here carol ventured  mrs b j gougerling wife of the banker stated in a shocked manner any place from threefifty to fivefifty a week i know positively that mrs clark after swearing that she wouldnt weaken and encourage them in their outrageous demands went and paid fivefiftythink of it practically a dollar a day for unskilled work and of course her food and room and a chance to do her own washing right in with the rest of the wash how much do you pay mrs kennicott  yes how much do you pay insisted half a dozen  wwhy i pay six a week she feebly confessed  they gasped juanita protested dont you think its hard on the rest of us when you pay so much juanitas demand was reinforced by the universal glower  carol was angry i dont care a maid has one of the hardest jobs on earth she works from ten to eighteen hours a day she has to wash slimy dishes and dirty clothes she tends the children and runs to the door with wet chapped hands and  mrs dave dyer broke into carols peroration with a furious thats all very well but believe me i do those things myself when im without a maidand thats a good share of the time for a person that isnt willing to yield and pay exorbitant wages  carol was retorting but a maid does it for strangers and all she gets out of it is the pay  their eyes were hostile four of them were talking at once vida sherwins dictatorial voice cut through took control of the revolution  tut tut tut tut what angry passionsand what an idiotic discussion all of you getting too serious stop it carol kennicott youre probably right but youre too much ahead of the times juanita quit looking so belligerent what is this a card party or a hen fight carol you stop admiring yourself as the joan of arc of the hired girls or ill spank you you come over here and talk libraries with ethel villets boooooo if theres any more pecking ill take charge of the hen roost myself  they all laughed artificially and carol obediently talked libraries  a smalltown bungalow the wives of a village doctor and a village drygoods merchant a provincial teacher a colloquial brawl over paying a servant a dollar more a week yet this insignificance echoed cellarplots and cabinet meetings and labor conferences in persia and prussia rome and boston and the orators who deemed themselves international leaders were but the raised voices of a billion juanitas denouncing a million carols with a hundred thousand vida sherwins trying to shoo away the storm  carol felt guilty she devoted herself to admiring the spinsterish miss villetsand immediately committed another offense against the laws of decency  we havent seen you at the library yet miss villets reproved  ive wanted to run in so much but ive been getting settled andill probably come in so often youll get tired of me i hear you have such a nice library  there are many who like it we have two thousand more books than wakamin  isnt that fine im sure you are largely responsible ive had some experience in st paul  so i have been informed not that i entirely approve of library methods in these large cities so careless letting tramps and all sorts of dirty persons practically sleep in the readingrooms  i know but the poor soulswell im sure you will agree with me in one thing the chief task of a librarian is to get people to read  you feel so my feeling mrs kennicott and i am merely quoting the librarian of a very large college is that the first duty of the conscientious librarian is to preserve the books  oh carol repented her oh miss villets stiffened and attacked  it may be all very well in cities where they have unlimited funds to let nasty children ruin books and just deliberately tear them up and fresh young men take more books out than they are entitled to by the regulations but im never going to permit it in this library  what if some children are destructive they learn to read books are cheaper than minds  nothing is cheaper than the minds of some of these children that come in and bother me simply because their mothers dont keep them home where they belong some librarians may choose to be so wishywashy and turn their libraries into nursinghomes and kindergartens but as long as im in charge the gopher prairie library is going to be quiet and decent and the books well kept  carol saw that the others were listening waiting for her to be objectionable she flinched before their dislike she hastened to smile in agreement with miss villets to glance publicly at her wristwatch to warble that it was so latehave to hurry homehusbandsuch nice partymaybe you were right about maids prejudiced because bea so nicesuch perfectly divine angelsfood mrs haydock must give me the recipegoodby such happy party  she walked home she reflected it was my fault i was touchy and i opposed them so much onlyi cant i cant be one of them if i must damn all the maids toiling in filthy kitchens all the ragged hungry children and these women are to be my arbiters the rest of my life  she ignored beas call from the kitchen she ran upstairs to the unfrequented guestroom she wept in terror her body a pale arc as she knelt beside a cumbrous blackwalnut bed beside a puffy mattress covered with a red quilt in a shuttered and airless room    chapter viii   dont i in looking for things to do show that im not attentive enough to will am i impressed enough by his work i will be oh i will be if i cant be one of the town if i must be an outcast  when kennicott came home she bustled dear you must tell me a lot more about your cases i want to know i want to understand  sure you bet and he went down to fix the furnace  at supper she asked for instance what did you do today  do today how do you mean  medically i want to understand  today oh there wasnt much of anything couple chumps with bellyaches and a sprained wrist and a fool woman that thinks she wants to kill herself because her husband doesnt like her andjust routine work  but the unhappy woman doesnt sound routine  her just case of nerves you cant do much with these marriage mixups  but dear please will you tell me about the next case that you do think is interesting  sure you bet tell you about anything thatsay thats pretty good salmon get it at howlands    ii   four days after the jolly seventeen debacle vida sherwin called and casually blew carols world to pieces  may i come in and gossip a while she said with such excess of bright innocence that carol was uneasy vida took off her furs with a bounce she sat down as though it were a gymnasium exercise she flung out  feel disgracefully good this weather raymond wutherspoon says if he had my energy hed be a grand opera singer i always think this climate is the finest in the world and my friends are the dearest people in the world and my work is the most essential thing in the world probably i fool myself but i know one thing for certain youre the pluckiest little idiot in the world  and so you are about to flay me alive carol was cheerful about it  am i perhaps ive been wonderingi know that the third party to a squabble is often the most to blame the one who runs between a and b having a beautiful time telling each of them what the other has said but i want you to take a big part in vitalizing gopher prairie and sosuch a very unique opportunity andam i silly  i know what you mean i was too abrupt at the jolly seventeen  it isnt that matter of fact im glad you told them some wholesome truths about servants though perhaps you were just a bit tactless its bigger than that i wonder if you understand that in a secluded community like this every newcomer is on test people cordial to her but watching her all the time i remember when a latin teacher came here from wellesley they resented her broad a were sure it was affected of course they have discussed you  have they talked about me much  my dear  i always feel as though i walked around in a cloud looking out at others but not being seen i feel so inconspicuous and so normalso normal that theres nothing about me to discuss i cant realize that mr and mrs haydock must gossip about me carol was working up a small passion of distaste and i dont like it it makes me crawly to think of their daring to talk over all i do and say pawing me over i resent it i hate  wait child perhaps they resent some things in you i want you to try and be impersonal theyd paw over anybody who came in new didnt you with newcomers in college  yes  well then will you be impersonal im paying you the compliment of supposing that you can be i want you to be big enough to help me make this town worth while  ill be as impersonal as cold boiled potatoes not that i shall ever be able to help you make the town worth while what do they say about me really i want to know  of course the illiterate ones resent your references to anything farther away than minneapolis theyre so suspiciousthats it suspicious and some think you dress too well  oh they do do they shall i dress in gunnysacking to suit them  please are you going to be a baby  ill be good sulkily  you certainly will or i wont tell you one single thing you must understand this im not asking you to change yourself just want you to know what they think you must do that no matter how absurd their prejudices are if youre going to handle them is it your ambition to make this a better town or isnt it  i dont know whether it is or not  whywhytut tut now of course it is why i depend on you youre a born reformer  i am notnot any more  of course you are  oh if i really could helpso they think im affected  my lamb they do now dont say theyre nervy after all gopher prairie standards are as reasonable to gopher prairie as lake shore drive standards are to chicago and theres more gopher prairies than there are chicagos or londons andill tell you the whole story they think youre showing off when you say american instead of ammurrican they think youre too frivolous lifes so serious to them that they cant imagine any kind of laughter except juanitas snortling ethel villets was sure you were patronizing her when  oh i was not  you talked about encouraging reading and mrs elder thought you were patronizing when you said she had such a pretty little car she thinks its an enormous car and some of the merchants say youre too flip when you talk to them in the store and  poor me when i was trying to be friendly  every housewife in town is doubtful about your being so chummy with your bea all right to be kind but they say you act as though she were your cousin wait now theres plenty more and they think you were eccentric in furnishing this roomthey think the broad couch and that japanese dingus are absurd wait i know theyre silly and i guess ive heard a dozen criticize you because you dont go to church oftener and  i cant stand iti cant bear to realize that theyve been saying all these things while ive been going about so happily and liking them i wonder if you ought to have told me it will make me selfconscious  i wonder the same thing only answer i can get is the old saw about knowledge being power and some day youll see how absorbing it is to have power even here to control the townoh im a crank but i do like to see things moving  it hurts it makes these people seem so beastly and treacherous when ive been perfectly natural with them but lets have it all what did they say about my chinese housewarming party  why uh  go on or ill make up worse things than anything you can tell me  they did enjoy it but i guess some of them felt you were showing offpretending that your husband is richer than he is  i canttheir meanness of mind is beyond any horrors i could imagine they really thought that iand you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap who dared to say that the rich or the poor  fairly well assorted  cant they at least understand me well enough to see that though i might be affected and culturine at least i simply couldnt commit that other kind of vulgarity if they must know you may tell them with my compliments that will makes about four thousand a year and the party cost half of what they probably thought it did chinese things are not very expensive and i made my own costume  stop it stop beating me i know all that what they meant was they felt you were starting dangerous competition by giving a party such as most people here cant afford four thousand is a pretty big income for this town  i never thought of starting competition will you believe that it was in all love and friendliness that i tried to give them the gayest party i could it was foolish it was childish and noisy but i did mean it so well  i know of course and it certainly is unfair of them to make fun of your having that chinese foodchow men was itand to laugh about your wearing those pretty trousers  carol sprang up whimpering oh they didnt do that they didnt poke fun at my feast that i ordered so carefully for them and my little chinese costume that i was so happy makingi made it secretly to surprise them and theyve been ridiculing it all this while  she was huddled on the couch  vida was stroking her hair muttering i shouldnt  shrouded in shame carol did not know when vida slipped away the clocks bell at half past five aroused her i must get hold of myself before will comes i hope he never knows what a fool his wife is    frozen sneering horrible hearts  like a very small very lonely girl she trudged upstairs slow step by step her feet dragging her hand on the rail it was not her husband to whom she wanted to run for protectionit was her father her smiling understanding father dead these twelve years    iii   kennicott was yawning stretched in the largest chair between the radiator and a small kerosene stove  cautiously will dear i wonder if the people here dont criticize me sometimes they must i mean if they ever do you mustnt let it bother you  criticize you lord i should say not they all keep telling me youre the swellest girl they ever saw  well ive just fanciedthe merchants probably think im too fussy about shopping im afraid i bore mr dashaway and mr howland and mr ludelmeyer  i can tell you how that is i didnt want to speak of it but since youve brought it up chet dashaway probably resents the fact that you got this new furniture down in the cities instead of here i didnt want to raise any objection at the time butafter all i make my money here and they naturally expect me to spend it here  if mr dashaway will kindly tell me how any civilized person can furnish a room out of the mortuary pieces that he calls she remembered she said meekly but i understand  and howland and ludelmeyeroh youve probably handed em a few roasts for the bum stocks they carry when you just meant to jolly em but rats what do we care this is an independent town not like these eastern holes where you have to watch your step all the time and live up to fool demands and social customs and a lot of old tabbies always busy criticizing everybodys free here to do what he wants to he said it with a flourish and carol perceived that he believed it she turned her breath of fury into a yawn  by the way carrie while were talking of this of course i like to keep independent and i dont believe in this business of binding yourself to trade with the man that trades with you unless you really want to but same time id be just as glad if you dealt with jenson or ludelmeyer as much as you ran instead of howland  gould who go to dr gould every last time and the whole tribe of em the same way i dont see why i should be paying out my good money for groceries and having them pass it on to terry gould  ive gone to howland  gould because theyre better and cleaner  i know i dont mean cut them out entirely course jenson is trickygive you short weightand ludelmeyer is a shiftless old dutch hog but same time i mean lets keep the trade in the family whenever it is convenient see how i mean  i see  well guess its about time to turn in  he yawned went out to look at the thermometer slammed the door patted her head unbuttoned his waistcoat yawned wound the clock went down to look at the furnace yawned and clumped upstairs to bed casually scratching his thick woolen undershirt  till he bawled arent you ever coming up to bed she sat unmoving    chapter ix   i  she had tripped into the meadow to teach the lambs a pretty educational dance and found that the lambs were wolves there was no way out between their pressing gray shoulders she was surrounded by fangs and sneering eyes  she could not go on enduring the hidden derision she wanted to flee she wanted to hide in the generous indifference of cities she practised saying to kennicott think perhaps ill run down to st paul for a few days but she could not trust herself to say it carelessly could not abide his certain questioning  reform the town all she wanted was to be tolerated  she could not look directly at people she flushed and winced before citizens who a week ago had been amusing objects of study and in their goodmornings she heard a cruel sniggering  she encountered juanita haydock at ole jensons grocery she besought oh how do you do heavens what beautiful celery that is  yes doesnt it look fresh harry simply has to have his celery on sunday drat the man  carol hastened out of the shop exulting she didnt make fun of me    did she  in a week she had recovered from consciousness of insecurity of shame and whispering notoriety but she kept her habit of avoiding people she walked the streets with her head down when she spied mrs mcganum or mrs dyer ahead she crossed over with an elaborate pretense of looking at a billboard always she was acting for the benefit of every one she sawand for the benefit of the ambushed leering eyes which she did not see  she perceived that vida sherwin had told the truth whether she entered a store or swept the back porch or stood at the baywindow in the livingroom the village peeped at her once she had swung along the street triumphant in making a home now she glanced at each house and felt when she was safely home that she had won past a thousand enemies armed with ridicule she told herself that her sensitiveness was preposterous but daily she was thrown into panic she saw curtains slide back into innocent smoothness old women who had been entering their houses slipped out again to stare at herin the wintry quiet she could hear them tiptoeing on their porches when she had for a blessed hour forgotten the searchlight when she was scampering through a chill dusk happy in yellow windows against gray night her heart checked as she realized that a head covered with a shawl was thrust up over a snowtipped bush to watch her  she admitted that she was taking herself too seriously that villagers gape at every one she became placid and thought well of her philosophy but next morning she had a shock of shame as she entered ludelmeyers the grocer his clerk and neurotic mrs dave dyer had been giggling about something they halted looked embarrassed babbled about onions carol felt guilty that evening when kennicott took her to call on the crochety lyman casses their hosts seemed flustered at their arrival kennicott jovially hooted what makes you so hangdog lym the casses tittered feebly  except dave dyer sam clark and raymie wutherspoon there were no merchants of whose welcome carol was certain she knew that she read mockery into greetings but she could not control her suspicion could not rise from her psychic collapse she alternately raged and flinched at the superiority of the merchants they did not know that they were being rude but they meant to have it understood that they were prosperous and not scared of no doctors wife they often said one mans as good as anotherand a darn sight better this motto however they did not commend to farmer customers who had had crop failures the yankee merchants were crabbed and ole jenson ludelmeyer and gus dahl from the old country wished to be taken for yankees james madison howland born in new hampshire and ole jenson born in sweden both proved that they were free american citizens by grunting i dont know whether i got any or not or well you cant expect me to get it delivered by noon  it was good form for the customers to fight back juanita haydock cheerfully jabbered you have it there by twelve or ill snatch that fresh deliveryboy baldheaded but carol had never been able to play the game of friendly rudeness and now she was certain that she never would learn it she formed the cowardly habit of going to axel egges  axel was not respectable and rude he was still a foreigner and he expected to remain one his manner was heavy and uninterrogative his establishment was more fantastic than any crossroads store no one save axel himself could find anything a part of the assortment of childrens stockings was under a blanket on a shelf a part in a tin gingersnap box the rest heaped like a nest of blackcotton snakes upon a flourbarrel which was surrounded by brooms norwegian bibles dried cod for ludfisk boxes of apricots and a pair and a half of lumbermens rubberfooted boots the place was crowded with scandinavian farmwives standing aloof in shawls and ancient fawncolored leg o mutton jackets awaiting the return of their lords they spoke norwegian or swedish and looked at carol uncomprehendingly they were a relief to herthey were not whispering that she was a poseur  but what she told herself was that axel egges was so picturesque and romantic  it was in the matter of clothes that she was most selfconscious  when she dared to go shopping in her new checked suit with the blackembroidered sulphur collar she had as good as invited all of gopher prairie which interested itself in nothing so intimately as in new clothes and the cost thereof to investigate her it was a smart suit with lines unfamiliar to the dragging yellow and pink frocks of the town the widow bogarts stare from her porch indicated well i never saw anything like that before mrs mcganum stopped carol at the notions shop to hint my thats a nice suitwasnt it terribly expensive the gang of boys in front of the drug store commented hey pudgie play you a game of checkers on that dress carol could not endure it she drew her fur coat over the suit and hastily fastened the buttons while the boys snickered    ii   no group angered her quite so much as these staring young roues  she had tried to convince herself that the village with its fresh air its lakes for fishing and swimming was healthier than the artificial city but she was sickened by glimpses of the gang of boys from fourteen to twenty who loafed before dyers drug store smoking cigarettes displaying fancy shoes and purple ties and coats of diamondshaped buttons whistling the hoochikoochi and catcalling oh you babydoll at every passing girl  she saw them playing pool in the stinking room behind del snafflins barber shop and shaking dice in the smoke house and gathered in a snickering knot to listen to the juicy stories of bert tybee the bartender of the minniemashie house she heard them smacking moist lips over every lovescene at the rosebud movie palace at the counter of the greek confectionery parlor while they ate dreadful messes of decayed bananas acid cherries whipped cream and gelatinous icecream they screamed to one another hey lemme lone quit doggone you looka what you went and done you almost spilled my glass swater like hell i did hey gol darn your hide dont you go sticking your coffin nail in my iscream oh you batty how juh like dancing with tillie mcguire last night some squeezing heh kid  by diligent consultation of american fiction she discovered that this was the only virile and amusing manner in which boys could function that boys who were not compounded of the gutter and the miningcamp were mollycoddles and unhappy she had taken this for granted she had studied the boys pityingly but impersonally it had not occurred to her that they might touch her  now she was aware that they knew all about her that they were waiting for some affectation over which they could guffaw no schoolgirl passed their observationposts more flushingly than did mrs dr kennicott in shame she knew that they glanced appraisingly at her snowy overshoes speculating about her legs theirs were not young eyesthere was no youth in all the town she agonized they were born old grim and old and spying and censorious  she cried again that their youth was senile and cruel on the day when she overheard cy bogart and earl haydock  cyrus n bogart son of the righteous widow who lived across the alley was at this time a boy of fourteen or fifteen carol had already seen quite enough of cy bogart on her first evening in gopher prairie cy had appeared at the head of a charivari banging immensely upon a discarded automobile fender his companions were yelping in imitation of coyotes kennicott had felt rather complimented had gone out and distributed a dollar but cy was a capitalist in charivaris he returned with an entirely new group and this time there were three automobile fenders and a carnival rattle when kennicott again interrupted his shaving cy piped naw you got to give us two dollars and he got it a week later cy rigged a tictac to a window of the livingroom and the tattoo out of the darkness frightened carol into screaming since then in four months she had beheld cy hanging a cat stealing melons throwing tomatoes at the kennicott house and making skitracks across the lawn and had heard him explaining the mysteries of generation with great audibility and dismaying knowledge he was in fact a museum specimen of what a small town a welldisciplined public school a tradition of hearty humor and a pious mother could produce from the material of a courageous and ingenious mind  carol was afraid of him far from protesting when he set his mongrel on a kitten she worked hard at not seeing him  the kennicott garage was a shed littered with paintcans tools a lawnmower and ancient wisps of hay above it was a loft which cy bogart and earl haydock young brother of harry used as a den for smoking hiding from whippings and planning secret societies they climbed to it by a ladder on the alley side of the shed  this morning of late january two or three weeks after vidas revelations carol had gone into the stablegarage to find a hammer snow softened her step she heard voices in the loft above her  ah gee lezoh lez go down the lake and swipe some mushrats out of somebodys traps cy was yawning  and get our ears beat off grumbled earl haydock  gosh these cigarettes are dandy member when we were just kids and used to smoke cornsilk and hayseed  yup gosh  spit silence  say earl ma says if you chew tobacco you get consumption  aw rats your old lady is a crank  yuh thats so pause but she says she knows a fella that did  aw gee whiz didnt doc kennicott used to chew tobacco all the time before he married thishere girl from the cities he used to spitgee some shot he could hit a tree ten feet off  this was news to the girl from the cities  say how is she continued earl  huh hows who  you know who i mean smarty  a tussle a thumping of loose boards silence weary narration from cy  mrs kennicott oh shes all right i guess relief to carol below she gimme a hunk o cake one time but ma says shes stuckup as hell mas always talking about her ma says if mrs kennicott thought as much about the doc as she does about her clothes the doc wouldnt look so peaked  spit silence  yuh juanitas always talking about her too from earl she says mrs kennicott thinks she knows it all juanita says she has to laugh till she almost busts every time she sees mrs kennicott peerading along the street with that take a lookim a swell skirt way shes got but gosh i dont pay no attention to juanita shes meaner n a crab  ma was telling somebody that she heard that mrs kennicott claimed she made forty dollars a week when she was on some job in the cities and ma says she knows posolutely that she never made but eighteen a weekma says that when shes lived here a while she wont go round making a fool of herself pulling that bighead stuff on folks that know a whole lot more than she does theyre all laughing up their sleeves at her  say jever notice how mrs kennicott fusses around the house other evening when i was coming over here shed forgot to pull down the curtain and i watched her for ten minutes jeeze youd a died laughing she was there all alone and she must a spent five minutes getting a picture straight it was funny as hell the way shed stick out her finger to straighten the picturedeedledee see my tunnin ittle finger oh my aint i cute what a fine long tail my cats got  but say earl shes some goodlooker just the same and o ignatz the glad rags she must of bought for her wedding jever notice these lowcut dresses and these thin shimmyshirts she wears i had a good squint at em when they were out on the line with the wash and some ankles shes got heh  then carol fled  in her innocence she had not known that the whole town could discuss even her garments her body she felt that she was being dragged naked down main street  the moment it was dusk she pulled down the windowshades all the shades flush with the sill but beyond them she felt moist fleering eyes    iii   she remembered and tried to forget and remembered more sharply the vulgar detail of her husbands having observed the ancient customs of the land by chewing tobacco she would have preferred a prettier vicegambling or a mistress for these she might have found a luxury of forgiveness she could not remember any fascinatingly wicked hero of fiction who chewed tobacco she asserted that it proved him to be a man of the bold free west she tried to align him with the hairychested heroes of the motionpictures she curled on the couch a pallid softness in the twilight and fought herself and lost the battle spitting did not identify him with rangers riding the buttes it merely bound him to gopher prairieto nat hicks the tailor and bert tybee the bartender  but he gave it up for me oh what does it matter were all filthy in some things i think of myself as so superior but i do eat and digest i do wash my dirty paws and scratch im not a cool slim goddess on a column there arent any he gave it up for me he stands by me believing that every one loves me hes the rock of agesin a storm of meanness thats driving me mad    it will drive me mad  all evening she sang scotch ballads to kennicott and when she noticed that he was chewing an unlighted cigar she smiled maternally at his secret  she could not escape asking in the exact words and mental intonations which a thousand million women dairy wenches and mischiefmaking queens had used before her and which a million million women will know hereafter was it all a horrible mistake my marrying him she quieted the doubtwithout answering it    iv   kennicott had taken her north to lacquimeurt in the big woods it was the entrance to a chippewa indian reservation a sandy settlement among norway pines on the shore of a huge snowglaring lake she had her first sight of his mother except the glimpse at the wedding mrs kennicott had a hushed and delicate breeding which dignified her woodeny overscrubbed cottage with its worn hard cushions in heavy rockers she had never lost the childs miraculous power of wonder she asked questions about books and cities she murmured  will is a dear hardworking boy but hes inclined to be too serious and youve taught him how to play last night i heard you both laughing about the old indian basketseller and i just lay in bed and enjoyed your happiness  carol forgot her miseryhunting in this solidarity of family life she could depend upon them she was not battling alone watching mrs kennicott flit about the kitchen she was better able to translate kennicott himself he was matteroffact yes and incurably mature he didnt really play he let carol play with him but he had his mothers genius for trusting her disdain for prying her sure integrity  from the two days at lacquimeurt carol drew confidence in herself and she returned to gopher prairie in a throbbing calm like those golden drugged seconds when because he is for an instant free from pain a sick man revels in living  a bright hard winter day the wind shrill black and silver clouds booming across the sky everything in panicky motion during the brief light they struggled against the surf of wind through deep snow kennicott was cheerful he hailed loren wheeler behave yourself while i been away the editor bellowed b gosh you stayed so long that all your patients have got well and importantly took notes for the dauntless about their journey jackson elder cried hey folks hows tricks up north mrs mcganum waved to them from her porch  theyre glad to see us we mean something here these people are satisfied why cant i be but can i sit back all my life and be satisfied with hey folks they want shouts on main street and i want violins in a paneled room why    v   vida sherwin ran in after school a dozen times she was tactful torrentially anecdotal she had scuttled about town and plucked compliments mrs dr westlake had pronounced carol a very sweet bright cultured young woman and brad bemis the tinsmith at clarks hardware store had declared that she was easy to work for and awful easy to look at  but carol could not yet take her in she resented this outsiders knowledge of her shame vida was not too long tolerant she hinted youre a great brooder child buck up now the towns quit criticizing you almost entirely come with me to the thanatopsis club they have some of the best papers and currentevents discussionsso interesting  in vidas demands carol felt a compulsion but she was too listless to obey  it was bea sorenson who was really her confidante  however charitable toward the lower classes she may have thought herself carol had been reared to assume that servants belong to a distinct and inferior species but she discovered that bea was extraordinarily like girls she had loved in college and as a companion altogether superior to the young matrons of the jolly seventeen daily they became more frankly two girls playing at housework bea artlessly considered carol the most beautiful and accomplished lady in the country she was always shrieking my dots a swell hat or ay tink all dese ladies yoost die when dey see how elegant you do your hair but it was not the humbleness of a servant nor the hypocrisy of a slave it was the admiration of freshman for junior  they made out the days menus together though they began with propriety carol sitting by the kitchen table and bea at the sink or blacking the stove the conference was likely to end with both of them by the table while bea gurgled over the icemans attempt to kiss her or carol admitted everybody knows that the doctor is lots more clever than dr mcganum when carol came in from marketing bea plunged into the hall to take off her coat rub her frostied hands and ask vos dere lots of folks uptown today  this was the welcome upon which carol depended    vi  through her weeks of cowering there was no change in her surface life no one save vida was aware of her agonizing on her most despairing days she chatted to women on the street in stores but without the protection of kennicotts presence she did not go to the jolly seventeen she delivered herself to the judgment of the town only when she went shopping and on the ritualistic occasions of formal afternoon calls when mrs lyman cass or mrs george edwin mott with clean gloves and minute handkerchiefs and sealskin cardcases and countenances of frozen approbation sat on the edges of chairs and inquired do you find gopher prairie pleasing when they spent evenings of social profitandloss at the haydocks or the dyers she hid behind kennicott playing the simple bride  now she was unprotected kennicott had taken a patient to rochester for an operation he would be away for two or three days she had not minded she would loosen the matrimonial tension and be a fanciful girl for a time but now that he was gone the house was listeningly empty bea was out this afternoonpresumably drinking coffee and talking about fellows with her cousin tina it was the day for the monthly supper and eveningbridge of the jolly seventeen but carol dared not go  she sat alone    chapter x  the house was haunted long before evening shadows slipped down the walls and waited behind every chair  did that door move  no she wouldnt go to the jolly seventeen she hadnt energy enough to caper before them to smile blandly at juanitas rudeness not today but she did want a party now if some one would come in this afternoon some one who liked hervida or mrs sam clark or old mrs champ perry or gentle mrs dr westlake or guy pollock shed telephone  no that wouldnt be it they must come of themselves  perhaps they would  why not  shed have tea ready anyway if they camesplendid if notwhat did she care she wasnt going to yield to the village and let down she was going to keep up a belief in the rite of tea to which she had always looked forward as the symbol of a leisurely fine existence and it would be just as much fun even if it was so babyish to have tea by herself and pretend that she was entertaining clever men it would  she turned the shining thought into action she bustled to the kitchen stoked the woodrange sang schumann while she boiled the kettle warmed up raisin cookies on a newspaper spread on the rack in the oven she scampered upstairs to bring down her filmiest teacloth she arranged a silver tray she proudly carried it into the livingroom and set it on the long cherrywood table pushing aside a hoop of embroidery a volume of conrad from the library copies of the saturday evening post the literary digest and kennicotts national geographic magazine  she moved the tray back and forth and regarded the effect she shook her head she busily unfolded the sewingtable set it in the baywindow patted the teacloth to smoothness moved the tray some time ill have a mahogany teatable she said happily  she had brought in two cups two plates for herself a straight chair but for the guest the big wingchair which she pantingly tugged to the table  she had finished all the preparations she could think of she sat and waited she listened for the doorbell the telephone her eagerness was stilled her hands drooped  surely vida sherwin would hear the summons  she glanced through the baywindow snow was sifting over the ridge of the howland house like sprays of water from a hose the wide yards across the street were gray with moving eddies the black trees shivered the roadway was gashed with ruts of ice  she looked at the extra cup and plate she looked at the wingchair it was so empty  the tea was cold in the pot with wearily dipping fingertip she tested it yes quite cold she couldnt wait any longer  the cup across from her was icily clean glisteningly empty  simply absurd to wait she poured her own cup of tea she sat and stared at it what was it she was going to do now oh yes how idiotic take a lump of sugar  she didnt want the beastly tea  she was springing up she was on the couch sobbing    ii   she was thinking more sharply than she had for weeks  she reverted to her resolution to change the townawaken it prod it reform it what if they were wolves instead of lambs theyd eat her all the sooner if she was meek to them fight or be eaten it was easier to change the town completely than to conciliate it she could not take their point of view it was a negative thing an intellectual squalor a swamp of prejudices and fears she would have to make them take hers she was not a vincent de paul to govern and mold a people what of that the tiniest change in their distrust of beauty would be the beginning of the end a seed to sprout and some day with thickening roots to crack their wall of mediocrity if she could not as she desired do a great thing nobly and with laughter yet she need not be content with village nothingness she would plant one seed in the blank wall  was she just was it merely a blank wall this town which to three thousand and more people was the center of the universe hadnt she returning from lacquimeurt felt the heartiness of their greetings no the ten thousand gopher prairies had no monopoly of greetings and friendly hands sam clark was no more loyal than girl librarians she knew in st paul the people she had met in chicago and those others had so much that gopher prairie complacently lackedthe world of gaiety and adventure of music and the integrity of bronze of remembered mists from tropic isles and paris nights and the walls of bagdad of industrial justice and a god who spake not in doggerel hymns  one seed which seed it was did not matter all knowledge and freedom were one but she had delayed so long in finding that seed could she do something with this thanatopsis club or should she make her house so charming that it would be an influence shed make kennicott like poetry that was it for a beginning she conceived so clear a picture of their bending over large fair pages by the fire in a nonexistent fireplace that the spectral presences slipped away doors no longer moved curtains were not creeping shadows but lovely dark masses in the dusk and when bea came home carol was singing at the piano which she had not touched for many days  their supper was the feast of two girls carol was in the diningroom in a frock of black satin edged with gold and bea in blue gingham and an apron dined in the kitchen but the door was open between and carol was inquiring did you see any ducks in dahls window and bea chanting no maam say ve have a svell time dis afternoon tina she have coffee and knackebrod and her fella vos dere and ve yoost laughed and laughed and her fella say he vos president and he going to make me queen of finland and ay stick a fedder in may hair and say ay bane going to go to varoh ve vos so foolish and ve laugh so  when carol sat at the piano again she did not think of her husband but of the bookdrugged hermit guy pollock she wished that pollock would come calling  if a girl really kissed him hed creep out of his den and be human if will were as literate as guy or guy were as executive as will i think i could endure even gopher prairie its so hard to mother will i could be maternal with guy is that what i want something to mother a man or a baby or a town i will have a baby some day but to have him isolated here all his receptive years  and so to bed  have i found my real level in bea and kitchengossip  oh i do miss you will but it will be pleasant to turn over in bed as often as i want to without worrying about waking you up  am i really this settled thing called a married woman i feel so unmarried tonight so free to think that there was once a mrs kennicott who let herself worry over a town called gopher prairie when there was a whole world outside it  of course will is going to like poetry    iii   a black february day clouds hewn of ponderous timber weighing down on the earth an irresolute dropping of snow specks upon the trampled wastes gloom but no veiling of angularity the lines of roofs and sidewalks sharp and inescapable  the second day of kennicotts absence  she fled from the creepy house for a walk it was thirty below zero too cold to exhilarate her in the spaces between houses the wind caught her it stung it gnawed at nose and ears and aching cheeks and she hastened from shelter to shelter catching her breath in the lee of a barn grateful for the protection of a billboard covered with ragged posters showing layer under layer of pastesmeared green and streaky red  the grove of oaks at the end of the street suggested indians hunting snowshoes and she struggled past the earthbanked cottages to the open country to a farm and a low hill corrugated with hard snow in her loose nutria coat seal toque virginal cheeks unmarked by lines of village jealousies she was as out of place on this dreary hillside as a scarlet tanager on an icefloe she looked down on gopher prairie the snow stretching without break from streets to devouring prairie beyond wiped out the towns pretense of being a shelter the houses were black specks on a white sheet her heart shivered with that still loneliness as her body shivered with the wind  she ran back into the huddle of streets all the while protesting that she wanted a citys yellow glare of shopwindows and restaurants or the primitive forest with hooded furs and a rifle or a barnyard warm and steamy noisy with hens and cattle certainly not these dun houses these yards choked with winter ashpiles these roads of dirty snow and clotted frozen mud the zest of winter was gone three months more till may the cold might drag on with the snow ever filthier the weakened body less resistent she wondered why the good citizens insisted on adding the chill of prejudice why they did not make the houses of their spirits more warm and frivolous like the wise chatterers of stockholm and moscow  she circled the outskirts of the town and viewed the slum of swede hollow wherever as many as three houses are gathered there will be a slum of at least one house in gopher prairie the sam clarks boasted you dont get any of this poverty that you find in citiesalways plenty of workno need of charityman got to be blame shiftless if he dont get ahead but now that the summer mask of leaves and grass was gone carol discovered misery and dead hope in a shack of thin boards covered with tarpaper she saw the washerwoman mrs steinhof working in gray steam outside her sixyearold boy chopped wood he had a torn jacket muffler of a blue like skimmed milk his hands were covered with red mittens through which protruded his chapped raw knuckles he halted to blow on them to cry disinterestedly  a family of recently arrived finns were camped in an abandoned stable a man of eighty was picking up lumps of coal along the railroad  she did not know what to do about it she felt that these independent citizens who had been taught that they belonged to a democracy would resent her trying to play lady bountiful  she lost her loneliness in the activity of the village industriesthe railroadyards with a freighttrain switching the wheatelevator oiltanks a slaughterhouse with bloodmarks on the snow the creamery with the sleds of farmers and piles of milkcans an unexplained stone hut labeled dangerpowder stored here the jolly tombstoneyard where a utilitarian sculptor in a red calfskin overcoat whistled as he hammered the shiniest of granite headstones jackson elders small planingmill with the smell of fresh pine shavings and the burr of circular saws most important the gopher prairie flour and milling company lyman cass president its windows were blanketed with flourdust but it was the most stirring spot in town workmen were wheeling barrels of flour into a boxcar a farmer sitting on sacks of wheat in a bobsled argued with the wheatbuyer machinery within the mill boomed and whined water gurgled in the icefreed millrace  the clatter was a relief to carol after months of smug houses she wished that she could work in the mill that she did not belong to the caste of professionalmanswife  she started for home through the small slum before a tarpaper shack at a gateless gate a man in rough brown dogskin coat and black plush cap with lappets was watching her his square face was confident his foxy mustache was picaresque he stood erect his hands in his sidepockets his pipe puffing slowly he was fortyfive or six perhaps  how do mrs kennicott he drawled  she recalled himthe town handyman who had repaired their furnace at the beginning of winter  oh how do you do she fluttered  my name s bjornstam the red swede they call me remember always thought id kind of like to say howdy to you again  yeyesive been exploring the outskirts of town  yump fine mess no sewage no street cleaning and the lutheran minister and the priest represent the arts and sciences well thunder we submerged tenth down here in swede hollow are no worse off than you folks thank god we dont have to go and purr at juanity haydock at the jolly old seventeen  the carol who regarded herself as completely adaptable was uncomfortable at being chosen as comrade by a pipereeking oddjob man probably he was one of her husbands patients but she must keep her dignity  yes even the jolly seventeen isnt always so exciting its very cold again today isnt it well  bjornstam was not respectfully valedictory he showed no signs of pulling a forelock his eyebrows moved as though they had a life of their own with a subgrin he went on  maybe i hadnt ought to talk about mrs haydock and her solemcholy seventeen in that fresh way i suppose id be tickled to death if i was invited to sit in with that gang im what they call a pariah i guess im the town badman mrs kennicott town atheist and i suppose i must be an anarchist too everybody who doesnt love the bankers and the grand old republican party is an anarchist  carol had unconsciously slipped from her attitude of departure into an attitude of listening her face full toward him her muff lowered she fumbled  yes i suppose so her own grudges came in a flood i dont see why you shouldnt criticize the jolly seventeen if you want to they arent sacred  oh yes they are the dollarsign has chased the crucifix clean off the map but then ive got no kick i do what i please and i suppose i ought to let them do the same  what do you mean by saying youre a pariah  im poor and yet i dont decently envy the rich im an old bach i make enough money for a stake and then i sit around by myself and shake hands with myself and have a smoke and read history and i dont contribute to the wealth of brother elder or daddy cass  youi fancy you read a good deal  yep in a hitoramiss way ill tell you im a lone wolf i trade horses and saw wood and work in lumbercampsim a firstrate swamper always wished i could go to college though i spose id find it pretty slow and theyd probably kick me out  you really are a curious person mr  bjornstam miles bjornstam half yank and half swede usually known as that damn lazy bigmouthed calamityhowler that aint satisfied with the way we run things no i aint curiouswhatever you mean by that im just a bookworm probably too much reading for the amount of digestion ive got probably halfbaked im going to get in halfbaked first and beat you to it because its dead sure to be handed to a radical that wears jeans  they grinned together she demanded  you say that the jolly seventeen is stupid what makes you think so  oh trust us borers into the foundation to know about your leisure class fact mrs kennicott ill say that far as i can make out the only people in this mans town that do have any brainsi dont mean ledgerkeeping brains or duckhunting brains or babyspanking brains but real imaginative brainsare you and me and guy pollock and the foreman at the flourmill hes a socialist the foreman dont tell lym cass that lym would fire a socialist quicker than he would a horsethief  indeed no i shant tell him  this foreman and i have some great settos hes a regular oldline partymember too dogmatic expects to reform everything from deforestration to nosebleed by saying phrases like surplus value like reading the prayerbook but same time hes a plato j aristotle compared with people like ezry stowbody or professor mott or julius flickerbaugh  its interesting to hear about him  he dug his toe into a drift like a schoolboy rats you mean i talk too much well i do when i get hold of somebody like you you probably want to run along and keep your nose from freezing  yes i must go i suppose but tell me why did you leave miss sherwin of the high school out of your list of the town intelligentsia  i guess maybe she does belong in it from all i can hear shes in everything and behind everything that looks like a reformlot more than most folks realize she lets mrs reverend warren the president of thishere thanatopsis club think shes running the works but miss sherwin is the secret boss and nags all the easygoing dames into doing something but way i figure it outyou see im not interested in these dinky reforms miss sherwins trying to repair the holes in this barnaclecovered ship of a town by keeping busy bailing out the water and pollock tries to repair it by reading poetry to the crew me i want to yank it up on the ways and fire the poor bum of a shoemaker that built it so it sails crooked and have it rebuilt right from the keel up  yesthatthat would be better but i must run home my poor nose is nearly frozen  say you better come in and get warm and see what an old bachs shack is like  she looked doubtfully at him at the low shanty the yard that was littered with cordwood moldy planks a hoopless washtub she was disquieted but bjornstam did not give her the opportunity to be delicate he flung out his hand in a welcoming gesture which assumed that she was her own counselor that she was not a respectable married woman but fully a human being with a shaky well just a moment to warm my nose she glanced down the street to make sure that she was not spied on and bolted toward the shanty  she remained for one hour and never had she known a more considerate host than the red swede  he had but one room bare pine floor small workbench wall bunk with amazingly neat bed fryingpan and ashstippled coffeepot on the shelf behind the potbellied cannonball stove backwoods chairsone constructed from half a barrel one from a tilted plankand a row of books incredibly assorted byron and tennyson and stevenson a manual of gasengines a book by thorstein veblen and a spotty treatise on the care feeding diseases and breeding of poultry and cattle  there was but one picturea magazine colorplate of a steeproofed village in the harz mountains which suggested kobolds and maidens with golden hair  bjornstam did not fuss over her he suggested might throw open your coat and put your feet up on the box in front of the stove he tossed his dogskin coat into the bunk lowered himself into the barrel chair and droned on  yeh im probably a yahoo but by gum i do keep my independence by doing odd jobs and thats more n these polite cusses like the clerks in the banks do when im rude to some slob it may be partly because i dont know better and god knows im not no authority on trick forks and what pants you wear with a prince albert but mostly its because i mean something im about the only man in johnson county that remembers the joker in the declaration of independence about americans being supposed to have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  i meet old ezra stowbody on the street he looks at me like he wants me to remember hes a highmuckamuck and worth two hundred thousand dollars and he says uh bjornquist  bjornstams my name ezra i says he knows my name all rightee  well whatever your name is he says i understand you have a gasoline saw i want you to come around and saw up four cords of maple for me he says  so you like my looks eh i says kind of innocent  what difference does that make want you to saw that wood before saturday he says real sharp common workman going and getting fresh with a fifth of a million dollars all walking around in a handmedown fur coat  heres the difference it makes i says just to devil him how do you know i like your looks maybe he didnt look sore nope i says thinking it all over i dont like your application for a loan take it to another bank only there aint any i says and i walks off on him  sure probably i was surlyand foolish but i figured there had to be one man in town independent enough to sass the banker  he hitched out of his chair made coffee gave carol a cup and talked on half defiant and half apologetic half wistful for friendliness and half amused by her surprise at the discovery that there was a proletarian philosophy  at the door she hinted  mr bjornstam if you were i would you worry when people thought you were affected  huh kick em in the face say if i were a seagull and all over silver think id care what a pack of dirty seals thought about my flying  it was not the wind at her back it was the thrust of bjornstams scorn which carried her through town she faced juanita haydock cocked her head at maud dyers brief nod and came home to bea radiant she telephoned vida sherwin to run over this evening she lustily played tschaikowskythe virile chords an echo of the red laughing philosopher of the tarpaper shack  when she hinted to vida isnt there a man here who amuses himself by being irreverent to the village godsbjornstam some such a name the reformleader said bjornstam oh yes fixes things hes awfully impertinent    iv   kennicott had returned at midnight at breakfast he said four several times that he had missed her every moment  on her way to market sam clark hailed her the top o the mornin to yez going to stop and pass the time of day mit saml warmer eh whatd the docs thermometer say it was say you folks better come round and visit with us one of these evenings dont be so doggone proud staying by yourselves  champ perry the pioneer wheatbuyer at the elevator stopped her in the postoffice held her hand in his withered paws peered at her with faded eyes and chuckled you are so fresh and blooming my dear mother was saying tother day that a sight of you was better n a dose of medicine  in the bon ton store she found guy pollock tentatively buying a modest gray scarf we havent seen you for so long she said wouldnt you like to come in and play cribbage some evening as though he meant it pollock begged may i really  while she was purchasing two yards of malines the vocal raymie wutherspoon tiptoed up to her his long sallow face bobbing and he besought youve just got to come back to my department and see a pair of patent leather slippers i set aside for you  in a manner of more than sacerdotal reverence he unlaced her boots tucked her skirt about her ankles slid on the slippers she took them  youre a good salesman she said  im not a salesman at all i just like elegant things all this is so inartistic he indicated with a forlornly waving hand the shelves of shoeboxes the seat of thin wood perforated in rosettes the display of shoetrees and tin boxes of blacking the lithograph of a smirking young woman with cherry cheeks who proclaimed in the exalted poetry of advertising my tootsies never got hep to what pedal perfection was till i got a pair of clever classy cleopatra shoes  but sometimes raymie sighed there is a pair of dainty little shoes like these and i set them aside for some one who will appreciate when i saw these i said right away wouldnt it be nice if they fitted mrs kennicott and i meant to speak to you first chance i had i havent forgotten our jolly talks at mrs gurreys  that evening guy pollock came in and though kennicott instantly impressed him into a cribbage game carol was happy again    v   she did not in recovering something of her buoyancy forget her determination to begin the liberalizing of gopher prairie by the easy and agreeable propaganda of teaching kennicott to enjoy reading poetry in the lamplight the campaign was delayed twice he suggested that they call on neighbors once he was in the country the fourth evening he yawned pleasantly stretched and inquired well whatll we do tonight shall we go to the movies  i know exactly what were going to do now dont ask questions come and sit down by the table there are you comfy lean back and forget youre a practical man and listen to me  it may be that she had been influenced by the managerial vida sherwin certainly she sounded as though she was selling culture but she dropped it when she sat on the couch her chin in her hands a volume of yeats on her knees and read aloud  instantly she was released from the homely comfort of a prairie town she was in the world of lonely thingsthe flutter of twilight linnets the aching call of gulls along a shore to which the netted foam crept out of darkness the island of aengus and the elder gods and the eternal glories that never were tall kings and women girdled with crusted gold the woful incessant chanting and the  hehchacha coughed dr kennicott she stopped she remembered that he was the sort of person who chewed tobacco she glared while he uneasily petitioned thats great stuff study it in college i like poetry finejames whitcomb riley and some of longfellowthis hiawatha gosh i wish i could appreciate that highbrow art stuff but i guess im too old a dog to learn new tricks  with pity for his bewilderment and a certain desire to giggle she consoled him then lets try some tennyson youve read him  tennyson you bet read him in school theres that       and let there be no what is it of farewell      when i put out to sea      but let the  well i dont remember all of it butoh sure and theres that i met a little country boy who i dont remember exactly how it goes but the chorus ends up we are seven  yes wellshall we try the idylls of the king theyre so full of color  go to it shoot but he hastened to shelter himself behind a cigar  she was not transported to camelot she read with an eye cocked on him and when she saw how much he was suffering she ran to him kissed his forehead cried you poor forced tuberose that wants to be a decent turnip  look here now that aint  anyway i shant torture you any longer  she could not quite give up she read kipling with a great deal of emphasis   theres a regiment acoming down the grand trunk road   he tapped his foot to the rhythm he looked normal and reassured but when he complimented her that was fine i dont know but what you can elocute just as good as ella stowbody she banged the book and suggested that they were not too late for the nine oclock show at the movies  that was her last effort to harvest the april wind to teach divine unhappiness by a correspondence course to buy the lilies of avalon and the sunsets of cockaigne in tin cans at ole jensons grocery  but the fact is that at the motionpictures she discovered herself laughing as heartily as kennicott at the humor of an actor who stuffed spaghetti down a womans evening frock for a second she loathed her laughter mourned for the day when on her hill by the mississippi she had walked the battlements with queens but the celebrated cinema jesters conceit of dropping toads into a soupplate flung her into unwilling tittering and the afterglow faded the dead queens fled through darkness    vi   she went to the jolly seventeens afternoon bridge she had learned the elements of the game from the sam clarks she played quietly and reasonably badly she had no opinions on anything more polemic than woolen unionsuits a topic on which mrs howland discoursed for five minutes she smiled frequently and was the complete canarybird in her manner of thanking the hostess mrs dave dyer  her only anxious period was during the conference on husbands  the young matrons discussed the intimacies of domesticity with a frankness and a minuteness which dismayed carol juanita haydock communicated harrys method of shaving and his interest in deershooting mrs gougerling reported fully and with some irritation her husbands inappreciation of liver and bacon maud dyer chronicled daves digestive disorders quoted a recent bedtime controversy with him in regard to christian science socks and the sewing of buttons upon vests announced that she simply wasnt going to stand his always pawing girls when he went and got crazyjealous if a man just danced with her and rather more than sketched daves varieties of kisses  so meekly did carol give attention so obviously was she at last desirous of being one of them that they looked on her fondly and encouraged her to give such details of her honeymoon as might be of interest she was embarrassed rather than resentful she deliberately misunderstood she talked of kennicotts overshoes and medical ideals till they were thoroughly bored they regarded her as agreeable but green  till the end she labored to satisfy the inquisition she bubbled at juanita the president of the club that she wanted to entertain them only she said i dont know that i can give you any refreshments as nice as mrs dyers salad or that simply delicious angelsfood we had at your house dear  fine we need a hostess for the seventeenth of march wouldnt it be awfully original if you made it a st patricks day bridge ill be tickled to death to help you with it im glad youve learned to play bridge at first i didnt hardly know if you were going to like gopher prairie isnt it dandy that youve settled down to being homey with us maybe we arent as highbrow as the cities but we do have the daisiest times andoh we go swimming in summer and dances andoh lots of good times if folks will just take us as we are i think were a pretty good bunch  im sure of it thank you so much for the idea about having a st patricks day bridge  oh thats nothing i always think the jolly seventeen are so good at original ideas if you knew these other towns wakamin and joralemon and all youd find out and realize that g p is the liveliest smartest town in the state did you know that percy bresnahan the famous auto manufacturer came from here andyes i think that a st patricks day party would be awfully cunning and original and yet not too queer or freaky or anything    chapter xi  i  she had often been invited to the weekly meetings of the thanatopsis the womens study club but she had put it off the thanatopsis was vida sherwin promised such a cozy group and yet it puts you in touch with all the intellectual thoughts that are going on everywhere  early in march mrs westlake wife of the veteran physician marched into carols livingroom like an amiable old pussy and suggested my dear you really must come to the thanatopsis this afternoon mrs dawson is going to be leader and the poor soul is frightened to death she wanted me to get you to come she says shes sure you will brighten up the meeting with your knowledge of books and writings english poetry is our topic today so shoo put on your coat  english poetry really id love to go i didnt realize you were reading poetry  oh were not so slow  mrs luke dawson wife of the richest man in town gaped at them piteously when they appeared her expensive frock of beavercolored satin with rows plasters and pendants of solemn brown beads was intended for a woman twice her size she stood wringing her hands in front of nineteen folding chairs in her front parlor with its faded photograph of minnehaha falls in 1890 its colored enlargement of mr dawson its bulbous lamp painted with sepia cows and mountains and standing on a mortuary marble column  she creaked o mrs kennicott im in such a fix im supposed to lead the discussion and i wondered would you come and help  what poet do you take up today demanded carol in her library tone of what book do you wish to take out  why the english ones  not all of them  wwhy yes were learning all of european literature this year the club gets such a nice magazine culture hints and we follow its programs last year our subject was men and women of the bible and next year well probably take up furnishings and china my it does make a body hustle to keep up with all these new culture subjects but it is improving so will you help us with the discussion today  on her way over carol had decided to use the thanatopsis as the tool with which to liberalize the town she had immediately conceived enormous enthusiasm she had chanted these are the real people when the housewives who bear the burdens are interested in poetry it means something ill work with themfor themanything  her enthusiasm had become watery even before thirteen women resolutely removed their overshoes sat down meatily ate peppermints dusted their fingers folded their hands composed their lower thoughts and invited the naked muse of poetry to deliver her most improving message they had greeted carol affectionately and she tried to be a daughter to them but she felt insecure her chair was out in the open exposed to their gaze and it was a hardslatted quivery slippery churchparlor chair likely to collapse publicly and without warning it was impossible to sit on it without folding the hands and listening piously  she wanted to kick the chair and run it would make a magnificent clatter  she saw that vida sherwin was watching her she pinched her wrist as though she were a noisy child in church and when she was decent and cramped again she listened  mrs dawson opened the meeting by sighing im sure im glad to see you all here today and i understand that the ladies have prepared a number of very interesting papers this is such an interesting subject the poets they have been an inspiration for higher thought in fact wasnt it reverend benlick who said that some of the poets have been as much an inspiration as a good many of the ministers and so we shall be glad to hear  the poor lady smiled neuralgically panted with fright scrabbled about the small oak table to find her eyeglasses and continued we will first have the pleasure of hearing mrs jenson on the subject shakespeare and milton  mrs ole jenson said that shakespeare was born in 1564 and died 1616 he lived in london england and in stratfordonavon which many american tourists loved to visit a lovely town with many curios and old houses well worth examination many people believed that shakespeare was the greatest playwright who ever lived also a fine poet not much was known about his life but after all that did not really make so much difference because they loved to read his numerous plays several of the best known of which she would now criticize  perhaps the best known of his plays was the merchant of venice having a beautiful love story and a fine appreciation of a womans brains which a womans club even those who did not care to commit themselves on the question of suffrage ought to appreciate laughter mrs jenson was sure that she for one would love to be like portia the play was about a jew named shylock and he didnt want his daughter to marry a venice gentleman named antonio  mrs leonard warren a slender gray nervous woman president of the thanatopsis and wife of the congregational pastor reported the birth and death dates of byron scott moore burns and wound up  burns was quite a poor boy and he did not enjoy the advantages we enjoy today except for the advantages of the fine old scotch kirk where he heard the word of god preached more fearlessly than even in the finest big brick churches in the big and socalled advanced cities of today but he did not have our educational advantages and latin and the other treasures of the mind so richly strewn before the alas too ofttimes inattentive feet of our youth who do not always sufficiently appreciate the privileges freely granted to every american boy rich or poor burns had to work hard and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low habits but it is morally instructive to know that he was a good student and educated himself in striking contrast to the loose ways and socalled aristocratic societylife of lord byron on which i have just spoken and certainly though the lords and earls of his day may have looked down upon burns as a humble person many of us have greatly enjoyed his pieces about the mouse and other rustic subjects with their message of humble beautyi am so sorry i have not got the time to quote some of them  mrs george edwin mott gave ten minutes to tennyson and browning  mrs nat hicks a wryfaced curiously sweet woman so awed by her betters that carol wanted to kiss her completed the days grim task by a paper on other poets the other poets worthy of consideration were coleridge wordsworth shelley gray mrs hemans and kipling  miss ella stowbody obliged with a recital of the recessional and extracts from lalla rookh by request she gave an old sweetheart of mine as encore  gopher prairie had finished the poets it was ready for the next weeks labor english fiction and essays  mrs dawson besought now we will have a discussion of the papers and i am sure we shall all enjoy hearing from one who we hope to have as a new member mrs kennicott who with her splendid literary training and all should be able to give us many pointers andmany helpful pointers  carol had warned herself not to be so beastly supercilious she had insisted that in the belated quest of these workstained women was an aspiration which ought to stir her tears but theyre so selfsatisfied they think theyre doing burns a favor they dont believe they have a belated quest theyre sure that they have culture salted and hung up it was out of this stupor of doubt that mrs dawsons summons roused her she was in a panic how could she speak without hurting them  mrs champ perry leaned over to stroke her hand and whisper you look tired dearie dont you talk unless you want to  affection flooded carol she was on her feet searching for words and courtesies  the only thing in the way of suggestioni know you are following a definite program but i do wish that now youve had such a splendid introduction instead of going on with some other subject next year you could return and take up the poets more in detail especially actual quotationseven though their lives are so interesting and as mrs warren said so morally instructive and perhaps there are several poets not mentioned today whom it might be worth while consideringkeats for instance and matthew arnold and rossetti and swinburne swinburne would be such awell that is such a contrast to life as we all enjoy it in our beautiful middlewest  she saw that mrs leonard warren was not with her she captured her by innocently continuing  unless perhaps swinburne tends to be uh more outspoken than you than we really like what do you think mrs warren  the pastors wife decided why youve caught my very thoughts mrs kennicott of course i have never read swinburne but years ago when he was in vogue i remember mr warren saying that swinburne or was it oscar wilde but anyway he said that though many socalled intellectual people posed and pretended to find beauty in swinburne there can never be genuine beauty without the message from the heart but at the same time i do think you have an excellent idea and though we have talked about furnishings and china as the probable subject for next year i believe that it would be nice if the program committee would try to work in another day entirely devoted to english poetry in fact madame chairman i so move you  when mrs dawsons coffee and angelsfood had helped them to recover from the depression caused by thoughts of shakespeares death they all told carol that it was a pleasure to have her with them the membership committee retired to the sittingroom for three minutes and elected her a member  and she stopped being patronizing  she wanted to be one of them they were so loyal and kind it was they who would carry out her aspiration her campaign against village sloth was actually begun on what specific reform should she first loose her army during the gossip after the meeting mrs george edwin mott remarked that the city hall seemed inadequate for the splendid modern gopher prairie mrs nat hicks timidly wished that the young people could have free dances therethe lodge dances were so exclusive the city hall that was it carol hurried home  she had not realized that gopher prairie was a city from kennicott she discovered that it was legally organized with a mayor and citycouncil and wards she was delighted by the simplicity of voting ones self a metropolis why not  she was a proud and patriotic citizen all evening    ii   she examined the city hall next morning she had remembered it only as a bleak inconspicuousness she found it a livercolored frame coop half a block from main street the front was an unrelieved wall of clapboards and dirty windows it had an unobstructed view of a vacant lot and nat hickss tailor shop it was larger than the carpenter shop beside it but not so well built  no one was about she walked into the corridor on one side was the municipal court like a country school on the other the room of the volunteer fire company with a ford hosecart and the ornamental helmets used in parades at the end of the hall a filthy twocell jail now empty but smelling of ammonia and ancient sweat the whole second story was a large unfinished room littered with piles of folding chairs a limecrusted mortarmixing box and the skeletons of fourth of july floats covered with decomposing plaster shields and faded red white and blue bunting at the end was an abortive stage the room was large enough for the community dances which mrs nat hicks advocated but carol was after something bigger than dances  in the afternoon she scampered to the public library  the library was open three afternoons and four evenings a week it was housed in an old dwelling sufficient but unattractive carol caught herself picturing pleasanter readingrooms chairs for children an art collection a librarian young enough to experiment  she berated herself stop this fever of reforming everything i will be satisfied with the library the city hall is enough for a beginning and its really an excellent library itsit isnt so bad    is it possible that i am to find dishonesties and stupidity in every human activity i encounter in schools and business and government and everything is there never any contentment never any rest  she shook her head as though she were shaking off water and hastened into the library a young light amiable presence modest in unbuttoned fur coat blue suit fresh organdy collar and tan boots roughened from scuffling snow miss villets stared at her and carol purred i was so sorry not to see you at the thanatopsis yesterday vida said you might come  oh you went to the thanatopsis did you enjoy it  so much such good papers on the poets carol lied resolutely but i did think they should have had you give one of the papers on poetry  wellof course im not one of the bunch that seem to have the time to take and run the club and if they prefer to have papers on literature by other ladies who have no literary trainingafter all why should i complain what am i but a city employee  youre not youre the one person that doesthat doesoh you do so much tell me is there uhwho are the people who control the club  miss villets emphatically stamped a date in the front of frank on the lower mississippi for a small flaxen boy glowered at him as though she were stamping a warning on his brain and sighed  i wouldnt put myself forward or criticize any one for the world and vida is one of my best friends and such a splendid teacher and there is no one in town more advanced and interested in all movements but i must say that no matter who the president or the committees are vida sherwin seems to be behind them all the time and though she is always telling me about what she is pleased to call my fine work in the library i notice that im not often called on for papers though mrs lyman cass once volunteered and told me that she thought my paper on the cathedrals of england was the most interesting paper we had the year we took up english and french travel and architecture butand of course mrs mott and mrs warren are very important in the club as you might expect of the wives of the superintendent of schools and the congregational pastor and indeed they are both very cultured butno you may regard me as entirely unimportant im sure what i say doesnt matter a bit  youre much too modest and im going to tell vida so and uh i wonder if you can give me just a teeny bit of your time and show me where the magazine files are kept  she had won she was profusely escorted to a room like a grandmothers attic where she discovered periodicals devoted to housedecoration and townplanning with a sixyear file of the national geographic miss villets blessedly left her alone humming fluttering pages with delighted fingers carol sat crosslegged on the floor the magazines in heaps about her  she found pictures of new england streets the dignity of falmouth the charm of concord stockbridge and farmington and hillhouse avenue the fairybook suburb of forest hills on long island devonshire cottages and essex manors and a yorkshire high street and port sunlight the arab village of djeddahan intricately chased jewelbox a town in california which had changed itself from the barren brick fronts and slatternly frame sheds of a main street to a way which led the eye down a vista of arcades and gardens  assured that she was not quite mad in her belief that a small american town might be lovely as well as useful in buying wheat and selling plows she sat brooding her thin fingers playing a tattoo on her cheeks she saw in gopher prairie a georgian city hall warm brick walls with white shutters a fanlight a wide hall and curving stair she saw it the common home and inspiration not only of the town but of the country about it should contain the courtroom she couldnt get herself to put in a jail public library a collection of excellent prints restroom and model kitchen for farmwives theater lecture room free community ballroom farmbureau gymnasium forming about it and influenced by it as mediaeval villages gathered about the castle she saw a new georgian town as graceful and beloved as annapolis or that bowery alexandria to which washington rode  all this the thanatopsis club was to accomplish with no difficulty whatever since its several husbands were the controllers of business and politics she was proud of herself for this practical view  she had taken only half an hour to change a wirefenced potatoplot into a walled rosegarden she hurried out to apprize mrs leonard warren as president of the thanatopsis of the miracle which had been worked    iii   at a quarter to three carol had left home at halfpast four she had created the georgian town at a quarter to five she was in the dignified poverty of the congregational parsonage her enthusiasm pattering upon mrs leonard warren like summer rain upon an old gray roof at two minutes to five a town of demure courtyards and welcoming dormer windows had been erected and at two minutes past five the entire town was as flat as babylon  erect in a black william and mary chair against gray and specklybrown volumes of sermons and biblical commentaries and palestine geographies upon long pine shelves her neat black shoes firm on a ragrug herself as correct and lowtoned as her background mrs warren listened without comment till carol was quite through then answered delicately  yes i think you draw a very nice picture of what might easily come to passsome day i have no doubt that such villages will be found on the prairiesome day but if i might make just the least little criticism it seems to me that you are wrong in supposing either that the city hall would be the proper start or that the thanatopsis would be the right instrument after all its the churches isnt it that are the real heart of the community as you may possibly know my husband is prominent in congregational circles all through the state for his advocacy of churchunion he hopes to see all the evangelical denominations joined in one strong body opposing catholicism and christian science and properly guiding all movements that make for morality and prohibition here the combined churches could afford a splendid clubhouse maybe a stucco and halftimber building with gargoyles and all sorts of pleasing decorations on it which it seems to me would be lots better to impress the ordinary class of people than just a plain oldfashioned colonial house such as you describe and that would be the proper center for all educational and pleasurable activities instead of letting them fall into the hands of the politicians  i dont suppose it will take more than thirty or forty years for the churches to get together carol said innocently  hardly that long even things are moving so rapidly so it would be a mistake to make any other plans  carol did not recover her zeal till two days after when she tried mrs george edwin mott wife of the superintendent of schools  mrs mott commented personally i am terribly busy with dressmaking and having the seamstress in the house and all but it would be splendid to have the other members of the thanatopsis take up the question except for one thing first and foremost we must have a new schoolbuilding mr mott says they are terribly cramped  carol went to view the old building the grades and the high school were combined in a damp yellowbrick structure with the narrow windows of an antiquated jaila hulk which expressed hatred and compulsory training she conceded mrs motts demand so violently that for two days she dropped her own campaign then she built the school and city hall together as the center of the reborn town  she ventured to the leadcolored dwelling of mrs dave dyer behind the mask of winterstripped vines and a wide porch only a foot above the ground the cottage was so impersonal that carol could never visualize it nor could she remember anything that was inside it but mrs dyer was personal enough with carol mrs howland mrs mcganum and vida sherwin she was a link between the jolly seventeen and the serious thanatopsis in contrast to juanita haydock who unnecessarily boasted of being a lowbrow and publicly stated that she would see herself in jail before shed write any darned old club papers mrs dyer was superfeminine in the kimono in which she received carol her skin was fine pale soft suggesting a weak voluptuousness at afternooncoffees she had been rude but now she addressed carol as dear and insisted on being called maud carol did not quite know why she was uncomfortable in this talcumpowder atmosphere but she hastened to get into the fresh air of her plans  maud dyer granted that the city hall wasnt so very nice yet as dave said there was no use doing anything about it till they received an appropriation from the state and combined a new city hall with a national guard armory dave had given verdict what these mouthy youngsters that hang around the poolroom need is universal military training make men of em  mrs dyer removed the new schoolbuilding from the city hall  oh so mrs mott has got you going on her school craze shes been dinging at that till everybodys sick and tired what she really wants is a big office for her dear baldheaded gawge to sit around and look important in of course i admire mrs mott and im very fond of her shes so brainy even if she does try to butt in and run the thanatopsis but i must say were sick of her nagging the old building was good enough for us when we were kids i hate these wouldbe women politicians dont you    iv   the first week of march had given promise of spring and stirred carol with a thousand desires for lakes and fields and roads the snow was gone except for filthy woolly patches under trees the thermometer leaped in a day from windbitten chill to itchy warmth as soon as carol was convinced that even in this imprisoned north spring could exist again the snow came down as abruptly as a paper storm in a theater the northwest gale flung it up in a half blizzard and with her hope of a glorified town went hope of summer meadows  but a week later though the snow was everywhere in slushy heaps the promise was unmistakable by the invisible hints in air and sky and earth which had aroused her every year through ten thousand generations she knew that spring was coming it was not a scorching hard dusty day like the treacherous intruder of a week before but soaked with languor softened with a milky light rivulets were hurrying in each alley a calling robin appeared by magic on the crabapple tree in the howlands yard everybody chuckled looks like winter is going and this ll bring the frost out of the roadshave the autos out pretty soon nowwonder what kind of bassfishing well get this summerought to be good crops this year  each evening kennicott repeated we better not take off our heavy underwear or the storm windows too soonmight be nother spell of coldgot to be careful bout catching coldwonder if the coal will last through  the expanding forces of life within her choked the desire for reforming she trotted through the house planning the spring cleaning with bea when she attended her second meeting of the thanatopsis she said nothing about remaking the town she listened respectably to statistics on dickens thackeray jane austen george eliot scott hardy lamb de quincey and mrs humphry ward who it seemed constituted the writers of english fiction and essays  not till she inspected the restroom did she again become a fanatic she had often glanced at the storebuilding which had been turned into a refuge in which farmwives could wait while their husbands transacted business she had heard vida sherwin and mrs warren caress the virtue of the thanatopsis in establishing the restroom and in sharing with the city council the expense of maintaining it but she had never entered it till this march day  she went in impulsively nodded at the matron a plump worthy widow named nodelquist and at a couple of farmwomen who were meekly rocking the restroom resembled a secondhand store it was furnished with discarded patent rockers lopsided reed chairs a scratched pine table a gritty straw mat old steel engravings of milkmaids being morally amorous under willowtrees faded chromos of roses and fish and a kerosene stove for warming lunches the front window was darkened by torn net curtains and by a mound of geraniums and rubberplants  while she was listening to mrs nodelquists account of how many thousands of farmers wives used the restroom every year and how much they appreciated the kindness of the ladies in providing them with this lovely place and all free she thought kindness nothing the kindladies husbands get the farmers trade this is mere commercial accommodation and its horrible it ought to be the most charming room in town to comfort women sick of prairie kitchens certainly it ought to have a clear window so that they can see the metropolitan life go by some day im going to make a better restrooma clubroom why ive already planned that as part of my georgian town hall  so it chanced that she was plotting against the peace of the thanatopsis at her third meeting which covered scandinavian russian and polish literature with remarks by mrs leonard warren on the sinful paganism of the russian socalled church even before the entrance of the coffee and hot rolls carol seized on mrs champ perry the kind and amplebosomed pioneer woman who gave historic dignity to the modern matrons of the thanatopsis she poured out her plans mrs perry nodded and stroked carols hand but at the end she sighed  i wish i could agree with you dearie im sure youre one of the lords anointed even if we dont see you at the baptist church as often as wed like to but im afraid youre too tenderhearted when champ and i came here we teamedit with an oxcart from sauk centre to gopher prairie and there was nothing here then but a stockade and a few soldiers and some log cabins when we wanted salt pork and gunpowder we sent out a man on horseback and probably he was shot dead by the injuns before he got back we ladiesof course we were all farmers at firstwe didnt expect any restroom in those days my wed have thought the one they have now was simply elegant my house was roofed with hay and it leaked something terrible when it rainedonly dry place was under a shelf  and when the town grew up we thought the new city hall was real fine and i dont see any need for dancehalls dancing isnt what it was anyway we used to dance modest and we had just as much fun as all these young folks do now with their terrible turkey trots and hugging and all but if they must neglect the lords injunction that young girls ought to be modest then i guess they manage pretty well at the k p hall and the oddfellows even if some of tie lodges dont always welcome a lot of these foreigners and hired help to all their dances and i certainly dont see any need of a farmbureau or this domestic science demonstration you talk about in my day the boys learned to farm by honest sweating and every gal could cook or her ma learned her how across her knee besides aint there a county agent at wakamin he comes here once a fortnight maybe thats enough monkeying with this scientific farmingchamp says theres nothing to it anyway  and as for a lecture hallhavent we got the churches good deal better to listen to a good oldfashioned sermon than a lot of geography and books and things that nobody needs to knowmore n enough heathen learning right here in the thanatopsis and as for trying to make a whole town in this colonial architecture you talk abouti do love nice things to this day i run ribbons into my petticoats even if champ perry does laugh at me the old villain but just the same i dont believe any of us oldtimers would like to see the town that we worked so hard to build being tore down to make a place that wouldnt look like nothing but some dutch storybook and not a bit like the place we loved and dont you think its sweet now all the trees and lawns and such comfy houses and hotwater heat and electric lights and telephones and cement walks and everything why i thought everybody from the twin cities always said it was such a beautiful town  carol forswore herself declared that gopher prairie had the color of algiers and the gaiety of mardi gras  yet the next afternoon she was pouncing on mrs lyman cass the hooknosed consort of the owner of the flourmill  mrs casss parlor belonged to the crammedvictorian school as mrs luke dawsons belonged to the barevictorian it was furnished on two principles first everything must resemble something else a rocker had a back like a lyre a nearleather seat imitating tufted cloth and arms like scotch presbyterian lions with knobs scrolls shields and spearpoints on unexpected portions of the chair the second principle of the crammedvictorian school was that every inch of the interior must be filled with useless objects  the walls of mrs casss parlor were plastered with handpainted pictures buckeye pictures of birchtrees newsboys puppies and churchsteeples on christmas eve with a plaque depicting the exposition building in minneapolis burntwood portraits of indian chiefs of no tribe in particular a pansydecked poetic motto a yard of roses and the banners of the educational institutions attended by the casses two sonschicopee falls business college and mcgillicuddy university one small square table contained a cardreceiver of painted china with a rim of wrought and gilded lead a family bible grants memoirs the latest novel by mrs gene stratton porter a wooden model of a swiss chalet which was also a bank for dimes a polished abalone shell holding one blackheaded pin and one empty spool a velvet pincushion in a gilded metal slipper with souvenir of troy n y stamped on the toe and an unexplained red glass dish which had warts  mrs casss first remark was i must show you all my pretty things and art objects  she piped after carols appeal  i see you think the new england villages and colonial houses are so much more cunning than these middlewestern towns im glad you feel that way youll be interested to know i was born in vermont  and dont you think we ought to try to make gopher prai  my gracious no we cant afford it taxes are much too high as it is we ought to retrench and not let the city council spend another cent uhdont you think that was a grand paper mrs westlake read about tolstoy i was so glad she pointed out how all his silly socialistic ideas failed  what mrs cass said was what kennicott said that evening not in twenty years would the council propose or gopher prairie vote the funds for a new city hall    v   carol had avoided exposing her plans to vida sherwin she was shy of the bigsister manner vida would either laugh at her or snatch the idea and change it to suit herself but there was no other hope when vida came in to tea carol sketched her utopia  vida was soothing but decisive  my dear youre all off i would like to see it a real gardeny place to shut out the gales but it cant be done what could the clubwomen accomplish  their husbands are the most important men in town they are the town  but the town as a separate unit is not the husband of the thanatopsis if you knew the trouble we had in getting the city council to spend the money and cover the pumpingstation with vines whatever you may think of gopher prairie women theyre twice as progressive as the men  but cant the men see the ugliness  they dont think its ugly and how can you prove it matter of taste why should they like what a boston architect likes  what they like is to sell prunes  well why not anyway the point is that you have to work from the inside with what we have rather than from the outside with foreign ideas the shell ought not to be forced on the spirit it cant be the bright shell has to grow out of the spirit and express it that means waiting if we keep after the city council for another ten years they may vote the bonds for a new school  i refuse to believe that if they saw it the big men would be too tightfisted to spend a few dollars each for a buildingthinkdancing and lectures and plays all done cooperatively  you mention the word cooperative to the merchants and theyll lynch you the one thing they fear more than mailorder houses is that farmers cooperative movements may get started  the secret trails that lead to scared pocketbooks always in everything and i dont have any of the fine melodrama of fiction the dictagraphs and speeches by torchlight im merely blocked by stupidity oh i know im a fool i dream of venice and i live in archangel and scold because the northern seas arent tendercolored but at least they shant keep me from loving venice and sometime ill run awayall right no more  she flung out her hands in a gesture of renunciation    vi   early may wheat springing up in blades like grass corn and potatoes being planted the land humming for two days there had been steady rain even in town the roads were a furrowed welter of mud hideous to view and difficult to cross main street was a black swamp from curb to curb on residence streets the grass parking beside the walks oozed gray water it was prickly hot yet the town was barren under the bleak sky softened neither by snow nor by waving boughs the houses squatted and scowled revealed in their unkempt harshness  as she dragged homeward carol looked with distaste at her clayloaded rubbers the smeared hem of her skirt she passed lyman casss pinnacled darkred hulking house she waded a streaky yellow pool this morass was not her home she insisted her home and her beautiful town existed in her mind they had already been created the task was done what she really had been questing was some one to share them with her vida would not kennicott could not  some one to share her refuge  suddenly she was thinking of guy pollock  she dismissed him he was too cautious she needed a spirit as young and unreasonable as her own and she would never find it youth would never come singing she was beaten  yet that same evening she had an idea which solved the rebuilding of gopher prairie  within ten minutes she was jerking the oldfashioned bellpull of luke dawson mrs dawson opened the door and peered doubtfully about the edge of it carol kissed her cheek and frisked into the lugubrious sittingroom  well well youre a sight for sore eyes chuckled mr dawson dropping his newspaper pushing his spectacles back on his forehead  you seem so excited sighed mrs dawson  i am mr dawson arent you a millionaire  he cocked his head and purred well i guess if i cashed in on all my securities and farmholdings and my interests in iron on the mesaba and in northern timber and cutover lands i could push two million dollars pretty close and ive made every cent of it by hard work and having the sense to not go out and spend every  i think i want most of it from you  the dawsons glanced at each other in appreciation of the jest and he chirped youre worse than reverend benlick he dont hardly ever strike me for more than ten dollarsat a time  im not joking i mean it your children in the cities are grownup and welltodo you dont want to die and leave your name unknown why not do a big original thing why not rebuild the whole town get a great architect and have him plan a town that would be suitable to the prairie perhaps hed create some entirely new form of architecture then tear down all these shambling buildings  mr dawson had decided that she really did mean it he wailed why that would cost at least three or four million dollars  but you alone just one man have two of those millions  me spend all my hardearned cash on building houses for a lot of shiftless beggars that never had the sense to save their money not that ive ever been mean mama could always have a hired girl to do the workwhen we could find one but her and i have worked our fingers to the bone andspend it on a lot of these rascals  please dont be angry i just meani meanoh not spend all of it of course but if you led off the list and the others came in and if they heard you talk about a more attractive town  why now child youve got a lot of notions besides whats the matter with the town looks good to me ive had people that have traveled all over the world tell me time and again that gopher prairie is the prettiest place in the middlewest good enough for anybody certainly good enough for mama and me besides mama and me are planning to go out to pasadena and buy a bungalow and live there    vii   she had met miles bjornstam on the street for the second of welcome encounter this workman with the bandit mustache and the muddy overalls seemed nearer than any one else to the credulous youth which she was seeking to fight beside her and she told him as a cheerful anecdote a little of her story  he grunted i never thought id be agreeing with old man dawson the pennypinching old landthiefand a fine briber he is too but you got the wrong slant you arent one of the peopleyet you want to do something for the town i dont i want the town to do something for itself we dont want old dawsons moneynot if its a gift with a string well take it away from him because it belongs to us you got to get more iron and cussedness into you come join us cheerful bums and some daywhen we educate ourselves and quit being bumswell take things and run em straight  he had changed from her friend to a cynical man in overalls she could not relish the autocracy of cheerful bums  she forgot him as she tramped the outskirts of town  she had replaced the city hall project by an entirely new and highly exhilarating thought of how little was done for these unpicturesque poor    viii   the spring of the plains is not a reluctant virgin but brazen and soon away the mud roads of a few days ago are powdery dust and the puddles beside them have hardened into lozenges of black sleek earth like cracked patent leather  carol was panting as she crept to the meeting of the thanatopsis program committee which was to decide the subject for next fall and winter  madam chairman miss ella stowbody in an oystercolored blouse asked if there was any new business  carol rose she suggested that the thanatopsis ought to help the poor of the town she was ever so correct and modern she did not she said want charity for them but a chance of selfhelp an employment bureau direction in washing babies and making pleasing stews possibly a municipal fund for homebuilding what do you think of my plans mrs warren she concluded  speaking judiciously as one related to the church by marriage mrs warren gave verdict  im sure were all heartily in accord with mrs kennicott in feeling that wherever genuine poverty is encountered it is not only noblesse oblige but a joy to fulfil our duty to the less fortunate ones but i must say it seems to me we should lose the whole point of the thing by not regarding it as charity why thats the chief adornment of the true christian and the church the bible has laid it down for our guidance faith hope and charity it says and the poor ye have with ye always which indicates that there never can be anything to these socalled scientific schemes for abolishing charity never and isnt it better so i should hate to think of a world in which we were deprived of all the pleasure of giving besides if these shiftless folks realize theyre getting charity and not something to which they have a right theyre so much more grateful  besides snorted miss ella stowbody theyve been fooling you mrs kennicott there isnt any real poverty here take that mrs steinhof you speak of i send her our washing whenever theres too much for our hired girli must have sent her ten dollars worth the past year alone im sure papa would never approve of a city homebuilding fund papa says these folks are fakers especially all these tenant farmers that pretend they have so much trouble getting seed and machinery papa says they simply wont pay their debts he says hes sure he hates to foreclose mortgages but its the only way to make them respect the law  and then think of all the clothes we give these people said mrs jackson elder  carol intruded again oh yes the clothes i was going to speak of that dont you think that when we give clothes to the poor if we do give them old ones we ought to mend them first and make them as presentable as we can next christmas when the thanatopsis makes its distribution wouldnt it be jolly if we got together and sewed on the clothes and trimmed hats and made them  heavens and earth they have more time than we have they ought to be mighty good and grateful to get anything no matter what shape its in i know im not going to sit and sew for that lazy mrs vopni with all ive got to do snapped ella stowbody  they were glaring at carol she reflected that mrs vopni whose husband had been killed by a train had ten children  but mrs mary ellen wilks was smiling mrs wilks was the proprietor of ye art shoppe and magazine and book store and the reader of the small christian science church she made it all clear  if this class of people had an understanding of science and that we are the children of god and nothing can harm us they wouldnt be in error and poverty  mrs jackson elder confirmed besides it strikes me the club is already doing enough with treeplanting and the antifly campaign and the responsibility for the restroomto say nothing of the fact that weve talked of trying to get the railroad to put in a park at the station  i think so too said madam chairman she glanced uneasily at miss sherwin but what do you think vida  vida smiled tactfully at each of the committee and announced well i dont believe wed better start anything more right now but its been a privilege to hear carols dear generous ideas hasnt it oh there is one thing we must decide on at once we must get together and oppose any move on the part of the minneapolis clubs to elect another state federation president from the twin cities and this mrs edgar potbury theyre putting forwardi know there are people who think shes a bright interesting speaker but i regard her as very shallow what do you say to my writing to the lake ojibawasha club telling them that if their district will support mrs warren for second vicepresident well support their mrs hagelton and such a dear lovely cultivated woman too for president  yes we ought to show up those minneapolis folks ella stowbody said acidly and oh by the way we must oppose this movement of mrs potburys to have the state clubs come out definitely in favor of woman suffrage women havent any place in politics they would lose all their daintiness and charm if they became involved in these horried plots and logrolling and all this awful political stuff about scandal and personalities and so on  allsave onenodded they interrupted the formal businessmeeting to discuss mrs edgar potburys husband mrs potburys income mrs potburys sedan mrs potburys residence mrs potburys oratorical style mrs potburys mandarin evening coat mrs potburys coiffure and mrs potburys altogether reprehensible influence on the state federation of womens clubs  before the program committee adjourned they took three minutes to decide which of the subjects suggested by the magazine culture hints furnishings and china or the bible as literature would be better for the coming year there was one annoying incident mrs dr kennicott interfered and showed off again she commented dont you think that we already get enough of the bible in our churches and sunday schools  mrs leonard warren somewhat out of order but much more out of temper cried well upon my word i didnt suppose there was any one who felt that we could get enough of the bible i guess if the grand old book has withstood the attacks of infidels for these two thousand years it is worth our slight consideration  oh i didnt mean carol begged inasmuch as she did mean it was hard to be extremely lucid but i wish instead of limiting ourselves either to the bible or to anecdotes about the brothers adams wigs which culture hints seems to regard as the significant point about furniture we could study some of the really stirring ideas that are springing up todaywhether its chemistry or anthropology or labor problemsthe things that are going to mean so terribly much  everybody cleared her polite throat  madam chairman inquired is there any other discussion will some one make a motion to adopt the suggestion of vida sherwinto take up furnishings and china  it was adopted unanimously  checkmate murmured carol as she held up her hand  had she actually believed that she could plant a seed of liberalism in the blank wall of mediocrity how had she fallen into the folly of trying to plant anything whatever in a wall so smooth and sunglazed and so satisfying to the happy sleepers within    chapter xii  one week of authentic spring one rare sweet week of may one tranquil moment between the blast of winter and the charge of summer daily carol walked from town into flashing country hysteric with new life  one enchanted hour when she returned to youth and a belief in the possibility of beauty  she had walked northward toward the upper shore of plover lake taking to the railroad track whose directness and dryness make it the natural highway for pedestrians on the plains she stepped from tie to tie in long strides at each roadcrossing she had to crawl over a cattleguard of sharpened timbers she walked the rails balancing with arms extended cautious heel before toe as she lost balance her body bent over her arms revolved wildly and when she toppled she laughed aloud  the thick grass beside the track coarse and prickly with many burnings hid canaryyellow buttercups and the mauve petals and woolly sagegreen coats of the pasque flowers the branches of the kinnikinic brush were red and smooth as lacquer on a saki bowl  she ran down the gravelly embankment smiled at children gathering flowers in a little basket thrust a handful of the soft pasque flowers into the bosom of her white blouse fields of springing wheat drew her from the straight propriety of the railroad and she crawled through the rusty barbedwire fence she followed a furrow between low wheat blades and a field of rye which showed silver lights as it flowed before the wind she found a pasture by the lake so sprinkled was the pasture with ragbaby blossoms and the cottony herb of indian tobacco that it spread out like a rare old persian carpet of cream and rose and delicate green under her feet the rough grass made a pleasant crunching sweet winds blew from the sunny lake beside her and small waves sputtered on the meadowy shore she leaped a tiny creek bowered in pussywillow buds she was nearing a frivolous grove of birch and poplar and wild plum trees  the poplar foliage had the downiness of a corot arbor the green and silver trunks were as candid as the birches as slender and lustrous as the limbs of a pierrot the cloudy white blossoms of the plum trees filled the grove with a springtime mistiness which gave an illusion of distance  she ran into the wood crying out for joy of freedom regained after winter chokecherry blossoms lured her from the outer sunwarmed spaces to depths of green stillness where a submarine light came through the young leaves she walked pensively along an abandoned road she found a moccasinflower beside a lichencovered log at the end of the road she saw the open acresdipping rolling fields bright with wheat  i believe the woodland gods still live and out there the great land its beautiful as the mountains what do i care for thanatopsises  she came out on the prairie spacious under an arch of boldly cut clouds small pools glittered above a marsh redwinged blackbirds chased a crow in a swift melodrama of the air on a hill was silhouetted a man following a drag his horse bent its neck and plodded content  a path took her to the corinth road leading back to town dandelions glowed in patches amidst the wild grass by the way a stream golloped through a concrete culvert beneath the road she trudged in healthy weariness  a man in a bumping ford rattled up beside her hailed give you a lift mrs kennicott  thank you its awfully good of you but im enjoying the walk  great day by golly i seen some wheat that must of been five inches high well so long  she hadnt the dimmest notion who he was but his greeting warmed her this countryman gave her a companionship which she had never whether by her fault or theirs or neither been able to find in the matrons and commercial lords of the town  half a mile from town in a hollow between hazelnut bushes and a brook she discovered a gipsy encampment a covered wagon a tent a bunch of peggedout horses a broadshouldered man was squatted on his heels holding a fryingpan over a campfire he looked toward her he was miles bjornstam  well well what you doing out here he roared come have a hunk o bacon pete hey pete  a tousled person came from behind the covered wagon  pete heres the one honesttogod lady in my bum town come on crawl in and set a couple minutes mrs kennicott im hiking off for all summer  the red swede staggered up rubbed his cramped knees lumbered to the wire fence held the strands apart for her she unconsciously smiled at him as she went through her skirt caught on a barb he carefully freed it  beside this man in blue flannel shirt baggy khaki trousers uneven suspenders and vile felt hat she was small and exquisite  the surly pete set out an upturned bucket for her she lounged on it her elbows on her knees where are you going she asked  just starting off for the summer horsetrading bjornstam chuckled his red mustache caught the sun regular hoboes and public benefactors we are take a hike like this every once in a while sharks on horses buy em from farmers and sell em to others were honestfrequently great time camp along the road i was wishing i had a chance to say goodby to you before i ducked out butsay you better come along with us  id like to  while youre playing mumbletypeg with mrs lym cass pete and me will be rambling across dakota through the bad lands into the butte country and when fall comes well be crossing over a pass of the big horn mountains maybe and camp in a snowstorm quarter of a mile right straight up above a lake then in the morning well lie snug in our blankets and look up through the pines at an eagle howd it strike you heh eagle soaring and soaring all daybig wide sky  dont or i will go with you and im afraid there might be some slight scandal perhaps some day ill do it goodby  her hand disappeared in his blackened leather glove from the turn in the road she waved at him she walked on more soberly now and she was lonely  but the wheat and grass were sleek velvet under the sunset the prairie clouds were tawny gold and she swung happily into main street    ii   through the first days of june she drove with kennicott on his calls she identified him with the virile land she admired him as she saw with what respect the farmers obeyed him she was out in the early chill after a hasty cup of coffee reaching open country as the fresh sun came up in that unspoiled world meadow larks called from the tops of thin split fenceposts the wild roses smelled clean  as they returned in late afternoon the low sun was a solemnity of radial bands like a heavenly fan of beaten gold the limitless circle of the grain was a green sea rimmed with fog and the willow windbreaks were palmy isles  before july the close heat blanketed them the tortured earth cracked farmers panted through cornfields behind cultivators and the sweating flanks of horses while she waited for kennicott in the car before a farmhouse the seat burned her fingers and her head ached with the glare on fenders and hood  a black thundershower was followed by a dust storm which turned the sky yellow with the hint of a coming tornado impalpable black dust farborne from dakota covered the inner sills of the closed windows  the july heat was ever more stifling they crawled along main street by day they found it hard to sleep at night they brought mattresses down to the livingroom and thrashed and turned by the open window ten times a night they talked of going out to soak themselves with the hose and wade through the dew but they were too listless to take the trouble on cool evenings when they tried to go walking the gnats appeared in swarms which peppered their faces and caught in their throats  she wanted the northern pines the eastern sea but kennicott declared that it would be kind of hard to get away just now the health and improvement committee of the thanatopsis asked her to take part in the antifly campaign and she toiled about town persuading householders to use the flytraps furnished by the club or giving out money prizes to flyswatting children she was loyal enough but not ardent and without ever quite intending to she began to neglect the task as heat sucked at her strength  kennicott and she motored north and spent a week with his motherthat is carol spent it with his mother while he fished for bass  the great event was their purchase of a summer cottage down on lake minniemashie  perhaps the most amiable feature of life in gopher prairie was the summer cottages they were merely tworoom shanties with a seepage of brokendown chairs peeling veneered tables chromos pasted on wooden walls and inefficient kerosene stoves they were so thinwalled and so close together that you couldand didhear a baby being spanked in the fifth cottage off but they were set among elms and lindens on a bluff which looked across the lake to fields of ripened wheat sloping up to green woods  here the matrons forgot social jealousies and sat gossiping in gingham or in old bathingsuits surrounded by hysterical children they paddled for hours carol joined them she ducked shrieking small boys and helped babies construct sandbasins for unfortunate minnows she liked juanita haydock and maud dyer when she helped them make picnicsupper for the men who came motoring out from town each evening she was easier and more natural with them in the debate as to whether there should be veal loaf or poached egg on hash she had no chance to be heretical and oversensitive  they danced sometimes in the evening they had a minstrel show with kennicott surprisingly good as endman always they were encircled by children wise in the lore of woodchucks and gophers and rafts and willow whistles  if they could have continued this normal barbaric life carol would have been the most enthusiastic citizen of gopher prairie she was relieved to be assured that she did not want bookish conversation alone that she did not expect the town to become a bohemia she was content now she did not criticize  but in september when the year was at its richest custom dictated that it was time to return to town to remove the children from the waste occupation of learning the earth and send them back to lessons about the number of potatoes which in a delightful world untroubled by commissionhouses or shortages in freightcars william sold to john the women who had cheerfully gone bathing all summer looked doubtful when carol begged lets keep up an outdoor life this winter lets slide and skate their hearts shut again till spring and the nine months of cliques and radiators and dainty refreshments began all over    iii   carol had started a salon  since kennicott vida sherwin and guy pollock were her only lions and since kennicott would have preferred sam clark to all the poets and radicals in the entire world her private and selfdefensive clique did not get beyond one evening dinner for vida and guy on her first wedding anniversary and that dinner did not get beyond a controversy regarding raymie wutherspoons yearnings  guy pollock was the gentlest person she had found here he spoke of her new jade and cream frock naturally not jocosely he held her chair for her as they sat down to dinner and he did not like kennicott interrupt her to shout oh say speaking of that i heard a good story today but guy was incurably hermit he sat late and talked hard and did not come again  then she met champ perry in the postofficeand decided that in the history of the pioneers was the panacea for gopher prairie for all of america we have lost their sturdiness she told herself we must restore the last of the veterans to power and follow them on the backward path to the integrity of lincoln to the gaiety of settlers dancing in a sawmill  she read in the records of the minnesota territorial pioneers that only sixty years ago not so far back as the birth of her own father four cabins had composed gopher prairie the log stockade which mrs champ perry was to find when she trekked in was built afterward by the soldiers as a defense against the sioux the four cabins were inhabited by maine yankees who had come up the mississippi to st paul and driven north over virgin prairie into virgin woods they ground their own corn the menfolks shot ducks and pigeons and prairie chickens the new breakings yielded the turniplike rutabagas which they ate raw and boiled and baked and raw again for treat they had wild plums and crabapples and tiny wild strawberries  grasshoppers came darkening the sky and in an hour ate the farmwifes garden and the farmers coat precious horses painfully brought from illinois were drowned in bogs or stampeded by the fear of blizzards snow blew through the chinks of newmade cabins and eastern children with flowery muslin dresses shivered all winter and in summer were red and black with mosquito bites indians were everywhere they camped in dooryards stalked into kitchens to demand doughnuts came with rifles across their backs into schoolhouses and begged to see the pictures in the geographies packs of timberwolves treed the children and the settlers found dens of rattlesnakes killed fifty a hundred in a day  yet it was a buoyant life carol read enviously in the admirable minnesota chronicles called old rail fence corners the reminiscence of mrs mahlon black who settled in stillwater in 1848  there was nothing to parade over in those days we took it as it came and had happy lives    we would all gather together and in about two minutes would be having a good timeplaying cards or dancing    we used to waltz and dance contra dances none of these new jigs and not wear any clothes to speak of we covered our hides in those days no tight skirts like now you could take three or four steps inside our skirts and then not reach the edge one of the boys would fiddle a while and then some one would spell him and he could get a dance sometimes they would dance and fiddle too  she reflected that if she could not have ballrooms of gray and rose and crystal she wanted to be swinging across a puncheonfloor with a dancing fiddler this smug inbetween town which had exchanged money musk for phonographs grinding out ragtime it was neither the heroic old nor the sophisticated new couldnt she somehow some yet unimagined how turn it back to simplicity  she herself knew two of the pioneers the perrys champ perry was the buyer at the grainelevator he weighed wagons of wheat on a rough platformscale in the cracks of which the kernels sprouted every spring between times he napped in the dusty peace of his office  she called on the perrys at their rooms above howland  goulds grocery  when they were already old they had lost the money which they had invested in an elevator they had given up their beloved yellow brick house and moved into these rooms over a store which were the gopher prairie equivalent of a flat a broad stairway led from the street to the upper hall along which were the doors of a lawyers office a dentists a photographers studio the lodgerooms of the affiliated order of spartans and at the back the perrys apartment  they received her their first caller in a month with aged fluttering tenderness mrs perry confided my its a shame we got to entertain you in such a cramped place and there aint any water except that ole iron sink outside in the hall but still as i say to champ beggars cant be choosers sides the brick house was too big for me to sweep and it was way out and its nice to be living down here among folks yes were glad to be here butsome day maybe we can have a house of our own again were saving upoh dear if we could have our own home but these rooms are real nice aint they  as old people will the world over they had moved as much as possible of their familiar furniture into this small space carol had none of the superiority she felt toward mrs lyman casss plutocratic parlor she was at home here she noted with tenderness all the makeshifts the darned chairarms the patent rocker covered with sleazy cretonne the pasted strips of paper mending the birchbark napkinrings labeled papa and mama  she hinted of her new enthusiasm to find one of the young folks who took them seriously heartened the perrys and she easily drew from them the principles by which gopher prairie should be born againshould again become amusing to live in  this was their philosophy complete    in the era of aeroplanes and syndicalism  the baptist church and somewhat less the methodist congregational and presbyterian churches is the perfect the divinely ordained standard in music oratory philanthropy and ethics we dont need all this newfangled science or this terrible higher criticism thats ruining our young men in colleges what we need is to get back to the true word of god and a good sound belief in hell like we used to have it preached to us  the republican party the grand old party of blaine and mckinley is the agent of the lord and of the baptist church in temporal affairs  all socialists ought to be hanged  harold bell wright is a lovely writer and he teaches such good morals in his novels and folks say hes made prett near a million dollars out of em  people who make more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred are wicked  europeans are still wickeder  it doesnt hurt any to drink a glass of beer on a warm day but anybody who touches wine is headed straight for hell  virgins are not so virginal as they used to be  nobody needs drugstore ice cream pie is good enough for anybody  the farmers want too much for their wheat  the owners of the elevatorcompany expect too much for the salaries they pay  there would be no more trouble or discontent in the world if everybody worked as hard as pa did when he cleared our first farm    iv   carols heroworship dwindled to polite nodding and the nodding dwindled to a desire to escape and she went home with a headache  next day she saw miles bjornstam on the street  just back from montana great summer pumped my lungs chuckfull of rocky mountain air now for another whirl at sassing the bosses of gopher prairie she smiled at him and the perrys faded the pioneers faded till they were but daguerreotypes in a black walnut cupboard    chapter xiii  she tried more from loyalty than from desire to call upon the perrys on a november evening when kennicott was away they were not at home  like a child who has no one to play with she loitered through the dark hall she saw a light under an office door she knocked to the person who opened she murmured do you happen to know where the perrys are she realized that it was guy pollock  im awfully sorry mrs kennicott but i dont know wont you come in and wait for them  wwhy she observed as she reflected that in gopher prairie it is not decent to call on a man as she decided that no really she wouldnt go in and as she went in  i didnt know your office was up here  yes office townhouse and chateau in picardy but you cant see the chateau and townhouse next to the duke of sutherlands theyre beyond that inner door they are a cot and a washstand and my other suit and the blue crepe tie you said you liked  you remember my saying that  of course i always shall please try this chair  she glanced about the rusty officegaunt stove shelves of tan lawbooks deskchair filled with newspapers so long sat upon that they were in holes and smudged to grayness there were only two things which suggested guy pollock on the green felt of the tabledesk between legal blanks and a clotted inkwell was a cloissone vase on a swing shelf was a row of books unfamiliar to gopher prairie mosher editions of the poets black and red german novels a charles lamb in crushed levant  guy did not sit down he quartered the office a grayhound on the scent a grayhound with glasses tilted forward on his thin nose and a silky indecisive brown mustache he had a golf jacket of jersey worn through at the creases in the sleeves she noted that he did not apologize for it as kennicott would have done  he made conversation i didnt know you were a bosom friend of the perrys champ is the salt of the earth but somehow i cant imagine him joining you in symbolic dancing or making improvements on the diesel engine  no hes a dear soul bless him but he belongs in the national museum along with general grants sword and imoh i suppose im seeking for a gospel that will evangelize gopher prairie  really evangelize it to what  to anything thats definite seriousness or frivolousness or both i wouldnt care whether it was a laboratory or a carnival but its merely safe tell me mr pollock what is the matter with gopher prairie  is anything the matter with it isnt there perhaps something the matter with you and me may i join you in the honor of having something the matter  yes thanks no i think its the town  because they enjoy skating more than biology  but im not only more interested in biology than the jolly seventeen but also in skating ill skate with them or slide or throw snowballs just as gladly as talk with you  oh no  yes but they want to stay home and embroider  perhaps im not defending the town its merelyim a confirmed doubter of myself probably im conceited about my lack of conceit anyway gopher prairie isnt particularly bad its like all villages in all countries most places that have lost the smell of earth but not yet acquired the smell of patchoulior of factorysmokeare just as suspicious and righteous i wonder if the small town isnt with some lovely exceptions a social appendix some day these dull markettowns may be as obsolete as monasteries i can imagine the farmer and his local storemanager going by monorail at the end of the day into a city more charming than any william morris utopiamusic a university clubs for loafers like me lord how id like to have a real club  she asked impulsively you why do you stay here  i have the village virus  it sounds dangerous  it is more dangerous than the cancer that will certainly get me at fifty unless i stop this smoking the village virus is the germ whichits extraordinarily like the hookwormit infects ambitious people who stay too long in the provinces youll find it epidemic among lawyers and doctors and ministers and collegebred merchantsall these people who have had a glimpse of the world that thinks and laughs but have returned to their swamp im a perfect example but i shant pester you with my dolors  you wont and do sit down so i can see you  he dropped into the shrieking deskchair he looked squarely at her she was conscious of the pupils of his eyes of the fact that he was a man and lonely they were embarrassed they elaborately glanced away and were relieved as he went on  the diagnosis of my village virus is simple enough i was born in an ohio town about the same size as gopher prairie and much less friendly itd had more generations in which to form an oligarchy of respectability here a stranger is taken in if he is correct if he likes hunting and motoring and god and our senator there we didnt take in even our own till we had contemptuously got used to them it was a redbrick ohio town and the trees made it damp and it smelled of rotten apples the country wasnt like our lakes and prairie there were small stuffy cornfields and brickyards and greasy oilwells  i went to a denominational college and learned that since dictating the bible and hiring a perfect race of ministers to explain it god has never done much but creep around and try to catch us disobeying it from college i went to new york to the columbia law school and for four years i lived oh i wont rhapsodize about new york it was dirty and noisy and breathless and ghastly expensive but compared with the moldy academy in which i had been smothered i went to symphonies twice a week i saw irving and terry and duse and bernhardt from the top gallery i walked in gramercy park and i read oh everything  through a cousin i learned that julius flickerbaugh was sick and needed a partner i came here julius got well he didnt like my way of loafing five hours and then doing my work really not so badly in one we parted  when i first came here i swore id keep up my interests very lofty i read browning and went to minneapolis for the theaters i thought i was keeping up but i guess the village virus had me already i was reading four copies of cheap fictionmagazines to one poem id put off the minneapolis trips till i simply had to go there on a lot of legal matters  a few years ago i was talking to a patent lawyer from chicago and i realized thatid always felt so superior to people like julius flickerbaugh but i saw that i was as provincial and behindthetimes as julius worse julius plows through the literary digest and the outlook faithfully while im turning over pages of a book by charles flandrau that i already know by heart  i decided to leave here stern resolution grasp the world then i found that the village virus had me absolute i didnt want to face new streets and younger menreal competition it was too easy to go on making out conveyances and arguing ditching cases sothats all of the biography of a living dead man except the diverting last chapter the lies about my having been a tower of strength and legal wisdom which some day a preacher will spin over my lean dry body  he looked down at his tabledesk fingering the starry enameled vase  she could not comment she pictured herself running across the room to pat his hair she saw that his lips were firm under his soft faded mustache she sat still and maundered i know the village virus perhaps it will get me some day im goingoh no matter at least i am making you talk usually you have to be polite to my garrulousness but now im sitting at your feet  it would be rather nice to have you literally sitting at my feet by a fire  would you have a fireplace for me  naturally please dont snub me now let the old man rave how old are you carol  twentysix guy  twentysix i was just leaving new york at twentysix i heard patti sing at twentysix and now im fortyseven i feel like a child yet im old enough to be your father so its decently paternal to imagine you curled at my feet    of course i hope it isnt but well reflect the morals of gopher prairie by officially announcing that it is    these standards that you and i live up to theres one thing thats the matter with gopher prairie at least with the rulingclass there is a rulingclass despite all our professions of democracy and the penalty we tribal rulers pay is that our subjects watch us every minute we cant get wholesomely drunk and relax we have to be so correct about sex morals and inconspicuous clothes and doing our commercial trickery only in the traditional ways that none of us can live up to it and we become horribly hypocritical unavoidably the widowrobbing deacon of fiction cant help being hypocritical the widows themselves demand it they admire his unctuousness and look at me suppose i did dare to make love tosome exquisite married woman i wouldnt admit it to myself i giggle with the most revolting salaciousness over la vie parisienne when i get hold of one in chicago yet i shouldnt even try to hold your hand im broken its the historical anglosaxon way of making life miserable    oh my dear i havent talked to anybody about myself and all our selves for years  guy cant we do something with the town really  no we cant he disposed of it like a judge ruling out an improper objection returned to matters less uncomfortably energetic curious most troubles are unnecessary we have nature beaten we can make her grow wheat we can keep warm when she sends blizzards so we raise the devil just for pleasurewars politics racehatreds labordisputes here in gopher prairie weve cleared the fields and become soft so we make ourselves unhappy artificially at great expense and exertion methodists disliking episcopalians the man with the hudson laughing at the man with the flivver the worst is the commercial hatredthe grocer feeling that any man who doesnt deal with him is robbing him what hurts me is that it applies to lawyers and doctors and decidedly to their wives as much as to grocers the doctorsyou know about thathow your husband and westlake and gould dislike one another  no i wont admit it  he grinned  oh maybe once or twice when will has positively known of a case where doctorwhere one of the others has continued to call on patients longer than necessary he has laughed about it but  he still grinned  no really and when you say the wives of the doctors share these jealousiesmrs mcganum and i havent any particular crush on each other shes so stolid but her mother mrs westlakenobody could be sweeter  yes im sure shes very bland but i wouldnt tell her my hearts secrets if i were you my dear i insist that theres only one professionalmans wife in this town who doesnt plot and that is you you blessed credulous outsider  i wont be cajoled i wont believe that medicine the priesthood of healing can be turned into a pennypicking business  see here hasnt kennicott ever hinted to you that youd better be nice to some old woman because she tells her friends which doctor to call in but i oughtnt to  she remembered certain remarks which kennicott had offered regarding the widow bogart she flinched looked at guy beseechingly  he sprang up strode to her with a nervous step smoothed her hand she wondered if she ought to be offended by his caress then she wondered if he liked her hat the new oriental turban of rose and silver brocade  he dropped her hand his elbow brushed her shoulder he flitted over to the deskchair his thin back stooped he picked up the cloisonne vase across it he peered at her with such loneliness that she was startled but his eyes faded into impersonality as he talked of the jealousies of gopher prairie he stopped himself with a sharp good lord carol youre not a jury you are within your legal rights in refusing to be subjected to this summingup im a tedious old fool analyzing the obvious while youre the spirit of rebellion tell me your side what is gopher prairie to you  a bore  can i help  how could you  i dont know perhaps by listening i havent done that tonight but normallycant i be the confidant of the old french plays the tiringmaid with the mirror and the loyal ears  oh what is there to confide the people are savorless and proud of it and even if i liked you tremendously i couldnt talk to you without twenty old hexes watching whispering  but you will come talk to me once in a while  im not sure that i shall im trying to develop my own large capacity for dullness and contentment ive failed at every positive thing ive tried id better settle down as they call it and be satisfied to benothing  dont be cynical it hurts me in you its like blood on the wing of a hummingbird  im not a hummingbird im a hawk a tiny leashed hawk pecked to death by these large white flabby wormy hens but i am grateful to you for confirming me in the faith and im going home  please stay and have some coffee with me  id like to but theyve succeeded in terrorizing me im afraid of what people might say  im not afraid of that im only afraid of what you might say he stalked to her took her unresponsive hand carol you have been happy here tonight yes im begging  she squeezed his hand quickly then snatched hers away she had but little of the curiosity of the flirt and none of the intrigantes joy in furtiveness if she was the naive girl guy pollock was the clumsy boy he raced about the office he rammed his fists into his pockets he stammered iiioh the devil why do i awaken from smooth dustiness to this jagged rawness ill make im going to trot down the hall and bring in the dillons and well all have coffee or something  the dillons  yes really quite a decent young pairharvey dillon and his wife hes a dentist just come to town they live in a room behind his office same as i do here they dont know much of anybody  ive heard of them and ive never thought to call im horribly ashamed do bring them  she stopped for no very clear reason but his expression said her faltering admitted that they wished they had never mentioned the dillons with spurious enthusiasm he said splendid i will from the door he glanced at her curled in the peeled leather chair he slipped out came back with dr and mrs dillon  the four of them drank rather bad coffee which pollock made on a kerosene burner they laughed and spoke of minneapolis and were tremendously tactful and carol started for home through the november wind    chapter xiv  she was marching home  no i couldnt fall in love with him i like him very much but hes too much of a recluse could i kiss him no no guy pollock at twentysix i could have kissed him then maybe even if i were married to some one else and probably id have been glib in persuading myself that it wasnt really wrong  the amazing thing is that im not more amazed at myself i the virtuous young matron am i to be trusted if the prince charming came  a gopher prairie housewife married a year and yearning for a prince charming like a bachfisch of sixteen they say that marriage is a magic change but im not changed but  no i wouldnt want to fall in love even if the prince did come i wouldnt want to hurt will i am fond of will i am he doesnt stir me not any longer but i depend on him he is home and children  i wonder when we will begin to have children i do want them  i wonder whether i remembered to tell bea to have hominy tomorrow instead of oatmeal she will have gone to bed by now perhaps ill be up early enough  ever so fond of will i wouldnt hurt him even if i had to lose the mad love if the prince came id look once at him and run darn fast oh carol you are not heroic nor fine you are the immutable vulgar young female  but im not the faithless wife who enjoys confiding that shes misunderstood oh im not im not  am i  at least i didnt whisper to guy about wills faults and his blindness to my remarkable soul i didnt matter of fact will probably understands me perfectly if onlyif he would just back me up in rousing the town  how many how incredibly many wives there must be who tingle over the first guy pollock who smiles at them no i will not be one of that herd of yearners the coy virgin brides yet probably if the prince were young and dared to face life  im not half as well oriented as that mrs dillon so obviously adoring her dentist and seeing guy only as an eccentric fogy  they werent silk mrs dillons stockings they were lisle her legs are nice and slim but no nicer than mine i hate cotton tops on silk stockings    are my ankles getting fat i will not have fat ankles  no i am fond of will his workone farmer he pulls through diphtheria is worth all my yammering for a castle in spain a castle with baths  this hat is so tight i must stretch it guy liked it  theres the house im awfully chilly time to get out the fur coat i wonder if ill ever have a beaver coat nutria is not the same thing beaverglossy like to run my fingers over it guys mustache like beaver how utterly absurd  i am i am fond of will andcant i ever find another word than fond  hes home hell think i was out late  why cant he ever remember to pull down the shades cy bogart and all the beastly boys peeping in but the poor dear hes absentminded about minuteminushwhatever the word is he has so much worry and work while i do nothing but jabber to bea  i mustnt forget the hominy  she was flying into the hall kennicott looked up from the journal of the american medical society  hello what time did you get back she cried  about nine you been gadding here it is past eleven goodnatured yet not quite approving  did it feel neglected  well you didnt remember to close the lower draft in the furnace  oh im so sorry but i dont often forget things like that do i  she dropped into his lap and after he had jerked back his head to save his eyeglasses and removed the glasses and settled her in a position less cramping to his legs and casually cleared his throat he kissed her amiably and remarked  nope i must say youre fairly good about things like that i wasnt kicking i just meant i wouldnt want the fire to go out on us leave that draft open and the fire might burn up and go out on us and the nights are beginning to get pretty cold again pretty cold on my drive i put the sidecurtains up it was so chilly but the generator is working all right now  yes it is chilly but i feel fine after my walk  go walking  i went up to see the perrys by a definite act of will she added the truth they werent in and i saw guy pollock dropped into his office  why you havent been sitting and chinning with him till eleven oclock  of course there were some other people there andwill what do you think of dr westlake  westlake why  i noticed him on the street today  was he limping if the poor fish would have his teeth xrayed ill bet nine and a half cents hed find an abscess there rheumatism he calls it rheumatism hell hes behind the times wonder he doesnt bleed himself wellllllll a profound and serious yawn i hate to break up the party but its getting late and a doctor never knows when hell get routed out before morning she remembered that he had given this explanation in these words not less than thirty times in the year i guess we better be trotting up to bed ive wound the clock and looked at the furnace did you lock the front door when you came in  they trailed upstairs after he had turned out the lights and twice tested the front door to make sure it was fast while they talked they were preparing for bed carol still sought to maintain privacy by undressing behind the screen of the closet door kennicott was not so reticent tonight as every night she was irritated by having to push the old plush chair out of the way before she could open the closet door every time she opened the door she shoved the chair ten times an hour but kennicott liked to have the chair in the room and there was no place for it except in front of the closet  she pushed it felt angry hid her anger kennicott was yawning more portentously the room smelled stale she shrugged and became chatty  you were speaking of dr westlake tell meyouve never summed him up is he really a good doctor  oh yes hes a wise old coot  there you see there is no medical rivalry not in my house she said triumphantly to guy pollock  she hung her silk petticoat on a closet hook and went on dr westlake is so gentle and scholarly  well i dont know as id say he was such a whale of a scholar ive always had a suspicion he did a good deal of fourflushing about that he likes to have people think he keeps up his french and greek and lord knows what all and hes always got an old dago book lying around the sittingroom but ive got a hunch he reads detective stories bout like the rest of us and i dont know where hed ever learn so doggone many languages anyway he kind of lets people assume he went to harvard or berlin or oxford or somewhere but i looked him up in the medical register and he graduated from a hick college in pennsylvania way back in 1861  but this is the important thing is he an honest doctor  how do you mean honest depends on what you mean  suppose you were sick would you call him in would you let me call him in  not if i were well enough to cuss and bite i wouldnt no sir i wouldnt have the old fake in the house makes me tired his everlasting palavering and softsoaping hes all right for an ordinary bellyache or holding some fool womans hand but i wouldnt call him in for an honesttogod illness not much i wouldnt nosir you know i dont do much backbiting but same timeill tell you carrrie ive never got over being sore at westlake for the way he treated mrs jonderquist nothing the matter with her what she really needed was a rest but westlake kept calling on her and calling on her for weeks almost every day and he sent her a good big fat bill too you can bet i never did forgive him for that nice decent hardworking people like the jonderquists  in her batiste nightgown she was standing at the bureau engaged in the invariable rites of wishing that she had a real dressingtable with a triple mirror of bending toward the streaky glass and raising her chin to inspect a pinhead mole on her throat and finally of brushing her hair in rhythm to the strokes she went on  but will there isnt any of what you might call financial rivalry between you and the partnerswestlake and mcganumis there  he flipped into bed with a solemn backsomersault and a ludicrous kick of his heels as he tucked his legs under the blankets he snorted lord no i never begrudge any man a nickel he can get away from mefairly  but is westlake fair isnt he sly  sly is the word hes a fox that boy  she saw guy pollocks grin in the mirror she flushed  kennicott with his arms behind his head was yawning  yump hes smooth too smooth but i bet i make prett near as much as westlake and mcganum both together though ive never wanted to grab more than my just share if anybody wants to go to the partners instead of to me thats his business though i must say it makes me tired when westlake gets hold of the dawsons here luke dawson had been coming to me for every toeache and headache and a lot of little things that just wasted my time and then when his grandchild was here last summer and had summercomplaint i suppose or something like that probablyyou know the time you and i drove up to lacquimeurtwhy westlake got hold of ma dawson and scared her to death and made her think the kid had appendicitis and by golly if he and mcganum didnt operate and holler their heads off about the terrible adhesions they found and what a regular charley and will mayo they were for classy surgery they let on that if theyd waited two hours more the kid would have developed peritonitis and god knows what all and then they collected a nice fat hundred and fifty dollars and probably theyd have charged three hundred if they hadnt been afraid of me im no hog but i certainly do hate to give old luke ten dollars worth of advice for a dollar and a half and then see a hundred and fifty go glimmering and if i cant do a better pendectomy than either westlake or mcganum ill eat my hat  as she crept into bed she was dazzled by guys blazing grin she experimented  but westlake is cleverer than his soninlaw dont you think  yes westlake may be oldfashioned and all that but hes got a certain amount of intuition while mcganum goes into everything bullheaded and butts his way through like a damn yahoo and tries to argue his patients into having whatever he diagnoses them as having about the best thing mac can do is to stick to babysnatching hes just about on a par with this bonepounding chiropractor female mrs mattie gooch  mrs westlake and mrs mcganum thoughtheyre nice theyve been awfully cordial to me  well no reason why they shouldnt be is there oh theyre nice enoughthough you can bet your bottom dollar theyre both plugging for their husbands all the time trying to get the business and i dont know as i call it so damn cordial in mrs mcganum when i holler at her on the street and she nods back like she had a sore neck still shes all right its ma westlake that makes the mischief pussyfooting around all the time but i wouldnt trust any westlake out of the whole lot and while mrs mcganum seems square enough you dont never want to forget that shes westlakes daughter you bet  what about dr gould dont you think hes worse than either westlake or mcganum hes so cheapdrinking and playing pool and always smoking cigars in such a cocky way  thats all right now terry gould is a good deal of a tinhorn sport but he knows a lot about medicine and dont you forget it for one second  she stared down guys grin and asked more cheerfully is he honest too  ooooooooooo gosh im sleepy he burrowed beneath the bedclothes in a luxurious stretch and came up like a diver shaking his head as he complained hows that who terry gould honest dont start me laughingim too nice and sleepy i didnt say he was honest i said he had savvy enough to find the index in grays anatomy which is more than mcganum can do but i didnt say anything about his being honest he isnt terry is crooked as a dogs hind leg hes done me more than one dirty trick he told mrs glorbach seventeen miles out that i wasnt uptodate in obstetrics fat lot of good it did him she came right in and told me and terrys lazy hed let a pneumonia patient choke rather than interrupt a poker game  oh no i cant believe  well now im telling you  does he play much poker dr dillon told me that dr gould wanted him to play  dillon told you what whered you meet dillon hes just come to town  he and his wife were at mr pollocks tonight  say uh whatd you think of them didnt dillon strike you as pretty lightwaisted  why no he seemed intelligent im sure hes much more wideawake than our dentist  well now the old man is a good dentist he knows his business and dilloni wouldnt cuddle up to the dillons too close if i were you all right for pollock and thats none of our business but wei think id just give the dillons the glad hand and pass em up  but why he isnt a rival  thatsallright kennicott was aggressively awake now hell work right in with westlake and mcganum matter of fact i suspect they were largely responsible for his locating here theyll be sending him patients and hell send all that he can get hold of to them i dont trust anybody thats too much handinglove with westlake you give dillon a shot at some fellow thats just bought a farm here and drifts into town to get his teeth looked at and after dillon gets through with him youll see him edging around to westlake and mcganum every time  carol reached for her blouse which hung on a chair by the bed she draped it about her shoulders and sat up studying kennicott her chin in her hands in the gray light from the small electric bulb down the hall she could see that he was frowning  will this isi must get this straight some one said to me the other day that in towns like this even more than in cities all the doctors hate each other because of the money  who said that  it doesnt matter  ill bet a hat it was your vida sherwin shes a brainy woman but shed be a damn sight brainier if she kept her mouth shut and didnt let so much of her brains ooze out that way  will o will thats horrible aside from the vulgaritysome ways vida is my best friend even if she had said it which as a matter of fact she didnt he reared up his thick shoulders in absurd pink and green flannelette pajamas he sat straight and irritatingly snapped his fingers and growled  well if she didnt say it lets forget her doesnt make any difference who said it anyway the point is that you believe it god to think you dont understand me any better than that money  this is the first real quarrel weve ever had she was agonizing  he thrust out his long arm and snatched his wrinkly vest from a chair he took out a cigar a match he tossed the vest on the floor he lighted the cigar and puffed savagely he broke up the match and snapped the fragments at the footboard  she suddenly saw the footboard of the bed as the footstone of the grave of love  the room was drabcolored and illventilatedkennicott did not believe in opening the windows so darn wide that you heat all outdoors the stale air seemed never to change in the light from the hall they were two lumps of bedclothes with shoulders and tousled heads attached  she begged i didnt mean to wake you up dear and please dont smoke youve been smoking so much please go back to sleep im sorry  being sorry s all right but im going to tell you one or two things this falling for anybodys sayso about medical jealousy and competition is simply part and parcel of your usual willingness to think the worst you possibly can of us poor dubs in gopher prairie trouble with women like you is you always want to argue cant take things the way they are got to argue well im not going to argue about this in any way shape manner or form trouble with you is you dont make any effort to appreciate us youre so damned superior and think the city is such a hell of a lot finer place and you want us to do what you want all the time  thats not true its i who make the effort its theyits youwho stand back and criticize i have to come over to the towns opinion i have to devote myself to their interests they cant even see my interests to say nothing of adopting them i get ever so excited about their old lake minniemashie and the cottages but they simply guffaw in that lovely friendly way you advertise so much if i speak of wanting to see taormina also  sure tormina whatever that issome nice expensive millionaire colony i suppose sure thats the idea champagne taste and beer income and make sure that we never will have more than a beer income too  are you by any chance implying that i am not economical  well i hadnt intended to but since you bring it up yourself i dont mind saying the grocery bills are about twice what they ought to be  yes they probably are im not economical i cant be thanks to you  where d you get that thanks to you  please dont be quite so colloquialor shall i say vulgar  ill be as damn colloquial as i want to how do you get that thanks to you here about a year ago you jump me for not remembering to give you money well im reasonable i didnt blame you and i said i was to blame but have i ever forgotten it sincepractically  no you haventpractically but that isnt it i ought to have an allowance i will too i must have an agreement for a regular stated amount every month  fine idea of course a doctor gets a regular stated amount sure a thousand one monthand lucky if he makes a hundred the next  very well then a percentage or something else no matter how much you vary you can make a rough average for  but whats the idea what are you trying to get at mean to say im unreasonable think im so unreliable and tightwad that youve got to tie me down with a contract by god that hurts i thought id been pretty generous and decent and i took a lot of pleasurethinks i shell be tickled when i hand her over this twentyor fifty or whatever it was and now seems you been wanting to make it a kind of alimony me like a poor fool thinking i was liberal all the while and you  please stop pitying yourself youre having a beautiful time feeling injured i admit all you say certainly youve given me money both freely and amiably quite as if i were your mistress  carrie  i mean it what was a magnificent spectacle of generosity to you was humiliation to me you gave me moneygave it to your mistress if she was complaisant and then you  carrie  dont interrupt methen you felt youd discharged all obligation well hereafter ill refuse your money as a gift either im your partner in charge of the household department of our business with a regular budget for it or else im nothing if im to be a mistress i shall choose my lovers oh i hate iti hate itthis smirking and hoping for moneyand then not even spending it on jewels as a mistress has a right to but spending it on doubleboilers and socks for you yes indeed youre generous you give me a dollar right outthe only proviso is that i must spend it on a tie for you and you give it when and as you wish how can i be anything but uneconomical  oh well of course looking at it that way  i cant shop around cant buy in large quantities have to stick to stores where i have a charge account good deal of the time cant plan because i dont know how much money i can depend on thats what i pay for your charming sentimentalities about giving so generously you make me  wait wait you know youre exaggerating you never thought about that mistress stuff till just this minute matter of fact you never have smirked and hoped for money but all the same you may be right you ought to run the household as a business ill figure out a definite plan tomorrow and hereafter youll be on a regular amount or percentage with your own checking account  oh that is decent of you she turned toward him trying to be affectionate but his eyes were pink and unlovely in the flare of the match with which he lighted his dead and malodorous cigar his head drooped and a ridge of flesh scattered with pale small bristles bulged out under his chin  she sat in abeyance till he croaked  no tisnt especially decent its just fair and god knows i want to be fair but i expect others to be fair too and youre so high and mighty about people take sam clark best soul that ever lived honest and loyal and a damn good fellow  yes and a good shot at ducks dont forget that  well and he is a good shot too sam drops around in the evening to sit and visit and by golly just because he takes a dry smoke and rolls his cigar around in his mouth and maybe spits a few times you look at him as if he was a hog oh you didnt know i was onto you and i certainly hope sam hasnt noticed it but i never miss it  i have felt that way spittingugh but im sorry you caught my thoughts i tried to be nice i tried to hide them  maybe i catch a whole lot more than you think i do  yes perhaps you do  and d you know why sam doesnt light his cigar when hes here  why  hes so darn afraid youll be offended if he smokes you scare him every time he speaks of the weather you jump him because he aint talking about poetry or gertiegoetheor some other highbrow junk youve got him so leery he scarcely dares to come here  oh i am sorry though im sure its you who are exaggerating now  well now i dont know as i am and i can tell you one thing if you keep on youll manage to drive away every friend ive got  that would be horrible of me you know i dont mean to will what is it about me that frightens samif i do frighten him  oh you do all right stead of putting his legs up on another chair and unbuttoning his vest and telling a good story or maybe kidding me about something he sits on the edge of his chair and tries to make conversation about politics and he doesnt even cuss and sams never real comfortable unless he can cuss a little  in other words he isnt comfortable unless he can behave like a peasant in a mud hut  now thatll be about enough of that you want to know how you scare him first you deliberately fire some question at him that you know darn well he cant answerany fool could see you were experimenting with himand then you shock him by talking of mistresses or something like you were doing just now  of course the pure samuel never speaks of such erring ladies in his private conversations  not when theres ladies around you can bet your life on that  so the impurity lies in failing to pretend that  now we wont go into all thateugenics or whatever damn fad you choose to call it as i say first you shock him and then you become so darn flighty that nobody can follow you either you want to dance or you bang the piano or else you get moody as the devil and dont want to talk or anything else if you must be temperamental why cant you be that way by yourself  my dear man theres nothing id like better than to be by myself occasionally to have a room of my own i suppose you expect me to sit here and dream delicately and satisfy my temperamentality while you wander in from the bathroom with lather all over your face and shout seen my brown pants  huh he did not sound impressed he made no answer he turned out of bed his feet making one solid thud on the floor he marched from the room a grotesque figure in baggy unionpajamas she heard him drawing a drink of water at the bathroom tap she was furious at the contemptuousness of his exit she snuggled down in bed and looked away from him as he returned he ignored her as he flumped into bed he yawned and casually stated  well youll have plenty of privacy when we build a new house  when  oh ill build it all right dont you fret but of course i dont expect any credit for it  now it was she who grunted huh and ignored him and felt independent and masterful as she shot up out of bed turned her back on him fished a lone and petrified chocolate out of her glovebox in the top righthand drawer of the bureau gnawed at it found that it had cocoanut filling said damn wished that she had not said it so that she might be superior to his colloquialism and hurled the chocolate into the wastebasket where it made an evil and mocking clatter among the debris of torn linen collars and toothpaste box then in great dignity and selfdramatization she returned to bed  all this time he had been talking on embroidering his assertion that he didnt expect any credit she was reflecting that he was a rustic that she hated him that she had been insane to marry him that she had married him only because she was tired of work that she must get her long gloves cleaned that she would never do anything more for him and that she mustnt forget his hominy for breakfast she was roused to attention by his storming  im a fool to think about a new house by the time i get it built youll probably have succeeded in your plan to get me completely in dutch with every friend and every patient ive got  she sat up with a bounce she said coldly thank you very much for revealing your real opinion of me if thats the way you feel if im such a hindrance to you i cant stay under this roof another minute and i am perfectly well able to earn my own living i will go at once and you may get a divorce at your pleasure what you want is a nice sweet cow of a woman who will enjoy having your dear friends talk about the weather and spit on the floor  tut dont be a fool  you will very soon find out whether im a fool or not i mean it do you think id stay here one second after i found out that i was injuring you at least i have enough sense of justice not to do that  please stop flying off at tangents carrie this  tangents tangents let me tell you  isnt a theaterplay its a serious effort to have us get together on fundamentals weve both been cranky and said a lot of things we didnt mean i wish we were a couple o bloomin poets and just talked about roses and moonshine but were human all right lets cut out jabbing at each other lets admit we both do fool things see here you know you feel superior to folks youre not as bad as i say but youre not as good as you saynot by a long shot whats the reason youre so superior why cant you take folks as they are  her preparations for stalking out of the dolls house were not yet visible she mused  i think perhaps its my childhood she halted when she went on her voice had an artificial sound her words the bookish quality of emotional meditation my father was the tenderest man in the world but he did feel superior to ordinary people well he was and the minnesota valleyi used to sit there on the cliffs above mankato for hours at a time my chin in my hand looking way down the valley wanting to write poems the shiny tilted roofs below me and the river and beyond it the level fields in the mist and the rim of palisades acrossit held my thoughts in i lived in the valley but the prairieall my thoughts go flying off into the big space do you think it might be that  um well maybe butcarrie you always talk so much about getting all you can out of life and not letting the years slip by and here you deliberately go and deprive yourself of a lot of real good home pleasure by not enjoying people unless they wear frock coats and trot out  morning clothes oh sorry didnt mean t interrupt you  to a lot of teaparties take jack elder you think jack hasnt got any ideas about anything but manufacturing and the tariff on lumber but do you know that jack is nutty about music hell put a grandopera record on the phonograph and sit and listen to it and close his eyesor you take lym cass ever realize what a wellinformed man he is  but is he gopher prairie calls anybody wellinformed whos been through the state capitol and heard about gladstone  now im telling you lym reads a lotsolid stuffhistory or take mart mahoney the garageman hes got a lot of perry prints of famous pictures in his office or old bingham playfair that died here bout a year agolived seven miles out he was a captain in the civil war and knew general sherman and they say he was a miner in nevada right alongside of mark twain youll find these characters in all these small towns and a pile of savvy in every single one of them if you just dig for it  i know and i do love them especially people like champ perry but i cant be so very enthusiastic over the smug cits like jack elder  then im a smug cit too whatever that is  no youre a scientist oh i will try and get the music out of mr elder only why cant he let it come out instead of being ashamed of it and always talking about hunting dogs but i will try is it all right now  sure but theres one other thing you might give me some attention too  thats unjust you have everything i am  no i havent you think you respect meyou always hand out some spiel about my being so useful but you never think of me as having ambitions just as much as you have  perhaps not i think of you as being perfectly satisfied  well im not not by a long shot i dont want to be a plug general practitioner all my life like westlake and die in harness because i cant get out of it and have em say he was a good fellow but he couldnt save a cent not that i care a whoop what they say after ive kicked in and cant hear em but i want to put enough money away so you and i can be independent some day and not

farmlands do you understand why now  yes  will you try and see if you cant think of me as something more than just a dollarchasing roughneck  oh my dear i havent been just i am difficile and i wont call on the dillons and if dr dillon is working for westlake and mcganum i hate him    chapter xv  that december she was in love with her husband  she romanticized herself not as a great reformer but as the wife of a country physician the realities of the doctors household were colored by her pride  late at night a step on the wooden porch heard through her confusion of sleep the stormdoor opened fumbling over the inner doorpanels the buzz of the electric bell kennicott muttering gol darn it but patiently creeping out of bed remembering to draw the covers up to keep her warm feeling for slippers and bathrobe clumping downstairs  from below halfheard in her drowsiness a colloquy in the pidgingerman of the farmers who have forgotten the old country language without learning the new  hello barney wass willst du  morgen doctor die frau ist ja awful sick all night she been having an awful pain in de belly  how long she been this way wie lang eh  i dunno maybe two days  why didnt you

miles south all right huh the hell i will dont you go back to sleep huh well thats all right now you didnt wait so very darn long all right gus shoot her along by  his step on the stairs his quiet moving about the frigid room while he dressed his abstracted and meaningless cough she was supposed to be asleep she was too exquisitely drowsy to break the charm by speaking on a slip of paper laid on the bureaushe could hear the pencil grinding against the marble slabhe wrote his destination he went out hungry chilly unprotesting and she before she fell asleep again loved him for his sturdiness and saw the drama of his riding by night to the frightened household on the distant farm pictured children standing at a window waiting for him he suddenly had in her eyes the heroism of a wireless operator on a ship in a collision of an explorer feverclawed deserted by his bearers but going onjunglegoing  at six when the light faltered in as through ground glass and bleakly identified the chairs as gray rectangles she heard his step on the porch heard him at the furnace the rattle of shaking the grate the slow grinding removal of ashes the shovel thrust into the coalbin the abrupt clatter of the coal as it flew into the firebox the fussy regulation of draftsthe daily sounds of a gopher prairie life now first appealing to her as something brave and enduring manycolored and free she visioned the firebox flames turned to lemon and metallic gold as the coaldust sifted over them thin twisty flutters of purple ghost flames which gave no light slipping up between the dark banked coals  it was luxurious in bed and the house would be warm for her when she rose she reflected what a worthless cat she was what were her aspirations beside his capability  she awoke again as he dropped into bed  seems just a few minutes ago that you started out  ive been away four hours ive operated a woman for appendicitis in a dutch kitchen came awful close to losing her too but i pulled her through all right close squeak barney says he shot ten rabbits last sunday  he was instantly asleepone hour of rest before he had to be up and ready for the farmers who came in early she marveled that in what was to her but a nightblurred moment he should have been in a distant place have taken charge of a strange house have slashed a woman saved a life  what wonder he detested the lazy westlake and mcganum how could the easy guy pollock understand this skill and endurance  then kennicott was grumbling sevenfifteen arent you ever going to get up for breakfast and he was not a heroscientist but a rather irritable and commonplace man who needed a shave they had coffee griddlecakes and sausages and talked about mrs mcganums atrocious alligatorhide belt night witchery and morning disillusion were alike forgotten in the march of realities and days   ii  familiar to the doctors wife was the man with an injured leg driven in from the country on a sunday afternoon and brought to the house he sat in a rocker in the back of a lumberwagon his face pale from the anguish of the jolting his leg was thrust out before him resting on a starchbox and covered with a leatherbound horseblanket his drab courageous wife drove the wagon and she helped kennicott support him as he hobbled up the steps into the house  fellow cut his leg with an axpretty bad gashhalvor nelson nine miles out kennicott observed  carol fluttered at the back of the room childishly excited when she was sent to fetch towels and a basin of water kennicott lifted the farmer into a chair and chuckled there we are halvor well have you out fixing fences and drinking aquavit in a month the farmwife sat on the couch expressionless bulky in a mans dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets the flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her seamed neck her white wool gloves lay in her lap  kennicott drew from the injured leg the thick red german sock the innumerous other socks of gray and white wool then the spiral bandage the leg was of an unwholesome dead white with the black hairs feeble and thin and flattened and the scar a puckered line of crimson surely carol shuddered this was not human flesh the rosy shining tissue of the amorous poets  kennicott examined the scar smiled at halvor and his wife chanted fine b gosh couldnt be better  the nelsons looked deprecating the farmer nodded a cue to his wife and she mourned  vell how much ve going to owe you doctor  i guess itll belets see one drive out and two calls i guess itll be about eleven dollars in all lena  i dunno ve can pay you yoost a little wile doctor  kennicott lumbered over to her patted her shoulder roared why lord love you sister i wont worry if i never get it you pay me next fall when you get your crop    carrie suppose you or bea could shake up a cup of coffee and some cold lamb for the nelsons they got a long cold drive ahead   iii   he had been gone since morning her eyes ached with reading vida sherwin could not come to tea she wandered through the house empty as the bleary street without the problem of will the doctor be home in time for supper or shall i sit down without him was important in the household six was the rigid the canonical supperhour but at halfpast six he had not come much speculation with bea had the obstetrical case taken longer than he had expected had he been called somewhere else was the snow much heavier out in the country so that he should have taken a buggy or even a cutter instead of the car here in town it had melted a lot but still  a honking a shout the motor engine raced before it was shut off  she hurried to the window the car was a monster at rest after furious adventures the headlights blazed on the clots of ice in the road so that the tiniest lumps gave mountainous shadows and the taillight cast a circle of ruby on the snow behind kennicott was opening the door crying here we are old girl got stuck couple times but we made it by golly we made it and here we be come on food eatins  she rushed to him patted his fur coat the long hairs smooth but chilly to her fingers she joyously summoned bea all right hes here well sit right down   iv   there were to inform the doctors wife of his successes no clapping audiences nor bookreviews nor honorary degrees but there was a letter written by a german farmer recently moved from minnesota to saskatchewan   dear sor as you haf bin treading mee for a fue weaks dis somer and seen wat is rong wit mee so in regarding to dat i wont to tank you the

store he looked at her as though he had a right to he spoke softly i havent see you the last few days  no ive been out in the country with will several times hes sodo you know that people like you and me can never understand people like him were a pair of hypercritical loafers you and i while he quietly goes and does things  she nodded and smiled and was very busy about purchasing boric acid he stared after her and slipped away  when she found that he was gone she was slightly disconcerted   vi   she couldat timesagree with kennicott that the shavingandcorsets familiarity of married life was not dreary vulgarity but a wholesome frankness that artificial reticences might merely be irritating she was not much disturbed when for hours he sat about the livingroom in his honest socks but she would not listen to his theory that all this romance stuff is simply moonshineelegant when youre courting but no use busting yourself keeping it up all your life  she thought of surprises games to vary the days she knitted an astounding purple scarf which she hid under his supper plate when he discovered it he looked embarrassed and gasped is today an anniversary or something gosh id forgotten it  once she filled a thermos bottle with hot coffee a cornflakes box with cookies just baked by bea and bustled to his office at three in the afternoon she hid her bundles in the hall and peeped in  the office was shabby kennicott had inherited it from a medical predecessor and changed it only by adding a white enameled operatingtable a sterilizer a roentgenray apparatus and a small portable typewriter it was a suite of two rooms a waitingroom with straight chairs shaky pine table and those coverless and unknown magazines which are found only in the offices of dentists and doctors the room beyond looking on main street was businessoffice consultingroom operatingroom and in an alcove bacteriological and chemical laboratory the wooden floors of both rooms were bare the furniture was brown and scaly  waiting for the doctor were two women as still as though they were paralyzed and a man in a railroad brakemans uniform holding his bandaged right hand with his tanned left they stared at carol she sat modestly in a stiff chair feeling frivolous and out of place  kennicott appeared at the inner door ushering out a bleached man with a trickle of wan beard and consoling him all right dad be careful about the sugar and mind the diet i gave you gut the prescription filled and come in and see me next week say uh better uh better not drink too much beer all right dad  his voice was artificially hearty he looked absently at carol he was a medical machine now not a domestic machine what is it carrie he droned  no hurry just wanted to say hello  well  selfpity because he did not divine that this was a surprise party rendered her sad and interesting to herself and she had the pleasure of the martyrs in saying bravely to him its nothing special if youre busy long ill trot home  while she waited she ceased to pity and began to mock herself for the first time she observed the waitingroom oh yes the doctors family had to have obi panels and a wide couch and an electric percolator but any hole was good enough for sick tired common people who were nothing but the one means and excuse for the doctors existing no she couldnt blame kennicott he was satisfied by the shabby chairs he put up with them as his patients did it was her neglected provinceshe who had been going about talking of rebuilding the whole town  when the patients were gone she brought in her bundles  whats those wondered kennicott  turn your back look out of the window  he obeyednot very much bored when she cried now a feast of cookies and small hard candies and hot coffee was spread on the rolltop desk in the inner room  his broad face lightened thats a new one on me never was more surprised in my life and by golly i believe i am hungry say this is fine  when the first exhilaration of the surprise had declined she demanded will im going to refurnish your waitingroom  whats the matter with it its all right  it is not its hideous we can afford to give your patients a better place and it would be good business she felt tremendously politic  rats i dont worry about the business you look here now as i told youjust because i like to tuck a few dollars away ill be switched if ill stand for your thinking im nothing but a dollarchasing  stop it quick im not hurting your feelings im not criticizing im the adoring least one of thy harem i just mean  two days later with pictures wicker chairs a rug she had made the waitingroom habitable and kennicott admitted does look a lot better never thought much about it guess i need being bullied  she was convinced that she was gloriously content in her career as doctorswife   vii   she tried to free herself from the speculation and disillusionment which had been twitching at her sought to dismiss all the opinionation of an insurgent era she wanted to shine upon the vealfaced bristlybearded lyman cass as much as upon miles bjornstam or guy pollock she gave a reception for the thanatopsis club but her real acquiring of merit was in calling upon that mrs bogart whose gossipy good opinion was so valuable to a doctor  though the bogart house was next door she had entered it but three times now she put on her new moleskin cap which made her face small and innocent she rubbed off the traces of a lipstickand fled across the alley before her admirable resolution should sneak away  the age of houses like the age of men has small relation to their years the dullgreen cottage of the good widow bogart was twenty years old but it had the antiquity of cheops and the smell of mummydust its neatness rebuked the street the two stones by the path were painted yellow the outhouse was so overmodestly masked with vines and lattice that it was not concealed at all the last iron dog remaining in gopher prairie stood among whitewashed conchshells upon the lawn the hallway was dismayingly scrubbed the kitchen was an exercise in mathematics with problems worked out in equidistant chairs  the parlor was kept for visitors carol suggested lets sit in the kitchen please dont trouble to light the parlor stove  no trouble at all my gracious and you coming so seldom and all and the kitchen is a perfect sight i try to keep it clean but cy will track mud all over it ive spoken to him about it a hundred times if ive spoken once no you sit right there dearie and ill make a fire no trouble at all practically no trouble at all  mrs bogart groaned rubbed her joints and repeatedly dusted her hands while she made the fire and when carol tried to help she lamented oh it doesnt matter guess i aint good for much but toil and workin anyway seems as though thats what a lot of folks think  the parlor was distinguished by an expanse of rag carpet from which as they entered mrs bogart hastily picked one sad dead fly in the center of the carpet was a rug depicting a red newfoundland dog reclining in a green and yellow daisy field and labeled our friend the parlor organ tall and thin was adorned with a mirror partly circular partly square and partly diamondshaped and with brackets holding a pot of geraniums a mouthorgan and a copy of the oldtime hymnal on the center table was a searsroebuck mailorder catalogue a silver frame with photographs of the baptist church and of an elderly clergyman and an aluminum tray containing a rattlesnakes rattle and a broken spectaclelens  mrs bogart spoke of the eloquence of the reverend mr zitterel the coldness of cold days the price of poplar wood dave dyers new haircut and cy bogarts essential piety as i said to his sunday school teacher cy may be a little wild but thats because hes got so much better brains than a lot of these boys and this farmer that claims he caught cy stealing beggies is a liar and i ought to have the law on him  mrs bogart went thoroughly into the rumor that the girl waiter at billys lunch was not all she might beor rather was quite all she might be  my lands what can you expect when everybody knows what her mother was and if these traveling salesmen would let her alone she would be all right though i certainly dont believe she ought to be allowed to think she can pull the wool over our eyes the sooner shes sent to the school for incorrigible girls down at sauk centre the better for all andwont you just have a cup of coffee carol dearie im sure you wont mind old aunty bogart calling you by your first name when you think how long ive known will and i was such a friend of his dear lovely mother when she lived here andwas that fur cap expensive butdont you think its awful the way folks talk in this town  mrs bogart hitched her chair nearer her large face with its disturbing collection of moles and lone black hairs wrinkled cunningly she showed her decayed teeth in a reproving smile and in the confidential voice of one who scents stale bedroom scandal she breathed  i just dont see how folks can talk and act like they do you dont know the things that go on under cover this townwhy its only the religious training ive given cy thats kept him so innocent ofthings just the other dayi never pay no attention to stories but i heard it mighty good and straight that harry haydock is carrying on with a girl that clerks in a store down in minneapolis and poor juanita not knowing anything about itthough maybe its the judgment of god because before she married harry she acted up with more than one boywell i dont like to say it and maybe i aint uptodate like cy says but i always believed a lady shouldnt even give names to all sorts of dreadful things but just the same i know there was at least one case where juanita and a boywell they were just dreadful andandthen theres that ole jenson the grocer that thinks hes so plaguey smart and i know he made up to a farmers wife andand this awful man bjornstam that does chores and nat hicks and  there was it seemed no person in town who was not living a life of shame except mrs bogart and naturally she resented it  she knew she had always happened to be there once she whispered she was going by when an indiscreet windowshade had been left up a couple of inches once she had noticed a man and woman holding hands and right at a methodist sociable  another thingheaven knows i never want to start trouble but i cant help what i see from my back steps and i notice your hired girl bea carrying on with the grocery boys and all  mrs bogart id trust bea as i would myself  oh dearie you dont understand me im sure shes a good girl i mean shes green and i hope that none of these horrid young men that there are around town will get her into trouble its their parents fault letting them run wild and hear evil things if i had my way there wouldnt be none of them not boys nor girls neither allowed to know anything aboutabout things till they was married its terrible the bald way that some folks talk it just shows and gives away what awful thoughts they got inside them and theres nothing can cure them except coming right to god and kneeling down like i do at prayermeeting every wednesday evening and saying o god i would be a miserable sinner except for thy grace  id make every last one of these brats go to sunday school and learn to think about nice things stead of about cigarettes and goingsonand these dances they have at the lodges are the worst thing that ever happened to this town lot of young men squeezing girls and finding outoh its dreadful ive told the mayor he ought to put a stop to them andthere was one boy in this town i dont want to be suspicious or uncharitable but  it was half an hour before carol escaped  she stopped on her own porch and thought viciously  if that woman is on the side of the angels then i have no choice i must be on the side of the devil butisnt she like me she too wants to reform the town she too criticizes everybody she too thinks the men are vulgar and limited am i like her this is ghastly  that evening she did not merely consent to play cribbage with kennicott she urged him to play and she worked up a hectic interest in landdeals and sam clark   viii   in courtship days kennicott had shown her a photograph of nels erdstroms baby and log cabin but she had never seen the erdstroms they had become merely patients of the doctor kennicott telephoned her on a middecember afternoon want to throw your coat on and drive out to erdstroms with me fairly warm nels got the jaundice  oh yes she hastened to put on woolen stockings high boots sweater muffler cap mittens  the snow was too thick and the ruts frozen too hard for the motor they drove out in a clumsy high carriage tucked over them was a blue woolen cover prickly to her wrists and outside of it a buffalo robe humble and motheaten now used ever since the bison herds had streaked the prairie a few miles to the west  the scattered houses between which they passed in town were small and desolate in contrast to the expanse of huge snowy yards and wide street they crossed the railroad tracks and instantly were in the farm country the big piebald horses snorted clouds of steam and started to trot the carriage squeaked in rhythm kennicott drove with clucks of there boy take it easy he was thinking he paid no attention to carol yet it was he who commented pretty nice over there as they approached an oakgrove where shifty winter sunlight quivered in the hollow between two snowdrifts  they drove from the natural prairie to a cleared district which twenty years ago had been forest the country seemed to stretch unchanging to the north pole low hill brushscraggly bottom reedy creek muskrat mound fields with frozen brown clods thrust up through the snow  her ears and nose were pinched her breath frosted her collar her fingers ached  getting colder she said  yup  that was all their conversation for three miles yet she was happy  they reached nels erdstroms at four and with a throb she recognized the courageous venture which had lured her to gopher prairie the cleared fields furrows among stumps a log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with dry hay but nels had prospered he used the log cabin as a barn and a new house reared up a proud unwise gopher prairie house the more naked and ungraceful in its glossy white paint and pink trimmings every tree had been cut down the house was so unsheltered so battered by the wind so bleakly thrust out into the harsh clearing that carol shivered but they were welcomed warmly enough in the kitchen with its crisp new plaster its black and nickel range its cream separator in a corner  mrs erdstrom begged her to sit in the parlor where there was a phonograph and an oak and leather davenport the prairie farmers proofs of social progress but she dropped down by the kitchen stove and insisted please dont mind me when mrs erdstrom had followed the doctor out of the room carol glanced in a friendly way at the grained pine cupboard the framed lutheran konfirmations attest the traces of fried eggs and sausages on the dining table against the wall and a jewel among calendars presenting not only a lithographic young woman with cherry lips and a swedish advertisement of axel egges grocery but also a thermometer and a matchholder  she saw that a boy of four or five was staring at her from the hall a boy in gingham shirt and faded corduroy trousers but largeeyed firmmouthed widebrowed he vanished then peeped in again biting his knuckles turning his shoulder toward her in shyness  didnt she rememberwhat was itkennicott sitting beside her at fort snelling urging see how scared that baby is needs some woman like you  magic had fluttered about her thenmagic of sunset and cool air and the curiosity of lovers she held out her hands as much to that sanctity as to the boy  he edged into the room doubtfully sucking his thumb  hello she said whats your name  hee hee hee  youre quite right i agree with you silly people like me always ask children their names  hee hee hee  come here and ill tell you the story ofwell i dont know what it will be about but it will have a slim heroine and a prince charming  he stood stoically while she spun nonsense his giggling ceased she was winning him then the telephone belltwo long rings one short  mrs erdstrom galloped into the room shrieked into the transmitter vell yes yes dis is erdstroms place heh oh you vant de doctor  kennicott appeared growled into the telephone  well what do you want oh

bessie it aint possible this is the fellow that used to be so sickly why say hes a great big strapping svenska nowgoing to be bigger n his daddy  kennicotts bluffness made the child squirm with a delight which carol could not evoke it was a humble wife who followed the busy doctor out to the carriage and her ambition was not to play rachmaninoff better nor to build town halls but to chuckle at babies  the sunset was merely a flush of rose on a dome of silver with oak twigs and thin poplar branches against it but a silo on the horizon changed from a red tank to a tower of violet misted over with gray the purple road vanished and without lights in the darkness of a world destroyed they swayed ontoward nothing  it was a bumpy cold way to the morgenroth farm and she was asleep when they arrived  here was no glaring new house with a proud phonograph but a low whitewashed kitchen smelling of cream and cabbage adolph morgenroth was lying on a couch in the rarely used diningroom his heavy workscarred wife was shaking her hands in anxiety  carol felt that kennicott would do something magnificent and startling but he was casual he greeted the man well well adolph have to fix you up eh quietly to the wife hat die drug store my schwartze bag hier geschickt soschon wie viel uhr ist s sieben nun lassen uns ein wenig supper zuerst haben got any of that good beer leftgiebt s noch bier  he had supped in four minutes his coat off his sleeves rolled up he was scrubbing his hands in a tin basin in the sink using the bar of yellow kitchen soap  carol had not dared to look into the farther room while she labored over the supper of beer rye bread moist cornbeef and cabbage set on the kitchen table the man in there was groaning in her one glance she had seen that his blue flannel shirt was open at a corded tobaccobrown neck the hollows of which were sprinkled with thin black and gray hairs he was covered with a sheet like a corpse and outside the sheet was his right arm wrapped in towels stained with blood  but kennicott strode into the other room gaily and she followed him with surprising delicacy in his large fingers he unwrapped the towels and revealed an arm which below the elbow was a mass of blood and raw flesh the man bellowed the room grew thick about her she was very seasick she fled to a chair in the kitchen through the haze of nausea she heard kennicott grumbling afraid it will have to come off adolph what did you do fall on a reaper blade well fix it right up carrie carol  she couldntshe couldnt get up then she was up her knees like water her stomach revolving a thousand times a second her eyes filmed her ears full of roaring she couldnt reach the diningroom she was going to faint then she was in the diningroom leaning against the wall trying to smile flushing hot and cold along her chest and sides while kennicott mumbled say help mrs morgenroth and me carry him in on the kitchen table no first go out and shove those two tables together and put a blanket on them and a clean sheet  it was salvation to push the heavy tables to scrub them to be exact in placing the sheet her head cleared she was able to look calmly in at her husband and the farmwife while they undressed the wailing man got him into a clean nightgown and washed his arm kennicott came to lay out his instruments she realized that with no hospital facilities yet with no worry about it her husbandher husbandwas going to perform a surgical operation that miraculous boldness of which one read in stories about famous surgeons  she helped them to move adolph into the kitchen the man was in such a funk that he would not use his legs he was heavy and smelled of sweat and the stable but she put her arm about his waist her sleek head by his chest she tugged at him she clicked her tongue in imitation of kennicotts cheerful noises  when adolph was on the table kennicott laid a hemispheric steel and cotton frame on his face suggested to carol now you sit here at his head and keep the ether drippingabout this fast see ill watch his breathing look whos here real anesthetist ochsner hasnt got a better one class eh    now now adolph take it easy this wont hurt you a bit put you all nice and asleep and it wont hurt a bit schweig mal bald schlaft man grat wie ein kind so so bald gehts besser  as she let the ether drip nervously trying to keep the rhythm that kennicott had indicated carol stared at her husband with the abandon of heroworship  he shook his head bad lightbad light here mrs morgenroth you stand right here and hold this lamp hier und diesesdieses lamp haltenso  by that streaky glimmer he worked swiftly at ease the room was still carol tried to look at him yet not look at the seeping blood the crimson slash the vicious scalpel the ether fumes were sweet choking her head seemed to be floating away from her body her arm was feeble  it was not the blood but the grating of the surgical saw on the living bone that broke her and she knew that she had been fighting off nausea that she was beaten she was lost in dizziness she heard kennicotts voice  sick trot outdoors couple minutes adolph will stay under now  she was fumbling at a doorknob which whirled in insulting circles she was on the stoop gasping forcing air into her chest her head clearing as she returned she caught the scene as a whole the cavernous kitchen two milkcans a leaden patch by the wall hams dangling from a beam bats of light at the stove door and in the center illuminated by a small glass lamp held by a frightened stout woman dr kennicott bending over a body which was humped under a sheetthe surgeon his bare arms daubed with blood his hands in paleyellow rubber gloves loosening the tourniquet his face without emotion save when he threw up his head and clucked at the farmwife hold that light steady just a second morenoch blos esn wenig  he speaks a vulgar common incorrect german of life and death and birth and the soil i read the french and german of sentimental lovers and christmas garlands and i thought that it was i who had the culture she worshiped as she returned to her place  after a time he snapped thats enough dont give him any more ether he was concentrated on tying an artery his gruffness seemed heroic to her  as he shaped the flap of flesh she murmured oh you are wonderful  he was surprised why this is a cinch now if it had been like last weekget me some more water now last week i had a case with an ooze in the peritoneal cavity and by golly if it wasnt a stomach ulcer that i hadnt suspected andthere say i certainly am sleepy lets turn in here too late to drive home and tastes to me like a storm coming   ix   they slept on a feather bed with their fur coats over them in the morning they broke ice in the pitcherthe vast flowered and gilt pitcher  kennicotts storm had not come when they set out it was hazy and growing warmer after a mile she saw that he was studying a dark cloud in the north he urged the horses to the run but she forgot his unusual haste in wonder at the tragic landscape the pale snow the prickles of old stubble and the clumps of ragged brush faded into a gray obscurity under the hillocks were cold shadows the willows about a farmhouse were agitated by the rising wind and the patches of bare wood where the bark had peeled away were white as the flesh of a leper the snowy slews were of a harsh flatness the whole land was cruel and a climbing cloud of slateedged blackness dominated the sky  guess were about in for a blizzard speculated kennicott we can make ben mcgonegals anyway  blizzard really whybut still we used to think they were fun when i was a girl daddy had to stay home from court and wed stand at the window and watch the snow  not much fun on the prairie get lost freeze to death take no chances he chirruped at the horses they were flying now the carriage rocking on the hard ruts  the whole air suddenly crystallized into large damp flakes the horses and the buffalo robe were covered with snow her face was wet the thin butt of the whip held a white ridge the air became colder the snowflakes were harder they shot in level lines clawing at her face  she could not see a hundred feet ahead  kennicott was stern he bent forward the reins firm in his coonskin gauntlets she was certain that he would get through he always got through things  save for his presence the world and all normal living disappeared they were lost in the boiling snow he leaned close to bawl letting the horses have their heads theyll get us home  with a terrifying bump they were off the road slanting with two wheels in the ditch but instantly they were jerked back as the horses fled on she gasped she tried to and did not feel brave as she pulled the woolen robe up about her chin  they were passing something like a dark wall on the right i know that barn he yelped he pulled at the reins peeping from the covers she saw his teeth pinch his lower lip saw him scowl as he slackened and sawed and jerked sharply again at the racing horses  they stopped  farmhouse there put robe around you and come on he cried  it was like diving into icy water to climb out of the carriage but on the ground she smiled at him her face little and childish and pink above the buffalo robe over her shoulders in a swirl of flakes which scratched at their eyes like a maniac darkness he unbuckled the harness he turned and plodded back a ponderous furry figure holding the horses bridles carols hand dragging at his sleeve  they came to the cloudy bulk of a barn whose outer wall was directly upon the road feeling along it he found a gate led them into a yard into the barn the interior was warm it stunned them with its languid quiet  he carefully drove the horses into stalls  her toes were coals of pain lets run for the house she said  cant not yet might never find it might get lost ten feet away from it sit over in this stall near the horses well rush for the house when the blizzard lifts  im so stiff i cant walk  he carried her into the stall stripped off her overshoes and boots stopping to blow on his purple fingers as he fumbled at her laces he rubbed her feet and covered her with the buffalo robe and horseblankets from the pile on the feedbox she was drowsy hemmed in by the storm she sighed  youre so strong and yet so skilful and not afraid of blood or storm or  used to it only thing thats bothered me was the chance the ether fumes might explode last night  i dont understand  why dave the darn fool sent me ether instead of chloroform like i told him and you know ether fumes are mighty inflammable especially with that lamp right by the table but i had to operate of coursewound chuckfull of barnyard filth that way  you knew all the time thatboth you and i might have been blown up you knew it while you were operating  sure didnt you why whats the matter    chapter xvi  kennicott was heavily pleased by her christmas presents and he gave her a diamond barpin but she could not persuade herself that he was much interested in the rites of the morning in the tree she had decorated the three stockings she had hung the ribbons and gilt seals and hidden messages he said only  nice way to fix things all right what do you say we go down to jack elders and have a game of five hundred this afternoon  she remembered her fathers christmas fantasies the sacred old rag doll at the top of the tree the score of cheap presents the punch and carols the roast chestnuts by the fire and the gravity with which the judge opened the childrens scrawly notes and took cognizance of demands for sledrides for opinions upon the existence of santa claus she remembered him reading out a long indictment of himself for being a sentimentalist against the peace and dignity of the state of minnesota she remembered his thin legs twinkling before their sled  she muttered unsteadily must run up and put on my shoesslippers so cold in the not very romantic solitude of the locked bathroom she sat on the slippery edge of the tub and wept   ii   kennicott had five hobbies medicine landinvestment carol motoring and hunting it is not certain in what order he preferred them solid though his enthusiasms were in the matter of medicinehis admiration of this city surgeon his condemnation of that for tricky ways of persuading country practitioners to bring in surgical patients his indignation about feesplitting his pride in a new xray apparatusnone of these beatified him as did motoring  he nursed his twoyearold buick even in winter when it was stored in the stablegarage behind the house he filled the greasecups varnished a fender removed from beneath the back seat the debris of gloves copper washers crumpled maps dust and greasy rags winter noons he wandered out and stared owlishly at the car he became excited over a fabulous trip we might take next summer he galloped to the station brought home railway maps and traced motorroutes from gopher prairie to winnipeg or des moines or grand marais thinking aloud and expecting her to be effusive about such academic questions as now i wonder if we could stop at baraboo and break the jump from la crosse to chicago  to him motoring was a faith not to be questioned a highchurch cult with electric sparks for candles and pistonrings possessing the sanctity of altarvessels his liturgy was composed of intoned and metrical roadcomments they say theres a pretty good hike from duluth to international falls  hunting was equally a devotion full of metaphysical concepts veiled from carol all winter he read sportingcatalogues and thought about remarkable past shots member that time when i got two ducks on a long chance just at sunset at least once a month he drew his favorite repeating shotgun his pump gun from its wrapper of greased canton flannel he oiled the trigger and spent silent ecstatic moments aiming at the ceiling sunday mornings carol heard him trudging up to the attic and there an hour later she found him turning over boots wooden duckdecoys lunchboxes or reflectively squinting at old shells rubbing their brass caps with his sleeve and shaking his head as he thought about their uselessness  he kept the loadingtools he had used as a boy a capper for shotgun shells a mold for lead bullets when once in a housewifely frenzy for getting rid of things she raged why dont you give these away he solemnly defended them well you cant tell they might come in handy some day  she flushed she wondered if he was thinking of the child they would have when as he put it they were sure they could afford one  mysteriously aching nebulously sad she slipped away halfconvinced but only halfconvinced that it was horrible and unnatural this postponement of release of motheraffection this sacrifice to her opinionation and to his cautious desire for prosperity  but it would be worse if he were like sam clarkinsisted on having children she considered then if will were the prince wouldnt i demand his child  kennicotts landdeals were both financial advancement and favorite game driving through the country he noticed which farms had good crops he heard the news about the restless farmer who was thinking about selling out here and pulling his freight for alberta he asked the veterinarian about the value of different breeds of stock he inquired of lyman cass whether or not einar gyseldson really had had a yield of forty bushels of wheat to the acre he was always consulting julius flickerbaugh who handled more real estate than law and more law than justice he studied township maps and read notices of auctions  thus he was able to buy a quartersection of land for one hundred and fifty dollars an acre and to sell it in a year or two after installing a cement floor in the barn and running water in the house for one hundred and eighty or even two hundred  he spoke of these details to sam clark    rather often  in all his games cars and guns and land he expected carol to take an interest but he did not give her the facts which might have created interest he talked only of the obvious and tedious aspects never of his aspirations in finance nor of the mechanical principles of motors  this month of romance she was eager to understand his hobbies she shivered in the garage while he spent half an hour in deciding whether to put alcohol or patent nonfreezing liquid into the radiator or to drain out the water entirely or no then i wouldnt want to take her out if it turned warmstill of course i could fill the radiator againwouldnt take so awful longjust take a few pails of waterstill if it turned cold on me again before i drained itcourse theres some people that put in kerosene but they say it rots the hoseconnections andwhere did i put that lugwrench  it was at this point that she gave up being a motorist and retired to the house  in their new intimacy he was more communicative about his practise he informed her with the invariable warning not to tell that mrs sunderquist had another baby coming that the hired girl at howlands was in trouble but when she asked technical questions he did not know how to answer when she inquired exactly what is the method of taking out the tonsils he yawned tonsilectomy why you justif theres pus you operate just take em out seen the newspaper what the devil did bea do with it  she did not try again   iii   they had gone to the movies the movies were almost as vital to kennicott and the other solid citizens of gopher prairie as landspeculation and guns and automobiles  the feature film portrayed a brave young yankee who conquered a south american republic he turned the natives from their barbarous habits of singing and laughing to the vigorous sanity the pep and punch and go of the north he taught them to work in factories to wear klassy kollege klothes and to shout oh you baby doll watch me gather in the mazuma he changed nature itself a mountain which had borne nothing but lilies and cedars and loafing clouds was by his hustle so inspirited that it broke out in long wooden sheds and piles of iron ore to be converted into steamers to carry iron ore to be converted into steamers to carry iron ore  the intellectual tension induced by the master film was relieved by a livelier more lyric and less philosophical drama mack schnarken and the bathing suit babes in a comedy of manners entitled right on the coco mr schnarken was at various high moments a cook a lifeguard a burlesque actor and a sculptor there was a hotel hallway up which policemen charged only to be stunned by plaster busts hurled upon them from the innumerous doors if the plot lacked lucidity the dual motif of legs and pie was clear and sure bathing and modeling were equally sound occasions for legs the weddingscene was but an approach to the thunderous climax when mr schnarken slipped a piece of custard pie into the clergymans rear pocket  the audience in the rosebud movie palace squealed and wiped their eyes they scrambled under the seats for overshoes mittens and mufflers while the screen announced that next week mr schnarken might be seen in a new riproaring extraspecial superfeature of the clean comedy corporation entitled under mollies bed  im glad said carol to kennicott as they stooped before the northwest gale which was torturing the barren street that this is a moral country we dont allow any of these beastly frank novels  yump vice society and postal department wont stand for them the american people dont like filth  yes its fine im glad we have such dainty romances as right on the coco instead  say what in heck do you think youre trying to do kid me  he was silent she awaited his anger she meditated upon his gutter patois the boeotian dialect characteristic of gopher prairie he laughed puzzlingly when they came into the glow of the house he laughed again he condescended  ive got to hand it to you youre consistent all right id of thought that after getting this lookin at a lot of good decent farmers youd get over this highart stuff but you hang right on  well to herself he takes advantage of my trying to be good  tell you carrie theres just three classes of people folks that havent got any ideas at all and cranks that kick about everything and regular guys the fellows with sticktuitiveness that boost and get the worlds work done  then im probably a crank she smiled negligently  no i wont admit it you do like to talk but at a showdown youd prefer sam clark to any damn longhaired artist  ohwell  oh well mockingly my were just going to change everything arent we going to tell fellows that have been making movies for ten years how to direct em and tell architects how to build towns and make the magazines publish nothing but a lot of highbrow stories about old maids and about wives that dont know what they want oh were a terror    come on now carrie come out of it wake up youve got a fine nerve kicking about a movie because it shows a few legs why youre always touting these greek dancers or whatever they are that dont even wear a shimmy  but dear the trouble with that filmit wasnt that it got in so many legs but that it giggled coyly and promised to show more of them and then didnt keep the promise it was peeping toms idea of humor  i dont get you look here now  she lay awake while he rumbled with sleep  i must go on my crank ideas he calls them i thought that adoring him watching him operate would be enough it isnt not after the first thrill  i dont want to hurt him but i must go on  it isnt enough to stand by while he fills an automobile radiator and chucks me bits of information  if i stood by and admired him long enough i would be content i would become a nice little woman the village virus alreadyim not reading anything i havent touched the piano for a week im letting the days drown in worship of a good deal ten plunks more per acre i wont i wont succumb  how ive failed at everything the thanatopsis parties pioneers city hall guy and vida butit doesnt matter im not trying to reform the town now im not trying to organize browning clubs and sit in clean white kids yearning up at lecturers with ribbony eyeglasses i am trying to save my soul  will kennicott asleep there trusting me thinking he holds me and im leaving him all of me left him when he laughed at me it wasnt enough for him that i admired him i must change myself and grow like him he takes advantage no more its finished i will go on   iv   her violin lay on top of the upright piano she picked it up since she had last touched it the dried strings had snapped and upon it lay a gold and crimson cigarband   v   she longed to see guy pollock for the confirming of the brethren in the faith but kennicotts dominance was heavy upon her she could not determine whether she was checked by fear or him or by inertiaby dislike of the emotional labor of the scenes which would be involved in asserting independence she was like the revolutionist at fifty not afraid of death but bored by the probability of bad steaks and bad breaths and sitting up all night on windy barricades  the second evening after the movies she impulsively summoned vida sherwin and guy to the house for popcorn and cider in the livingroom vida and kennicott debated the value of manual training in grades below the eighth while carol sat beside guy at the dining table buttering popcorn she was quickened by the speculation in his eyes she murmured  guy do you want to help me  my dear how  i dont know  he waited  i think i want you to help me find out what has made the darkness of the women gray darkness and shadowy trees were all in it ten million women young married women with good prosperous husbands and business women in linen collars and grandmothers that gad out to teas and wives of underpaid miners and farmwives who really like to make butter and go to church what is it we wantand need will kennicott there would say that we need lots of children and hard work but it isnt that theres the same discontent in women with eight children and one more comingalways one more coming and you find it in stenographers and wives who scrub just as much as in girl collegegraduates who wonder how they can escape their kind parents what do we want  essentially i think you are like myself carol you want to go back to an age of tranquillity and charming manners you want to enthrone good taste again  just good taste fastidious people ohno i believe all of us want the same thingswere all together the industrial workers and the women and the farmers and the negro race and the asiatic colonies and even a few of the respectables its all the same revolt in all the classes that have waited and taken advice i think perhaps we want a more conscious life were tired of drudging and sleeping and dying were tired of seeing just a few people able to be individualists were tired of always deferring hope till the next generation were tired of hearing the politicians and priests and cautious reformers and the husbands coax us be calm be patient wait we have the plans for a utopia already made just give us a bit more time and well produce it trust us were wiser than you for ten thousand years theyve said that we want our utopia nowand were going to try our hands at it all we want iseverything for all of us for every housewife and every longshoreman and every hindu nationalist and every teacher we want everything we shatnt get it so we shatnt ever be content  she wondered why he was wincing he broke in  see here my dear i certainly hope you dont class yourself with a lot of troublemaking laborleaders democracy is all right theoretically and ill admit there are industrial injustices but id rather have them than see the world reduced to a dead level of mediocrity i refuse to believe that you have anything in common with a lot of laboring men rowing for bigger wages so that they can buy wretched flivvers and hideous playerpianos and  at this second in buenos ayres a newspaper editor broke his routine of being bored by exchanges to assert any injustice is better than seeing the world reduced to a gray level of scientific dullness at this second a clerk standing at the bar of a new york saloon stopped milling his secret fear of his nagging officemanager long enough to growl at the chauffeur beside him aw you socialists make me sick im an individualist i aint going to be nagged by no bureaus and take orders off laborleaders and mean to say a hobos as good as you and me  at this second carol realized that for all guys love of dead elegances his timidity was as depressing to her as the bulkiness of sam clark she realized that he was not a mystery as she had excitedly believed not a romantic messenger from the world outside on whom she could count for escape he belonged to gopher prairie absolutely she was snatched back from a dream of far countries and found herself on main street  he was completing his protest you dont want to be mixed up in all this orgy of meaningless discontent  she soothed him no i dont im not heroic im scared by all the fighting thats going on in the world i want nobility and adventure but perhaps i want still more to curl on the hearth with some one i love  would you  he did not finish it he picked up a handful of popcorn let it run through his fingers looked at her wistfully  with the loneliness of one who has put away a possible love carol saw that he was a stranger she saw that he had never been anything but a frame on which she had hung shining garments if she had let him diffidently make love to her it was not because she cared but because she did not care because it did not matter  she smiled at him with the exasperating tactfulness of a woman checking a flirtation a smile like an airy pat on the arm she sighed youre a dear to let me tell you my imaginary troubles she bounced up and trilled shall we take the popcorn in to them now  guy looked after her desolately  while she teased vida and kennicott she was repeating i must go on   vi   miles bjornstam the pariah red swede had brought his circular saw and portable gasoline engine to the house to cut the cords of poplar for the kitchen range kennicott had given the order carol knew nothing of it till she heard the ringing of the saw and glanced out to see bjornstam in black leather jacket and enormous ragged purple mittens pressing sticks against the whirling blade and flinging the stovelengths to one side the red irritable motor kept up a red irritable tiptiptiptiptiptip the whine of the saw rose till it simulated the shriek of a firealarm whistle at night but always at the end it gave a lively metallic clang and in the stillness she heard the flump of the cut stick falling on the pile  she threw a motor robe over her ran out bjornstam welcomed her well well well heres old miles fresh as ever well say thats all right he aint even begun to be cheeky yet next summer hes going to take you out on his horsetrading trip clear into idaho  yes and i may go  hows tricks crazy about the town yet  no but i probably shall be some day  dont let em get you kick em in the face  he shouted at her while he worked the pile of stovewood grew astonishingly the pale bark of the poplar sticks was mottled with lichens of sagegreen and dusty gray the newly sawed ends were freshcolored with the agreeable roughness of a woolen muffler to the sterile winter air the wood gave a scent of march sap  kennicott telephoned that he was going into the country bjornstam had not finished his work at noon and she invited him to have dinner with bea in the kitchen she wished that she were independent enough to dine with these her guests she considered their friendliness she sneered at social distinctions she raged at her own taboosand she continued to regard them as retainers and herself as a lady she sat in the diningroom and listened through the door to bjornstams booming and beas giggles she was the more absurd to herself in that after the rite of dining alone she could go out to the kitchen lean against the sink and talk to them  they were attracted to each other a swedish othello and desdemona more useful and amiable than their prototypes bjornstam told his scapes selling horses in a montana miningcamp breaking a logjam being impertinent to a twofisted millionaire lumberman bea gurgled oh my and kept his coffee cup filled  he took a long time to finish the wood he had frequently to go into the kitchen to get warm carol heard him confiding to bea youre a darn nice swede girl i guess if i had a woman like you i wouldnt be such a sorehead gosh your kitchen is clean makes an old bach feel sloppy say thats nice hair you got huh me fresh saaaay girl if i ever do get fresh youll know it why i could pick you up with one finger and hold you in the air long enough to read robert j ingersoll clean through ingersoll oh hes a religious writer sure youd like him fine  when he drove off he waved to bea and carol lonely at the window above was envious of their pastoral  and ibut i will go on   chapter xvii  i  they were driving down the lake to the cottages that moonlit january night twenty of them in the bobsled they sang toy land and seeing nelly home they leaped from the low back of the sled to race over the slippery snow ruts and when they were tired they climbed on the runners for a lift the moontipped flakes kicked up by the horses settled over the revelers and dripped down their necks but they laughed yelped beat their leather mittens against their chests the harness rattled the sleighbells were frantic jack elders setter sprang beside the horses barking  for a time carol raced with them the cold air gave fictive power she felt that she could run on all night leap twenty feet at a stride but the excess of energy tired her and she was glad to snuggle under the comforters which covered the hay in the sledbox  in the midst of the babel she found enchanted quietude  along the road the shadows from oakbranches were inked on the snow like bars of music then the sled came out on the surface of lake minniemashie across the thick ice was a veritable road a shortcut for farmers on the glaring expanse of the lakelevels of hard crust flashes of green ice blown clear chains of drifts ribbed like the seabeachthe moonlight was overwhelming it stormed on the snow it turned the woods ashore into crystals of fire the night was tropical and voluptuous in that drugged magic there was no difference between heavy heat and insinuating cold  carol was dreamstrayed the turbulent voices even guy pollock being connotative beside her were nothing she repeated       deep on the conventroof the snows      are sparkling to the moon  the words and the light blurred into one vast indefinite happiness and she believed that some great thing was coming to her she withdrew from the clamor into a worship of incomprehensible gods the night expanded she was conscious of the universe and all mysteries stooped down to her  she was jarred out of her ecstasy as the bobsled bumped up the steep road to the bluff where stood the cottages  they dismounted at jack elders shack the interior walls of unpainted boards which had been grateful in august were forbidding in the chill in fur coats and mufflers tied over caps they were a strange company bears and walruses talking jack elder lighted the shavings waiting in the belly of a castiron stove which was like an enlarged beanpot they piled their wraps high on a rocker and cheered the rocker as it solemnly tipped over backward  mrs elder and mrs sam clark made coffee in an enormous blackened tin pot vida sherwin and mrs mcganum unpacked doughnuts and gingerbread mrs dave dyer warmed up hot dogsfrankfurters in rolls dr terry gould after announcing ladies and gents prepare to be shocked shock line forms on the right produced a bottle of bourbon whisky  the others danced muttering ouch as their frosted feet struck the pine planks carol had lost her dream harry haydock lifted her by the waist and swung her she laughed the gravity of the people who stood apart and talked made her the more impatient for frolic  kennicott sam clark jackson elder young dr mcganum and james madison howland teetering on their toes near the stove conversed with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist in details the men were unlike yet they said the same things in the same hearty monotonous voices you had to look at them to see which was speaking  well we made pretty good time coming up from oneany one  yump we hit it up after we struck the good going on the lake  seems kind of slow though after driving an auto  yump it does at that say howd you make out with that sphinx tire you got  seems to hold out fine still i dont knows i like it any better than the roadeater cord  yump nothing better than a roadeater especially the cord the cords lots better than the fabric  yump you said somethingroadeaters a good tire  say howd you come out with pete garsheim on his payments  hes paying up pretty good thats a nice piece of land hes got  yump thats a dandy farm  yump petes got a good place there  they glided from these serious topics into the jocose insults which are the wit of main street sam clark was particularly apt at them whats this wildeyed sale of summer caps you think youre trying to pull off he clamored at harry haydock did you steal em or are you just overcharging us as usual    oh say speaking about caps di ever tell you the good one ive got on will the doc thinks hes a pretty good driver fact he thinks hes almost got human intelligence but one time he had his machine out in the rain and the poor fish he hadnt put on chains and thinks i  carol had heard the story rather often she fled back to the dancers and at dave dyers masterstroke of dropping an icicle down mrs mcganums back she applauded hysterically  they sat on the floor devouring the food the men giggled amiably as they passed the whisky bottle and laughed theres a real sport when juanita haydock took a sip carol tried to follow she believed that she desired to be drunk and riotous but the whisky choked her and as she saw kennicott frown she handed the bottle on repentantly somewhat too late she remembered that she had given up domesticity and repentance  lets play charades said raymie wutherspoon  oh yes do let us said ella stowbody  thats the caper sanctioned harry haydock  they interpreted the word making as may and king the crown was a red flannel mitten cocked on sam clarks broad pink bald head they forgot they were respectable they madebelieve carol was stimulated to cry  lets form a dramatic club and give a play shall we its been so much fun tonight  they looked affable  sure observed sam clark loyally  oh do let us i think it would be lovely to present romeo and juliet yearned ella stowbody  be a whale of a lot of fun dr terry gould granted  but if we did carol cautioned it would be awfully silly to have amateur theatricals we ought to paint our own scenery and everything and really do something fine thered be a lot of hard work would youwould we all be punctual at rehearsals do you suppose  you bet sure thats the idea fellow ought to be prompt at rehearsals they all agreed  then lets meet next week and form the gopher prairie dramatic association carol sang  she drove home loving these friends who raced through moonlit snow had bohemian parties and were about to create beauty in the theater everything was solved she would be an authentic part of the town yet escape the coma of the village virus    she would be free of kennicott again without hurting him without his knowing  she had triumphed  the moon was small and high now and unheeding   ii   though they had all been certain that they longed for the privilege of attending committee meetings and rehearsals the dramatic association as definitely formed consisted only of kennicott carol guy pollock vida sherwin ella stowbody the harry haydocks the dave dyers raymie wutherspoon dr terry gould and four new candidates flirtatious rita simons dr and mrs harvey dillon and myrtle cass an uncomely but intense girl of nineteen of these fifteen only seven came to the first meeting the rest telephoned their unparalleled regrets and engagements and illnesses and announced that they would be present at all other meetings through eternity  carol was made president and director  she had added the dillons despite kennicotts apprehension the dentist and his wife had not been taken up by the westlakes but had remained as definitely outside really smart society as willis woodford who was teller bookkeeper and janitor in stowbodys bank carol had noted mrs dillon dragging past the house during a bridge of the jolly seventeen looking in with pathetic lips at the splendor of the accepted she impulsively invited the dillons to the dramatic association meeting and when kennicott was brusque to them she was unusually cordial and felt virtuous  that selfapproval balanced her disappointment at the smallness of the meeting and her embarrassment during raymie wutherspoons repetitions of the stage needs uplifting and i believe that there are great lessons in some plays  ella stowbody who was a professional having studied elocution in milwaukee disapproved of carols enthusiasm for recent plays miss stowbody expressed the fundamental principle of the american drama the only way to be artistic is to present shakespeare as no one listened to her she sat back and looked like lady macbeth   iii   the little theaters which were to give piquancy to american drama three or four years later were only in embryo but of this fast coming revolt carol had premonitions she knew from some lost magazine article that in dublin were innovators called the irish players she knew confusedly that a man named gordon craig had painted sceneryor had he written plays she felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering a history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt with senators and their pompous puerilities she had a sensation of familiarity a dream of sitting in a brussels cafe and going afterward to a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall  the advertisement in the minneapolis paper leaped from the page to her eyes       the cosmos school of music oratory and      dramatic art announces a program of four      oneact plays by schnitzler shaw yeats      and lord dunsany  she had to be there she begged kennicott to run down to the cities with her  well i dont know be fun to take in a show but why the deuce do you want to see those darn foreign plays given by a lot of amateurs why dont you wait for a regular play later on theres going to be some corkers coming lottie of twogun rancho and cops and crooksreal broadway stuff with the new york casts whats this junk you want to see hm how he lied to her husband that doesnt listen so bad sounds racy and uh well i could go to the motor show i suppose id like to see this new hup roadster well  she never knew which attraction made him decide  she had four days of delightful worryover the hole in her one good silk petticoat the loss of a string of beads from her chiffon and brown velvet frock the catsup stain on her best georgette crepe blouse she wailed i havent a single solitary thing thats fit to be seen in and enjoyed herself very much indeed  kennicott went about casually letting people know that he was going to run down to the cities and see some shows  as the train plodded through the gray prairie on a windless day with the smoke from the engine clinging to the fields in giant cottonrolls in a low and writhing wall which shut off the snowy fields she did not look out of the window she closed her eyes and hummed and did not know that she was humming  she was the young poet attacking fame and paris  in the minneapolis station the crowd of lumberjacks farmers and swedish families with innumerous children and grandparents and paper parcels their foggy crowding and their clamor confused her she felt rustic in this once familiar city after a year and a half of gopher prairie she was certain that kennicott was taking the wrong trolleycar by dusk the liquor warehouses hebraic clothingshops and lodginghouses on lower hennepin avenue were smoky hideous illtempered she was battered by the noise and shuttling of the rushhour traffic when a clerk in an overcoat too closely fitted at the waist stared at her she moved nearer to kennicotts arm the clerk was flippant and urban he was a superior person used to this tumult was he laughing at her  for a moment she wanted the secure quiet of gopher prairie  in the hotellobby she was selfconscious she was not used to hotels she remembered with jealousy how often juanita haydock talked of the famous hotels in chicago she could not face the traveling salesmen baronial in large leather chairs she wanted people to believe that her husband and she were accustomed to luxury and chill elegance she was faintly angry at him for the vulgar way in which after signing the register dr w p kennicott  wife he bellowed at the clerk got a nice room with bath for us old man she gazed about haughtily but as she discovered that no one was interested in her she felt foolish and ashamed of her irritation  she asserted this silly lobby is too florid and simultaneously she admired it the onyx columns with gilt capitals the crownembroidered velvet curtains at the restaurant door the silkroped alcove where pretty girls perpetually waited for mysterious men the twopound boxes of candy and the variety of magazines at the newsstand the hidden orchestra was lively she saw a man who looked like a european diplomat in a loose topcoat and a homburg hat a woman with a broadtail coat a heavy lace veil pearl earrings and a close black hat entered the restaurant heavens thats the first really smart woman ive seen in a year carol exulted she felt metropolitan  but as she followed kennicott to the elevator the coatcheck girl a confident young woman with cheeks powdered like lime and a blouse low and thin and furiously crimson inspected her and under that supercilious glance carol was shy again she unconsciously waited for the bellboy to precede her into the elevator when he snorted go ahead she was mortified he thought she was a hayseed she worried  the moment she was in their room with the bellboy safely out of the way she looked critically at kennicott for the first time in months she really saw him  his clothes were too heavy and provincial his decent gray suit made by nat hicks of gopher prairie might have been of sheet iron it had no distinction of cut no easy grace like the diplomats burberry his black shoes were blunt and not well polished his scarf was a stupid brown he needed a shave  but she forgot her doubt as she realized the ingenuities of the room she ran about turning on the taps of the bathtub which gushed instead of dribbling like the taps at home snatching the new washrag out of its envelope of oiled paper trying the roseshaded light between the twin beds pulling out the drawers of the kidneyshaped walnut desk to examine the engraved stationery planning to write on it to every one she knew admiring the claretcolored velvet armchair and the blue rug testing the icewater tap and squealing happily when the water really did come out cold she flung her arms about kennicott kissed him  like it old lady  its adorable its so amusing i love you for bringing me you really are a dear  he looked blankly indulgent and yawned and condescended thats a pretty slick arrangement on the radiator so you can adjust it at any temperature you want must take a big furnace to run this place gosh i hope bea remembers to turn off the drafts tonight  under the glass cover of the dressingtable was a menu with the most enchanting dishes breast of guinea hen de vitresse pommes de terre a la russe meringue chantilly gateaux bruxelles  oh letsim going to have a hot bath and put on my new hat with the wool flowers and lets go down and eat for hours and well have a cocktail she chanted  while kennicott labored over ordering it was annoying to see him permit the waiter to be impertinent but as the cocktail elevated her to a bridge among colored stars as the oysters came innot canned oysters in the gopher prairie fashion but on the halfshellshe cried if you only knew how wonderful it is not to have had to plan this dinner and order it at the butchers and fuss and think about it and then watch bea cook it i feel so free and to have new kinds of food and different patterns of dishes and linen and not worry about whether the pudding is being spoiled oh this is a great moment for me   iv   they had all the experiences of provincials in a metropolis after breakfast carol bustled to a hairdressers bought gloves and a blouse and importantly met kennicott in front of an opticians in accordance with plans laid down revised and verified they admired the diamonds and furs and frosty silverware and mahogany chairs and polished morocco sewingboxes in shopwindows and were abashed by the throngs in the departmentstores and were bullied by a clerk into buying too many shirts for kennicott and gaped at the clever novelty perfumesjust in from new york carol got three books on the theater and spent an exultant hour in warning herself that she could not afford this rajahsilk frock in thinking how envious it would make juanita haydock in closing her eyes and buying it kennicott went from shop to shop earnestly hunting down a feltcovered device to keep the windshield of his car clear of rain  they dined extravagantly at their hotel at night and next morning sneaked round the corner to economize at a childs restaurant they were tired by three in the afternoon and dozed at the motionpictures and said they wished they were back in gopher prairieand by eleven in the evening they were again so lively that they went to a chinese restaurant that was frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on paydays they sat at a teak and marble table eating eggs fooyung and listened to a brassy automatic piano and were altogether cosmopolitan  on the street they met people from homethe mcganums they laughed shook hands repeatedly and exclaimed well this is quite a coincidence they asked when the mcganums had come down and begged for news of the town they had left two days before whatever the mcganums were at home here they stood out as so superior to all the undistinguishable strangers absurdly hurrying past that the kennicotts held them as long as they could the mcganums said goodby as though they were going to tibet instead of to the station to catch no 7 north  they explored minneapolis kennicott was conversational and technical regarding gluten and cocklecylinders and no i hard when they were shown through the gray stone hulks and new cement elevators of the largest flourmills in the world they looked across loring park and the parade to the towers of st marks and the procathedral and the red roofs of houses climbing kenwood hill they drove about the chain of gardencircled lakes and viewed the houses of the millers and lumbermen and real estate peersthe potentates of the expanding city they surveyed the small eccentric bungalows with pergolas the houses of pebbledash and tapestry brick with sleepingporches above sunparlors and one vast incredible chateau fronting the lake of the isles they tramped through a shiningnew section of apartmenthouses not the tall bleak apartments of eastern cities but low structures of cheerful yellow brick in which each flat had its glassenclosed porch with swinging couch and scarlet cushions and russian brass bowls between a waste of tracks and a raw gouged hill they found poverty in staggering shanties  they saw miles of the city which they had never known in their days of absorption in college they were distinguished explorers and they remarked in great mutual esteem i bet harry haydocks never seen the city like this why hed never have sense enough to study the machinery in the mills or go through all these outlying districts wonder folks in gopher prairie wouldnt use their legs and explore the way we do  they had two meals with carols sister and were bored and felt that intimacy which beatifies married people when they suddenly admit that they equally dislike a relative of either of them  so it was with affection but also with weariness that they approached the evening on which carol was to see the plays at the dramatic school kennicott suggested not going so darn tired from all this walking dont know but what we better turn in early and get rested up it was only from duty that carol dragged him and herself out of the warm hotel into a stinking trolley up the brownstone steps of the converted residence which lugubriously housed the dramatic school   v   they were in a long whitewashed hall with a clumsy drawcurtain across the front the folding chairs were filled with people who looked washed and ironed parents of the pupils girl students dutiful teachers  strikes me its going to be punk if the first play isnt good lets beat it said kennicott hopefully  all right she yawned with hazy eyes she tried to read the lists of characters which were hidden among lifeless advertisements of pianos musicdealers restaurants candy  she regarded the schnitzler play with no vast interest the actors moved and spoke stiffly just as its cynicism was beginning to rouse her villagedulled frivolity it was over  dont think a whale of a lot of that how about taking a sneak petitioned kennicott  oh lets try the next one how he lied to her husband  the shaw conceit amused her and perplexed kennicott  strikes me its darn fresh thought it would be racy dont know as i think much of a play where a husband actually claims he wants a fellow to make love to his wife no husband ever did that shall we shake a leg  i want to see this yeats thing land of hearts desire i used to love it in college she was awake now and urgent i know you didnt care so much for yeats when i read him aloud to you but you just see if you dont adore him on the stage  most of the cast were as unwieldy as oak chairs marching and the setting was an arty arrangement of batik scarfs and heavy tables but maire bruin was slim as carol and largereyed and her voice was a morning bell in her carol lived and on her lifting voice was transported from this sleepy smalltown husband and all the rows of polite parents to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where in a green dimness beside a window caressed by linden branches she bent over a chronicle of twilight women and the ancient gods  wellgoshnice kid played that girlgoodlooker said kennicott want to stay for the last piece heh  she shivered she did not answer  the curtain was again drawn aside on the stage they saw nothing but long green curtains and a leather chair two young men in brown robes like furniturecovers were gesturing vacuously and droning cryptic sentences full of repetitions  it was carols first hearing of dunsany she sympathized with the restless kennicott as he felt in his pocket for a cigar and unhappily put it back  without understanding when or how without a tangible change in the stilted intoning of the stagepuppets she was conscious of another time and place  stately and aloof among vainglorious tiringmaids a queen in robes that murmured on the marble floor she trod the gallery of a crumbling palace in the courtyard elephants trumpeted and swart men with beards dyed crimson stood with bloodstained hands folded upon their hilts guarding the caravan from el sharnak the camels with tyrian stuffs of topaz and cinnabar beyond the turrets of the outer wall the jungle glared and shrieked and the sun was furious above drenched orchids a youth came striding through the steelbossed doors the swordbitten doors that were higher than ten tall men he was in flexible mail and under the rim of his planished morion were amorous curls his hand was out to her before she touched it she could feel its warmth  gosh all hemlock what the dickens is all this stuff about carrie  she was no syrian queen she was mrs dr kennicott she fell with a jolt into a whitewashed hall and sat looking at two scared girls and a young man in wrinkled tights  kennicott fondly rambled as they left the hall  what the deuce did that last spiel mean couldnt make head or tail of it if thats highbrow drama give me a cowpuncher movie every time thank god thats over and we can get to bed wonder if we wouldnt make time by walking over to nicollet to take a car one thing i will say for that dump they had it warm enough must have a big hotair furnace i guess wonder how much coal it takes to run em through the winter  in the car he affectionately patted her knee and he was for a second the striding youth in armor then he was doc kennicott of gopher prairie and she was recaptured by main street never not all her life would she behold jungles and the tombs of kings there were strange things in the world they really existed but she would never see them  she would recreate them in plays  she would make the dramatic association understand her aspiration they would surely they would  she looked doubtfully at the impenetrable reality of yawning trolley conductor and sleepy passengers and placards advertising soap and underwear    chapter xviii  i  she hurried to the first meeting of the playreading committee her jungle romance had faded but she retained a religious fervor a surge of halfformed thought about the creation of beauty by suggestion  a dunsany play would be too difficult for the gopher prairie association she would let them compromise on shawon androcles and the lion which had just been published  the committee was composed of carol vida sherwin guy pollock raymie wutherspoon and juanita haydock they were exalted by the picture of themselves as being simultaneously businesslike and artistic they were entertained by vida in the parlor of mrs elisha gurreys boardinghouse with its steel engraving of grant at appomattox its basket of stereoscopic views and its mysterious stains on the gritty carpet  vida was an advocate of culturebuying and efficiencysystems she hinted that they ought to have as at the committeemeetings of the thanatopsis a regular order of business and the reading of the minutes but as there were no minutes to read and as no one knew exactly what was the regular order of the business of being literary they had to give up efficiency  carol as chairman said politely have you any ideas about what play wed better give first she waited for them to look abashed and vacant so that she might suggest androcles  guy pollock answered with disconcerting readiness ill tell you since were going to try to do something artistic and not simply fool around i believe we ought to give something classic how about the school for scandal  whydont you think that has been done a good deal  yes perhaps it has  carol was ready to say how about bernard shaw when he treacherously went on how would it be then to give a greek dramasay oedipus tyrannus  why i dont believe  vida sherwin intruded im sure that would be too hard for us now ive brought something that i think would be awfully jolly  she held out and carol incredulously took a thin gray pamphlet entitled mcginertys motherinlaw it was the sort of farce which is advertised in school entertainment catalogues as   riproaring knockout 5 m 3 f time 2 hrs interior set popular with churches and all highclass occasions   carol glanced from the scabrous object to vida and realized that she was not joking  but this isthis iswhy its just awhy vida i thought you appreciatedwellappreciated art  vida snorted oh art oh yes i do like art its very nice but after all what does it matter what kind of play we give as long as we get the association started the thing that matters is something that none of you have spoken of that is what are we going to do with the money if we make any i think it would be awfully nice if we presented the high school with a full set of stoddards travellectures  carol moaned oh but vida dear do forgive me but this farcenow what id like us to give is something distinguished say shaws androcles have any of you read it  yes good play said guy pollock  then raymie wutherspoon astoundingly spoke up  so have i i read through all the plays in the public library sos to be ready for this meeting andbut i dont believe you grasp the irreligious ideas in this androcles mrs kennicott i guess the feminine mind is too innocent to understand all these immoral writers im sure i dont want to criticize bernard shaw i understand he is very popular with the highbrows in minneapolis but just the sameas far as i can make out hes downright improper the things he sayswell it would be a very risky thing for our young folks to see it seems to me that a play that doesnt leave a nice taste in the mouth and that hasnt any message is nothing butnothing butwell whatever it may be it isnt art sonow ive found a play that is clean and theres some awfully funny scenes in it too i laughed out loud reading it its called his mothers heart and its about a young man in college who gets in with a lot of freethinkers and boozers and everything but in the end his mothers influence  juanita haydock broke in with a derisive oh rats raymie can the mothers influence i say lets give something with some class to it i bet we could get the rights to the girl from kankakee and thats a real show it ran for eleven months in new york  that would be lots of fun if it wouldnt cost too much reflected vida  carols was the only vote cast against the girl from kankakee   ii   she disliked the girl from kankakee even more than she had expected it narrated the success of a farmlassie in clearing her brother of a charge of forgery she became secretary to a new york millionaire and social counselor to his wife and after a wellconceived speech on the discomfort of having money she married his son  there was also a humorous officeboy  carol discerned that both juanita haydock and ella stowbody wanted the lead she let juanita have it juanita kissed her and in the exuberant manner of a new star presented to the executive committee her theory what we want in a play is humor and pep theres where american playwrights put it all over these darn old european glooms  as selected by carol and confirmed by the committee the persons of the play were       john grimm a millionaire          guy pollock      his wife                      miss vida sherwin      his son                       dr harvey dillon      his business rival              raymond t  wutherspoon      friend of mrs grimm             miss ella stowbody      the girl from kankakee            mrs harold c  haydock      her brother                    dr terence gould      her mother                     mrs david dyer      stenographer                   miss rita simons      officeboy                     miss myrtle cass      maid in the grimms home           mrs w  p  kennicott      direction of mrs kennicott  among the minor lamentations was maud dyers well of course i suppose i look old enough to be juanitas mother even if juanita is eight months older than i am but i dont know as i care to have everybody noticing it and  carol pleaded oh my dear you two look exactly the same age i chose you because you have such a darling complexion and you know with powder and a white wig anybody looks twice her age and i want the mother to be sweet no matter who else is  ella stowbody the professional perceiving that it was because of a conspiracy of jealousy that she had been given a small part alternated between lofty amusement and christian patience  carol hinted that the play would be improved by cutting but as every actor except vida and guy and herself wailed at the loss of a single line she was defeated she told herself that after all a great deal could be done with direction and settings  sam clark had boastfully written about the dramatic association to his schoolmate percy bresnahan president of the velvet motor company of boston bresnahan sent a check for a hundred dollars sam added twentyfive and brought the fund to carol fondly crying there thatll give you a start for putting the thing across swell  she rented the second floor of the city hall for two months all through the spring the association thrilled to its own talent in that dismal room they cleared out the bunting ballotboxes handbills legless chairs they attacked the stage it was a simpleminded stage it was raised above the floor and it did have a movable curtain painted with the advertisement of a druggist dead these ten years but otherwise it might not have been recognized as a stage there were two dressingrooms one for men one for women on either side the dressingroom doors were also the stageentrances opening from the house and many a citizen of gopher prairie had for his first glimpse of romance the bare shoulders of the leading woman  there were three sets of scenery a woodland a poor interior and a rich interior the last also useful for railway stations offices and as a background for the swedish quartette from chicago there were three gradations of lighting full on half on and entirely off  this was the only theater in gopher prairie it was known as the opra house once strolling companies had used it for performances of the two orphans and nellie the beautiful cloak model and othello with specialties between acts but now the motionpictures had ousted the gipsy drama  carol intended to be furiously modern in constructing the officeset the drawingroom for mr grimm and the humble home near kankakee it was the first time that any one in gopher prairie had been so revolutionary as to use enclosed scenes with continuous sidewalls the rooms in the opra house sets had separate wingpieces for sides which simplified dramaturgy as the villain could always get out of the heros way by walking out through the wall  the inhabitants of the humble home were supposed to be amiable and intelligent carol planned for them a simple set with warm color she could see the beginning of the play all dark save the high settles and the solid wooden table between them which were to be illuminated by a ray from offstage the high light was a polished copper pot filled with primroses less clearly she sketched the grimm drawingroom as a series of cool high white arches  as to how she was to produce these effects she had no notion  she discovered that despite the enthusiastic young writers the drama was not half so native and close to the soil as motor cars and telephones she discovered that simple arts require sophisticated training she discovered that to produce one perfect stagepicture would be as difficult as to turn all of gopher prairie into a georgian garden  she read all she could find regarding staging she bought paint and light wood she borrowed furniture and drapes unscrupulously she made kennicott turn carpenter she collided with the problem of lighting against the protest of kennicott and vida she mortgaged the association by sending to minneapolis for a baby spotlight a strip light a dimming device and blue and amber bulbs and with the gloating rapture of a born painter first turned loose among colors she spent absorbed evenings in grouping dimmingpainting with lights  only kennicott guy and vida helped her they speculated as to how flats could be lashed together to form a wall they hung crocusyellow curtains at the windows they blacked the sheetiron stove they put on aprons and swept the rest of the association dropped into the theater every evening and were literary and superior they had borrowed carols manuals of playproduction and had become extremely stagey in vocabulary  juanita haydock rita simons and raymie wutherspoon sat on a sawhorse watching carol try to get the right position for a picture on the wall in the first scene  i dont want to hand myself anything but i believe ill give a swell performance in this first act confided juanita i wish carol wasnt so bossy though she doesnt understand clothes i want to wear oh a dandy dress i haveall scarletand i said to her when i enter wouldnt it knock their eyes out if i just stood there at the door in this straight scarlet thing but she wouldnt let me  young rita agreed shes so much taken up with her old details and carpentering and everything that she cant see the picture as a whole now i thought it would be lovely if we had an officescene like the one in little but oh my because i saw that in duluth but she simply wouldnt listen at all  juanita sighed i wanted to give one speech like ethel barrymore would if she was in a play like this harry and i heard her one time in minneapoliswe had dandy seats in the orchestrai just know i could imitate her carol didnt pay any attention to my suggestion i dont want to criticize but i guess ethel knows more about acting than carol does  say do you think carol has the right dope about using a strip light behind the fireplace in the second act i told her i thought we ought to use a bunch offered raymie and i suggested it would be lovely if we used a cyclorama outside the window in the first act and what do you think she said yes and it would be lovely to have eleanora duse play the lead she said and aside from the fact that its evening in the first act youre a great technician she said i must say i think she was pretty sarcastic ive been reading up and i know i could build a cyclorama if she didnt want to run everything  yes and another thing i think the entrance in the first act ought to be l u e not l 3 e from juanita  and why does she just use plain white tormenters  whats a tormenter blurted rita simons  the savants stared at her ignorance   iii   carol did not resent their criticisms she didnt very much resent their sudden knowledge so long as they let her make pictures it was at rehearsals that the quarrrels broke no one understood that rehearsals were as real engagements as bridgegames or sociables at the episcopal church they gaily came in half an hour late or they vociferously came in ten minutes early and they were so hurt that they whispered about resigning when carol protested they telephoned i dont think id better come out afraid the dampness might start my toothache or guess cant make it tonight dave wants me to sit in on a poker game  when after a month of labor as many as nineelevenths of the cast were often present at a rehearsal when most of them had learned their parts and some of them spoke like human beings carol had a new shock in the realization that guy pollock and herself were very bad actors and that raymie wutherspoon was a surprisingly good one for all her visions she could not control her voice and she was bored by the fiftieth repetition of her few lines as maid guy pulled his soft mustache looked selfconscious and turned mr grimm into a limp dummy but raymie as the villain had no repressions the tilt of his head was full of character his drawl was admirably vicious  there was an evening when carol hoped she was going to make a play a rehearsal during which guy stopped looking abashed  from that evening the play declined  they were weary we know our parts well enough now whats the use of getting sick of them they complained they began to skylark to play with the sacred lights to giggle when carol was trying to make the sentimental myrtle cass into a humorous officeboy to act everything but the girl from kankakee after loafing through his proper part dr terry gould had great applause for his burlesque of hamlet even raymie lost his simple faith and tried to show that he could do a vaudeville shuffle  carol turned on the company see here i want this nonsense to stop weve simply got to get down to work  juanita haydock led the mutiny look here carol dont be so bossy after all were doing this play principally for the fun of it and if we have fun out of a lot of monkeyshines why then  yees feebly  you said one time that folks in g p didnt get enough fun out of life and now we are having a circus you want us to stop  carol answered slowly i wonder if i can explain what i mean its the difference between looking at the comic page and looking at manet i want fun out of this of course onlyi dont think it would be less fun but more to produce as perfect a play as we can she was curiously exalted her voice was strained she stared not at the company but at the grotesques scrawled on the backs of wingpieces by forgotten stagehands i wonder if you can understand the fun of making a beautiful thing the pride and satisfaction of it and the holiness  the company glanced doubtfully at one another in gopher prairie it is not good form to be holy except at a church between tenthirty and twelve on sunday  but if we want to do it weve got to work we must have selfdiscipline  they were at once amused and embarrassed they did not want to affront this mad woman they backed off and tried to rehearse carol did not hear juanita in front protesting to maud dyer if she calls it fun and holiness to sweat over her darned old playwell i dont   iv   carol attended the only professional play which came to gopher prairie that spring it was a tent show presenting snappy new dramas under canvas the hardworking actors doubled in brass and took tickets and between acts sang about the moon in june and sold dr wintergreens surefire tonic for ills of the heart lungs kidneys and bowels they presented sunbonnet nell a dramatic comedy of the ozarks with j witherbee boothby wringing the soul by his resonant yuh aint done right by mah little gal mr city man but yer agoin to find that back in theseyere hills theres honest folks and good shots  the audience on planks beneath the patched tent admired mr boothbys beard and long rifle stamped their feet in the dust at the spectacle of his heroism shouted when the comedian aped the city ladys use of a lorgnon by looking through a doughnut stuck on a fork wept visibly over mr boothbys little gal nell who was also mr boothbys legal wife pearl and when the curtain went down listened respectfully to mr boothbys lecture on dr wintergreens tonic as a cure for tapeworms which he illustrated by horrible pallid objects curled in bottles of yellowing alcohol  carol shook her head juanita is right im a fool holiness of the drama bernard shaw the only trouble with the girl from kankakee is that its too subtle for gopher prairie  she sought faith in spacious banal phrases taken from books the instinctive nobility of simple souls need only the opportunity to appreciate fine things and sturdy exponents of democracy but these optimisms did not sound so loud as the laughter of the audience at the funnymans line yes by heckelum im a smart fella she wanted to give up the play the dramatic association the town as she came out of the tent and walked with kennicott down the dusty spring street she peered at this straggling wooden village and felt that she could not possibly stay here through all of tomorrow  it was miles bjornstam who gave her strengthhe and the fact that every seat for the girl from kankakee had been sold  bjornstam was keeping company with bea every night he was sitting on the back steps once when carol appeared he grumbled hope youre going to give this burg one good show if you dont reckon nobody ever will   v   it was the great night it was the night of the play the two dressingrooms were swirling with actors panting twitchy pale del snafflin the barber who was as much a professional as ella having once gone on in a mob scene at a stockcompany performance in minneapolis was making them up and showing his scorn for amateurs with stand still for the love o mike how do you expect me to get your eyelids dark if you keep awigglin the actors were beseeching hey del put some red in my nostrilsyou put some in ritasgee you didnt hardly do anything to my face  they were enormously theatric they examined dels makeup box they sniffed the scent of greasepaint every minute they ran out to peep through the hole in the curtain they came back to inspect their wigs and costumes they read on the whitewashed walls of the dressingrooms the pencil inscriptions the flora flanders comedy company and this is a bum theater and felt that they were companions of these vanished troupers  carol smart in maids uniform coaxed the temporary stagehands to finish setting the first act wailed at kennicott the electrician now for heavens sake remember the change in cue for the ambers in act two slipped out to ask dave dyer the tickettaker if he could get some more chairs warned the frightened myrtle cass to be sure to upset the wastebasket when john grimm called here you reddy  del snafflins orchestra of piano violin and cornet began to tune up and every one behind the magic line of the proscenic arch was frightened into paralysis carol wavered to the hole in the curtain there were so many people out there staring so hard  in the second row she saw miles bjornstam not with bea but alone he really wanted to see the play it was a good omen who could tell perhaps this evening would convert gopher prairie to conscious beauty  she darted into the womens dressingroom roused maud dyer from her fainting panic pushed her to the wings and ordered the curtain up  it rose doubtfully it staggered and trembled but it did get up without catchingthis time then she realized that kennicott had forgotten to turn off the houselights some one out front was giggling  she galloped round to the left wing herself pulled the switch looked so ferociously at kennicott that he quaked and fled back  mrs dyer was creeping out on the halfdarkened stage the play was begun  and with that instant carol realized that it was a bad play abominably acted  encouraging them with lying smiles she watched her work go to pieces the settings seemed flimsy the lighting commonplace she watched guy pollock stammer and twist his mustache when he should have been a bullying magnate vida sherwin as grimms timid wife chatter at the audience as though they were her class in highschool english juanita in the leading role defy mr grimm as though she were repeating a list of things she had to buy at the grocery this morning ella stowbody remark id like a cup of tea as though she were reciting curfew shall not ring tonight and dr gould making love to rita simons squeak mymyyouareawonerfulgirl  myrtle cass as the officeboy was so much pleased by the applause of her relatives then so much agitated by the remarks of cy bogart in the back row in reference to her wearing trousers that she could hardly be got off the stage only raymie was so unsociable as to devote himself entirely to acting  that she was right in her opinion of the play carol was certain when miles bjornstam went out after the first act and did not come back   vi   between the second and third acts she called the company together and supplicated i want to know something before we have a chance to separate whether were doing well or badly tonight it is a beginning but will we take it as merely a beginning how many of you will pledge yourselves to start in with me right away tomorrow and plan for another play to be given in september  they stared at her they nodded at juanitas protest i think ones enough for a while its going elegant tonight but another playseems to me itll be time enough to talk about that next fall carol i hope you dont mean to hint and suggest were not doing fine tonight im sure the applause shows the audience think its just dandy  then carol knew how completely she had failed  as the audience seeped out she heard b j gougerling the banker say to howland the grocer well i think the folks did splendid just as good as professionals but i dont care much for these plays what i like is a good movie with auto accidents and holdups and some git to it and not all this talkytalk  then carol knew how certain she was to fail again  she wearily did not blame them company nor audience herself she blamed for trying to carve intaglios in good wholesome jackpine  its the worst defeat of all im beaten by main street i must go on but i cant  she was not vastly encouraged by the gopher prairie dauntless     would be impossible to distinguish among the actors when all gave such fine account of themselves in difficult roles of this wellknown new york stage play guy pollock as the old millionaire could not have been bettered for his fine impersonation of the gruff old millionaire mrs harry haydock as the young lady from the west who so easily showed the new york fourflushers where they got off was a vision of loveliness and with fine stage presence miss vida sherwin the ever popular teacher in our high school pleased as mrs grimm dr gould was well suited in the role of young lovergirls you better look out remember the doc is a bachelor the local four hundred also report that he is a great hand at shaking the light fantastic tootsies in the dance as the stenographer rita simons was pretty as a picture and miss ella stowbodys long and intensive study of the drama and kindred arts in eastern schools was seen in the fine finish of her part     to no one is greater credit to be given than to mrs will kennicott on whose capable shoulders fell the burden of directing   so kindly carol mused so well meant so neighborlyand so confoundedly untrue is it really my failure or theirs  she sought to be sensible she elaborately explained to herself that it was hysterical to condemn gopher prairie because it did not foam over the drama its justification was in its service as a markettown for farmers how bravely and generously it did its work forwarding the bread of the world feeding and healing the farmers  then on the corner below her husbands office she heard a farmer holding forth  sure course i was beaten the shipper and the grocers here wouldnt pay us a decent price for our potatoes even though folks in the cities were howling for em so we says well well get a truck and ship em right down to minneapolis but the commission merchants there were in cahoots with the local shipper here they said they wouldnt pay us a cent more than he would not even if they was nearer to the market well we found we could get higher prices in chicago but when we tried to get freight cars to ship there the railroads wouldnt let us have emeven though they had cars standing empty right here in the yards there you got itgood market and these towns keeping us from it gus thats the way these towns work all the time they pay what they want to for our wheat but we pay what they want us to for their clothes stowbody and dawson foreclose every mortgage they can and put in tenant farmers the dauntless lies to us about the nonpartisan league the lawyers sting us the machinerydealers hate to carry us over bad years and then their daughters put on swell dresses and look at us as if we were a bunch of hoboes man id like to burn this town  kennicott observed theres that old crank wes brannigan shooting off his mouth again gosh but he loves to hear himself talk they ought to run that fellow out of town   vii   she felt old and detached through highschool commencement week which is the fete of youth in gopher prairie through baccalaureate sermon senior parade junior entertainment commencement address by an iowa clergyman who asserted that he believed in the virtue of virtuousness and the procession of decoration day when the few civil war veterans followed champ perry in his rusty foragecap along the springpowdered road to the cemetery she met guy she found that she had nothing to say to him her head ached in an aimless way when kennicott rejoiced well have a great time this summer move down to the lake early and wear old clothes and act natural she smiled but her smile creaked  in the prairie heat she trudged along unchanging ways talked about nothing to tepid people and reflected that she might never escape from them  she was startled to find that she was using the word escape  then for three years which passed like one curt paragraph she ceased to find anything interesting save the bjornstams and her baby    chapter xix  i  in three years of exile from herself carol had certain experiences chronicled as important by the dauntless or discussed by the jolly seventeen but the event unchronicled undiscussed and supremely controlling was her slow admission of longing to find her own people   ii   bea and miles bjornstam were married in june a month after the girl from kankakee miles had turned respectable he had renounced his criticisms of state and society he had given up roving as horsetrader and wearing red mackinaws in lumbercamps he had gone to work as engineer in jackson elders planingmill he was to be seen upon the streets endeavoring to be neighborly with suspicious men whom he had taunted for years  carol was the patroness and manager of the wedding juanita haydock mocked youre a chump to let a good hired girl like bea go besides how do you know its a good thing her marrying a sassy bum like this awful red swede person get wise chase the man off with a mop and hold onto your svenska while the holdings good huh me go to their scandahoofian wedding not a chance  the other matrons echoed juanita carol was dismayed by the casualness of their cruelty but she persisted miles had exclaimed to her jack elder says maybe hell come to the wedding gee it would be nice to have bea meet the boss as a reglar married lady some day ill be so well off that bea can play with mrs elderand you watch us  there was an uneasy knot of only nine guests at the service in the unpainted lutheran churchcarol kennicott guy pollock and the champ perrys all brought by carol beas frightened rustic parents her cousin tina and pete miless expartner in horsetrading a surly hairy man who had bought a black suit and come twelve hundred miles from spokane for the event  miles continuously glanced back at the church door jackson elder did not appear the door did not once open after the awkward entrance of the first guests miless hand closed on beas arm  he had with carols help made his shanty over into a cottage with white curtains and a canary and a chintz chair  carol coaxed the powerful matrons to call on bea they half scoffed half promised to go  beas successor was the oldish broad silent oscarina who was suspicious of her frivolous mistress for a month so that juanita haydock was able to crow there smarty i told you youd run into the domestic problem but oscarina adopted carol as a daughter and with her as faithful to the kitchen as bea had been there was nothing changed in carols life   iii   she was unexpectedly appointed to the town libraryboard by ole jenson the new mayor the other members were dr westlake lyman cass julius flickerbaugh the attorney guy pollock and martin mahoney former liverystable keeper and now owner of a garage she was delighted she went to the first meeting rather condescendingly regarding herself as the only one besides guy who knew anything about books or library methods she was planning to revolutionize the whole system  her condescension was ruined and her humility wholesomely increased when she found the board in the shabby room on the second floor of the house which had been converted into the library not discussing the weather and longing to play checkers but talking about books she discovered that amiable old dr westlake read everything in verse and light fiction that lyman cass the vealfaced bristlybearded owner of the mill had tramped through gibbon hume grote prescott and the other thick historians that he could repeat pages from themand did when dr westlake whispered to her yes lym is a very wellinformed man but hes modest about it she felt uninformed and immodest and scolded at herself that she had missed the human potentialities in this vast gopher prairie when dr westlake quoted the paradiso don quixote wilhelm meister and the koran she reflected that no one she knew not even her father had read all four  she came diffidently to the second meeting of the board she did not plan to revolutionize anything she hoped that the wise elders might be so tolerant as to listen to her suggestions about changing the shelving of the juveniles  yet after four sessions of the libraryboard she was where she had been before the first session she had found that for all their pride in being reading men westlake and cass and even guy had no conception of making the library familiar to the whole town they used it they passed resolutions about it and they left it as dead as moses only the henty books and the elsie books and the latest optimisms by moral female novelists and virile clergymen were in general demand and the board themselves were interested only in old stilted volumes they had no tenderness for the noisiness of youth discovering great literature  if she was egotistic about her tiny learning they were at least as much so regarding theirs and for all their talk of the need of additional librarytax none of them was willing to risk censure by battling for it though they now had so small a fund that after paying for rent heat light and miss villetss salary they had only a hundred dollars a year for the purchase of books  the incident of the seventeen cents killed her none too enduring interest  she had come to the boardmeeting singing with a plan she had made a list of thirty european novels of the past ten years with twenty important books on psychology education and economics which the library lacked she had made kennicott promise to give fifteen dollars if each of the board would contribute the same they could have the books  lym cass looked alarmed scratched himself and protested i think it would be a bad precedent for the boardmembers to contribute moneyuhnot that i mind but it wouldnt be fairestablish precedent gracious they dont pay us a cent for our services certainly cant expect us to pay for the privilege of serving  only guy looked sympathetic and he stroked the pine table and said nothing  the rest of the meeting they gave to a bellicose investigation of the fact that there was seventeen cents less than there should be in the fund miss villets was summoned she spent half an hour in explosively defending herself the seventeen cents were gnawed over penny by penny and carol glancing at the carefully inscribed list which had been so lovely and exciting an hour before was silent and sorry for miss villets and sorrier for herself  she was reasonably regular in attendance till her two years were up and vida sherwin was appointed to the board in her place but she did not try to be revolutionary in the plodding course of her life there was nothing changed and nothing new   iv   kennicott made an excellent landdeal but as he told her none of the details she was not greatly exalted or agitated what did agitate her was his announcement half whispered and half blurted half tender and half coldly medical that they ought to have a baby now they could afford it they had so long agreed that perhaps it would be just as well not to have any children for a while yet that childlessness had come to be natural now she feared and longed and did not know she hesitatingly assented and wished that she had not assented  as there appeared no change in their drowsy relations she forgot all about it and life was planless   v   idling on the porch of their summer cottage at the lake on afternoons when kennicott was in town when the water was glazed and the whole air languid she pictured a hundred escapes fifth avenue in a snowstorm with limousines golden shops a cathedral spire a reed hut on fantastic piles above the mud of a jungle river a suite in paris immense high grave rooms with lambrequins and a balcony the enchanted mesa an ancient stone mill in maryland at the turn of the road between rocky brook and abrupt hills an upland moor of sheep and flitting cool sunlight a clanging dock where steel cranes unloaded steamers from buenos ayres and tsingtao a munich concerthall and a famous cellist playingplaying to her  one scene had a persistent witchery  she stood on a terrace overlooking a boulevard by the warm sea she was certain though she had no reason for it that the place was mentone along the drive below her swept barouches with a mechanical tlottlot tlottlot tlottlot and great cars with polished black hoods and engines quiet as the sigh of an old man in them were women erect slender enameled and expressionless as marionettes their small hands upon parasols their unchanging eyes always forward ignoring the men beside them tall men with gray hair and distinguished faces beyond the drive were painted sea and painted sands and blue and yellow pavilions nothing moved except the gliding carriages and the people were small and wooden spots in a picture drenched with gold and hard bright blues there was no sound of sea or winds no softness of whispers nor of falling petals nothing but yellow and cobalt and staring light and the neverchanging tlottlot tlottlot  she startled she whimpered it was the rapid ticking of the clock which had hypnotized her into hearing the steady hoofs no aching color of the sea and pride of supercilious people but the reality of a roundbellied nickel alarmclock on a shelf against a fuzzy unplaned pine wall with a stiff gray washrag hanging above it and a kerosenestove standing below  a thousand dreams governed by the fiction she had read drawn from the pictures she had envied absorbed her drowsy lake afternoons but always in the midst of them kennicott came out from town drew on khaki trousers which were plastered with dry fishscales asked enjoying yourself and did not listen to her answer  and nothing was changed and there was no reason to believe that there ever would be change   vi   trains  at the lake cottage she missed the passing of the trains she realized that in town she had depended upon them for assurance that there remained a world beyond  the railroad was more than a means of transportation to gopher prairie it was a new god a monster of steel limbs oak ribs flesh of gravel and a stupendous hunger for freight a deity created by man that he might keep himself respectful to property as elsewhere he had elevated and served as tribal gods the mines cottonmills motorfactories colleges army  the east remembered generations when there had been no railroad and had no awe of it but here the railroads had been before time was the towns had been staked out on barren prairie as convenient points for future trainhalts and back in 1860 and 1870 there had been much profit much opportunity to found aristocratic families in the possession of advance knowledge as to where the towns would arise  if a town was in disfavor the railroad could ignore it cut it off from commerce slay it to gopher prairie the tracks were eternal verities and boards of railroad directors an omnipotence the smallest boy or the most secluded grandam could tell you whether no 32 had a hotbox last tuesday whether no 7 was going to put on an extra daycoach and the name of the president of the road was familiar to every breakfast table  even in this new era of motors the citizens went down to the station to see the trains go through it was their romance their only mystery besides mass at the catholic church and from the trains came lords of the outer worldtraveling salesmen with piping on their waistcoats and visiting cousins from milwaukee  gopher prairie had once been a divisionpoint the roundhouse and repairshops were gone but two conductors still retained residence and they were persons of distinction men who traveled and talked to strangers who wore uniforms with brass buttons and knew all about these crooked games of conmen they were a special caste neither above nor below the haydocks but apart artists and adventurers  the night telegraphoperator at the railroad station was the most melodramatic figure in town awake at three in the morning alone in a room hectic with clatter of the telegraph key all night he talked to operators twenty fifty a hundred miles away it was always to be expected that he would be held up by robbers he never was but round him was a suggestion of masked faces at the window revolvers cords binding him to a chair his struggle to crawl to the key before he fainted  during blizzards everything about the railroad was melodramatic there were days when the town was completely shut off when they had no mail no express no fresh meat no newspapers at last the rotary snowplow came through bucking the drifts sending up a geyser and the way to the outside was open again the brakemen in mufflers and fur caps running along the tops of icecoated freightcars the engineers scratching frost from the cab windows and looking out inscrutable selfcontained pilots of the prairie seathey were heroism they were to carol the daring of the quest in a world of groceries and sermons  to the small boys the railroad was a familiar playground they climbed the iron ladders on the sides of the boxcars built fires behind piles of old ties waved to favorite brakemen but to carol it was magic  she was motoring with kennicott the car lumping through darkness the lights showing mudpuddles and ragged weeds by the road a train coming a rapid chuckachuck chuckachuck chuckachuck it was hurling pastthe pacific flyer an arrow of golden flame light from the firebox splashed the under side of the trailing smoke instantly the vision was gone carol was back in the long darkness and kennicott was giving his version of that fire and wonder no 19 must be bout ten minutes late  in town she listened from bed to the express whistling in the cut a mile north uuuuuuufaint nervous distrait horn of the free night riders journeying to the tall towns where were laughter and banners and the sound of bellsuuuuu uuuuuthe world going byuuuuuuufainter more wistful gone  down here there were no trains the stillness was very great the prairie encircled the lake lay round her raw dusty thick only the train could cut it some day she would take a train and that would be a great taking   vii   she turned to the chautauqua as she had turned to the dramatic association to the libraryboard  besides the permanent mother chautauqua in new york there are all over these states commercial chautauqua companies which send out to every smallest town troupes of lecturers and entertainers to give a week of culture under canvas living in minneapolis carol had never encountered the ambulant chautauqua and the announcement of its coming to gopher prairie gave her hope that others might be doing the vague things which she had attempted she pictured a condensed university course brought to the people mornings when she came in from the lake with kennicott she saw placards in every shopwindow and strung on a cord across main street a line of pennants alternately worded the boland chautauqua coming and a solid week of inspiration and enjoyment but she was disappointed when she saw the program it did not seem to be a tabloid university it did not seem to be any kind of a university it seemed to be a combination of vaudeville performance y m c a lecture and the graduation exercises of an elocution class  she took her doubt to kennicott he insisted well maybe it wont be so awful darn intellectual the way you and i might like it but its a whole lot better than nothing vida sherwin added they have some splendid speakers if the people dont carry off so much actual information they do get a lot of new ideas and thats what counts  during the chautauqua carol attended three evening meetings two afternoon meetings and one in the morning she was impressed by the audience the sallow women in skirts and blouses eager to be made to think the men in vests and shirtsleeves eager to be allowed to laugh and the wriggling children eager to sneak away she liked the plain benches the portable stage under its red marquee the great tent over all shadowy above strings of incandescent bulbs at night and by day casting an amber radiance on the patient crowd the scent of dust and trampled grass and sunbaked wood gave her an illusion of syrian caravans she forgot the speakers while she listened to noises outside the tent two farmers talking hoarsely a wagon creaking down main street the crow of a rooster she was content but it was the contentment of the lost hunter stopping to rest  for from the chautauqua itself she got nothing but wind and chaff and heavy laughter the laughter of yokels at old jokes a mirthless and primitive sound like the cries of beasts on a farm  these were the several instructors in the condensed universitys sevenday course  nine lecturers four of them exministers and one an excongressman all of them delivering inspirational addresses the only facts or opinions which carol derived from them were lincoln was a celebrated president of the united states but in his youth extremely poor james j hill was the bestknown railroadman of the west and in his youth extremely poor honesty and courtesy in business are preferable to boorishness and exposed trickery but this is not to be taken personally since all persons in gopher prairie are known to be honest and courteous london is a large city a distinguished statesman once taught sunday school  four entertainers who told jewish stories irish stories german stories chinese stories and tennessee mountaineer stories most of which carol had heard  a lady elocutionist who recited kipling and imitated children  a lecturer with motionpictures of an andean exploration excellent pictures and a halting narrative  three brassbands a company of six operasingers a hawaiian sextette and four youths who played saxophones and guitars disguised as washboards the most applauded pieces were those such as the lucia inevitability which the audience had heard most often  the local superintendent who remained through the week while the other enlighteners went to other chautauquas for their daily performances the superintendent was a bookish underfed man who worked hard at rousing artificial enthusiasm at trying to make the audience cheer by dividing them into competitive squads and telling them that they were intelligent and made splendid communal noises he gave most of the morning lectures droning with equal unhappy facility about poetry the holy land and the injustice to employers in any system of profitsharing  the final item was a man who neither lectured inspired nor entertained a plain little man with his hands in his pockets all the other speakers had confessed i cannot keep from telling the citizens of your beautiful city that none of the talent on this circuit have found a more charming spot or more enterprising and hospitable people but the little man suggested that the architecture of gopher prairie was haphazard and that it was sottish to let the lakefront be monopolized by the cinderheaped wall of the railroad embankment afterward the audience grumbled maybe that guys got the right dope but whats the use of looking on the dark side of things all the time new ideas are firstrate but not all this criticism enough trouble in life without looking for it  thus the chautauqua as carol saw it after it the town felt proud and educated   viii   two weeks later the great war smote europe  for a month gopher prairie had the delight of shuddering then as the war settled down to a business of trenchfighting they forgot  when carol talked about the balkans and the possibility of a german revolution kennicott yawned oh yes its a great old scrap but its none of our business folks out here are too busy growing corn to monkey with any fool war that those foreigners want to get themselves into  it was miles bjornstam who said i cant figure it out im opposed to wars but still seems like germany has got to be licked because them junkers stands in the way of progress  she was calling on miles and bea early in autumn they had received her with cries with dusting of chairs and a running to fetch water for coffee miles stood and beamed at her he fell often and joyously into his old irreverence about the lords of gopher prairie but alwayswith a certain difficultyhe added something decorous and appreciative  lots of people have come to see you havent they carol hinted  why beas cousin tina comes in right along and the foreman at the mill andoh we have good times say take a look at that bea wouldnt you think she was a canarybird to listen to her and to see that scandahoofian towhead of hers but say know what she is shes a mother hen way she fusses over meway she makes old miles wear a necktie hate to spoil her by letting her hear it but shes one pretty darn nicenicehell what do we care if none of the dirty snobs come and call weve got each other  carol worried about their struggle but she forgot it in the stress of sickness and fear for that autumn she knew that a baby was coming that at last life promised to be interesting in the peril of the great change    chapter xx  i  the baby was coming each morning she was nauseated chilly bedraggled and certain that she would never again be attractive each twilight she was afraid she did not feel exalted but unkempt and furious the period of daily sickness crawled into an endless time of boredom it became difficult for her to move about and she raged that she who had been slim and lightfooted should have to lean on a stick and be heartily commented upon by street gossips she was encircled by greasy eyes every matron hinted now that youre going to be a mother dearie youll get over all these ideas of yours and settle down she felt that willynilly she was being initiated into the assembly of housekeepers with the baby for hostage she would never escape presently she would be drinking coffee and rocking and talking about diapers  i could stand fighting them im used to that but this being taken in being taken as a matter of course i cant stand itand i must stand it  she alternately detested herself for not appreciating the kindly women and detested them for their advice lugubrious hints as to how much she would suffer in labor details of babyhygiene based on long experience and total misunderstanding superstitious cautions about the things she must eat and read and look at in prenatal care for the babys soul and always a pest of simpering babytalk mrs champ perry bustled in to lend ben hur as a preventive of future infant immorality the widow bogart appeared trailing pinkish exclamations and how is our lovely ittle muzzy today my aint it just like they always say being in a family way does make the girlie so lovely just like a madonna tell me her whisper was tinged with salaciousnessdoes oo feel the dear itsy one stirring the pledge of love i remember with cy of course he was so big  i do not look lovely mrs bogart my complexion is rotten and my hair is coming out and i look like a potatobag and i think my arches are falling and he isnt a pledge of love and im afraid he will look like us and i dont believe in motherdevotion and the whole business is a confounded nuisance of a biological process remarked carol  then the baby was born without unusual difficulty a boy with straight back and strong legs the first day she hated him for the tides of pain and hopeless fear he had caused she resented his raw ugliness after that she loved him with all the devotion and instinct at which she had scoffed she marveled at the perfection of the miniature hands as noisily as did kennicott she was overwhelmed by the trust with which the baby turned to her passion for him grew with each unpoetic irritating thing she had to do for him  he was named hugh for her father  hugh developed into a thin healthy child with a large head and straight delicate hair of a faint brown he was thoughtful and casuala kennicott  for two years nothing else existed she did not as the cynical matrons had prophesied give up worrying about the world and other folks babies soon as she got one of her own to fight for the barbarity of that willingness to sacrifice other children so that one child might have too much was impossible to her but she would sacrifice herself she understood consecrationshe who answered kennicotts hints about having hugh christened i refuse to insult my baby and myself by asking an ignorant young man in a frock coat to sanction him to permit me to have him i refuse to subject him to any devilchasing rites if i didnt give my babymy babyenough sanctification in those nine hours of hell then he cant get any more out of the reverend mr zitterel  well baptists hardly ever christen kids i was kind of thinking more about reverend warren said kennicott  hugh was her reason for living promise of accomplishment in the future shrine of adorationand a diverting toy i thought id be a dilettante mother but im as dismayingly natural as mrs bogart she boasted  for twoyears carol was a part of the town as much one of our young mothers as mrs mcganum her opinionation seemed dead she had no apparent desire for escape her brooding centered on hugh while she wondered at the pearl texture of his ear she exulted i feel like an old woman with a skin like sandpaper beside him and im glad of it he is perfect he shall have everything he shant always stay here in gopher prairie    i wonder which is really the best harvard or yale or oxford   ii   the people who hemmed her in had been brilliantly reinforced by mr and mrs whittier n smailkennicotts uncle whittier and aunt bessie  the true main streetite defines a relative as a person to whose house you go uninvited to stay as long as you like if you hear that lym cass on his journey east has spent all his time visiting in oyster center it does not mean that he prefers that village to the rest of new england but that he has relatives there it does not mean that he has written to the relatives these many years nor that they have ever given signs of a desire to look upon him but you wouldnt expect a man to go and spend good money at a hotel in boston when his own third cousins live right in the same state would you  when the smails sold their creamery in north dakota they visited mr smails sister kennicotts mother at lacquimeurt then plodded on to gopher prairie to stay with their nephew they appeared unannounced before the baby was born took their welcome for granted and immediately began to complain of the fact that their room faced north  uncle whittier and aunt bessie assumed that it was their privilege as relatives to laugh at carol and their duty as christians to let her know how absurd her notions were they objected to the food to oscarinas lack of friendliness to the wind the rain and the immodesty of carols maternity gowns they were strong and enduring for an hour at a time they could go on heaving questions about her fathers income about her theology and about the reason why she had not put on her rubbers when she had gone across the street for fussy discussion they had a rich full genius and their example developed in kennicott a tendency to the same form of affectionate flaying  if carol was so indiscreet as to murmur that she had a small headache instantly the two smails and kennicott were at it every five minutes every time she sat down or rose or spoke to oscarina they twanged is your head better now where does it hurt dont you keep hartshorn in the house didnt you walk too far today have you tried hartshorn dont you keep some in the house so it will be handy does it feel better now how does it feel do your eyes hurt too what time do you usually get to bed as late as that well how does it feel now  in her presence uncle whittier snorted at kennicott carol get these headaches often huh be better for her if she didnt go gadding around to all these bridgewhist parties and took some care of herself once in a while  they kept it up commenting questioning commenting questioning till her determination broke and she bleated for heavens sake dont discuss it my head s all right  she listened to the smails and kennicott trying to determine by dialectics whether the copy of the dauntless which aunt bessie wanted to send to her sister in alberta ought to have two or four cents postage on it carol would have taken it to the drug store and weighed it but then she was a dreamer while they were practical people as they frequently admitted so they sought to evolve the postal rate from their inner consciousnesses which combined with entire frankness in thinking aloud was their method of settling all problems  the smails did not believe in all this nonsense about privacy and reticence when carol left a letter from her sister on the table she was astounded to hear from uncle whittier i see your sister says her husband is doing fine you ought to go see her oftener i asked will and he says you dont go see her very often my you ought to go see her oftener  if carol was writing a letter to a classmate or planning the weeks menus she could be certain that aunt bessie would pop in and titter now dont let me disturb you i just wanted to see where you were dont stop im not going to stay only a second i just wondered if you could possibly have thought that i didnt eat the onions this noon because i didnt think they were properly cooked but that wasnt the reason at all it wasnt because i didnt think they were well cooked im sure that everything in your house is always very dainty and nice though i do think that oscarina is careless about some things she doesnt appreciate the big wages you pay her and she is so cranky all these swedes are so cranky i dont really see why you have a swede butbut that wasnt it i didnt eat them not because i didnt think they werent cooked proper it was justi find that onions dont agree with me its very strange ever since i had an attack of biliousness one time i have found that onions either fried onions or raw ones and whittier does love raw onions with vinegar and sugar on them  it was pure affection  carol was discovering that the one thing that can be more disconcerting than intelligent hatred is demanding love  she supposed that she was being gracefully dull and standardized in the smails presence but they scented the heretic and with forwardstooping delight they sat and tried to drag out her ludicrous concepts for their amusement they were like the sundayafternoon mob starting at monkeys in the zoo poking fingers and making faces and giggling at the resentment of the more dignified race  with a looselipped superior village smile uncle whittier hinted whats this i hear about your thinking gopher prairie ought to be all tore down and rebuilt carrie i dont know where folks get these newfangled ideas lots of farmers in dakota getting em these days about cooperation think they can run stores better n storekeepers huh  whit and i didnt need no cooperation as long as we was farming triumphed aunt bessie carrie tell your old auntie now dont you ever go to church on sunday you do go sometimes but you ought to go every sunday when youre as old as i am youll learn that no matter how smart folks think they are god knows a whole lot more than they do and then youll realize and be glad to go and listen to your pastor  in the manner of one who has just beheld a twoheaded calf they repeated that they had never heard such funny ideas they were staggered to learn that a real tangible person living in minnesota and married to their own fleshandblood relation could apparently believe that divorce may not always be immoral that illegitimate children do not bear any special and guaranteed form of curse that there are ethical authorities outside of the hebrew bible that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter that the capitalistic system of distribution and the baptist weddingceremony were not known in the garden of eden that mushrooms are as edible as cornbeef hash that the word dude is no longer frequently used that there are ministers of the gospel who accept evolution that some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always vote the republican ticket straight that it is not a universal custom to wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter that a violin is not inherently more immoral than a chapel organ that some poets do not have long hair and that jews are not always pedlers or pantsmakers  where does she get all them theries marveled uncle whittier smail while aunt bessie inquired do you suppose theres many folks got notions like hers my if there are and her tone settled the fact that there were not i just dont know what the worlds coming to  patientlymore or lesscarol awaited the exquisite day when they would announce departure after three weeks uncle whittier remarked we kinda like gopher prairie guess maybe well stay here wed been wondering what wed do now weve sold the creamery and my farms so i had a talk with ole jenson about his grocery and i guess ill buy him out and storekeep for a while  he did  carol rebelled kennicott soothed her oh we wont see much of them theyll have their own house  she resolved to be so chilly that they would stay away but she had no talent for conscious insolence they found a house but carol was never safe from their appearance with a hearty thought wed drop in this evening and keep you from being lonely why you aint had them curtains washed yet invariably whenever she was touched by the realization that it was they who were lonely they wrecked her pitying affection by commentsquestionscommentsadvice  they immediately became friendly with all of their own race with the luke dawsons the deacon piersons and mrs bogart and brought them along in the evening aunt bessie was a bridge over whom the older women bearing gifts of counsel and the ignorance of experience poured into carols island of reserve aunt bessie urged the good widow bogart drop in and see carrie real often young folks today dont understand housekeeping like we do  mrs bogart showed herself perfectly willing to be an associate relative  carol was thinking up protective insults when kennicotts mother came down to stay with brother whittier for two months carol was fond of mrs kennicott she could not carry out her insults  she felt trapped  she had been kidnaped by the town she was aunt bessies niece and she was to be a mother she was expected she almost expected herself to sit forever talking of babies cooks embroidery stitches the price of potatoes and the tastes of husbands in the matter of spinach  she found a refuge in the jolly seventeen she suddenly understood that they could be depended upon to laugh with her at mrs bogart and she now saw juanita haydocks gossip not as vulgarity but as gaiety and remarkable analysis  her life had changed even before hugh appeared she looked forward to the next bridge of the jolly seventeen and the security of whispering with her dear friends maud dyer and juanita and mrs mcganum  she was part of the town its philosophy and its feuds dominated her   iii   she was no longer irritated by the cooing of the matrons nor by their opinion that diet didnt matter so long as the little ones had plenty of lace and moist kisses but she concluded that in the care of babies as in politics intelligence was superior to quotations about pansies she liked best to talk about hugh to kennicott vida and the bjornstams she was happily domestic when kennicott sat by her on the floor to watch baby make faces she was delighted when miles speaking as one man to another admonished hugh i wouldnt stand them skirts if i was you come on join the union and strike make em give you pants  as a parent kennicott was moved to establish the first childwelfare week held in gopher prairie carol helped him weigh babies and examine their throats and she wrote out the diets for mute german and scandinavian mothers  the aristocracy of gopher prairie even the wives of the rival doctors took part and for several days there was community spirit and much uplift but this reign of love was overthrown when the prize for best baby was awarded not to decent parents but to bea and miles bjornstam the good matrons glared at olaf bjornstam with his blue eyes his honeycolored hair and magnificent back and they remarked well mrs kennicott maybe that swede brat is as healthy as your husband says he is but let me tell you i hate to think of the future that awaits any boy with a hired girl for a mother and an awful irreligious socialist for a pa  she raged but so violent was the current of their respectability so persistent was aunt bessie in running to her with their blabber that she was embarrassed when she took hugh to play with olaf she hated herself for it but she hoped that no one saw her go into the bjornstam shanty she hated herself and the towns indifferent cruelty when she saw beas radiant devotion to both babies alike when she saw miles staring at them wistfully  he had saved money had quit elders planingmill and started a dairy on a vacant lot near his shack he was proud of his three cows and sixty chickens and got up nights to nurse them  ill be a big farmer before you can bat an eye i tell you that young fellow olaf is going to go east to college along with the haydock kids uhlots of folks dropping in to chin with bea and me now say ma bogart come in one day she wasi liked the old lady fine and the mill foreman comes in right along oh we got lots of friends you bet   iv   though the town seemed to carol to change no more than the surrounding fields there was a constant shifting these three years the citizen of the prairie drifts always westward it may be because he is the heir of ancient migrationsand it may be because he finds within his own spirit so little adventure that he is driven to seek it by changing his horizon the towns remain unvaried yet the individual faces alter like classes in college the gopher prairie jeweler sells out for no discernible reason and moves on to alberta or the state of washington to open a shop precisely like his former one in a town precisely like the one he has left there is except among professional men and the wealthy small permanence either of residence or occupation a man becomes farmer grocer town policeman garageman restaurantowner postmaster insuranceagent and farmer all over again and the community more or less patiently suffers from his lack of knowledge in each of his experiments  ole jenson the grocer and dahl the butcher moved on to south dakota and idaho luke and mrs dawson picked up ten thousand acres of prairie soil in the magic portable form of a small check book and went to pasadena to a bungalow and sunshine and cafeterias chet dashaway sold his furniture and undertaking business and wandered to los angeles where the dauntless reported our good friend chester has accepted a fine position with a realestate firm and his wife has in the charming social circles of the queen city of the southwestland that same popularity which she enjoyed in our own society sets  rita simons was married to terry gould and rivaled juanita haydock as the gayest of the young married set but juanita also acquired merit harrys father died harry became senior partner in the bon ton store and juanita was more acidulous and shrewd and cackling than ever she bought an evening frock and exposed her collarbone to the wonder of the jolly seventeen and talked of moving to minneapolis  to defend her position against the new mrs terry gould she sought to attach carol to her faction by giggling that some folks might call rita innocent but ive got a hunch that she isnt half as ignorant of things as brides are supposed to beand of course terry isnt onetwothree as a doctor alongside of your husband  carol herself would gladly have followed mr ole jenson and migrated even to another main street flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would have for a time the outer look and promise of adventure she hinted to kennicott of the probable medical advantages of montana and oregon she knew that he was satisfied with gopher prairie but it gave her vicarious hope to think of going to ask for railroad folders at the station to trace the maps with a restless forefinger  yet to the casual eye she was not discontented she was not an abnormal and distressing traitor to the faith of main street  the settled citizen believes that the rebel is constantly in a stew of complaining and hearing of a carol kennicott he gasps what an awful person she must be a holy terror to live with glad my folks are satisfied with things way they are actually it was not so much as five minutes a day that carol devoted to lonely desires it is probable that the agitated citizen has within his circle at least one inarticulate rebel with aspirations as wayward as carols  the presence of the baby had made her take gopher prairie and the brown house seriously as natural places of residence she pleased kennicott by being friendly with the complacent maturity of mrs clark and mrs elder and when she had often enough been in conference upon the elders new cadillac car or the job which the oldest clark boy had taken in the office of the flourmill these topics became important things to follow up day by day  with ninetenths of her emotion concentrated upon hugh she did not criticize shops streets acquaintances    this year or two she hurried to uncle whittiers store for a package of cornflakes she abstractedly listened to uncle whittiers denunciation of martin mahoney for asserting that the wind last tuesday had been south and not southwest she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces of strangers thinking of hughs teething all the way she did not reflect that this store these drab blocks made up all her background she did her work and she triumphed over winning from the clarks at five hundred  the most considerable event of the two years after the birth of hugh occurred when vida sherwin resigned from the high school and was married carol was her attendant and as the wedding was at the episcopal church all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid gloves and looked refined  for years carol had been little sister to vida and had never in the least known to what degree vida loved her and hated her and in curious strained ways was bound to her    chapter xxi  i  gray steel that seems unmoving because it spins so fast in the balanced flywheel gray snow in an avenue of elms gray dawn with the sun behind itthis was the gray of vida sherwins life at thirtysix  she was small and active and sallow her yellow hair was faded and looked dry her blue silk blouses and modest lace collars and high black shoes and sailor hats were as literal and uncharming as a schoolroom desk but her eyes determined her appearance revealed her as a personage and a force indicated her faith in the goodness and purpose of everything they were blue and they were never still they expressed amusement pity enthusiasm if she had been seen in sleep with the wrinkles beside her eyes stilled and the creased lids hiding the radiant irises she would have lost her potency  she was born in a hillsmothered wisconsin village where her father was a prosy minister she labored through a sanctimonious college she taught for two years in an ironrange town of blurryfaced tatars and montenegrins and wastes of ore and when she came to gopher prairie its trees and the shining spaciousness of the wheat prairie made her certain that she was in paradise  she admitted to her fellowteachers that the schoolbuilding was slightly damp but she insisted that the rooms were arranged so convenientlyand then that bust of president mckinley at the head of the stairs its a lovely artwork and isnt it an inspiration to have the brave honest martyr president to think about she taught french english and history and the sophomore latin class which dealt in matters of a metaphysical nature called indirect discourse and the ablative absolute each year she was reconvinced that the pupils were beginning to learn more quickly she spent four winters in building up the debating society and when the debate really was lively one friday afternoon and the speakers of pieces did not forget their lines she felt rewarded  she lived an engrossed useful life and seemed as cool and simple as an apple but secretly she was creeping among fears longing and guilt she knew what it was but she dared not name it she hated even the sound of the word sex when she dreamed of being a woman of the harem with great white warm limbs she awoke to shudder defenseless in the dusk of her room she prayed to jesus always to the son of god offering him the terrible power of her adoration addressing him as the eternal lover growing passionate exalted large as she contemplated his splendor thus she mounted to endurance and surcease  by day rattling about in many activities she was able to ridicule her blazing nights of darkness with spurious cheerfulness she announced everywhere i guess im a born spinster and no one will ever marry a plain schoolmaam like me and you men great big noisy bothersome creatures we women wouldnt have you round the place dirtying up nice clean rooms if it wasnt that you have to be petted and guided we just ought to say scat to all of you  but when a man held her close at a dance even when professor george edwin mott patted her hand paternally as they considered the naughtinesses of cy bogart she quivered and reflected how superior she was to have kept her virginity  in the autumn of 1911 a year before dr will kennicott was married vida was his partner at a fivehundred tournament she was thirtyfour then kennicott about thirtysix to her he was a superb boyish diverting creature all the heroic qualities in a manly magnificent body they had been helping the hostess to serve the waldorf salad and coffee and gingerbread they were in the kitchen side by side on a bench while the others ponderously supped in the room beyond  kennicott was masculine and experimental he stroked vidas hand he put his arm carelessly about her shoulder  dont she said sharply  youre a cunning thing he offered patting the back of her shoulder in an exploratory manner  while she strained away she longed to move nearer to him he bent over looked at her knowingly she glanced down at his left hand as it touched her knee she sprang up started noisily and needlessly to wash the dishes he helped her he was too lazy to adventure furtherand too used to women in his profession she was grateful for the impersonality of his talk it enabled her to gain control she knew that she had skirted wild thoughts  a month after on a sleighingparty under the buffalo robes in the bobsled he whispered you pretend to be a grownup schoolteacher but youre nothing but a kiddie his arm was about her she resisted  dont you like the poor lonely bachelor he yammered in a fatuous way  no i dont you dont care for me in the least youre just practising on me  youre so mean im terribly fond of you  im not of you and im not going to let myself be fond of you either  he persistently drew her toward him she clutched his arm then she threw off the robe climbed out of the sled raced after it with harry haydock at the dance which followed the sleighride kennicott was devoted to the watery prettiness of maud dyer and vida was noisily interested in getting up a virginia reel without seeming to watch kennicott she knew that he did not once look at her  that was all of her first loveaffair  he gave no sign of remembering that he was terribly fond she waited for him she reveled in longing and in a sense of guilt because she longed she told herself that she did not want part of him unless he gave her all his devotion she would never let him touch her and when she found that she was probably lying she burned with scorn she fought it out in prayer she knelt in a pink flannel nightgown her thin hair down her back her forehead as full of horror as a mask of tragedy while she identified her love for the son of god with her love for a mortal and wondered if any other woman had ever been so sacrilegious she wanted to be a nun and observe perpetual adoration she bought a rosary but she had been so bitterly reared as a protestant that she could not bring herself to use it  yet none of her intimates in the school and in the boardinghouse knew of her abyss of passion they said she was so optimistic  when she heard that kennicott was to marry a girl pretty young and imposingly from the cities vida despaired she congratulated kennicott carelessly ascertained from him the hour of marriage at that hour sitting in her room vida pictured the wedding in st paul full of an ecstasy which horrified her she followed kennicott and the girl who had stolen her place followed them to the train through the evening the night  she was relieved when she had worked out a belief that she wasnt really shameful that there was a mystical relation between herself and carol so that she was vicariously yet veritably with kennicott and had the right to be  she saw carol during the first five minutes in gopher prairie she stared at the passing motor at kennicott and the girl beside him in that fog world of transference of emotion vida had no normal jealousy but a conviction that since through carol she had received kennicotts love then carol was a part of her an astral self a heightened and more beloved self she was glad of the girls charm of the smooth black hair the airy head and young shoulders but she was suddenly angry carol glanced at her for a quartersecond but looked past her at an old roadside barn if she had made the great sacrifice at least she expected gratitude and recognition vida raged while her conscious schoolroom mind fussily begged her to control this insanity  during her first call half of her wanted to welcome a fellow reader of books the other half itched to find out whether carol knew anything about kennicotts former interest in herself she discovered that carol was not aware that he had ever touched another womans hand carol was an amusing naive curiously learned child while vida was most actively describing the glories of the thanatopsis and complimenting this librarian on her training as a worker she was fancying that this girl was the child born of herself and kennicott and out of that symbolizing she had a comfort she had not known for months  when she came home after supper with the kennicotts and guy pollock she had a sudden and rather pleasant backsliding from devotion she bustled into her room she slammed her hat on the bed and chattered i dont care im a lot like herexcept a few years older im light and quick too and i can talk just as well as she can and im suremen are such fools id be ten times as sweet to make love to as that dreamy baby and i am as goodlooking  but as she sat on the bed and stared at her thin thighs defiance oozed away she mourned  no im not dear god how we fool ourselves i pretend im spiritual i pretend my legs are graceful they arent theyre skinny oldmaidish i hate it i hate that impertinent young woman a selfish cat taking his love for granted    no shes adorable    i dont think she ought to be so friendly with guy pollock  for a year vida loved carol longed to and did not pry into the details of her relations with kennicott enjoyed her spirit of play as expressed in childish teaparties and with the mystic bond between them forgotten was healthily vexed by carols assumption that she was a sociological messiah come to save gopher prairie this last facet of vidas thought was the one which after a year was most often turned to the light in a testy way she brooded these people that want to change everything all of a sudden without doing any work make me tired here i have to go and work for four years picking out the pupils for debates and drilling them and nagging at them to get them to look up references and begging them to choose their own subjectsfour years to get up a couple of good debates and she comes rushing in and expects in one year to change the whole town into a lollypop paradise with everybody stopping everything else to grow tulips and drink tea and its a comfy homey old town too  she had such an outburst after each of carols campaignsfor better thanatopsis programs for shavian plays for more human schoolsbut she never betrayed herself and always she was penitent  vida was and always would be a reformer a liberal she believed that details could excitingly be altered but that thingsingeneral were comely and kind and immutable carol was without understanding or accepting it a revolutionist a radical and therefore possessed of constructive ideas which only the destroyer can have since the reformer believes that all the essential constructing has already been done after years of intimacy it was this unexpressed opposition more than the fancied loss of kennicotts love which held vida irritably fascinated  but the birth of hugh revived the transcendental emotion she was indignant that carol should not be utterly fulfilled in having borne kennicotts child she admitted that carol seemed to have affection and immaculate care for the baby but she began to identify herself now with kennicott and in this phase to feel that she had endured quite too much from carols instability  she recalled certain other women who had come from the outside and had not appreciated gopher prairie she remembered the rectors wife who had been chilly to callers and who was rumored throughout the town to have said reahly i cawnt endure this bucolic heartiness in the responses the woman was positively known to have worn handkerchiefs in her bodice as paddingoh the town had simply roared at her of course the rector and she were got rid of in a few months  then there was the mysterious woman with the dyed hair and penciled eyebrows who wore tight english dresses like basques who smelled of stale musk who flirted with the men and got them to advance money for her expenses in a lawsuit who laughed at vidas reading at a schoolentertainment and went off owing a hotelbill and the three hundred dollars she had borrowed  vida insisted that she loved carol but with some satisfaction she compared her to these traducers of the town   ii   vida had enjoyed raymie wutherspoons singing in the episcopal choir she had thoroughly reviewed the weather with him at methodist sociables and in the bon ton but she did not really know him till she moved to mrs gurreys boardinghouse it was five years after her affair with kennicott she was thirtynine raymie perhaps a year younger  she said to him and sincerely my you can do anything with your brains and tact and that heavenly voice you were so good in the girl from kankakee you made me feel terribly stupid if youd gone on the stage i believe youd be just as good as anybody in minneapolis but still im not sorry you stuck to business its such a constructive career  do you really think so yearned raymie across the applesauce  it was the first time that either of them had found a dependable intellectual companionship they looked down on willis woodford the bankclerk and his anxious babycentric wife the silent lyman casses the slangy traveling man and the rest of mrs gurreys unenlightened guests they sat opposite and they sat late they were exhilarated to find that they agreed in confession of faith  people like sam clark and harry haydock arent earnest about music and pictures and eloquent sermons and really refined movies but then on the other hand people like carol kennicott put too much stress on all this art folks ought to appreciate lovely things but just the same they got to be practical andthey got to look at things in a practical way  smiling passing each other the pressedglass pickledish seeing mrs gurreys linty suppercloth irradiated by the light of intimacy vida and raymie talked about carols rosecolored turban carols sweetness carols new low shoes carols erroneous theory that there was no need of strict discipline in school carols amiability in the bon ton carols flow of wild ideas which honestly just simply made you nervous trying to keep track of them  about the lovely display of gents shirts in the bon ton window as dressed by raymie about raymies offertory last sunday the fact that there werent any of these new solos as nice as jerusalem the golden and the way raymie stood up to juanita haydock when she came into the store and tried to run things and he as much as told her that she was so anxious to have folks think she was smart and bright that she said things she didnt mean and anyway raymie was running the shoedepartment and if juanita or harry either didnt like the way he ran things they could go get another man  about vidas new jabot which made her look thirtytwo vidas estimate or twentytwo raymies estimate vidas plan to have the highschool debating society give a playlet and the difficulty of keeping the younger boys well behaved on the playground when a big lubber like cy bogart acted up so  about the picture postcard which mrs dawson had sent to mrs cass from pasadena showing roses growing right outdoors in february the change in time on no 4 the reckless way dr gould always drove his auto the reckless way almost all these people drove their autos the fallacy of supposing that these socialists could carry on a government for as much as six months if they ever did have a chance to try out their theories and the crazy way in which carol jumped from subject to subject  vida had once beheld raymie as a thin man with spectacles mournful drawnout face and colorless stiff hair now she noted that his jaw was square that his long hands moved quickly and were bleached in a refined manner and that his trusting eyes indicated that he had led a clean life she began to call him ray and to bounce in defense of his unselfishness and thoughtfulness every time juanita haydock or rita gould giggled about him at the jolly seventeen  on a sunday afternoon of late autumn they walked down to lake minniemashie ray said that he would like to see the ocean it must be a grand sight it must be much grander than a lake even a great big lake vida had seen it she stated modestly she had seen it on a summer trip to cape cod  have you been clear to cape cod massachusetts i knew youd traveled but i never realized youd been that far  made taller and younger by his interest she poured out oh my yes it was a wonderful trip so many points of interest through massachusettshistorical theres lexington where we turned back the redcoats and longfellows home at cambridge and cape codjust everythingfishermen and whaleships and sanddunes and everything  she wished that she had a little cane to carry he broke off a willow branch  my youre strong she said  no not very i wish there was a y m c a here so i could take up regular exercise i used to think i could do pretty good acrobatics if i had a chance  im sure you could youre unusually lithe for a large man  oh no not so very but i wish we had a y m it would be dandy to have lectures and everything and id like to take a class in improving the memoryi believe a fellow ought to go on educating himself and improving his mind even if he is in business dont you vidai guess im kind of fresh to call you vida  ive been calling you ray for weeks  he wondered why she sounded tart  he helped her down the bank to the edge of the lake but dropped her hand abruptly and as they sat on a willow log and he brushed her sleeve he delicately moved over and murmured oh excuse meaccident  she stared at the mudbrowned chilly water the floating gray reeds  you look so thoughtful he said  she threw out her hands i am will you kindly tell me whats the use ofanything oh dont mind me im a moody old hen tell me about your plan for getting a partnership in the bon ton i do think youre right harry haydock and that mean old simons ought to give you one  he hymned the old unhappy wars in which he had been achilles and the mellifluous nestor yet gone his righteous ways unheeded by the cruel kings    why if ive told em once ive told em a dozen times to get in a sideline of lightweight pants for gents summer wear and of course here they go and let a cheap kike like rifkin beat them to it and grab the trade right off em and then harry saidyou know how harry is maybe he dont mean to be grouchy but hes such a sorehead  he gave her a hand to rise if you dont mind i think a fellow is awful if a lady goes on a walk with him and she cant trust him and he tries to flirt with her and all  im sure youre highly trustworthy she snapped and she sprang up without his aid then smiling excessively uhdont you think carol sometimes fails to appreciate dr wills ability   iii   ray habitually asked her about his windowtrimming the display of the new shoes the best music for the entertainment at the eastern star and though he was recognized as a professional authority on what the town called gents furnishings about his own clothes she persuaded him not to wear the small bow ties which made him look like an elongated sunday school scholar once she burst out  ray i could shake you do you know youre too apologetic you always appreciate other people too much you fuss over carol kennicott when she has some crazy theory that we all ought to turn anarchists or live on figs and nuts or something and you listen when harry haydock tries to show off and talk about turnovers and credits and things you know lots better than he does look folks in the eye glare at em talk deep youre the smartest man in town if you only knew it you are  he could not believe it he kept coming back to her for confirmation he practised glaring and talking deep but he circuitously hinted to vida that when he had tried to look harry haydock in the eye harry had inquired whats the matter with you raymie got a pain but afterward harry had asked about kantbeatum socks in a manner which ray felt was somehow different from his former condescension  they were sitting on the squat yellow satin settee in the boardinghouse parlor as ray reannounced that he simply wouldnt stand it many more years if harry didnt give him a partnership his gesticulating hand touched vidas shoulders  oh excuse me he pleaded  its all right well i think i must be running up to my room headache she said briefly   iv   ray and she had stopped in at dyers for a hot chocolate on their way home from the movies that march evening vida speculated do you know that i may not be here next year  what do you mean  with her fragile narrow nails she smoothed the glass slab which formed the top of the round table at which they sat she peeped through the glass at the perfumeboxes of black and gold and citron in the hollow table she looked about at shelves of red rubber waterbottles pale yellow sponges washrags with blue borders hairbrushes of polished cherry backs she shook her head like a nervous medium coming out of a trance stared at him unhappily demanded  why should i stay here and i must make up my mind now time to renew our teachingcontracts for next year i think ill go teach in some other town everybody here is tired of me i might as well go before folks come out and say theyre tired of me i have to decide tonight i might as welloh no matter come lets skip its late  she sprang up ignoring his wail of vida wait sit down gosh im flabbergasted gee vida she marched out while he was paying his check she got ahead he ran after her blubbering vida wait in the shade of the lilacs in front of the gougerling house he came up with her stayed her flight by a hand on her shoulder  oh dont dont what does it matter she begged she was sobbing her soft wrinkly lids soaked with tears who cares for my affection or help i might as well drift on forgotten o ray please dont hold me let me go ill just decide not to renew my contract here andand driftway off  his hand was steady on her shoulder she dropped her head rubbed the back of his hand with her cheek  they were married in june   v   they took the ole jenson house its small said vida but its got the dearest vegetable garden and i love having time to get near to nature for once  though she became vida wutherspoon technically and though she certainly had no ideals about the independence of keeping her name she continued to be known as vida sherwin  she had resigned from the school but she kept up one class in english she bustled about on every committee of the thanatopsis she was always popping into the restroom to make mrs nodelquist sweep the floor she was appointed to the libraryboard to succeed carol she taught the senior girls class in the episcopal sunday school and tried to revive the kings daughters she exploded into selfconfidence and happiness her draining thoughts were by marriage turned into energy she became daily and visibly more plump and though she chattered as eagerly she was less obviously admiring of marital bliss less sentimental about babies sharper in demanding that the entire town share her reformsthe purchase of a park the compulsory cleaning of backyards  she penned harry haydock at his desk in the bon ton she interrupted his joking she told him that it was ray who had built up the shoedepartment and mens department she demanded that he be made a partner before harry could answer she threatened that ray and she would start a rival shop ill clerk behind the counter myself and a certain party is all ready to put up the money  she rather wondered who the certain party was  ray was made a onesixth partner  he became a glorified floorwalker greeting the men with new poise no longer coyly subservient to pretty women when he was not affectionately coercing people into buying things they did not need he stood at the back of the store glowing abstracted feeling masculine as he recalled the tempestuous surprises of love revealed by vida  the only remnant of vidas identification of herself with carol was a jealousy when she saw kennicott and ray together and reflected that some people might suppose that kennicott was his superior she was sure that carol thought so and she wanted to shriek you neednt try to gloat i wouldnt have your pokey old husband he hasnt one single bit of rays spiritual nobility    chapter xxii  i  the greatest mystery about a human being is not his reaction to sex or praise but the manner in which he contrives to put in twentyfour hours a day it is this which puzzles the longshoreman about the clerk the londoner about the bushman it was this which puzzled carol in regard to the married vida carol herself had the baby a larger house to care for all the telephone calls for kennicott when he was away and she read everything while vida was satisfied with newspaper headlines  but after detached brown years in boardinghouses vida was hungry for housework for the most pottering detail of it she had no maid nor wanted one she cooked baked swept washed suppercloths with the triumph of a chemist in a new laboratory to her the hearth was veritably the altar when she went shopping she hugged the cans of soup and she bought a mop or a side of bacon as though she were preparing for a reception she knelt beside a bean sprout and crooned i raised this with my own handsi brought this new life into the world  i love her for being so happy carol brooded i ought to be that way i worship the baby but the houseworkoh i suppose im fortunate so much better off than farmwomen on a new clearing or people in a slum  it has not yet been recorded that any human being has gained a very large or permanent contentment from meditation upon the fact that he is better off than others  in carols own twentyfour hours a day she got up dressed the baby had breakfast talked to oscarina about the days shopping put the baby on the porch to play went to the butchers to choose between steak and pork chops bathed the baby nailed up a shelf had dinner put the baby to bed for a nap paid the iceman read for an hour took the baby out for a walk called on vida had supper put the baby to bed darned socks listened to kennicotts yawning comment on what a fool dr mcganum was to try to use that cheap xray outfit of his on an epithelioma repaired a frock drowsily heard kennicott stoke the furnace tried to read a page of thorstein veblenand the day was gone  except when hugh was vigorously naughty or whiney or laughing or saying i like my chair with thrilling maturity she was always enfeebled by loneliness she no longer felt superior about that misfortune she would gladly have been converted to vidas satisfaction in gopher prairie and mopping the floor   ii   carol drove through an astonishing number of books from the public library and from city shops kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her disconcerting habit of buying them a book was a book and if you had several thousand of them right here in the library free why the dickens should you spend your good money after worrying about it for two or three years he decided that this was one of the funny ideas which she had caught as a librarian and from which she would never entirely recover  the authors whom she read were most of them frightfully annoyed by the vida sherwins they were young american sociologists young english realists russian horrorists anatole france rolland nexo wells shaw key edgar lee masters theodore dreiser sherwood anderson henry mencken and all the other subversive philosophers and artists whom women were consulting everywhere in batikcurtained studios in new york in kansas farmhouses san francisco drawingrooms alabama schools for negroes from them she got the same confused desire which the million other women felt the same determination to be classconscious without discovering the class of which she was to be conscious  certainly her reading precipitated her observations of main street of gopher prairie and of the several adjacent gopher prairies which she had seen on drives with kennicott in her fluid thought certain convictions appeared jaggedly a fragment of an impression at a time while she was going to sleep or manicuring her nails or waiting for kennicott  these convictions she presented to vida sherwinvida wutherspoonbeside a radiator over a bowl of not very good walnuts and pecans from uncle whittiers grocery on an evening when both kennicott and raymie had gone out of town with the other officers of the ancient and affiliated order of spartans to inaugurate a new chapter at wakamin vida had come to the house for the night she helped in putting hugh to bed sputtering the while about his soft skin then they talked till midnight  what carol said that evening what she was passionately thinking was also emerging in the minds of women in ten thousand gopher prairies her formulations were not pat solutions but visions of a tragic futility she did not utter them so compactly that they can be given in her words they were roughened with well you see and if you get what i mean and i dont know that im making myself clear but they were definite enough and indignant enough   iii   in reading popular stories and seeing plays asserted carol she had found only two traditions of the american small town the first tradition repeated in scores of magazines every month is that the american village remains the one sure abode of friendship honesty and clean sweet marriageable girls therefore all men who succeed in painting in paris or in finance in new york at last become weary of smart women return to their native towns assert that cities are vicious marry their childhood sweethearts and presumably joyously abide in those towns until death  the other tradition is that the significant features of all villages are whiskers iron dogs upon lawns gold bricks checkers jars of gilded cattails and shrewd comic old men who are known as hicks and who ejaculate waal i swan this altogether admirable tradition rules the vaudeville stage facetious illustrators and syndicated newspaper humor but out of actual life it passed forty years ago carols small town thinks not in hossswapping but in cheap motor cars telephones readymade clothes silos alfalfa kodaks phonographs leatherupholstered morris chairs bridgeprizes oilstocks motionpictures landdeals unread sets of mark twain and a chaste version of national politics  with such a smalltown life a kennicott or a champ perry is content but there are also hundreds of thousands particularly women and young men who are not at all content the more intelligent young people and the fortunate widows flee to the cities with agility and despite the fictional tradition resolutely stay there seldom returning even for holidays the most protesting patriots of the towns leave them in old age if they can afford it and go to live in california or in the cities  the reason carol insisted is not a whiskered rusticity it is nothing so amusing  it is an unimaginatively standardized background a sluggishness of speech and manners a rigid ruling of the spirit by the desire to appear respectable it is contentment    the contentment of the quiet dead who are scornful of the living for their restless walking it is negation canonized as the one positive virtue it is the prohibition of happiness it is slavery selfsought and selfdefended it is dullness made god  a savorless people gulping tasteless food and sitting afterward coatless and thoughtless in rockingchairs prickly with inane decorations listening to mechanical music saying mechanical things about the excellence of ford automobiles and viewing themselves as the greatest race in the world   iv   she had inquired as to the effect of this dominating dullness upon foreigners she remembered the feeble exotic quality to be found in the firstgeneration scandinavians she recalled the norwegian fair at the lutheran church to which bea had taken her there in the bondestue the replica of a norse farm kitchen pale women in scarlet jackets embroidered with gold thread and colored beads in black skirts with a line of blue greenstriped aprons and ridged caps very pretty to set off a fresh face had served rommegrod og lefsesweet cakes and sour milk pudding spiced with cinnamon for the first time in gopher prairie carol had found novelty she had reveled in the mild foreignness of it  but she saw these scandinavian women zealously exchanging their spiced puddings and red jackets for fried pork chops and congealed white blouses trading the ancient christmas hymns of the fjords for shes my jazzland cutie being americanized into uniformity and in less than a generation losing in the grayness whatever pleasant new customs they might have added to the life of the town their sons finished the process in readymade clothes and readymade highschool phrases they sank into propriety and the sound american customs had absorbed without one trace of pollution another alien invasion  and along with these foreigners she felt herself being ironed into glossy mediocrity and she rebelled in fear  the respectability of the gopher prairies said carol is reinforced by vows of poverty and chastity in the matter of knowledge except for half a dozen in each town the citizens are proud of that achievement of ignorance which it is so easy to come by to be intellectual or artistic or in their own word to be highbrow is to be priggish and of dubious virtue  large experiments in politics and in cooperative distribution ventures requiring knowledge courage and imagination do originate in the west and middlewest but they are not of the towns they are of the farmers if these heresies are supported by the townsmen it is only by occasional teachers doctors lawyers the labor unions and workmen like miles bjornstam who are punished by being mocked as cranks as halfbaked parlor socialists the editor and the rector preach at them the cloud of serene ignorance submerges them in unhappiness and futility   v   here vida observed yeswelldo you know ive always thought that ray would have made a wonderful rector he has what i call an essentially religious soul my hed have read the service beautifully i suppose its too late now but as i tell him he can also serve the world by selling shoes andi wonder if we oughtnt to have familyprayers   vi   doubtless all small towns in all countries in all ages carol admitted have a tendency to be not only dull but mean bitter infested with curiosity in france or tibet quite as much as in wyoming or indiana these timidities are inherent in isolation  but a village in a country which is taking pains to become altogether standardized and pure which aspires to succeed victorian england as the chief mediocrity of the world is no longer merely provincial no longer downy and restful in its leafshadowed ignorance it is a force seeking to dominate the earth to drain the hills and sea of color to set dante at boosting gopher prairie and to dress the high gods in klassy kollege klothes sure of itself it bullies other civilizations as a traveling salesman in a brown derby conquers the wisdom of china and tacks advertisements of cigarettes over arches for centuries dedicate to the sayings of confucius  such a society functions admirably in the large production of cheap automobiles dollar watches and safety razors but it is not satisfied until the entire world also admits that the end and joyous purpose of living is to ride in flivvers to make advertisingpictures of dollar watches and in the twilight to sit talking not of love and courage but of the convenience of safety razors  and such a society such a nation is determined by the gopher prairies the greatest manufacturer is but a busier sam clark and all the rotund senators and presidents are village lawyers and bankers grown nine feet tall  though a gopher prairie regards itself as a part of the great world compares itself to rome and vienna it will not acquire the scientific spirit the international mind which would make it great it picks at information which will visibly procure money or social distinction its conception of a community ideal is not the grand manner the noble aspiration the fine aristocratic pride but cheap labor for the kitchen and rapid increase in the price of land it plays at cards on greasy oilcloth in a shanty and does not know that prophets are walking and talking on the terrace  if all the provincials were as kindly as champ perry and sam clark there would be no reason for desiring the town to seek great traditions it is the harry haydocks the dave dyers the jackson elders small busy men crushingly powerful in their common purpose viewing themselves as men of the world but keeping themselves men of the cashregister and the comic film who make the town a sterile oligarchy   vii   she had sought to be definite in analyzing the surface ugliness of the gopher prairies she asserted that it is a matter of universal similarity of flimsiness of construction so that the towns resemble frontier camps of neglect of natural advantages so that the hills are covered with brush the lakes shut off by railroads and the creeks lined with dumpinggrounds of depressing sobriety of color rectangularity of buildings and excessive breadth and straightness of the gashed streets so that there is no escape from gales and from sight of the grim sweep of land nor any windings to coax the loiterer along while the breadth which would be majestic in an avenue of palaces makes the low shabby shops creeping down the typical main street the more mean by comparison  the universal similaritythat is the physical expression of the philosophy of dull safety ninetenths of the american towns are so alike that it is the completest boredom to wander from one to another always west of pittsburg and often east of it there is the same lumber yard the same railroad station the same ford garage the same creamery the same boxlike houses and twostory shops the new more conscious houses are alike in their very attempts at diversity the same bungalows the same square houses of stucco or tapestry brick the shops show the same standardized nationally advertised wares the newspapers of sections three thousand miles apart have the same syndicated features the boy in arkansas displays just such a flamboyant readymade suit as is found on just such a boy in delaware both of them iterate the same slang phrases from the same sportingpages and if one of them is in college and the other is a barber no one may surmise which is which  if kennicott were snatched from gopher prairie and instantly conveyed to a town leagues away he would not realize it he would go down apparently the same main street almost certainly it would be called main street in the same drug store he would see the same young man serving the same icecream soda to the same young woman with the same magazines and phonograph records under her arm not till he had climbed to his office and found another sign on the door another dr kennicott inside would he understand that something curious had presumably happened  finally behind all her comments carol saw the fact that the prairie towns no more exist to serve the farmers who are their reason of existence than do the great capitals they exist to fatten on the farmers to provide for the townsmen large motors and social preferment and unlike the capitals they do not give to the district in return for usury a stately and permanent center but only this ragged camp it is a parasitic greek civilizationminus the civilization  there we are then said carol the remedy is there any criticism perhaps for the beginning of the beginning oh theres nothing that attacks the tribal god mediocrity that doesnt help a little    and probably theres nothing that helps very much perhaps some day the farmers will build and own their markettowns think of the club they could have but im afraid i havent any reform program not any more the trouble is spiritual and no league or party can enact a preference for gardens rather than dumpinggrounds    theres my confession well  in other words all you want is perfection  yes why not  how you hate this place how can you expect to do anything with it if you havent any sympathy  but i have and affection or else i wouldnt fume so ive learned that gopher prairie isnt just an eruption on the prairie as i thought first but as large as new york in new york i wouldnt know more than forty or fifty people and i know that many here go on say what youre thinking  well my dear if i did take all your notions seriously it would be pretty discouraging imagine how a person would feel after working hard for years and helping to build up a nice town to have you airily flit in and simply say rotten think thats fair  why not it must be just as discouraging for the gopher prairieite to see venice and make comparisons  it would not i imagine gondolas are kind of nice to ride in but weve got better bathrooms butmy dear youre not the only person in this town who has done some thinking for herself although pardon my rudeness im afraid you think so ill admit we lack some things maybe our theater isnt as good as shows in paris all right i dont want to see any foreign culture suddenly forced on uswhether its streetplanning or tablemanners or crazy communistic ideas  vida sketched what she termed practical things that will make a happier and prettier town but that do belong to our life that actually are being done of the thanatopsis club she spoke of the restroom the fight against mosquitos the campaign for more gardens and shadetrees and sewersmatters not fantastic and nebulous and distant but immediate and sure  carols answer was fantastic and nebulous enough  yes    yes    i know theyre good but if i could put through all those reforms at once id still want startling exotic things life is comfortable and clean enough here already and so secure what it needs is to be less secure more eager the civic improvements which id like the thanatopsis to advocate are strindberg plays and classic dancersexquisite legs beneath tulleand i can see him so clearly a thick blackbearded cynical frenchman who would sit about and drink and sing opera and tell bawdy stories and laugh at our proprieties and quote rabelais and not be ashamed to kiss my hand  huh not sure about the rest of it but i guess thats what you and all the other discontented young women really want some stranger kissing your hand at carols gasp the old squirrellike vida darted out and cried oh my dear dont take that too seriously i just meant  i know you just meant it go on be good for my soul isnt it funny here we all areme trying to be good for gopher prairies soul and gopher prairie trying to be good for my soul what are my other sins  oh theres plenty of them possibly some day we shall have your fat cynical frenchman horrible sneering tobaccostained object ruining his brains and his digestion with vile liquor but thank heaven for a while well manage to keep busy with our lawns and pavements you see these things really are coming the thanatopsis is getting somewhere and you her tone italicized the wordsto my great disappointment are doing less not more than the people you laugh at sam clark on the schoolboard is working for better school ventilation ella stowbody whose elocuting you always think is so absurd has persuaded the railroad to share the expense of a parked space at the station to do away with that vacant lot  you sneer so easily im sorry but i do think theres something essentially cheap in your attitude especially about religion  if you must know youre not a sound reformer at all youre an impossibilist and you give up too easily you gave up on the new city hall the antifly campaign club papers the libraryboard the dramatic associationjust because we didnt graduate into ibsen the very first thing you want perfection all at once do you know what the finest thing youve done isaside from bringing hugh into the world it was the help you gave dr will during babywelfare week you didnt demand that each baby be a philosopher and artist before you weighed him as you do with the rest of us  and now im afraid perhaps ill hurt you were going to have a new schoolbuilding in this townin just a few yearsand well have it without one bit of help or interest from you  professor mott and i and some others have been dinging away at the moneyed men for years we didnt call on you because you would never stand the poundpoundpounding year after year without one bit of encouragement and weve won ive got the promise of everybody who counts that just as soon as warconditions permit theyll vote the bonds for the schoolhouse and well have a wonderful buildinglovely brown brick with big windows and agricultural and manualtraining departments when we get it thatll be my answer to all your theories  im glad and im ashamed i havent had any part in getting it butplease dont think im unsympathetic if i ask one question will the teachers in the hygienic new building go on informing the children that persia is a yellow spot on the map and caesar the title of a book of grammatical puzzles   viii   vida was indignant carol was apologetic they talked for another hour the eternal mary and marthaan immoralist mary and a reformist martha it was vida who conquered  the fact that she had been left out of the campaign for the new schoolbuilding disconcerted carol she laid her dreams of perfection aside when vida asked her to take charge of a group of camp fire girls she obeyed and had definite pleasure out of the indian dances and ritual and costumes she went more regularly to the thanatopsis with vida as lieutenant and unofficial commander she campaigned for a village nurse to attend poor families raised the fund herself saw to it that the nurse was young and strong and amiable and intelligent  yet all the while she beheld the burly cynical frenchman and the diaphanous dancers as clearly as the child sees its airborn playmates she relished the camp fire girls not because in vidas words this scout training will help so much to make them good wives but because she hoped that the sioux dances would bring subversive color into their dinginess  she helped ella stowbody to set out plants in the tiny triangular park at the railroad station she squatted in the dirt with a small curved trowel and the most decorous of gardening gauntlets she talked to ella about the publicspiritedness of fuchsias and cannas and she felt that she was scrubbing a temple deserted by the gods and empty even of incense and the sound of chanting passengers looking from trains saw her as a village woman of fading prettiness incorruptible virtue and no abnormalities the baggageman heard her say oh yes i do think it will be a good example for the children and all the while she saw herself running garlanded through the streets of babylon  planting led her to botanizing she never got much farther than recognizing the tiger lily and the wild rose but she rediscovered hugh what does the buttercup say mummy he cried his hand full of straggly grasses his cheek gilded with pollen she knelt to embrace him she affirmed that he made life more than full she was altogether reconciled    for an hour  but she awoke at night to hovering death she crept away from the hump of bedding that was kennicott tiptoed into the bathroom and by the mirror in the door of the medicinecabinet examined her pallid face  wasnt she growing visibly older in ratio as vida grew plumper and younger wasnt her nose sharper wasnt her neck granulated she stared and choked she was only thirty but the five years since her marriagehad they not gone by as hastily and stupidly as though she had been under ether would time not slink past till death she pounded her fist on the cool enameled rim of the bathtub and raged mutely against the indifferent gods  i dont care i wont endure it they lie sovida and will and aunt bessiethey tell me i ought to be satisfied with hugh and a good home and planting seven nasturtiums in a station garden i am i when i die the world will be annihilated as far as im concerned i am i im not content to leave the sea and the ivory towers to others i want them for me damn vida damn all of them do they think they can make me believe that a display of potatoes at howland  goulds is enough beauty and strangeness    chapter xxiii  i  when america entered the great european war vida sent raymie off to an officers trainingcampless than a year after her wedding raymie was diligent and rather strong he came out a first lieutenant of infantry and was one of the earliest sent abroad  carol grew definitely afraid of vida as vida transferred the passion which had been released in marriage to the cause of the war as she lost all tolerance when carol was touched by the desire for heroism in raymie and tried tactfully to express it vida made her feel like an impertinent child  by enlistment and draft the sons of lyman cass nat hicks sam clark joined the army but most of the soldiers were the sons of german and swedish farmers unknown to carol dr terry gould and dr mcganum became captains in the medical corps and were stationed at camps in iowa and georgia they were the only officers besides raymie from the gopher prairie district kennicott wanted to go with them but the several doctors of the town forgot medical rivalry and meeting in council decided that he would do better to wait and keep the town well till he should be needed kennicott was fortytwo now the only youngish doctor left in a radius of eighteen miles old dr westlake who loved comfort like a cat protestingly rolled out at night for country calls and hunted through his collarbox for his g a r button  carol did not quite know what she thought about kennicotts going certainly she was no spartan wife she knew that he wanted to go she knew that this longing was always in him behind his unchanged trudging and remarks about the weather she felt for him an admiring affectionand she was sorry that she had nothing more than affection  cy bogart was the spectacular warrior of the town cy was no longer the weedy boy who had sat in the loft speculating about carols egotism and the mysteries of generation he was nineteen now tall broad busy the town sport famous for his ability to drink beer to shake dice to tell undesirable stories and from his post in front of dyers drug store to embarrass the girls by jollying them as they passed his face was at once peachbloomed and pimply  cy was to be heard publishing it abroad that if he couldnt get the widow bogarts permission to enlist hed run away and enlist without it he shouted that he hated every dirty hun by gosh if he could just poke a bayonet into one big fat heinie and learn him some decency and democracy hed die happy cy got much reputation by whipping a farmboy named adolph pochbauer for being a damn hyphenated german    this was the younger pochbauer who was killed in the argonne while he was trying to bring the body of his yankee captain back to the lines at this time cy bogart was still dwelling in gopher prairie and planning to go to war   ii   everywhere carol heard that the war was going to bring a basic change in psychology to purify and uplift everything from marital relations to national politics and she tried to exult in it only she did not find it she saw the women who made bandages for the red cross giving up bridge and laughing at having to do without sugar but over the surgicaldressings they did not speak of god and the souls of men but of miles bjornstams impudence of terry goulds scandalous carryingson with a farmers daughter four years ago of cooking cabbage and of altering blouses their references to the war touched atrocities only she herself was punctual and efficient at making dressings but she could not like mrs lyman cass and mrs bogart fill the dressings with hate for enemies  when she protested to vida the young do the work while these old ones sit around and interrupt us and gag with hate because theyre too feeble to do anything but hate then vida turned on her  if you cant be reverent at least dont be so pert and opinionated now when men and women are dying some of uswe have given up so much and were glad to at least we expect that you others shant try to be witty at our expense  there was weeping  carol did desire to see the prussian autocracy defeated she did persuade herself that there were no autocracies save that of prussia she did thrill to motionpictures of troops embarking in new york and she was uncomfortable when she met miles bjornstam on the street and he croaked  hows tricks things going fine with me got two new cows well have you become a patriot eh sure theyll bring democracythe democracy of death yes sure in every war since the garden of eden the workmen have gone out to fight each other for perfectly good reasonshanded to them by their bosses now me im wise im so wise that i know i dont know anything about the war  it was not a thought of the war that remained with her after miless declamation but a perception that she and vida and all of the goodintentioners who wanted to do something for the common people were insignificant because the common people were able to do things for themselves and highly likely to as soon as they learned the fact the conception of millions of workmen like miles taking control frightened her and she scuttled rapidly away from the thought of a time when she might no longer retain the position of lady bountiful to the bjornstams and beas and oscarinas whom she lovedand patronized   iii   it was in june two months after americas entrance into the war that the momentous event happenedthe visit of the great percy bresnahan the millionaire president of the velvet motor car company of boston the one native son who was always to be mentioned to strangers  for two weeks there were rumors sam clark cried to kennicott say i hear perce bresnahan is coming by golly itll be great to see the old scout eh finally the dauntless printed on the front page with a no 1 head a letter from bresnahan to jackson elder  dear jack  well jack i find i can make it im to go to washington as a dollar a year man for the government in the aviation motor section and tell them how much i dont know about carburetors but before i start in being a hero i want to shoot out and catch me a big black bass and cuss out you and sam clark and harry haydock and will kennicott and the rest of you pirates ill land in g p on june 7 on no 7 from mpls shake a dayday tell bert tybee to save me a glass of beer  sincerely yours  perce    all members of the social financial scientific literary and sporting sets were at no 7 to meet bresnahan mrs lyman cass was beside del snafflin the barber and juanita haydock almost cordial to miss villets the librarian carol saw bresnahan laughing down at them from the train vestibulebig immaculate overjawed with the eye of an executive in the voice of the professional good fellow he bellowed howdy folks as she was introduced to him not he to her bresnahan looked into her eyes and his handshake was warm unhurried  he declined the offers of motors he walked off his arm about the shoulder of nat hicks the sporting tailor with the elegant harry haydock carrying one of his enormous pale leather bags del snafflin the other jack elder bearing an overcoat and julius flickerbaugh the fishingtackle carol noted that though bresnahan wore spats and a stick no small boy jeered she decided i must have will get a doublebreasted blue coat and a wing collar and a dotted bowtie like his  that evening when kennicott was trimming the grass along the walk with sheepshears bresnahan rolled up alone he was now in corduroy trousers khaki shirt open at the throat a white boating hat and marvelous canvasandleather shoes on the job there old will say my lord this is living to come back and get into a regular mansized pair of pants they can talk all they want to about the city but my idea of a good time is to loaf around and see you boys and catch a gamey bass  he hustled up the walk and blared at carol wheres that little fellow i hear youve got one fine big heboy that youre holding out on me  hes gone to bed rather briefly  i know and rules are rules these days kids get routed through the shop like a motor but look here sister im one great hand at busting rules come on now let uncle perce have a look at him please now sister  he put his arm about her waist it was a large strong sophisticated arm and very agreeable he grinned at her with a devastating knowingness while kennicott glowed inanely she flushed she was alarmed by the ease with which the bigcity man invaded her guarded personality she was glad in retreat to scamper ahead of the two men upstairs to the hallroom in which hugh slept all the way kennicott muttered well well say gee whittakers but its good to have you back certainly is good to see you  hugh lay on his stomach making an earnest business of sleeping he burrowed his eyes in the dwarf blue pillow to escape the electric light then sat up abruptly small and frail in his woolly nightdrawers his floss of brown hair wild the pillow clutched to his breast he wailed he stared at the stranger in a manner of patient dismissal he explained confidentially to carol daddy wouldnt let it be morning yet what does the pillow say  bresnahan dropped his arm caressingly on carols shoulder he pronounced my lord youre a lucky girl to have a fine young husk like that i figure will knew what he was doing when he persuaded you to take a chance on an old bum like him they tell me you come from st paul were going to get you to come to boston some day he leaned over the bed young man youre the slickest sight ive seen this side of boston with your permission may we present you with a slight token of our regard and appreciation of your long service  he held out a red rubber pierrot hugh remarked gimme it hid it under the bedclothes and stared at bresnahan as though he had never seen the man before  for once carol permitted herself the spiritual luxury of not asking why hugh dear what do you say when some one gives you a present the great man was apparently waiting they stood in inane suspense till bresnahan led them out rumbling how about planning a fishingtrip will  he remained for half an hour always he told carol what a charming person she was always he looked at her knowingly  yes he probably would make a woman fall in love with him but it wouldnt last a week id get tired of his confounded buoyancy his hypocrisy hes a spiritual bully he makes me rude to him in selfdefense oh yes he is glad to be here he does like us hes so good an actor that he convinces his own self    id hate him in boston hed have all the obvious bigcity things limousines discreet eveningclothes order a clever dinner at a smart restaurant drawingroom decorated by the best firmbut the pictures giving him away id rather talk to guy pollock in his dusty office    how i lie his arm coaxed my shoulder and his eyes dared me not to admire him id be afraid of him i hate him    oh the inconceivable egotistic imagination of women all this stew of analysis about a man a good decent friendly efficient man because he was kind to me as wills wife   iv   the kennicotts the elders the clarks and bresnahan went fishing at red squaw lake they drove forty miles to the lake in elders new cadillac there was much laughter and bustle at the start much storing of lunchbaskets and jointed poles much inquiry as to whether it would really bother carol to sit with her feet up on a roll of shawls when they were ready to go mrs clark lamented oh sam i forgot my magazine and bresnahan bullied come on now if you women think youre going to be literary you cant go with us tough guys every one laughed a great deal and as they drove on mrs clark explained that though probably she would not have read it still she might have wanted to while the other girls had a nap in the afternoon and she was right in the middle of a serialit was an awfully exciting storyit seems that this girl was a turkish dancer only she was really the daughter of an american lady and a russian prince and men kept running after her just disgustingly but she remained pure and there was a scene  while the men floated on the lake casting for black bass the women prepared lunch and yawned carol was a little resentful of the manner in which the men assumed that they did not care to fish i dont want to go with them but i would like the privilege of refusing  the lunch was long and pleasant it was a background for the talk of the great man come home hints of cities and large imperative affairs and famous people jocosely modest admissions that yes their friend perce was doing about as well as most of these boston swells that think so much of themselves because they come from rich old families and went to college and everything believe me its us new business men that are running beantown today and not a lot of fussy old bucks snoozing in their clubs  carol realized that he was not one of the sons of gopher prairie who if they do not actually starve in the east are invariably spoken of as highly successful and she found behind his too incessant flattery a genuine affection for his mates it was in the matter of the war that he most favored and thrilled them dropping his voice while they bent nearer there was no one within two miles to overhear he disclosed the fact that in both boston and washington hed been getting a lot of inside stuff on the warright straight from headquartershe was in touch with some mencouldnt name them but they were darn high up in both the war and state departmentsand he would sayonly for petes sake they mustnt breathe one word of this it was strictly on the qt and not generally known outside of washingtonbut just between ourselvesand they could take this for gospelspain had finally decided to join the entente allies in the grand scrap yes sir thered be two million fully equipped spanish soldiers fighting with us in france in one month now some surprise for germany all right  how about the prospects for revolution in germany reverently asked kennicott  the authority grunted nothing to it the one thing you can bet on is that no matter what happens to the german people win or lose theyll stick by the kaiser till hell freezes over i got that absolutely straight from a fellow whos on the inside of the inside in washington no sir i dont pretend to know much about international affairs but one thing you can put down as settled is that germany will be a hohenzollern empire for the next forty years at that i dont know as its so bad the kaiser and the junkers keep a firm hand on a lot of these red agitators whod be worse than a king if they could get control  im terribly interested in this uprising that overthrew the czar in russia suggested carol she had finally been conquered by the mans wizard knowledge of affairs  kennicott apologized for her carries nuts about this russian revolution is there much to it perce  there is not bresnahan said flatly i can speak by the book there carol honey im surprised to find you talking like a new york russian jew or one of these longhairs i can tell you only you dont need to let every one in on it this is confidential i got it from a man whos close to the state department but as a matter of fact the czar will be back in power before the end of the year you read a lot about his retiring and about his being killed but i know hes got a big army back of him and hell show these damn agitators lazy beggars hunting for a soft berth bossing the poor goats that fall for em hell show em where they get off  carol was sorry to hear that the czar was coming back but she said nothing the others had looked vacant at the mention of a country so far away as russia now they edged in and asked bresnahan what he thought about the packard car investments in texas oilwells the comparative merits of young men born in minnesota and in massachusetts the question of prohibition the future cost of motor tires and wasnt it true that american aviators put it all over these frenchmen  they were glad to find that he agreed with them on every point  as she heard bresnahan announce were perfectly willing to talk to any committee the men may choose but were not going to stand for some outside agitator butting in and telling us how were going to run our plant carol remembered that jackson elder now meekly receiving new ideas had said the same thing in the same words  while sam clark was digging up from his memory a long and immensely detailed story of the crushing things he had said to a pullman porter named george bresnahan hugged his knees and rocked and watched carol she wondered if he did not understand the laboriousness of the smile with which she listened to kennicotts account of the good one he had on carrie that marital coyly improper tentimestold tale of how she had forgotten to attend to hugh because she was all het up pounding the boxwhich may be translated as eagerly playing the piano she was certain that bresnahan saw through her when she pretended not to hear kennicotts invitation to join a game of cribbage she feared the comments he might make she was irritated by her fear  she was equally irritated when the motor returned through gopher prairie to find that she was proud of sharing in bresnahans kudos as people waved and juanita haydock leaned from a window she said to herself as though i cared whether im seen with this fat phonograph and simultaneously everybody has noticed how much will and i are playing with mr bresnahan  the town was full of his stories his friendliness his memory for names his clothes his troutflies his generosity he had given a hundred dollars to father klubok the priest and a hundred to the reverend mr zitterel the baptist minister for americanization work  at the bon ton carol heard nat hicks the tailor exulting  old perce certainly pulled a good one on this fellow bjornstam that always is shooting off his mouth hes supposed to of settled down since he got married but lord those fellows that think they know it all they never change well the red swede got the grand razz handed to him all right he had the nerve to breeze up to perce at dave dyers and he said he said to perce ive always wanted to look at a man that was so useful that folks would pay him a million dollars for existing and perce gave him the onceover and come right back have eh he says well he says ive been looking for a man so useful sweeping floors that i could pay him four dollars a day want the job my friend ha ha ha say you know how lippy bjornstam is well for once he didnt have a thing to say he tried to get fresh and tell what a rotten town this is and perce come right back at him if you dont like this country you better get out of it and go back to germany where you belong say maybe us fellows didnt give bjornstam the horselaugh though oh perce is the whitehaired boy in this burg all rightee   v   bresnahan had borrowed jackson elders motor he stopped at the kennicotts he bawled at carol rocking with hugh on the porch better come for a ride  she wanted to snub him thanks so much but im being maternal  bring him along bring him along bresnahan was out of the seat stalking up the sidewalk and the rest of her protests and dignities were feeble  she did not bring hugh along  bresnahan was silent for a mile in words but he looked at her as though he meant her to know that he understood everything she thought  she observed how deep was his chest  lovely fields over there he said  you really like them theres no profit in them  he chuckled sister you cant get away with it im onto you you consider me a big bluff well maybe i am but so are you my dearand pretty enough so that id try to make love to you if i werent afraid youd slap me  mr bresnahan do you talk that way to your wifes friends and do you call them sister  as a matter of fact i do and i make em like it score two but his chuckle was not so rotund and he was very attentive to the ammeter  in a moment he was cautiously attacking thats a wonderful boy will kennicott great work these country practitioners are doing the other day in washington i was talking to a big scientific shark a professor in johns hopkins medical school and he was saying that no one has ever sufficiently appreciated the general practitioner and the sympathy and help he gives folks these crack specialists the young scientific fellows theyre so cocksure and so wrapped up in their laboratories that they miss the human element except in the case of a few freak diseases that no respectable human being would waste his time having its the old doc that keeps a community well mind and body and strikes me that will is one of the steadiest and clearestheaded counter practitioners ive ever met eh  im sure he is hes a servant of reality  come again um yes all of that whatever that is    say child you dont care a whole lot for gopher prairie if im not mistaken  nope  theres where youre missing a big chance theres nothing to these cities believe me i know this is a good town as they go youre lucky to be here i wish i could shy on  very well why dont you  huh whylordcant get away fr  you dont have to stay i do so i want to change it do you know that men like you prominent men do quite a reasonable amount of harm by insisting that your native towns and native states are perfect its you who encourage the denizens not to change they quote you and go on believing that they live in paradise and she clenched her fist the incredible dullness of it  suppose you were right even so dont you think you waste a lot of thundering on one poor scared little town kind of mean  i tell you its dull dull  the folks dont find it dull these couples like the haydocks have a high old time dances and cards  they dont theyre bored almost every one here is vacuousness and bad manners and spiteful gossipthats what i hate  those thingscourse theyre here so are they in boston and every place else why the faults you find in this town are simply human nature and never will be changed  perhaps but in a boston all the good carols ill admit i have no faults can find one another and play but hereim alone in a stale poolexcept as its stirred by the great mr bresnahan  my lord to hear you tell it a fellow d think that all the denizens as you impolitely call em are so confoundedly unhappy that its a wonder they dont all up and commit suicide but they seem to struggle along somehow  they dont know what they miss and anybody can endure anything look at men in mines and in prisons  he drew up on the south shore of lake minniemashie he glanced across the reeds reflected on the water the quiver of wavelets like crumpled tinfoil the distant shores patched with dark woods silvery oats and deep yellow wheat he patted her hand siscarol youre a darling girl but youre difficult know what i think  yes  humph maybe you do butmy humble not too humble opinion is that you like to be different you like to think youre peculiar why if you knew how many tens of thousands of women especially in new york say just what you do youd lose all the fun of thinking youre a lone genius and youd be on the bandwagon whooping it up for gopher prairie and a good decent family life theres always about a million young women just out of college who want to teach their grandmothers how to suck eggs  how proud you are of that homely rustic metaphor you use it at banquets and directors meetings and boast of your climb from a humble homestead  huh you may have my number im not telling but look here youre so prejudiced against gopher prairie that you overshoot the mark you antagonize those who might be inclined to agree with you in some particulars butgreat guns the town cant be all wrong  no it isnt but it could be let me tell you a fable imagine a cavewoman complaining to her mate she doesnt like one single thing she hates the damp cave the rats running over her bare legs the stiff skin garments the eating of halfraw meat her husbands bushy face the constant battles and the worship of the spirits who will hoodoo her unless she gives the priests her best claw necklace her man protests but it cant all be wrong and he thinks he has reduced her to absurdity now you assume that a world which produces a percy bresnahan and a velvet motor company must be civilized it is arent we only about halfway along in barbarism i suggest mrs bogart as a test and well continue in barbarism just as long as people as nearly intelligent as you continue to defend things as they are because they are  youre a fair spieler child but by golly id like to see you try to design a new manifold or run a factory and keep a lot of your fellow reds from czechslovenskimagyargodknowswheria on the job youd drop your theories so darn quick im not any defender of things as they are sure theyre rotten only im sensible  he preached his gospel love of outdoors playing the game loyalty to friends she had the neophytes shock of discovery that outside of tracts conservatives do not tremble and find no answer when an iconoclast turns on them but retort with agility and confusing statistics  he was so much the man the worker the friend that she liked him when she most tried to stand out against him he was so much the successful executive that she did not want him to despise her his manner of sneering at what he called parlor socialists though the phrase was not overwhelmingly new had a power which made her wish to placate his company of wellfed speedloving administrators when he demanded would you like to associate with nothing but a lot of turkeynecked hornspectacled nuts that have adenoids and need a haircut and that spend all their time kicking about conditions and never do a lick of work she said no but just the same when he asserted even if your cavewoman was right in knocking the whole works i bet some redblooded regular fellow some real heman found her a nice dry cave and not any whining criticizing radical she wriggled her head feebly between a nod and a shake  his large hands sensual lips easy voice supported his selfconfidence he made her feel young and softas kennicott had once made her feel she had nothing to say when he bent his powerful head and experimented my dear im sorry im going away from this town youd be a darling child to play with you are pretty some day in boston ill show you how we buy a lunch well hang it got to be starting back  the only answer to his gospel of beef which she could find when she was home was a wail of but just the same  she did not see him again before he departed for washington  his eyes remained his glances at her lips and hair and shoulders had revealed to her that she was not a wifeandmother alone but a girl that there still were men in the world as there had been in college days  that admiration led her to study kennicott to tear at the shroud of intimacy to perceive the strangeness of the most familiar    chapter xxiv  i  all that midsummer month carol was sensitive to kennicott she recalled a hundred grotesqueries her comic dismay at his having chewed tobacco the evening when she had tried to read poetry to him matters which had seemed to vanish with no trace or sequence always she repeated that he had been heroically patient in his desire to join the army she made much of her consoling affection for him in little things she liked the homeliness of his tinkering about the house his strength and handiness as he tightened the hinges of a shutter his boyishness when he ran to her to be comforted because he had found rust in the barrel of his pumpgun but at the highest he was to her another hugh without the glamor of hughs unknown future  there was late in june a day of heatlightning  because of the work imposed by the absence of the other doctors the kennicotts had not moved to the lake cottage but remained in town dusty and irritable in the afternoon when she went to oleson  mcguires formerly dahl  olesons carol was vexed by the assumption of the youthful clerk recently come from the farm that he had to be neighborly and rude he was no more brusquely familiar than a dozen other clerks of the town but her nerves were heatscorched  when she asked for codfish for supper he grunted what dyou want that darned old dry stuff for  i like it  punk guess the doc can afford something better than that try some of the new wienies we got in swell the haydocks use em  she exploded my dear young man it is not your duty to instruct me in housekeeping and it doesnt particularly concern me what the haydocks condescend to approve  he was hurt he hastily wrapped up the leprous fragment of fish he gaped as she trailed out she lamented i shouldnt have spoken so he didnt mean anything he doesnt know when he is being rude  her repentance was not proof against uncle whittier when she stopped in at his grocery for salt and a package of safety matches uncle whittier in a shirt collarless and soaked with sweat in a brown streak down his back was whining at a clerk come on now get a hustle on and lug that pound cake up to mis casss some folks in this town think a storekeeper aint got nothing to do but chase out phoneorders    hello carrie that dress you got on looks kind of low in the neck to me may be decent and modesti suppose im oldfashionedbut i never thought much of showing the whole town a womans bust hee hee hee    afternoon mrs hicks sage just out of it lemme sell you some other spices heh uncle whittier was nasally indignant certainly got plenty other spices jus good as sage for any purpse whatever whats the matter withwell with allspice when mrs hicks had gone he raged some folks dont know what they want  sweating sanctimonious bullymy husbands uncle thought carol  she crept into dave dyers dave held up his arms with dont shoot i surrender she smiled but it occurred to her that for nearly five years dave had kept up this game of pretending that she threatened his life  as she went dragging through the pricklyhot street she reflected that a citizen of gopher prairie does not have jestshe has a jest every cold morning for five winters lyman cass had remarked fair to middlin chillyget worse before it gets better fifty times had ezra stowbody informed the public that carol had once asked shall i indorse this check on the back fifty times had sam clark called to her whered you steal that hat fifty times had the mention of barney cahoon the town drayman like a nickel in a slot produced from kennicott the apocryphal story of barneys directing a minister come down to the depot and get your case of religious bookstheyre leaking  she came home by the unvarying route she knew every housefront every streetcrossing every billboard every tree every dog she knew every blackened bananaskin and empty cigarettebox in the gutters she knew every greeting when jim howland stopped and gaped at her there was no possibility that he was about to confide anything but his grudging well haryuh tday  all her future life this same redlabeled breadcrate in front of the bakery this same thimbleshaped crack in the sidewalk a quarter of a block beyond stowbodys granite hitchingpost  she silently handed her purchases to the silent oscarina she sat on the porch rocking fanning twitchy with hughs whining  kennicott came home grumbled what the devil is the kid yapping about  i guess you can stand it ten minutes if i can stand it all day  he came to supper in his shirt sleeves his vest partly open revealing discolored suspenders  why dont you put on your nice palm beach suit and take off that hideous vest she complained  too much trouble too hot to go upstairs  she realized that for perhaps a year she had not definitely looked at her husband she regarded his tablemanners he violently chased fragments of fish about his plate with a knife and licked the knife after gobbling them she was slightly sick she asserted im ridiculous what do these things matter dont be so simple but she knew that to her they did matter these solecisms and mixed tenses of the table  she realized that they found little to say that incredibly they were like the talkedout couples whom she had pitied at restaurants  bresnahan would have spouted in a lively exciting unreliable manner  she realized that kennicotts clothes were seldom pressed his coat was wrinkled his trousers would flap at the knees when he arose his shoes were unblacked and they were of an elderly shapelessness he refused to wear soft hats cleaved to a hard derby as a symbol of virility and prosperity and sometimes he forgot to take it off in the house she peeped at his cuffs they were frayed in prickles of starched linen she had turned them once she clipped them every week but when she had begged him to throw the shirt away last sunday morning at the crisis of the weekly bath he had uneasily protested oh itll wear quite a while yet  he was shaved by himself or more socially by del snafflin only three times a week this morning had not been one of the three times  yet he was vain of his new turndown collars and sleek ties he often spoke of the sloppy dressing of dr mcganum and he laughed at old men who wore detachable cuffs or gladstone collars  carol did not care much for the creamed codfish that evening  she noted that his nails were jagged and illshaped from his habit of cutting them with a pocketknife and despising a nailfile as effeminate and urban that they were invariably clean that his were the scoured fingers of the surgeon made his stubborn untidiness the more jarring they were wise hands kind hands but they were not the hands of love  she remembered him in the days of courtship he had tried to please her then had touched her by sheepishly wearing a colored band on his straw hat was it possible that those days of fumbling for each other were gone so completely he had read books to impress her had said she recalled it ironically that she was to point out his every fault had insisted once as they sat in the secret place beneath the walls of fort snelling  she shut the door on her thoughts that was sacred ground but it was a shame that  she nervously pushed away her cake and stewed apricots  after supper when they had been driven in from the porch by mosquitos when kennicott had for the twohundredth time in five years commented we must have a new screen on the porchlets all the bugs in they sat reading and she noted and detested herself for noting and noted again his habitual awkwardness he slumped down in one chair his legs up on another and he explored the recesses of his left ear with the end of his little fingershe could hear the faint smackhe kept it uphe kept it up  he blurted oh forgot tell you some of the fellows coming in to play poker this evening suppose we could have some crackers and cheese and beer  she nodded  he might have mentioned it before oh well its his house  the pokerparty straggled in sam clark jack elder dave dyer jim howland to her they mechanically said devenin but to kennicott in a heroic male manner well well shall we start playing got a hunch im going to lick somebody real bad no one suggested that she join them she told herself that it was her own fault because she was not more friendly but she remembered that they never asked mrs sam clark to play  bresnahan would have asked her  she sat in the livingroom glancing across the hall at the men as they humped over the dining table  they were in shirt sleeves smoking chewing spitting incessantly lowering their voices for a moment so that she did not hear what they said and afterward giggling hoarsely using over and over the canonical phrases three to dole i raise you a finif come on now ante up what do you think this is a pink tea the cigarsmoke was acrid and pervasive the firmness with which the men mouthed their cigars made the lower part of their faces expressionless heavy unappealing they were like politicians cynically dividing appointments  how could they understand her world  did that faint and delicate world exist was she a fool she doubted her world doubted herself and was sick in the acid smokestained air  she slipped back into brooding upon the habituality of the house  kennicott was as fixed in routine as an isolated old man at first he had amorously deceived himself into liking her experiments with foodthe one medium in which she could express imaginationbut now he wanted only his round of favorite dishes steak roast beef boiled pigsfeet oatmeal baked apples because at some more flexible period he had advanced from oranges to grapefruit he considered himself an epicure  during their first autumn she had smiled over his affection for his huntingcoat but now that the leather had come unstitched in dribbles of pale yellow thread and tatters of canvas smeared with dirt of the fields and grease from guncleaning hung in a border of rags she hated the thing  wasnt her whole life like that huntingcoat  she knew every nick and brown spot on each piece of the set of china purchased by kennicotts mother in 1895discreet china with a pattern of washedout forgetmenots rimmed with blurred gold the gravyboat in a saucer which did not match the solemn and evangelical covered vegetabledishes the two platters  twenty times had kennicott sighed over the fact that bea had broken the other platterthe mediumsized one  the kitchen  damp black iron sink damp whiteyyellow drainboard with shreds of discolored wood which from long scrubbing were as soft as cotton thread warped table alarm clock stove bravely blackened by oscarina but an abomination in its loose doors and broken drafts and oven that never would keep an even heat  carol had done her best by the kitchen painted it white put up curtains replaced a sixyearold calendar by a color print she had hoped for tiling and a kerosene range for summer cooking but kennicott always postponed these expenses  she was better acquainted with the utensils in the kitchen than with vida sherwin or guy pollock the canopener whose soft gray metal handle was twisted from some ancient effort to pry open a window was more pertinent to her than all the cathedrals in europe and more significant than the future of asia was the neversettled weekly question as to whether the small kitchen knife with the unpainted handle or the secondbest buckhorn carvingknife was better for cutting up cold chicken for sunday supper   ii   she was ignored by the males till midnight her husband called suppose we could have some eats carrie as she passed through the diningroom the men smiled on her bellysmiles none of them noticed her while she was serving the crackers and cheese and sardines and beer they were determining the exact psychology of dave dyer in standing pat two hours before  when they were gone she said to kennicott your friends have the manners of a barroom they expect me to wait on them like a servant theyre not so much interested in me as they would be in a waiter because they dont have to tip me unfortunately well good night  so rarely did she nag in this petty hotweather fashion that he was astonished rather than angry hey wait whats the idea i must say i dont get you the boysbarroom why perce bresnahan was saying there isnt a finer bunch of royal good fellows anywhere than just the crowd that were here tonight  they stood in the lower hall he was too shocked to go on with his duties of locking the front door and winding his watch and the clock  bresnahan im sick of him she meant nothing in particular  why carrie hes one of the biggest men in the country boston just eats out of his hand  i wonder if it does how do we know but that in boston among wellbred people he may be regarded as an absolute lout the way he calls women sister and the way  now look here thatll do of course i know you dont mean ityoure simply hot and tired and trying to work off your peeve on me but just the same i wont stand your jumping on perce youits just like your attitude toward the warso darn afraid that america will become militaristic  but you are the pure patriot  by god i am  yes i heard you talking to sam clark tonight about ways of avoiding the income tax  he had recovered enough to lock the door he clumped upstairs ahead of her growling you dont know what youre talking about im perfectly willing to pay my full taxfact im in favor of the income taxeven though i do think its a penalty on frugality and enterprisefact its an unjust darnfool tax but just the same ill pay it only im not idiot enough to pay more than the government makes me pay and sam and i were just figuring out whether all automobile expenses oughnt to be exemptions ill take a lot off you carrie but i dont propose for one second to stand your saying im not patriotic you know mighty well and good that ive tried to get away and join the army and at the beginning of the whole fracas i saidive said right alongthat we ought to have entered the war the minute germany invaded belgium you dont get me at all you cant appreciate a mans work youre abnormal youve fussed so much with these fool novels and books and all this highbrow junkyou like to argue  it ended a quarter of an hour later in his calling her a neurotic before he turned away and pretended to sleep  for the first time they had failed to make peace  there are two races of people only two and they live side by side his calls mine neurotic mine calls his stupid well never understand each other never and its madness for us to debateto lie together in a hot bed in a creepy roomenemies yoked   iii   it clarified in her the longing for a place of her own  while its so hot i think ill sleep in the spare room she said next day  not a bad idea he was cheerful and kindly  the room was filled with a lumbering double bed and a cheap pine bureau she stored the bed in the attic replaced it by a cot which with a denim cover made a couch by day put in a dressingtable a rocker transformed by a cretonne cover had miles bjornstam build bookshelves  kennicott slowly understood that she meant to keep up her seclusion in his queries changing the whole room putting your books in there she caught his dismay but it was so easy once her door was closed to shut out his worry that hurt herthe ease of forgetting him  aunt bessie smail sleuthed out this anarchy she yammered why carrie you aint going to sleep all alone by yourself i dont believe in that married folks should have the same room of course dont go getting silly notions no telling what a thing like that might lead to suppose i up and told your uncle whit that i wanted a room of my own  carol spoke of recipes for cornpudding  but from mrs dr westlake she drew encouragement she had made an afternoon call on mrs westlake she was for the first time invited upstairs and found the suave old woman sewing in a white and mahogany room with a small bed  oh do you have your own royal apartments and the doctor his carol hinted  indeed i do the doctor says its bad enough to have to stand my temper at meals do mrs westlake looked at her sharply why dont you do the same thing  ive been thinking about it carol laughed in an embarrassed way then you wouldnt regard me as a complete hussy if i wanted to be by myself now and then  why child every woman ought to get off by herself and turn over her thoughtsabout children and god and how bad her complexion is and the way men dont really understand her and how much work she finds to do in the house and how much patience it takes to endure some things in a mans love  yes carol said it in a gasp her hands twisted together she wanted to confess not only her hatred for the aunt bessies but her covert irritation toward those she best loved her alienation from kennicott her disappointment in guy pollock her uneasiness in the presence of vida she had enough selfcontrol to confine herself to yes men the dear blundering souls we do have to get off and laugh at them  of course we do not that you have to laugh at dr kennicott so much but my man heavens now theres a rare old bird reading storybooks when he ought to be tending to business marcus westlake i say to him youre a romantic old fool and does he get angry he does not he chuckles and says yes my beloved folks do say that married people grow to resemble each other drat him mrs westlake laughed comfortably  after such a disclosure what could carol do but return the courtesy by remarking that as for kennicott he wasnt romantic enoughthe darling before she left she had babbled to mrs westlake her dislike for aunt bessie the fact that kennicotts income was now more than five thousand a year her view of the reason why vida had married raymie which included some thoroughly insincere praise of raymies kind heart her opinion of the libraryboard just what kennicott had said about mrs carthals diabetes and what kennicott thought of the several surgeons in the cities  she went home soothed by confession inspirited by finding a new friend   iv   the tragicomedy of the domestic situation  oscarina went back home to help on the farm and carol had a succession of maids with gaps between the lack of servants was becoming one of the most cramping problems of the prairie town increasingly the farmers daughters rebelled against village dullness and against the unchanged attitude of the juanitas toward hired girls they went off to city kitchens or to city shops and factories that they might be free and even human after hours  the jolly seventeen were delighted at carols desertion by the loyal oscarina they reminded her that she had said i dont have any trouble with maids see how oscarina stays on  between incumbencies of finn maids from the north woods germans from the prairies occasional swedes and norwegians and icelanders carol did her own workand endured aunt bessies skittering in to tell her how to dampen a broom for fluffy dust how to sugar doughnuts how to stuff a goose carol was deft and won shy praise from kennicott but as her shoulder blades began to sting she wondered how many millions of women had lied to themselves during the deathrimmed years through which they had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework  she doubted the convenience and as a natural sequent the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home which she had regarded as the basis of all decent life  she considered her doubts vicious she refused to remember how many of the women of the jolly seventeen nagged their husbands and were nagged by them  she energetically did not whine to kennicott but her eyes ached she was not the girl in breeches and a flannel shirt who had cooked over a campfire in the colorado mountains five years ago her ambition was to get to bed at nine her strongest emotion was resentment over rising at halfpast six to care for hugh the back of her neck ached as she got out of bed she was cynical about the joys of a simple laborious life she understood why workmen and workmens wives are not grateful to their kind employers  at midmorning when she was momentarily free from the ache in her neck and back she was glad of the reality of work the hours were living and nimble but she had no desire to read the eloquent little newspaper essays in praise of labor which are daily written by the whitebrowed journalistic prophets she felt independent and though she hid it a bit surly  in cleaning the house she pondered upon the maidsroom it was a slantroofed smallwindowed hole above the kitchen oppressive in summer frigid in winter she saw that while she had been considering herself an unusually good mistress she had been permitting her friends bea and oscarina to live in a sty she complained to kennicott whats the matter with it he growled as they stood on the perilous stairs dodging up from the kitchen she commented upon the sloping roof of unplastered boards stained in brown rings by the rain the uneven floor the cot and its tumbled discouragedlooking quilts the broken rocker the distorting mirror  maybe it aint any hotel radisson parlor but still its so much better than anything these hired girls are accustomed to at home that they think its fine seems foolish to spend money when they wouldnt appreciate it  but that night he drawled with the casualness of a man who wishes to be surprising and delightful carrie dont know but what we might begin to think about building a new house one of these days howd you like that  wwhy  im getting to the point now where i feel we can afford oneand a corker ill show this burg something like a real house well put one over on sam and harry make folks sit up an take notice  yes she said  he did not go on  daily he returned to the subject of the new house but as to time and mode he was indefinite at first she believed she babbled of a low stone house with lattice windows and tulipbeds of colonial brick of a white frame cottage with green shutters and dormer windows to her enthusiasms he answered well yees might be worth thinking about remember where i put my pipe when she pressed him he fidgeted i dont know seems to me those kind of houses you speak of have been overdone  it proved that what he wanted was a house exactly like sam clarks which was exactly like every third new house in every town in the country a square yellow stolidity with immaculate clapboards a broad screened porch tidy grassplots and concrete walks a house resembling the mind of a merchant who votes the party ticket straight and goes to church once a month and owns a good car  he admitted well yes maybe it isnt so darn artistic butmatter of fact though i dont want a place just like sams maybe i would cut off that fool tower hes got and i think probably it would look better painted a nice cream color that yellow on sams house is too kind of flashy then theres another kind of house thats mighty nice and substantiallooking with shingles in a nice brown stain instead of clapboardsseen some in minneapolis youre way off your base when you say i only like one kind of house  uncle whittier and aunt bessie came in one evening when carol was sleepily advocating a rosegarden cottage  youve had a lot of experience with housekeeping aunty and dont you think kennicott appealed that it would be sensible to have a nice square house and pay more attention to getting a crackajack furnace than to all this architecture and doodads  aunt bessie worked her lips as though they were an elastic band why of course i know how it is with young folks like you carrie you want towers and baywindows and pianos and heaven knows what all but the thing to get is closets and a good furnace and a handy place to hang out the washing and the rest dont matter  uncle whittier dribbled a little put his face near to carols and sputtered course it dont what dyou care what folks think about the outside of your house its the inside youre living in none of my business but i must say you young folks thatd rather have cakes than potatoes get me riled  she reached her room before she became savage below dreadfully near she could hear the broomswish of aunt bessies voice and the moppounding of uncle whittiers grumble she had a reasonless dread that they would intrude on her then a fear that she would yield to gopher prairies conception of duty toward an aunt bessie and go downstairs to be nice she felt the demand for standardized behavior coming in waves from all the citizens who sat in their sittingrooms watching her with respectable eyes waiting demanding unyielding she snarled oh all right ill go she powdered her nose straightened her collar and coldly marched downstairs the three elders ignored her they had advanced from the new house to agreeable general fussing aunt bessie was saying in a tone like the munching of dry toast  i do think mr stowbody ought to have had the rainpipe fixed at our store right away i went to see him on tuesday morning before ten no it was couple minutes after ten but anyway it was long before nooni know because i went right from the bank to the meat market to get some steakmy i think its outrageous the prices oleson  mcguire charge for their meat and it isnt as if they gave you a good cut either but just any old thing and i had time to get it and i stopped in at mrs bogarts to ask about her rheumatism  carol was watching uncle whittier she knew from his taut expression that he was not listening to aunt bessie but herding his own thoughts and that he would interrupt her bluntly he did  will where cn i get an extra pair of pants for this coat and vest d want to pay too much  well guess nat hicks could make you up a pair but if i were you id drop into ike rifkinshis prices are lower than the bon tons  humph got the new stove in your office yet  no been looking at some at sam clarks but  well y ought get t in dont do to put off getting a stove all summer and then have it come cold on you in the fall  carol smiled upon them ingratiatingly do you dears mind if i slip up to bed im rather tiredcleaned the upstairs today  she retreated she was certain that they were discussing her and foully forgiving her she lay awake till she heard the distant creak of a bed which indicated that kennicott had retired then she felt safe  it was kennicott who brought up the matter of the smails at breakfast with no visible connection he said uncle whit is kind of clumsy but just the same hes a pretty wise old coot hes certainly making good with the store  carol smiled and kennicott was pleased that she had come to her senses as whit says after all the first thing is to have the inside of a house right and darn the people on the outside looking in  it seemed settled that the house was to be a sound example of the sam clark school  kennicott made much of erecting it entirely for her and the baby he spoke of closets for her frocks and a comfy sewingroom but when he drew on a leaf from an old accountbook he was a papersaver and a stringpicker the plans for the garage he gave much more attention to a cement floor and a workbench and a gasolinetank than he had to sewingrooms  she sat back and was afraid  in the present rookery there were odd thingsa step up from the hall to the diningroom a picturesqueness in the shed and bedraggled lilac bush but the new place would be smooth standardized fixed it was probable now that kennicott was past forty and settled that this would be the last venture he would ever make in building so long as she stayed in this ark she would always have a possibility of change but once she was in the new house there she would sit for all the rest of her lifethere she would die desperately she wanted to put it off against the chance of miracles while kennicott was chattering about a patent swingdoor for the garage she saw the swingdoors of a prison  she never voluntarily returned to the project aggrieved kennicott stopped drawing plans and in ten days the new house was forgotten   v   every year since their marriage carol had longed for a trip through the east every year kennicott had talked of attending the american medical association convention and then afterwards we could do the east up brown i know new york clean throughspent pretty near a week therebut i would like to see new england and all these historic places and have some seafood he talked of it from february to may and in may he invariably decided that coming confinementcases or landdeals would prevent his getting away from homebase for very long this yearand no sense going till we can do it right  the weariness of dishwashing had increased her desire to go she pictured herself looking at emersons manse bathing in a surf of jade and ivory wearing a trottoir and a summer fur meeting an aristocratic stranger in the spring kennicott had pathetically volunteered spose youd like to get in a good long tour this summer but with gould and mac away and so many patients depending on me dont see how i can make it by golly i feel like a tightwad though not taking you through all this restless july after she had tasted bresnahans disturbing flavor of travel and gaiety she wanted to go but she said nothing they spoke of and postponed a trip to the twin cities when she suggested as though it were a tremendous joke i think baby and i might up and leave you and run off to cape cod by ourselves his only reaction was golly dont know but what you may almost have to do that if we dont get in a trip next year  toward the end of july he proposed say the beavers are holding a convention in joralemon street fair and everything we might go down tomorrow and id like to see dr calibree about some business put in the whole day might help some to make up for our trip fine fellow dr calibree  joralemon was a prairie town of the size of gopher prairie  their motor was out of order and there was no passengertrain at an early hour they went down by freighttrain after the weighty and conversational business of leaving hugh with aunt bessie carol was exultant over this irregular jaunting it was the first unusual thing except the glance of bresnahan that had happened since the weaning of hugh they rode in the caboose the small red cupolatopped car jerked along at the end of the train it was a roving shanty the cabin of a land schooner with black oilcloth seats along the side and for desk a pine board to be let down on hinges kennicott played sevenup with the conductor and two brakemen carol liked the blue silk kerchiefs about the brakemens throats she liked their welcome to her and their air of friendly independence since there were no sweating passengers crammed in beside her she reveled in the trains slowness she was part of these lakes and tawny wheatfields she liked the smell of hot earth and clean grease and the leisurely chugachug chugachug of the trucks was a song of contentment in the sun  she pretended that she was going to the rockies when they reached joralemon she was radiant with holidaymaking  her eagerness began to lessen the moment they stopped at a red frame station exactly like the one they had just left at gopher prairie and kennicott yawned right on time just in time for dinner at the calibrees i phoned the doctor from g p that wed be here well catch the freight that gets in before twelve i told him he said hed meet us at the depot and take us right up to the house for dinner calibree is a good man and youll find his wife is a mighty brainy little woman bright as a dollar by golly there he is  dr calibree was a squat cleanshaven conscientiouslooking man of forty he was curiously like his own brownpainted motor car with eyeglasses for windshield want you to meet my wife doctorcarrie make you quainted with dr calibree said kennicott calibree bowed quietly and shook her hand but before he had finished shaking it he was concentrating upon kennicott with nice to see you doctor say dont let me forget to ask you about what you did in that exopthalmic goiter casethat bohemian woman at wahkeenyan  the two men on the front seat of the car chanted goiters and ignored her she did not know it she was trying to feed her illusion of adventure by staring at unfamiliar houses    drab cottages artificial stone bungalows square painty stolidities with immaculate clapboards and broad screened porches and tidy grassplots  calibree handed her over to his wife a thick woman who called her dearie and asked if she was hot and visibly searching for conversation produced lets see you and the doctor have a little one havent you at dinner mrs calibree served the corned beef and cabbage and looked steamy looked like the steamy leaves of cabbage the men were oblivious of their wives as they gave the social passwords of main street the orthodox opinions on weather crops and motor cars then flung away restraint and gyrated in the debauch of shoptalk stroking his chin drawling in the ecstasy of being erudite kennicott inquired say doctor what success have you had with thyroid for treatment of pains in the legs before childbirth  carol did not resent their assumption that she was too ignorant to be admitted to masculine mysteries she was used to it but the cabbage and mrs calibrees monotonous i dont know what were coming to with all this difficulty getting hired girls were gumming her eyes with drowsiness she sought to clear them by appealing to calibree in a manner of exaggerated liveliness doctor have the medical societies in minnesota ever advocated legislation for help to nursing mothers  calibree slowly revolved toward her uhive neveruhnever looked into it i dont believe much in getting mixed up in politics he turned squarely from her and peering earnestly at kennicott resumed doctor whats been your experience with unilateral pyelonephritis buckburn of baltimore advocates decapsulation and nephrotomy but seems to me  not till after two did they rise in the lee of the stonily mature trio carol proceeded to the street fair which added mundane gaiety to the annual rites of the united and fraternal order of beavers beavers human beavers were everywhere thirtysecond degree beavers in gray sack suits and decent derbies more flippant beavers in crash summer coats and straw hats rustic beavers in shirt sleeves and frayed suspenders but whatever his castesymbols every beaver was distinguished by an enormous shrimpcolored ribbon lettered in silver sir knight and brother u f o b annual state convention on the motherly shirtwaist of each of their wives was a badge sir knights lady the duluth delegation had brought their famous beaver amateur band in zouave costumes of green velvet jacket blue trousers and scarlet fez the strange thing was that beneath their scarlet pride the zouaves faces remained those of american businessmen pink smooth eyeglassed and as they stood playing in a circle at the corner of main street and second as they tootled on fifes or with swelling cheeks blew into cornets their eyes remained as owlish as though they were sitting at desks under the sign this is my busy day  carol had supposed that the beavers were average citizens organized for the purposes of getting cheap lifeinsurance and playing poker at the lodgerooms every second wednesday but she saw a large poster which proclaimed       beavers      u f o b       the greatest influence for good citizenship in the      country  the jolliest aggregation of redblooded      openhanded hustleemup good fellows in the world      joralemon welcomes you to her hospitable city  kennicott read the poster and to calibree admired strong lodge the beavers never joined dont know but what i will  calibree adumbrated theyre a good bunch good strong lodge see that fellow there thats playing the snare drum hes the smartest wholesale grocer in duluth they say guess it would be worth joining oh say are you doing much insurance examining  they went on to the street fair  lining one block of main street were the attractionstwo hotdog stands a lemonade and popcorn stand a merrygoround and booths in which balls might be thrown at rag dolls if one wished to throw balls at rag dolls the dignified delegates were shy of the booths but country boys with brickred necks and paleblue ties and brightyellow shoes who had brought sweethearts into town in somewhat dusty and listed fords were wolfing sandwiches drinking strawberry pop out of bottles and riding the revolving crimson and gold horses they shrieked and giggled peanutroasters whistled the merrygoround pounded out monotonous music the barkers bawled heres your chanceheres your chancecome on here boycome on heregive that girl a good timegive her a swell timeheres your chance to win a genuwine gold watch for five cents half a dime the twentieth part of a dollah the prairie sun jabbed the unshaded street with shafts that were like poisonous thorns the tinny cornices above the brick stores were glaring the dull breeze scattered dust on sweaty beavers who crawled along in tight scorching new shoes up two blocks and back up two blocks and back wondering what to do next working at having a good time  carols head ached as she trailed behind the unsmiling calibrees along the block of booths she chirruped at kennicott lets be wild lets ride on the merrygoround and grab a gold ring  kennicott considered it and mumbled to calibree think you folks would like to stop and try a ride on the merrygoround  calibree considered it and mumbled to his wife think youd like to stop and try a ride on the merrygoround  mrs calibree smiled in a washedout manner and sighed oh no i dont believe i care to much but you folks go ahead and try it  calibree stated to kennicott no i dont believe we care to a whole lot but you folks go ahead and try it  kennicott summarized the whole case against wildness lets try it some other time carrie  she gave it up she looked at the town she saw that in adventuring from main street gopher prairie to main street joralemon she had not stirred there were the same twostory brick groceries with lodgesigns above the awnings the same onestory wooden millinery shop the same firebrick garages the same prairie at the open end of the wide street the same people wondering whether the levity of eating a hotdog sandwich would break their taboos  they reached gopher prairie at nine in the evening  you look kind of hot said kennicott  yes  joralemon is an enterprising town dont you think so she broke no i think its an ashheap  why carrie  he worried over it for a week while he ground his plate with his knife as he energetically pursued fragments of bacon he peeped at her    chapter xxv  carries all right shes finicky but shell get over it but i wish shed hurry up about it what she cant understand is that a fellow practising medicine in a small town like this has got to cut out the highbrow stuff and not spend all his time going to concerts and shining his shoes not but what he might be just as good at all these intellectual and art things as some other folks if he had the time for it dr will kennicott was brooding in his office during a free moment toward the end of the summer afternoon he hunched down in his tilted deskchair undid a button of his shirt glanced at the state news in the back of the journal of the american medical association dropped the magazine leaned back with his right thumb hooked in the armhole of his vest and his left thumb stroking the back of his hair  by golly shes taking an awful big chance though youd expect her to learn by and by that i wont be a parlor lizard she says we try to make her over well shes always trying to make me over from a perfectly good m d into a damn poet with a socialist necktie shed have a fit if she knew how many women would be willing to cuddle up to friend will and comfort him if hed give em the chance theres still a few dames that think the old man isnt so darn unattractive im glad ive ducked all that womangame since ive been married butbe switched if sometimes i dont feel tempted to shine up to some girl that has sense enough to take life as it is some frau that doesnt want to talk longfellow all the time but just hold my hand and say you look all in honey take it easy and dont try to talk  carrie thinks shes such a whale at analyzing folks giving the town the onceover telling us where we get off why shed simply turn up her toes and croak if she found out how much she doesnt know about the high old times a wise guy could have in this burg on the qt if he wasnt faithful to his wife but i am at that no matter what faults shes got theres nobody here no nor in minnaplus either thats as nicelooking and square and bright as carrie she ought to of been an artist or a writer or one of those things but once she took a shot at living here she ought to stick by it prettylord yes but cold she simply doesnt know what passion is she simply hasnt got an ídea how hard it is for a fullblooded man to go on pretending to be satisfied with just being endured it gets awful tiresome having to feel like a criminal just because im normal shes getting so she doesnt even care for my kissing her well  i guess i can weather it same as i did earning my way through school and getting started in practise but i wonder how long i can stand being an outsider in my own home  he sat up at the entrance of mrs dave dyer she slumped into a chair and gasped with the heat he chuckled well well maud this is fine wheres the subscriptionlist what cause do i get robbed for this trip  i havent any subscriptionlist will i want to see you professionally  and you a christian scientist have you given that up what next new thought or spiritualism  no i have not given it up  strikes me its kind of a knock on the sisterhood your coming to see a doctor  no it isnt its just that my faith isnt strong enough yet so there now and besides you are kind of consoling will i mean as a man not just as a doctor youre so strong and placid  he sat on the edge of his desk coatless his vest swinging open with the thick gold line of his watchchain across the gap his hands in his trousers pockets his big arms bent and easy as she purred he cocked an interested eye maud dyer was neurotic religiocentric faded her emotions were moist and her figure was unsystematicsplendid thighs and arms with thick ankles and a body that was bulgy in the wrong places but her milky skin was delicious her eyes were alive her chestnut hair shone and there was a tender slope from her ears to the shadowy place below her jaw  with unusual solicitude he uttered his stock phrase well what seems to be the matter maud  ive got such a backache all the time im afraid the organic trouble that you treated me for is coming back  any definite signs of it  nno but i think youd better examine me  nope dont believe its necessary maud to be honest between old friends i think your troubles are mostly imaginary i cant really advise you to have an examination  she flushed looked out of the window he was conscious that his voice was not impersonal and even  she turned quickly will you always say my troubles are imaginary why cant you be scientific ive been reading an article about these new nervespecialists and they claim that lots of imaginary ailments yes and lots of real pain too are what they call psychoses and they order a change in a womans way of living so she can get on a higher plane  wait wait whoaup wait now dont mix up your christian science and your psychology theyre two entirely different fads youll be mixing in socialism next youre as bad as carrie with your psychoses why good lord maud i could talk about neuroses and psychoses and inhibitions and repressions and complexes just as well as any damn specialist if i got paid for it if i was in the city and had the nerve to charge the fees that those fellows do if a specialist stung you for a hundreddollar consultationfee and told you to go to new york to duck daves nagging youd do it to save the hundred dollars but you know meim your neighboryou see me mowing the lawnyou figure im just a plug general practitioner if i said go to new york dave and you would laugh your heads off and say look at the airs will is putting on what does he think he is  as a matter of fact youre right you have a perfectly welldeveloped case of repression of sex instinct and it raises the old ned with your body what you need is to get away from dave and travel yes and go to every doggone kind of new thought and bahai and swami and hooptedoodle meeting you can find i know it well s you do but how can i advise it dave would be up here taking my hide off im willing to be family physician and priest and lawyer and plumber and wetnurse but i draw the line at making dave loosen up on money too hard a job in weather like this so savvy my dear believe it will rain if this heat keeps  but will hed never give it to me on my sayso hed never let me go away you know how dave is so jolly and liberal in society and oh just loves to match quarters and such a perfect sport if he loses but at home he pinches a nickel till the buffalo drips blood i have to nag him for every single dollar  sure i know but its your fight honey keep after him hed simply resent my butting in  he crossed over and patted her shoulder outside the window beyond the flyscreen that was opaque with dust and cottonwood lint main street was hushed except for the impatient throb of a standing motor car she took his firm hand pressed his knuckles against her cheek  o will dave is so mean and little and noisythe shrimp youre so calm when hes cutting up at parties i see you standing back and watching himthe way a mastiff watches a terrier  he fought for professional dignity with dave s not a bad fellow  lingeringly she released his hand will drop round by the house this evening and scold me make me be good and sensible and im so lonely  if i did dave would be there and wed have to play cards its his evening off from the store  no the clerk just got called to corinthmother sick dave will be in the store till midnight oh come on over theres some lovely beer on the ice and we can sit and talk and be all cool and lazy that wouldnt be wrong of us would it  no no course it wouldnt be wrong but still oughtnt to he saw carol slim black and ivory cool scornful of intrigue  all right but ill be so lonely  her throat seemed young above her loose blouse of muslin and machinelace  tell you maud ill drop in just for a minute if i happen to be called down that way  if youd like demurely o will i just want comfort i know youre all married and my such a proud papa and of course nowif i could just sit near you in the dusk and be quiet and forget dave you will come  sure i will  ill expect you ill be

right shes got more life to her than carol has all my fault anyway why cant i be more cagey like calibree and mcganum and the rest of the doctors oh i am but mauds such a demanding idiot deliberately bamboozling me into going up there tonight matter of principle ought not to let her get away with it i wont go ill call her up and tell her i wont go me with carrie at home finest little woman in the world and a messyminded female like maud dyerno sir though theres no need of hurting her feelings i may just drop in for a second to tell her i cant stay all my fault anyway ought never to have started in and jollied maud along in the old days if its my fault ive got no right to punish maud i could just drop in for a second and then pretend i had a country call and beat it damn nuisance though having to fake up excuses lord why cant the women let you alone just because once or twice seven hundred million years ago you were a poor fool why cant they let you forget it mauds own fault ill stay strictly away take carrie to the movies and forget maud    but it would be kind of hot at the movies tonight  he fled from himself he rammed on his hat threw his coat over his arm banged the door locked it tramped downstairs i wont go he said sturdily and as he said it he would have given a good deal to know whether he was going  he was refreshed as always by the familiar windows and faces it restored his soul to have sam clark trustingly bellow better come down to the lake this evening and have a swim doc aint you going to open your cottage at all this summer by golly we miss you he noted the progress on the new garage he had triumphed in the laying of every course of bricks in them he had seen the growth of the town his pride was ushered back to its throne by the respectfulness of oley sundquist evenin doc the woman is a lot better that was swell medicine you gave her he was calmed by the mechanicalness of the tasks at home burning the gray web of a tentworm on the wild cherry tree sealing with gum a cut in the right front tire of the car sprinkling the road before the house the hose was cool to his hands as the bright arrows fell with a faint puttering sound a crescent of blackness was formed in the gray dust  dave dyer came along  where going dave  down to the store just had supper  but thursday s your night off  sure but pete went home his mother s supposed to be sick gosh these clerks you get nowadaysoverpay em and then they wont work  thats tough dave youll have to work clear up till twelve then  yup better drop in and have a cigar if youre downtown  well i may at that may have to go down and see mrs champ perry shes ailing so long dave  kennicott had not yet entered the house he was conscious that carol was near him that she was important that he was afraid of her disapproval but he was content to be alone when he had finished sprinkling he strolled into the house up to the babys room and cried to hugh storytime for the old man eh  carol was in a low chair framed and haloed by the window behind her an image in pale gold the baby curled in her lap his head on her arm listening with gravity while she sang from gene field       tis little luddydud in the morning      tis little luddydud at night      and all day long      tis the same dear song      of that growing crowing knowing little sprite  kennicott was enchanted  maud dyer i should say not  when the current maid bawled upstairs supper on de table kennicott was upon his back flapping his hands in the earnest effort to be a seal thrilled by the strength with which his son kicked him he slipped his arm about carols shoulder he went down to supper rejoicing that he was cleansed of perilous stuff while carol was putting the baby to bed he sat on the front steps nat hicks tailor and roue came to sit beside him between waves of his hand as he drove off mosquitos nat whispered say doc you dont feel like imagining youre a bacheldore again and coming out for a time tonight do you  as how  you know this new dressmaker mrs swiftwaiteswell dame with blondine hair well shes a pretty good goer me and harry haydock are going to take her and that fat wren that works in the bon tonnice kid tooon an auto ride tonight maybe well drive down to that farm harry bought were taking some beer and some of the smoothest rye you ever laid tongue to im not predicting none but if we dont have a picnic ill miss my guess  go to it no skin off my ear nat think i want to be fifth wheel in the coach  no but look here the little swiftwaite has a friend with her from winona dandy looker and some gay bird and harry and me thought maybe youd like to sneak off for one evening  nono  rats now doc forget your everlasting dignity you used to be a pretty good sport yourself when you were footfree  it may have been the fact that mrs swiftwaites friend remained to kennicott an illtold rumor it may have been carols voice wistful in the pallid evening as she sang to hugh it may have been natural and commendable virtue but certainly he was positive  nope im married for keeps dont pretend to be any saint like to get out and raise cain and shoot a few drinks but a fellow owes a dutystraight now wont you feel like a sneak when you come back to the missus after your jamboree  me my moral in life is what they dont know wont hurt em none the way to handle wives like the fellow says is to catch em early treat em rough and tell em nothing  well thats your business i suppose but i cant get away with it besides thatway i figure it this illicit lovemaking is the one game that you always lose at if you do lose you feel foolish and if you win as soon as you find out how little it is that youve been scheming for why then you lose worse than ever nature stinging us as usual but at that i guess a lot of wives in this burg would be surprised if they knew everything that goes on behind their backs eh nattie  would they say boy if the good wives knew what some of the boys get away with when they go down to the cities why theyd throw a fit sure you wont come doc think of getting all cooled off by a good long drive and then the lovely swiftwaites white hand mixing you a good stiff highball  nope nope sorry guess i wont grumbled kennicott  he was glad that nat showed signs of going but he was restless he heard carol on the stairs come have a seathave the whole earth he shouted jovially  she did not answer his joviality she sat on the porch rocked silently then sighed so many mosquitos out here you havent had the screen fixed  as though he was testing her he said quietly head aching again  oh not much butthis maid is so slow to learn i have to show her everything i had to clean most of the silver myself and hugh was so bad all afternoon he whined so poor soul he was hot but he did wear me out  uhyou usually want to get out like to walk down to the lake shore the girl can stay home or go to the movies come on lets go to the movies or shall we jump in the car and run out to sams for a swim  if you dont mind dear im afraid im rather tired  why dont you sleep downstairs tonight on the couch be cooler im going to bring down my mattress come on keep the old man company cant telli might get scared of burglars lettin little fellow like me stay all alone by himself  its sweet of you to think of it but i like my own room so much

perhaps ill go byby unless you want me dear of course if theres anything you really want me for  no no    matter of fact i really ought to run down and see mrs champ perry shes ailing so you skip in andmay drop in at the drug store if im not home when you get sleepy dont wait up for me  he kissed her rambled off nodded to jim howland stopped indifferently to speak to mrs terry gould but his heart was racing his stomach was constricted he walked more slowly he reached dave dyers yard he glanced in on the porch sheltered by a wildgrape vine was the figure of a woman in white he heard the swingcouch creak as she sat up abruptly peered then leaned back and pretended to relax  be nice to have some cool beer just drop in for a second he insisted as he opened the dyer gate   ii   mrs bogart was calling upon carol protected by aunt bessie smail  have you heard about this awful woman thats supposed to have come here to do dressmakinga mrs swiftwaiteawful peroxide blonde moaned mrs bogart they say theres some of the awfullest goingson at her housemere boys and old grayheaded rips sneaking in there evenings and drinking licker and every kind of goingson we women cant never realize the carnal thoughts in the hearts of men i tell you even though i been acquainted with will kennicott almost since he was a mere boy seems like i wouldnt trust even him who knows what designin women might tempt him especially a doctor with women rushin in to see him at his office and all you know i never hint around but havent you felt that  carol was furious i dont pretend that will has no faults but one thing i do know hes as simplehearted about what you call goingson as a babe and if he ever were such a sad dog as to look at another woman i certainly hope hed have spirit enough to do the tempting and not be coaxed into it as in your depressing picture  why what a wicked thing to say carrie from aunt bessie  no i mean it oh of course i dont mean it buti know every thought in his head so well that he couldnt hide anything even if he wanted to now this morninghe was out late last night he had to go see mrs perry who is ailing and then fix a mans hand and this morning he was so quiet and thoughtful at breakfast and she leaned forward breathed dramatically to the two perched harpies what do you suppose he was thinking of  what trembled mrs bogart  whether the grass needs cutting probably there there dont mind my naughtiness i have some freshmade raisin cookies for you    chapter xxvi  carols liveliest interest was in her walks with the baby hugh wanted to know what the boxelder tree said and what the ford garage said and what the big cloud said and she told him with a feeling that she was not in the least making up stories but discovering the souls of things they had an especial fondness for the hitchingpost in front of the mill it was a brown post stout and agreeable the smooth leg of it held the sunlight while its neck grooved by hitchingstraps tickled ones fingers carol had never been awake to the earth except as a show of changing color and great satisfying masses she had lived in people and in ideas about having ideas but hughs questions made her attentive to the comedies of sparrows robins blue jays yellowhammers she regained her pleasure in the arching flight of swallows and added to it a solicitude about their nests and family squabbles  she forgot her seasons of boredom she said to hugh were two fat disreputable old minstrels roaming round the world and he echoed her roamin roundroamin round  the high adventure the secret place to which they both fled joyously was the house of miles and bea and olaf bjornstam  kennicott steadily disapproved of the bjornstams he protested what do you want to talk to that crank for he hinted that a former swede hired girl was low company for the son of dr will kennicott she did not explain she did not quite understand it herself did not know that in the bjornstams she found her friends her club her sympathy and her ration of blessed cynicism for a time the gossip of juanita haydock and the jolly seventeen had been a refuge from the droning of aunt bessie but the relief had not continued the young matrons made her nervous they talked so loud always so loud they filled a room with clashing cackle their jests and gags they repeated nine times over unconsciously she had discarded the jolly seventeen guy pollock vida and every one save mrs dr westlake and the friends whom she did not clearly know as friendsthe bjornstams  to hugh the red swede was the most heroic and powerful person in the world with unrestrained adoration he trotted after while miles fed the cows chased his one pigan animal of lax and migratory instinctsor dramatically slaughtered a chicken and to hugh olaf was lord among mortal men less stalwart than the old monarch king miles but more understanding of the relations and values of things of small sticks lone playingcards and irretrievably injured hoops  carol saw though she did not admit that olaf was not only more beautiful than her own dark child but more gracious olaf was a norse chieftain straight sunnyhaired largelimbed resplendently amiable to his subjects hugh was a vulgarian a bustling business man it was hugh that bounced and said lets play olaf that opened luminous blue eyes and agreed all right in condescending gentleness if hugh batted himand hugh did bat himolaf was unafraid but shocked in magnificent solitude he marched toward the house while hugh bewailed his sin and the overclouding of august favor  the two friends played with an imperial chariot which miles had made out of a starchbox and four red spools together they stuck switches into a mousehole with vast satisfaction though entirely without known results  bea the chubby and humming bea impartially gave cookies and scoldings to both children and if carol refused a cup of coffee and a wafer of buttered knackebrod she was desolated  miles had done well with his dairy he had six cows two hundred chickens a cream separator a ford truck in the spring he had built a tworoom addition to his shack that illustrious building was to hugh a carnival uncle miles did the most spectacular unexpected things ran up the ladder stood on the ridgepole waving a hammer and singing something about to arms my citizens nailed shingles faster than aunt bessie could iron handkerchiefs and lifted a twobysix with hugh riding on one end and olaf on the other uncle miless most ecstatic trick was to make figures not on paper but right on a new pine board with the broadest softest pencil in the world there was a thing worth seeing  the tools in his office father had tools fascinating in their shininess and curious shapes but they were sharp they were something called sterized and they distinctly were not for boys to touch in fact it was a good dodge to volunteer i must not touch when you looked at the tools on the glass shelves in fathers office but uncle miles who was a person altogether superior to father let you handle all his kit except the saws there was a hammer with a silver head there was a metal thing like a big l there was a magic instrument very precious made out of costly red wood and gold with a tube which contained a dropno it wasnt a drop it was a nothing which lived in the water but the nothing looked like a drop and it ran in a frightened way up and down the tube no matter how cautiously you tilted the magic instrument and there were nails very different and cleverbig valiant spikes middlesized ones which were not very interesting and shinglenails much jollier than the fussedup fairies in the yellow book   ii   while he had worked on the addition miles had talked frankly to carol he admitted now that so long as he stayed in gopher prairie he would remain a pariah beas lutheran friends were as much offended by his agnostic gibes as the merchants by his radicalism and i cant seem to keep my mouth shut i think im being a baalamb and not springing any theories wilder than cat spells cat but when folks have gone i relize ive been stepping on their pet religious corns oh the mill foreman keeps dropping in and that danish shoemaker and one fellow from elders factory and a few svenskas but you know bea big goodhearted wench like her wants a lot of folks aroundlikes to fuss over emnever satisfied unless she tiring herself out making coffee for somebody  once she kidnapped me and drug me to the methodist church i goes in pious as widow bogart and sits still and never cracks a smile while the preacher is favoring us with his misinformation on evolution but afterwards when the old stalwarts were pumphandling everybody at the door and calling em brother and sister they let me sail right by with nary a clinch they figure im the town badman always will be i guess itll have to be olaf who goes on and sometimesblamed if i dont feel like coming out and saying ive been conservative nothing to it now im going to start something in these rotten onehorse lumbercamps west of town but beas got me hypnotized lord mrs kennicott do you relize what a jolly square faithful woman she is and i love olafoh well i wont go and get sentimental on you  course ive had thoughts of pulling up stakes and going west maybe if they didnt know it beforehand they wouldnt find out id ever been guilty of trying to think for myself butoh ive worked hard and built up this dairy business and i hate to start all over again and move bea and the kid into another oneroom shack thats how they get us encourage us to be thrifty and own our own houses and then by golly theyve got us they know we wont dare risk everything by committing lezwhat is it lez majestyi mean they know we wont be hinting around that if we had a cooperative bank we could get along without stowbody wellas long as i can sit and play pinochle with bea and tell whoppers to olaf about his daddys adventures in the woods and how he snared a wapaloosie and knew paul bunyan why i dont mind being a bum its just for them that i mind say say dont whisper a word to bea but when i get this addition done im going to buy her a phonograph  he did  while she was busy with the activities her workhungry muscles foundwashing ironing mending baking dusting preserving plucking a chicken painting the sink tasks which because she was miless full partner were exciting and creativebea listened to the phonograph records with rapture like that of cattle in a warm stable the addition gave her a kitchen with a bedroom above the original oneroom shack was now a livingroom with the phonograph a genuine leatherupholstered goldenoak rocker and a picture of governor john johnson  in late july carol went to the bjornstams desirous of a chance to express her opinion of beavers and calibrees and joralemons she found olaf abed restless from a slight fever and bea flushed and dizzy but trying to keep up her work she lured miles aside and worried  they dont look at all well whats the matter  their stomachs are out of whack i wanted to call in doc kennicott but bea thinks the doc doesnt like usshe thinks maybe hes sore because you come down here but im getting worried  im going to call the doctor at once  she yearned over olaf his lambent eyes were stupid he moaned he rubbed his forehead  have they been eating something thats been bad for them she fluttered to miles  might be bum water ill tell you we used to get our water at oscar eklunds place over across the street but oscar kept dinging at me and hinting i was a tightwad not to dig a well of my own one time he said sure you socialists are great on divvying up other folks moneyand water i knew if he kept it up thered be a fuss and i aint safe to have around once a fuss starts im likely to forget myself and let loose with a punch in the snoot i offered to pay oscar but he refusedhed rather have the chance to kid me so i starts getting water down at mrs fageross in the hollow there and i dont believe its real good figuring to dig my own well this fall  one scarlet word was before carols eyes while she listened she fled to kennicotts office he gravely heard her out nodded said be right over  he examined bea and olaf he shook his head yes looks to me like typhoid  golly ive seen typhoid in lumbercamps groaned miles all the strength dripping out of him have they got it very bad  oh well take good care of them said kennicott and for the first time in their acquaintance he smiled on miles and clapped his shoulder  wont you need a nurse demanded carol  why to miles kennicott hinted couldnt you get beas cousin tina  shes down at the old folks in the country  then let me do it carol insisted they need some one to cook for them and isnt it good to give them sponge baths in typhoid  yes all right kennicott was automatic he was the official the physician i guess probably it would be hard to get a nurse here in town just now mrs stiver is busy with an obstetrical case and that town nurse of yours is off on vacation aint she all right bjornstam can spell you at night  all week from eight each morning till midnight carol fed them bathed them smoothed sheets took temperatures miles refused to let her cook terrified pallid noiseless in stocking feet he did the kitchen work and the sweeping his big red hands awkwardly careful kennicott came in three times a day unchangingly tender and hopeful in the sickroom evenly polite to miles  carol understood how great was her love for her friends it bore her through it made her arm steady and tireless to bathe them what exhausted her was the sight of bea and olaf turned into flaccid invalids uncomfortably flushed after taking food begging for the healing of sleep at night  during the second week olafs powerful legs were flabby spots of a viciously delicate pink came out on his chest and back his cheeks sank he looked frightened his tongue was brown and revolting his confident voice dwindled to a bewildered murmur ceaseless and racking  bea had stayed on her feet too long at the beginning the moment kennicott had ordered her to bed she had begun to collapse one early evening she startled them by screaming in an intense abdominal pain and within half an hour she was in a delirium till dawn carol was with her and not all of beas groping through the blackness of halfdelirious pain was so pitiful to carol as the way in which miles silently peered into the room from the top of the narrow stairs carol slept three hours next morning and ran back bea was altogether delirious but she muttered nothing save olafve have such a good time  at ten while carol was preparing an icebag in the kitchen miles answered a knock at the front door she saw vida sherwin maud dyer and mrs zitterel wife of the baptist pastor they were carrying grapes and womensmagazines magazines with highcolored pictures and optimistic fiction  we just heard your wife was sick weve come to see if there isnt something we can do chirruped vida  miles looked steadily at the three women youre too late you cant do nothing now beas always kind of hoped that you folks would come see her she wanted to have a chance and be friends she used to sit waiting for somebody to knock ive seen her sitting here waiting nowoh you aint worth goddamning he shut the door  all day carol watched olafs strength oozing he was emaciated his ribs were grim clear lines his skin was clammy his pulse was feeble but terrifyingly rapid it beatbeatbeat in a drumroll of death late that afternoon he sobbed and died  bea did not know it she was delirious next morning when she went she did not know that olaf would no longer swing his lath sword on the doorstep no longer rule his subjects of the cattleyard that miless son would not go east to college  miles carol kennicott were silent they washed the bodies together their eyes veiled  go home now and sleep youre pretty tired i cant ever pay you back for what you done miles whispered to carol  yes but ill be back here tomorrow go with you to the funeral she said laboriously  when the time for the funeral came carol was in bed collapsed she assumed that neighbors would go they had not told her that word of miless rebuff to vida had spread through town a cyclonic fury  it was only by chance that leaning on her elbow in bed she glanced through the window and saw the funeral of bea and olaf there was no music no carriages there was only miles bjornstam in his black weddingsuit walking quite alone head down behind the shabby hearse that bore the bodies of his wife and baby  an hour after hugh came into her room crying and when she said as cheerily as she could what is it dear he besought mummy i want to go play with olaf  that afternoon juanita haydock dropped in to brighten carol she said too bad about this bea that was your hired girl but i dont waste any sympathy on that man of hers everybody says he drank too much and treated his family awful and thats how they got sick    chapter xxvii  i  a letter from raymie wutherspoon in france said that he had been sent to the front been slightly wounded been made a captain from vidas pride carol sought to draw a stimulant to rouse her from depression  miles had sold his dairy he had several thousand dollars to carol he said goodby with a mumbled word a harsh handshake going to buy a farm in northern albertafar off from folks as i can get he turned sharply away but he did not walk with his former spring his shoulders seemed old  it was said that before he went he cursed the town there was talk of arresting him of riding him on a rail it was rumored that at the station old champ perry rebuked him you better not come back here weve got respect for your dead but we havent got any for a blasphemer and a traitor that wont do anything for his country and only bought one liberty bond  some of the people who had been at the station declared that miles made some dreadful seditious retort something about loving german workmen more than american bankers but others asserted that he couldnt find one word with which to answer the veteran that he merely sneaked up on the platform of the train he must have felt guilty everybody agreed for as the train left town a farmer saw him standing in the vestibule and looking out  his housewith the addition which he had built four months agowas very near the track on which his train passed  when carol went there for the last time she found olafs chariot with its red spool wheels standing in the sunny corner beside the stable she wondered if a quick eye could have noticed it from a train  that day and that week she went reluctantly to red cross work she stitched and packed silently while vida read the war bulletins and she said nothing at all when kennicott commented from what champ says i guess bjornstam was a bad egg after all in spite of bea dont know but what the citizens committee ought to have forced him to be patrioticlet on like they could send him to jail if he didnt volunteer and come through for bonds and the y m c a theyve worked that stunt fine with all these german farmers   ii   she found no inspiration but she did find a dependable kindness in mrs westlake and at last she yielded to the old womans receptivity and had relief in sobbing the story of bea  guy pollock she often met on the street but he was merely a pleasant voice which said things about charles lamb and sunsets  her most positive experience was the revelation of mrs flickerbaugh the tall thin twitchy wife of the attorney carol encountered her at the drug store  walking snapped mrs flickerbaugh  why yes  humph guess youre the only female in this town that retains the use of her legs come home and have a cup o tea with me  because she had nothing else to do carol went but she was uncomfortable in the presence of the amused stares which mrs flickerbaughs raiment drew today in reeking early august she wore a mans cap a skinny fur like a dead cat a necklace of imitation pearls a scabrous satin blouse and a thick cloth skirt hiked up in front  come in sit down stick the baby in that rocker hope you dont mind the house looking like a rats nest you dont like this town neither do i said mrs flickerbaugh  why  course you dont  well then i dont but im sure that some day ill find some solution probably im a hexagonal peg solution find the hexagonal hole carol was very brisk  how do you know you ever will find it  theres mrs westlake shes naturally a bigcity womanshe ought to have a lovely old house in philadelphia or bostonbut she escapes by being absorbed in reading  you be satisfied to never do anything but read  no but heavens one cant go on hating a town always  why not i can ive hated it for thirtytwo years ill die hereand ill hate it till i die i ought to have been a business woman i had a good deal of talent for tending to figures all gone now some folks think im crazy guess i am sit and grouch go to church and sing hymns folks think im religious tut trying to forget washing and ironing and mending socks want an office of my own and sell things julius never hear of it too late  carol sat on the gritty couch and sank into fear could this drabness of life keep up forever then would she some day so despise herself and her neighbors that she too would walk main street an old skinny eccentric woman in a mangy catsfur as she crept home she felt that the trap had finally closed she went into the house a frail small woman still winsome but hopeless of eye as she staggered with the weight of the drowsy boy in her arms  she sat alone on the porch that evening it seemed that kennicott had to make a professional call on mrs dave dyer  under the stilly boughs and the black gauze of dusk the street was meshed in silence there was but the hum of motor tires crunching the road the creak of a rocker on the howlands porch the slap of a hand attacking a mosquito a heatweary conversation starting and dying the precise rhythm of crickets the thud of moths against the screensounds that were a distilled silence it was a street beyond the end of the world beyond the boundaries of hope though she should sit here forever no brave procession no one who was interesting would be coming by it was tediousness made tangible a street builded of lassitude and of futility  myrtle cass appeared with cy bogart she giggled and bounced when cy tickled her ear in village love they strolled with the halfdancing gait of lovers kicking their feet out sideways or shuffling a dragging jig and the concrete walk sounded to the broken twofour rhythm their voices had a dusky turbulence suddenly to the woman rocking on the porch of the doctors house the night came alive and she felt that everywhere in the darkness panted an ardent quest which she was missing as she sank back to wait forthere must be something    chapter xxviii  it was at a supper of the jolly seventeen in august that carol heard of elizabeth from mrs dave dyer  carol was fond of maud dyer because she had been particularly agreeable lately had obviously repented of the nervous distaste which she had once shown maud patted her hand when they met and asked about hugh  kennicott said that he was kind of sorry for the girl some ways shes too darn emotional but still dave is sort of mean to her he was polite to poor maud when they all went down to the cottages for a swim carol was proud of that sympathy in him and now she took pains to sit with their new friend  mrs dyer was bubbling oh have you folks heard about this young fellow thats just come to town that the boys call elizabeth hes working in nat hickss tailor shop i bet he doesnt make eighteen a week but my isnt he the perfect lady though he talks so refined and oh the lugs he puts onbelted coat and pique collar with a gold pin and socks to match his necktie and honestyou wont believe this but i got it straightthis fellow you know hes staying at mrs gurreys punk old boardinghouse and they say he asked mrs gurrey if he ought to put on a dresssuit for supper imagine can you beat that and him nothing but a swede tailorerik valborg his name is but he used to be in a tailor shop in minneapolis they do say hes a smart needlepusher at that and he tries to let on that hes a regular city fellow they say he tries to make people think hes a poetcarries books around and pretends to read em myrtle cass says she met him at a dance and he was mooning around all over the place and he asked her did she like flowers and poetry and music and everything he spieled like he was a regular united states senator and myrtleshes a devil that girl ha hashe kidded him along and got him going and honest what dyou think he said he said he didnt find any intellectual companionship in this town can you beat it imagine and him a swede tailor my and they say hes the most awful mollycoddlelooks just like a girl the boys call him elizabeth and they stop him and ask about the books he lets on to have read and he goes and tells them and they take it all in and jolly him terribly and he never gets onto the fact theyre kidding him oh i think its just too funny  the jolly seventeen laughed and carol laughed with them mrs jack elder added that this erik valborg had confided to mrs gurrey that he would love to design clothes for women imagine mrs harvey dillon had had a glimpse of him but honestly shed thought he was awfully handsome this was instantly controverted by mrs b j gougerling wife of the banker mrs gougerling had had she reported a good look at this valborg fellow she and b j had been motoring and passed elizabeth out by mcgruders bridge he was wearing the awfullest clothes with the waist pinched in like a girls he was sitting on a rock doing nothing but when he heard the gougerling car coming he snatched a book out of his pocket and as they went by he pretended to be reading it to show off and he wasnt really goodlookingjust kind of soft as b j had pointed out  when the husbands came they joined in the expose my name is elizabeth im the celebrated musical tailor the skirts fall for me by the thou do i get some more veal loaf merrily shrieked dave dyer he had some admirable stories about the tricks the town youngsters had played on valborg they had dropped a decaying perch into his pocket they had pinned on his back a sign im the prize boob kick me  glad of any laughter carol joined the frolic and surprised them by crying dave i do think youre the dearest thing since you got your hair cut that was an excellent sally everybody applauded kennicott looked proud  she decided that sometime she really must go out of her way to pass hickss shop and see this freak   ii   she was at sunday morning service at the baptist church in a solemn row with her husband hugh uncle whittier aunt bessie  despite aunt bessies nagging the kennicotts rarely attended church the doctor asserted sure religion is a fine influencegot to have it to keep the lower classes in orderfact its the only thing that appeals to a lot of those fellows and makes em respect the rights of property and i guess this theology is ok lot of wise old coots figured it all out and they knew more about it than we do he believed in the christian religion and never thought about it he believed in the church and seldom went near it he was shocked by carols lack of faith and wasnt quite sure what was the nature of the faith that she lacked  carol herself was an uneasy and dodging agnostic  when she ventured to sunday school and heard the teachers droning that the genealogy of shamsherai was a valuable ethical problem for children to think about when she experimented with wednesday prayermeeting and listened to storekeeping elders giving their unvarying weekly testimony in primitive erotic symbols and such gory chaldean phrases as washed in the blood of the lamb and a vengeful god when mrs bogart boasted that through his boyhood she had made cy confess nightly upon the basis of the ten commandments then carol was dismayed to find the christian religion in america in the twentieth century as abnormal as zoroastrianismwithout the splendor but when she went to church suppers and felt the friendliness saw the gaiety with which the sisters served cold ham and scalloped potatoes when mrs champ perry cried to her on an afternoon call my dear if you just knew how happy it makes you to come into abiding grace then carol found the humanness behind the sanguinary and alien theology always she perceived that the churchesmethodist baptist congregational catholic all of themwhich had seemed so unimportant to the judges home in her childhood so isolated from the city struggle in st paul were still in gopher prairie the strongest of the forces compelling respectability  this august sunday she had been tempted by the announcement that the reverend edmund zitterel would preach on the topic america face your problems with the great war workmen in every nation showing a desire to control industries russia hinting a leftward revolution against kerensky woman suffrage coming there seemed to be plenty of problems for the reverend mr zitterel to call on america to face carol gathered her family and trotted off behind uncle whittier  the congregation faced the heat with informality men with highly plastered hair so painfully shaved that their faces looked sore removed their coats sighed and unbuttoned two buttons of their uncreased sunday vests largebosomed whitebloused hotnecked spectacled matronsthe mothers in israel pioneers and friends of mrs champ perrywaved their palmleaf fans in a steady rhythm abashed boys slunk into the rear pews and giggled while milky little girls up front with their mothers selfconsciously kept from turning around  the church was half barn and half gopher prairie parlor the streaky brown wallpaper was broken in its dismal sweep only by framed texts come unto me and the lord is my shepherd by a list of hymns and by a crimson and green diagram staggeringly drawn upon hempcolored paper indicating the alarming ease with which a young man may descend from palaces of pleasure and the house of pride to eternal damnation but the varnished oak pews and the new red carpet and the three large chairs on the platform behind the bare readingstand were all of a rockingchair comfort  carol was civic and neighborly and commendable today she beamed and bowed she trolled out with the others the hymn       how pleasant tis on sabbath morn      to gather in the church      and there ill have no carnal thoughts      nor sin shall me besmirch  with a rustle of starched linen skirts and stiff shirtfronts the congregation sat down and gave heed to the reverend mr zitterel the priest was a thin swart intense young man with a bang he wore a black sack suit and a lilac tie he smote the enormous bible on the readingstand vociferated come let us reason together delivered a prayer informing almighty god of the news of the past week and began to reason  it proved that the only problems which america had to face were mormonism and prohibition  dont let any of these selfconceited fellows that are always trying to stir up trouble deceive you with the belief that theres anything to all these smartaleck movements to let the unions and the farmers nonpartisan league kill all our initiative and enterprise by fixing wages and prices there isnt any movement that amounts to a whoop without its got a moral background and let me tell you that while folks are fussing about what they call economics and socialism and science and a lot of things that are nothing in the world but a disguise for atheism the old satan is busy spreading his secret net and tentacles out there in utah under his guise of joe smith or brigham young or whoever their leaders happen to be today it doesnt make any difference and theyre making game of the old bible that has led this american people through its manifold trials and tribulations to its firm position as the fulfilment of the prophecies and the recognized leader of all nations sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of my feet said the lord of hosts acts ii the thirtyfourth verseand let me tell you right now you got to get up a good deal earlier in the morning than you get up even when youre going fishing if you want to be smarter than the lord who has shown us the straight and narrow way and he that passeth therefrom is in eternal peril and to return to this vital and terrible subject of mormonismand as i say it is terrible to realize how little attention is given to this evil right here in our midst and on our very doorstep as it wereits a shame and a disgrace that the congress of these united states spends all its time talking about inconsequential financial matters that ought to be left to the treasury department as i understand it instead of arising in their might and passing a law that any one admitting he is a mormon shall simply be deported and as it were kicked out of this free country in which we havent got any room for polygamy and the tyrannies of satan  and to digress for a moment especially as there are more of them in this state than there are mormons though you never can tell what will happen with this vain generation of young girls that think more about wearing silk stockings than about minding their mothers and learning to bake a good loaf of bread and many of them listening to these sneaking mormon missionariesand i actually heard one of them talking right out on a streetcorner in duluth a few years ago and the officers of the law not protestingbut still as they are a smaller but more immediate problem let me stop for just a moment to pay my respects to these seventhday adventists not that they are immoral i dont mean but when a body of men go on insisting that saturday is the sabbath after christ himself has clearly indicated the new dispensation then i think the legislature ought to step in  at this point carol awoke  she got through three more minutes by studying the face of a girl in the pew across a sensitive unhappy girl whose longing poured out with intimidating selfrevelation as she worshiped mr zitterel carol wondered who the girl was she had seen her at church suppers she considered how many of the three thousand people in the town she did not know to how many of them the thanatopsis and the jolly seventeen were icy social peaks how many of them might be toiling through boredom thicker than her ownwith greater courage  she examined her nails she read two hymns she got some satisfaction out of rubbing an itching knuckle she pillowed on her shoulder the head of the baby who after killing time in the same manner as his mother was so fortunate as to fall asleep she read the introduction titlepage and acknowledgment of copyrights in the hymnal she tried to evolve a philosophy which would explain why kennicott could never tie his scarf so that it would reach the top of the gap in his turndown collar  there were no other diversions to be found in the pew she glanced back at the congregation she thought that it would be amiable to bow to mrs champ perry  her slow turning head stopped galvanized  across the aisle two rows back was a strange young man who shone among the cudchewing citizens like a visitant from the sunamber curls low forehead fine nose chin smooth but not raw from sabbath shaving his lips startled her the lips of men in gopher prairie are flat in the face straight and grudging the strangers mouth was arched the upper lip short he wore a brown jersey coat a delftblue bow a white silk shirt white flannel trousers he suggested the ocean beach a tennis court anything but the sunblistered utility of main street  a visitor from minneapolis here for business no he wasnt a business man he was a poet keats was in his face and shelley and arthur upson whom she had once seen in minneapolis he was at once too sensitive and too sophisticated to touch business as she knew it in gopher prairie  with restrained amusement he was analyzing the noisy mr zitterel carol was ashamed to have this spy from the great world hear the pastors maundering she felt responsible for the town she resented his gaping at their private rites she flushed turned away but she continued to feel his presence  how could she meet him she must for an hour of talk he was all that she was hungry for she could not let him get away without a wordand she would have to she pictured and ridiculed herself as walking up to him and remarking i am sick with the village virus will you please tell me what people are saying and playing in new york she pictured and groaned over the expression of kennicott if she should say why wouldnt it be reasonable for you my soul to ask that complete stranger in the brown jersey coat to come to supper tonight  she brooded not looking back she warned herself that she was probably exaggerating that no young man could have all these exalted qualities wasnt he too obviously smart too glossynew like a movie actor probably he was a traveling salesman who sang tenor and fancied himself in imitations of newport clothes and spoke of the swellest business proposition that ever came down the pike in a panic she peered at him no this was no hustling salesman this boy with the curving grecian lips and the serious eyes  she rose after the service carefully taking kennicotts arm and smiling at him in a mute assertion that she was devoted to him no matter what happened she followed the mysterys soft brown jersey shoulders out of the church  fatty hicks the shrill and puffy son of nat flapped his hand at the beautiful stranger and jeered hows the kid all dolled up like a plush horse today aint we  carol was exceeding sick her herald from the outside was erik valborg elizabeth apprentice tailor gasoline and hot goose mending dirty jackets respectfully holding a tapemeasure about a paunch  and yet she insisted this boy was also himself   iii   they had sunday dinner with the smails in a diningroom which centered about a fruit and flower piece and a crayonenlargement of uncle whittier carol did not heed aunt bessies fussing in regard to mrs robert b schminkes bead necklace and whittiers error in putting on the striped pants day like this she did not taste the shreds of roast pork she said vacuously  uhwill i wonder if that young man in the white flannel trousers at church this morning was this valborg person that theyre all talking about  yump thats him wasnt that the darndest getup he had on kennicott scratched at a white smear on his hard gray sleeve  it wasnt so bad i wonder where he comes from he seems to have lived in cities a good deal is he from the east  the east him why he comes from a farm right up north here just this side of jefferson i know his father slightlyadolph valborgtypical cranky old swede farmer  oh really blandly  believe he has lived in minneapolis for quite some time though learned his trade there and i will say hes bright some ways reads a lot pollock says he takes more books out of the library than anybody else in town huh hes kind of like you in that  the smails and kennicott laughed very much at this sly jest uncle whittier seized the conversation that fellow thats working for hicks milksop thats what he is makes me tired to see a young fellow that ought to be in the war or anyway out in the fields earning his living honest like i done when i was young doing a womans work and then come out and dress up like a showactor why when i was his age  carol reflected that the carvingknife would make an excellent dagger with which to kill uncle whittier it would slide in easily the headlines would be terrible  kennicott said judiciously oh i dont want to be unjust to him i believe he took his physical examination for military service got varicose veinsnot bad but enough to disqualify him though i will say he doesnt look like a fellow that would be so awful darn crazy to poke his bayonet into a huns guts  will please  well he dont looks soft to me and they say he told del snafflin when he was getting a haircut on saturday that he wished he could play the piano  isnt it wonderful how much we all know about one another in a town like this said carol innocently  kennicott was suspicious but aunt bessie serving the floating island pudding agreed yes it is wonderful folks can get away with all sorts of meannesses and sins in these terrible cities but they cant here i was noticing this tailor fellow this morning and when mrs riggs offered to share her hymnbook with him he shook his head and all the while we was singing he just stood there like a bump on a log and never opened his mouth everybody says hes got an idea that hes got so much better manners and all than what the rest of us have but if thats what he calls good manners i want to know  carol again studied the carvingknife blood on the whiteness of a tablecloth might be gorgeous  then  fool neurotic impossibilist telling yourself orchard fairytalesat thirty    dear lord am i really thirty that boy cant be more than twentyfive   iv   she went calling  boarding with the widow bogart was fern mullins a girl of twentytwo who was to be teacher of english french and gymnastics in the high school this coming session fern mullins had come to town early for the sixweeks normal course for country teachers carol had noticed her on the street had heard almost as much about her as about erik valborg she was tall weedy pretty and incurably rakish whether she wore a low middy collar or dressed reticently for school in a black suit with a highnecked blouse she was airy flippant she looks like an absolute totty said all the mrs sam clarks disapprovingly and all the juanita haydocks enviously  that sunday evening sitting in baggy canvas lawnchairs beside the house the kennicotts saw fern laughing with cy bogart who though still a junior in high school was now a lump of a man only two or three years younger than fern cy had to go downtown for weighty matters connected with the poolparlor fern drooped on the bogart porch her chin in her hands  she looks lonely said kennicott  she does poor soul i believe ill go over and speak to her i was introduced to her at daves but i havent called carol was slipping across the lawn a white figure in the dimness faintly brushing the dewy grass she was thinking of erik and of the fact that her feet were wet and she was casual in her greeting hello the doctor and i wondered if you were lonely  resentfully i am  carol concentrated on her my dear you sound so i know how it is i used to be tired when i was on the jobi was a librarian what was your college i was blodgett  more interestedly i went to the u fern meant the university of minnesota  you must have had a splendid time blodgett was a bit dull  where were you a librarian challengingly  st paulthe main library  honest oh dear i wish i was back in the cities this is my first year of teaching and im scared stiff i did have the best time in college dramatics and basketball and fussing and dancingim simply crazy about dancing and here except when i have the kids in gymnasium class or when im chaperoning the basketball team on a trip outoftown i wont dare to move above a whisper i guess they dont care much if you put any pep into teaching or not as long as you look like a good influence out of schoolhoursand that means never doing anything you want to this normal course is bad enough but the regular school will be fierce if it wasnt too late to get a job in the cities i swear id resign here i bet i wont dare to go to a single dance all winter if i cut loose and danced the way i like to theyd think i was a perfect hellionpoor harmless me oh i oughtnt to be talking like this fern you never could be cagey  dont be frightened my dear    doesnt that sound atrociously old and kind im talking to you the way mrs westlake talks to me thats having a husband and a kitchen range i suppose but i feel young and i want to dance like alike a helliontoo so i sympathize  fern made a sound of gratitude carol inquired what experience did you have with college dramatics i tried to start a kind of little theater here it was dreadful i must tell you about it  two hours later when kennicott came over to greet fern and to yawn look here carrie dont you suppose you better be thinking about turning in ive got a hard day tomorrow the two were talking so intimately that they constantly interrupted each other  as she went respectably home convoyed by a husband and decorously holding up her skirts carol rejoiced everything has changed i have two friends fern andbut whos the other thats queer i thought there wasoh how absurd   v   she often passed erik valborg on the street the brown jersey coat became unremarkable when she was driving with kennicott in early evening she saw him on the lake shore reading a thin book which might easily have been poetry she noted that he was the only person in the motorized town who still took long walks  she told herself that she was the daughter of a judge the wife of a doctor and that she did not care to know a capering tailor she told herself that she was not responsive to men    not even to percy bresnahan she told herself that a woman of thirty who heeded a boy of twentyfive was ridiculous and on friday when she had convinced herself that the errand was necessary she went to nat hickss shop bearing the not very romantic burden of a pair of her husbands trousers hicks was in the back room she faced the greek god who in a somewhat ungodlike way was stitching a coat on a scaley sewingmachine in a room of smutted plaster walls  she saw that his hands were not in keeping with a hellenic face they were thick roughened with needle and hot iron and plowhandle even in the shop he persisted in his finery he wore a silk shirt a topaz scarf thin tan shoes  this she absorbed while she was saying curtly can i get these pressed please  not rising from the sewingmachine he stuck out his hand mumbled when do you want them  oh monday  the adventure was over she was marching out  what name he called after her  he had risen and despite the farcicality of dr will kennicotts bulgy trousers draped over his arm he had the grace of a cat  kennicott  kennicott oh oh say youre mrs dr kennicott then arent you  yes she stood at the door now that she had carried out her preposterous impulse to see what he was like she was cold she was as ready to detect familiarities as the virtuous miss ella stowbody  ive heard about you myrtle cass was saying you got up a dramatic club and gave a dandy play ive always wished i had a chance to belong to a little theater and give some european plays or whimsical like barrie or a pageant  he pronounced it pagent he rhymed pag with rag  carol nodded in the manner of a lady being kind to a tradesman and one of her selves sneered our erik is indeed a lost john keats  he was appealing do you suppose it would be possible to get up another dramatic club this coming fall  well it might be worth thinking of she came out of her several conflicting poses and said sincerely theres a new teacher miss mullins who might have some talent that would make three of us for a nucleus if we could scrape up half a dozen we might give a real play with a small cast have you had any experience  just a bum club that some of us got up in minneapolis when i was working there we had one good man an interior decoratormaybe he was kind of sis and effeminate but he really was an artist and we gave one dandy play but iof course ive always had to work hard and study by myself and im probably sloppy and id love it if i had training in rehearsingi mean the crankier the director was the better id like it if you didnt want to use me as an actor id love to design the costumes im crazy about fabricstextures and colors and designs  she knew that he was trying to keep her from going trying to indicate that he was something more than a person to whom one brought trousers for pressing he besought  some day i hope i can get away from this fool repairing when i have the money saved up i want to go east and work for some big dressmaker and study art drawing and become a highclass designer or do you think thats a kind of fiddlin ambition for a fellow i was brought up on a farm and then monkeyin round with silks i dont know what do you think myrtle cass says youre awfully educated  i am awfully tell me have the boys made fun of your ambition  she was seventy years old and sexless and more advisory than vida sherwin  well they have at that theyve jollied me a good deal here and minneapolis both they say dressmaking is ladies work but i was willing to get drafted for the war i tried to get in but they rejected me but i did try  i thought some of working up in a gents furnishings store and i had a chance to travel on the road for a clothing house but somehowi hate this tailoring but i cant seem to get enthusiastic about salesmanship i keep thinking about a room in gray oatmeal paper with prints in very narrow gold framesor would it be better in white enamel panelingbut anyway it looks out on fifth avenue and im designing a sumptuous he made it sumptooousrobe of linden green chiffon over cloth of gold you knowtileul its elegant    what do you think  why not what do you care for the opinion of city rowdies or a lot of farm boys but you mustnt you really mustnt let casual strangers like me have a chance to judge you  wellyou arent a stranger one way myrtle cassmiss cass should sayshes spoken about you so often i wanted to call on youand the doctorbut i didnt quite have the nerve one evening i walked past your house but you and your husband were talking on the porch and you looked so chummy and happy i didnt dare butt in  maternally i think its extremely nice of you to want to be trained inin enunciation by a stagedirector perhaps i could help you im a thoroughly sound and uninspired schoolmaam by instinct quite hopelessly mature  oh you arent either  she was not very successful at accepting his fervor with the air of amused woman of the world but she sounded reasonably impersonal thank you shall we see if we really can get up a new dramatic club ill tell you come to the house this evening about eight ill ask miss mullins to come over and well talk about it   vi   he has absolutely no sense of humor less than will but hasnt hewhat is a sense of humor isnt the thing he lacks the backslapping jocosity that passes for humor here anywaypoor lamb coaxing me to stay and play with him poor lonely lamb if he could be free from nat hickses from people who say dandy and bum would he develop  i wonder if whitman didnt use brooklyn backstreet slang as a boy  no not whitman hes keatssensitive to silken things innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tigermoths deepdamaskd wings keats here a bewildered spirit fallen on main street and main street laughs till it aches giggles till the spirit doubts his own self and tries to give up the use of wings for the correct uses of a gents furnishings store gopher prairie with its celebrated eleven miles of cement walk    i wonder how much of the cement is made out of the tombstones of john keatses   vii   kennicott was cordial to fern mullins teased her told her he was a great hand for running off with pretty schoolteachers and promised that if the schoolboard should object to her dancing he would bat em one over the head and tell em how lucky they were to get a girl with some go to her for once  but to erik valborg he was not cordial he shook hands loosely and said h are yuh  nat hicks was socially acceptable he had been here for years and owned his shop but this person was merely nats workman and the towns principle of perfect democracy was not meant to be applied indiscriminately  the conference on a dramatic club theoretically included kennicott but he sat back patting yawns conscious of ferns ankles smiling amiably on the children at their sport  fern wanted to tell her grievances carol was sulky every time she thought of the girl from kankakee it was erik who made suggestions he had read with astounding breadth and astounding lack of judgment his voice was sensitive to liquids but he overused the word glorious he mispronounced a tenth of the words he had from books but he knew it he was insistent but he was shy  when he demanded id like to stage suppressed desires by cook and miss glaspell carol ceased to be patronizing he was not the yearner he was the artist sure of his vision id make it simple use a big window at the back with a cyclorama of a blue that would simply hit you in the eye and just one treebranch to suggest a park below put the breakfast table on a dais let the colors be kind of arty and tearoomyorange chairs and orange and blue table and blue japanese breakfast set and some place one big flat smear of blackbang oh another play i wish we could do is tennyson jesses the black mask ive never seen it butglorious ending where this woman looks at the man with his face all blown away and she just gives one horrible scream  good god is that your idea of a glorious ending bayed kennicott  that sounds fierce i do love artistic things but not the horrible ones moaned fern mullins  erik was bewildered glanced at carol she nodded loyally  at the end of the conference they had decided nothing    chapter xxix  she had walked up the railroad track with hugh this sunday afternoon  she saw erik valborg coming in an ancient highwater suit tramping sullenly and alone striking at the rails with a stick for a second she unreasoningly wanted to avoid him but she kept on and she serenely talked about god whose voice hugh asserted made the humming in the telegraph wires erik stared straightened they greeted each other with hello  hugh say howdoyoudo to mr valborg  oh dear me hes got a button unbuttoned worried erik kneeling carol frowned then noted the strength with which he swung the baby in the air  may i walk along a piece with you  im tired lets rest on those ties then i must be trotting back  they sat on a heap of discarded railroad ties oak logs spotted with cinnamoncolored dryrot and marked with metallic brown streaks where iron plates had rested hugh learned that the pile was the hidingplace of injuns he went gunning for them while the elders talked of uninteresting things  the telegraph wires thrummed thrummed thrummed above them the rails were glaring hard lines the goldenrod smelled dusty across the track was a pasture of dwarf clover and sparse lawn cut by earthy cowpaths beyond its placid narrow green the rough immensity of new stubble jagged with wheatstacks like huge pineapples  erik talked of books flamed like a recent convert to any faith he exhibited as many titles and authors as possible halting only to appeal have you read his last book dont you think hes a terribly strong writer  she was dizzy but when he insisted youve been a librarian tell me do i read too much fiction she advised him loftily rather discursively he had she indicated never studied he had skipped from one emotion to another especiallyshe hesitated then flung it at himhe must not guess at pronunciations he must endure the nuisance of stopping to reach for the dictionary  im talking like a cranky teacher she sighed  no and i will study read the damned dictionary right through he crossed his legs and bent over clutching his ankle with both hands i know what you mean ive been rushing from picture to picture like a kid let loose in an art gallery for the first time you see its so awful recent that ive found there was a worldwell a world where beautiful things counted i was on the farm till i was nineteen dad is a good farmer but nothing else do you know why he first sent me off to learn tailoring i wanted to study drawing and he had a cousin thatd made a lot of money tailoring out in dakota and he said tailoring was a lot like drawing so he sent me down to a punk hole called curlew to work in a tailor shop up to that time id only had three months schooling a yearwalked to school two miles through snow up to my kneesand dad never would stand for my having a single book except schoolbooks  i never read a novel till i got dorothy vernon of haddon hall out of the library at curlew i thought it was the loveliest thing in the world next i read barriers burned away and then popes translation of homer some combination all right when i went to minneapolis just two years ago i guess id read pretty much everything in that curlew library but id never heard of rossetti or john sargent or balzac or brahms butyump ill study look here shall i get out of this tailoring this pressing and repairing  i dont see why a surgeon should spend very much time cobbling shoes  but what if i find i cant really draw and design after fussing around in new york or chicago id feel like a fool if i had to go back to work in a gents furnishings store  please say haberdashery  haberdashery all right ill remember he shrugged and spread his fingers wide  she was humbled by his humility she put away in her mind to take out and worry over later a speculation as to whether it was not she who was naive she urged what if you do have to go back most of us do we cant all be artistsmyself for instance we have to darn socks and yet were not content to think of nothing but socks and darningcotton id demand all i could getwhether i finally settled down to designing frocks or building temples or pressing pants what if you do drop back youll have had the adventure dont be too meek toward life go youre young youre unmarried try everything dont listen to nat hicks and sam clark and be a steady young manin order to help them make money youre still a blessed innocent go and play till the good people capture you  but i dont just want to play i want to make something beautiful god and i dont know enough do you get it do you understand nobody else ever has do you understand  yes  and sobut heres what bothers me i like fabrics dinky things like that little drawings and elegant words but look over there at those fields big new dont it seem kind of a shame to leave this and go back to the east and europe and do what all those people have been doing so long being careful about words when theres millions of bushels off wheat here reading this fellow pater when ive helped dad to clear fields  its good to clear fields but its not for you its one of our favorite american myths that broad plains necessarily make broad minds and high mountains make high purpose i thought that myself when i first came to the prairie bignew oh i dont want to deny the prairie future it will be magnificent but equally im hanged if i want to be bullied by it go to war on behalf of main street be bullied and bullied by the faith that the future is already here in the present and that all of us must stay and worship wheatstacks and insist that this is gods countryand never of course do anything original or gaycolored that would help to make that future anyway you dont belong here sam clark and nat hicks thats what our big newness has produced go before its too late as it has been forfor some of us young man go east and grow up with the revolution then perhaps you may come back and tell sam and nat and me what to do with the land weve been clearingif well listenif we dont lynch you first  he looked at her reverently she could hear him saying  ive always wanted to know a woman who would talk to me like that  her hearing was faulty he was saying nothing of the sort he was saying  why arent you happy with your husband  iyou  he doesnt care for the blessed innocent part of you does he  erik you mustnt  first you tell me to go and be free and then you say that i mustnt  i know but you mustntyou must be more impersonal  he glowered at her like a downy young owl she wasnt sure but she thought that he muttered im damned if i will she considered with wholesome fear the perils of meddling with other peoples destinies and she said timidly hadnt we better start back now  he mused youre younger than i am your lips are for songs about rivers in the morning and lakes at twilight i dont see how anybody could ever hurt you    yes we better go  he trudged beside her his eyes averted hugh experimentally took his thumb he looked down at the baby seriously he burst out all right ill do it ill stay here one year save not spend so much money on clothes and then ill go east to artschool work on the sidetailor shop dressmakers ill learn what im good for designing clothes stagesettings illustrating or selling collars to fat men all settled he peered at her unsmiling  can you stand it here in town for a year  with you to look at  please i mean dont the people here think youre an odd bird they do me i assure you  i dont know i never notice much oh they do kid me about not being in the armyespecially the old warhorses the old men that arent going themselves and this bogart boy and mr hickss sonhes a horrible brat but probably hes licensed to say what he thinks about his fathers hired man  hes beastly  they were in town they passed aunt bessies house aunt bessie and mrs bogart were at the window and carol saw that they were staring so intently that they answered her wave only with the stiffly raised hands of automatons in the next block mrs dr westlake was gaping from her porch carol said with an embarrassed quaver  i want to run in and see mrs westlake ill say goodby here  she avoided his eyes  mrs westlake was affable carol felt that she was expected to explain and while she was mentally asserting that shed be hanged if shed explain she was explaining  hugh captured that valborg boy up the track they became such good friends and i talked to him for a while id heard he was eccentric but really i found him quite intelligent crude but he readsreads almost the way dr westlake does  thats fine why does he stick here in town whats this i hear about his being interested in myrtle cass  i dont know is he im sure he isnt he said he was quite lonely besides myrtle is a babe in arms  twentyone if shes a day  wellis the doctor going to do any hunting this fall   ii   the need of explaining erik dragged her back into doubting for all his ardent reading and his ardent life was he anything but a smalltown youth bred on an illiberal farm and in cheap tailor shops he had rough hands she had been attracted only by hands that were fine and suave like those of her father delicate hands and resolute purpose but this boypowerful seamed hands and flabby will  its not appealing weakness like his but sane strength that will animate the gopher prairies onlydoes that mean anything or am i echoing vida the world has always let strong statesmen and soldiersthe men with strong voicestake control and what have the thundering boobies done what is strength  this classifying of people i suppose tailors differ as much as burglars or kings  erik frightened me when he turned on me of course he didnt mean anything but i mustnt let him be so personal  amazing impertinence  but he didnt mean to be  his hands are firm i wonder if sculptors dont have thick hands too  of course if there really is anything i can do to help the boy  though i despise these people who interfere he must be independent   iii   she wasnt altogether pleased the week after when erik was independent and without asking for her inspiration planned the tennis tournament it proved that he had learned to play in minneapolis that next to juanita haydock he had the best serve in town tennis was well spoken of in gopher prairie and almost never played there were three courts one belonging to harry haydock one to the cottages at the lake and one a rough field on the outskirts laid out by a defunct tennis association  erik had been seen in flannels and an imitation panama hat playing on the abandoned court with willis woodford the clerk in stowbodys bank suddenly he was going about proposing the reorganization of the tennis association and writing names in a fifteencent notebook bought for the purpose at dyers when he came to carol he was so excited over being an organizer that he did not stop to talk of himself and aubrey beardsley for more than ten minutes he begged will you get some of the folks to come in and she nodded agreeably  he proposed an informal exhibition match to advertise the association he suggested that carol and himself the haydocks the woodfords and the dillons play doubles and that the association be formed from the gathered enthusiasts he had asked harry haydock to be tentative president harry he reported had promised all right you bet but you go ahead and arrange things and ill ok em erik planned that the match should be held saturday afternoon on the old public court at the edge of town he was happy in being for the first time part of gopher prairie  through the week carol heard how select an attendance there was to be  kennicott growled that he didnt care to go  had he any objections to her playing with erik  no sure not she needed the exercise carol went to the match early the court was in a meadow out on the new antonia road only erik was there he was dashing about with a rake trying to make the court somewhat less like a plowed field he admitted that he had stage fright at the thought of the coming horde willis and mrs woodford arrived willis in homemade knickers and black sneakers through at the toe then dr and mrs harvey dillon people as harmless and grateful as the woodfords  carol was embarrassed and excessively agreeable like the bishops lady trying not to feel out of place at a baptist bazaar  they waited  the match was scheduled for three as spectators there assembled one youthful grocery clerk stopping his ford delivery wagon to stare from the seat and one solemn small boy tugging a smaller sister who had a careless nose  i wonder where the haydocks are they ought to show up at least said erik  carol smiled confidently at him and peered down the empty road toward town only heatwaves and dust and dusty weeds  at halfpast three no one had come and the grocery boy reluctantly got out cranked his ford glared at them in a disillusioned manner and rattled away the small boy and his sister ate grass and sighed  the players pretended to be exhilarated by practising service but they startled at each dustcloud from a motor car none of the cars turned into the meadownone till a quarter to four when kennicott drove in  carols heart swelled how loyal he is depend on him hed come if nobody else did even though he doesnt care for the game the old darling  kennicott did not alight he called out carrie harry haydock phoned me that theyve decided to hold the tennis matches or whatever you call em down at the cottages at the lake instead of here the bunch are down there now haydocks and dyers and clarks and everybody harry wanted to know if id bring you down i guess i can take the timecome right back after supper  before carol could sum it all up erik stammered why haydock didnt say anything to me about the change of course hes the president but  kennicott looked at him heavily and grunted i dont know a thing about it    coming carrie  i am not the match was to be here and it will be here you can tell harry haydock that hes beastly rude she rallied the five who had been left out who would always be left out come on well toss to see which four of us play the only and original first annual tennis tournament of forest hills del monte and gopher prairie  dont know as i blame you said kennicott well have supper at home then he drove off  she hated him for his composure he had ruined her defiance she felt much less like susan b anthony as she turned to her huddled followers  mrs dillon and willis woodford lost the toss the others played out the game slowly painfully stumbling on the rough earth muffing the easiest shots watched only by the small boy and his sniveling sister beyond the court stretched the eternal stubblefields the four marionettes awkwardly going through exercises insignificant in the hot sweep of contemptuous land were not heroic their voices did not ring out in the score but sounded apologetic and when the game was over they glanced about as though they were waiting to be laughed at  they walked home carol took eriks arm through her thin linen sleeve she could feel the crumply warmth of his familiar brown jersey coat she observed that there were purple and red gold threads interwoven with the brown she remembered the first time she had seen it  their talk was nothing but improvisations on the theme i never did like this haydock he just considers his own convenience ahead of them the dillons and woodfords spoke of the weather and b j gougerlings new bungalow no one referred to their tennis tournament at her gate carol shook hands firmly with erik and smiled at him  next morning sunday morning when carol was on the porch the haydocks drove up  we didnt mean to be rude to you dearie implored juanita i wouldnt have you think that for anything we planned that will and you should come down and have supper at our cottage  no im sure you didnt mean to be carol was superneighborly but i do think you ought to apologize to poor erik valborg he was terribly hurt  oh valborg i dont care so much what he thinks objected harry hes nothing but a conceited buttinsky juanita and i kind of figured he was trying to run this tennis thing too darn much anyway  but you asked him to make arrangements  i know but i dont like him good lord you couldnt hurt his feelings he dresses up like a chorus manand by golly he looks like onebut hes nothing but a swede farm boy and these foreigners they all got hides like a covey of rhinoceroses   but he is hurt  welli dont suppose i ought to have gone off halfcocked and not jollied him along ill give him a cigar hell  juanita had been licking her lips and staring at carol she interrupted her husband yes i do think harry ought to fix it up with him you like him dont you carol  over and through carol ran a frightened cautiousness like him i havent an ídea he seems to be a very decent young man i just felt that when hed worked so hard on the plans for the match it was a shame not to be nice to him  maybe theres something to that mumbled harry then at sight of kennicott coming round the corner tugging the red garden hose by its brass nozzle he roared in relief what d you think youre trying to do doc  while kennicott explained in detail all that he thought he was trying to do while he rubbed his chin and gravely stated struck me the grass was looking kind of brown in patchesdidnt know but what id give it a sprinkling and while harry agreed that this was an excellent idea juanita made friendly noises and behind the gilt screen of an affectionate smile watched carols face   iv   she wanted to see erik she wanted some one to play with there wasnt even so dignified and sound an excuse as having kennicotts trousers pressed when she inspected them all three pairs looked discouragingly neat she probably would not have ventured on it had she not spied nat hicks in the poolparlor being witty over bottlepool erik was alone she fluttered toward the tailor shop dashed into its slovenly heat with the comic fastidiousness of a humming bird dipping into a dry tigerlily it was after she had entered that she found an excuse  erik was in the back room crosslegged on a long table sewing a vest but he looked as though he were doing this eccentric thing to amuse himself  hello i wonder if you couldnt plan a sportssuit for me she said breathlessly  he stared at her he protested no i wont god im not going to be a tailor with you  why erik she said like a mildly shocked mother  it occurred to her that she did not need a suit and that the order might have been hard to explain to kennicott  he swung down from the table i want to show you something he rummaged in the rolltop desk on which nat hicks kept bills buttons calendars buckles threadchanneled wax shotgun shells samples of brocade for fancy vests fishingreels pornographic postcards shreds of buckram lining he pulled out a blurred sheet of bristol board and anxiously gave it to her it was a sketch for a frock it was not well drawn it was too finicking the pillars in the background were grotesquely squat but the frock had an original back very low with a central triangular section from the waist to a string of jet beads at the neck  its stunning but how it would shock mrs clark  yes wouldnt it  you must let yourself go more when youre drawing  dont know if i can ive started kind of late but listen what do you think ive done this two weeks ive read almost clear through a latin grammar and about twenty pages of caesar  splendid you are lucky you havent a teacher to make you artificial  youre my teacher  there was a dangerous edge of personality to his voice she was offended and agitated she turned her shoulder on him stared through the back window studying this typical center of a typical main street block a vista hidden from casual strollers the backs of the chief establishments in town surrounded a quadrangle neglected dirty and incomparably dismal from the front howland  goulds grocery was smug enough but attached to the rear was a leanto of storm streaked pine lumber with a sanded tar roofa staggering doubtful shed behind which was a heap of ashes splintered packingboxes shreds of excelsior crumpled strawboard broken olivebottles rotten fruit and utterly disintegrated vegetables orange carrots turning black and potatoes with ulcers the rear of the bon ton store was grim with blistered blackpainted iron shutters under them a pile of once glossy red shirtboxes now a pulp from recent rain  as seen from main street oleson  mcguires meat market had a sanitary and virtuous expression with its new tile counter fresh sawdust on the floor and a hanging veal cut in rosettes but she now viewed a back room with a homemade refrigerator of yellow smeared with black grease a man in an apron spotted with dry blood was hoisting out a hard slab of meat  behind billys lunch the cook in an apron which must long ago have been white smoked a pipe and spat at the pest of sticky flies in the center of the block by itself was the stable for the three horses of the drayman and beside it a pile of manure  the rear of ezra stowbodys bank was whitewashed and back of it was a concrete walk and a threefoot square of grass but the window was barred and behind the bars she saw willis woodford cramped over figures in pompous books he raised his head jerkily rubbed his eyes and went back to the eternity of figures  the backs of the other shops were an impressionistic picture of dirty grays drained browns writhing heaps of refuse  mine is a backyard romancewith a journeyman tailor  she was saved from selfpity as she began to think through eriks mind she turned to him with an indignant its disgusting that this is all you have to look at  he considered it outside there i dont notice much im learning to look inside not awful easy  yes    i must be hurrying  as she walked homewithout hurryingshe remembered her father saying to a serious tenyearold carol lady only a fool thinks hes superior to beautiful bindings but only a doubledistilled fool reads nothing but bindings  she was startled by the return of her father startled by a sudden conviction that in this flaxen boy she had found the gray reticent judge who was divine love perfect understanding she debated it furiously denied it reaffirmed it ridiculed it of one thing she was unhappily certain there was nothing of the beloved father image in will kennicott   v   she wondered why she sang so often and why she found so many pleasant thingslamplight seen though trees on a cool evening sunshine on brown wood morning sparrows black sloping roofs turned to plates of silver by moonlight pleasant things small friendly things and pleasant placesa field of goldenrod a pasture by the creekand suddenly a wealth of pleasant people vida was lenient to carol at the surgicaldressing class mrs dave dyer flattered her with questions about her health baby cook and opinions on the war  mrs dyer seemed not to share the towns prejudice against erik hes a nicelooking fellow we must have him go on one of our picnics some time unexpectedly dave dyer also liked him the tightfisted little farceur had a confused reverence for anything that seemed to him refined or clever he answered harry haydocks sneers thats all right now elizabeth may doll himself up too much but hes smart and dont you forget it i was asking round trying to find out where this ukraine is and darn if he didnt tell me whats the matter with his talking so polite hells bells harry no harm in being polite theres some regular hemen that are just as polite as women prett near  carol found herself going about rejoicing how neighborly the town is she drew up with a dismayed am i falling in love with this boy thats ridiculous im merely interested in him i like to think of helping him to succeed  but as she dusted the livingroom mended a collarband bathed hugh she was picturing herself and a young artistan apollo nameless and evasivebuilding a house in the berkshires or in virginia exuberantly buying a chair with his first check reading poetry together and frequently being earnest over valuable statistics about labor tumbling out of bed early for a sunday walk and chattering where kennicott would have yawned over bread and butter by a lake hugh was in her pictures and he adored the young artist who made castles of chairs and rugs for him beyond these playtimes she saw the things i could do for erikand she admitted that erik did partly make up the image of her altogether perfect artist  in panic she insisted on being attentive to kennicott when he wanted to be left alone to read the newspaper   vi   she needed new clothes kennicott had promised well have a good trip down to the cities in the fall and take plenty of time for it and you can get your new gladrags then but as she examined her wardrobe she flung her ancient black velvet frock on the floor and raged theyre disgraceful everything i have is falling to pieces  there was a new dressmaker and milliner a mrs swiftwaite it was said that she was not altogether an elevating influence in the way she glanced at men that she would as soon take away a legally appropriated husband as not that if there was any mr swiftwaite it certainly was strange that nobody seemed to know anything about him but she had made for rita gould an organdy frock and hat to match universally admitted to be too cunning for words and the matrons went cautiously with darting eyes and excessive politeness to the rooms which mrs swiftwaite had taken in the old luke dawson house on floral avenue  with none of the spiritual preparation which normally precedes the buying of new clothes in gopher prairie carol marched into mrs swiftwaites and demanded i want to see a hat and possibly a blouse  in the dingy old front parlor which she had tried to make smart with a pier glass covers from fashion magazines anemic french prints mrs swiftwaite moved smoothly among the dressdummies and hatrests spoke smoothly as she took up a small black and red turban i am sure the lady will find this extremely attractive  its dreadfully tabby and smalltowny thought carol while she soothed i dont believe it quite goes with me  its the choicest thing i have and im sure youll find it suits you beautifully it has a great deal of chic please try it on said mrs swiftwaite more smoothly than ever  carol studied the woman she was as imitative as a glass diamond she was the more rustic in her effort to appear urban she wore a severe highcollared blouse with a row of small black buttons which was becoming to her lowbreasted slim neatness but her skirt was hysterically checkered her cheeks were too highly rouged her lips too sharply penciled she was magnificently a specimen of the illiterate divorcee of forty made up to look thirty clever and alluring  while she was trying on the hat carol felt very condescending she took it off shook her head explained with the kind smile for inferiors im afraid it wont do though its unusually nice for so small a town as this  but its really absolutely newyorkish  well it  you see i know my new york styles i lived in new york for years besides almost a year in akron  you did carol was polite and edged away and went home unhappily she was wondering whether her own airs were as laughable as mrs swiftwaites she put on the eyeglasses which kennicott had recently given to her for reading and looked over a grocery bill she went hastily up to her room to her mirror she was in a mood of selfdepreciation accurately or not this was the picture she saw in the mirror  neat rimless eyeglasses black hair clumsily tucked under a mauve straw hat which would have suited a spinster cheeks clear bloodless thin nose gentle mouth and chin a modest voile blouse with an edging of lace at the neck a virginal sweetness and timorousnessno flare of gaiety no suggestion of cities music quick laughter  i have become a smalltown woman absolute typical modest and moral and safe protected from life genteel the village virusthe village virtuousness my hairjust scrambled together what can erik see in that wedded spinster there he does like me because im the only woman whos decent to him how long before hell wake up to me    ive waked up to myself    am i as old asas old as i am  not really old become careless let myself look tabby  i want to chuck every stitch i own black hair and pale cheekstheyd go with a spanish dancers costumerose behind my ear scarlet mantilla over one shoulder the other bare  she seized the rouge sponge daubed her cheeks scratched at her lips with the vermilion pencil until they stung tore open her collar she posed with her thin arms in the attitude of the fandango she dropped them sharply she shook her head my heart doesnt dance she said she flushed as she fastened her blouse  at least im much more graceful than fern mullins heavens when i came here from the cities girls imitated me now im trying to imitate a city girl    chapter xxx  fern mullins rushed into the house on a saturday morning early in september and shrieked at carol school starts next tuesday ive got to have one more spree before im arrested lets get up a picnic down the lake for this afternoon wont you come mrs kennicott and the doctor cy bogart wants to gohes a brat but hes lively  i dont think the doctor can go sedately he said something about having to make a country call this afternoon but id love to  thats dandy who can we get  mrs dyer might be chaperon shes been so nice and maybe dave if he could get away from the store  how about erik valborg i think hes got lots more style than these town boys you like him all right dont you  so the picnic of carol fern erik cy bogart and the dyers was not only moral but inevitable  they drove to the birch grove on the south shore of lake minniemashie dave dyer was his most clownish self he yelped jigged wore carols hat dropped an ant down ferns back and when they went swimming the women modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up the men undressing behind the bushes constantly repeating gee hope we dont run into poison ivy dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wifes ankle he infected the others erik gave an imitation of the greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a laprobe on the grass cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them  but carol could not frolic  she had made herself young with parted hair sailor blouse and large blue bow white canvas shoes and short linen skirt her mirror had asserted that she looked exactly as she had in college that her throat was smooth her collarbone not very noticeable but she was under restraint when they swam she enjoyed the freshness of the water but she was irritated by cys tricks by daves excessive good spirits she admired eriks dance he could never betray bad taste as cy did and dave she waited for him to come to her he did not come by his joyousness he had apparently endeared himself to the dyers maud watched him and after supper cried to him come sit down beside me bad boy carol winced at his willingness to be a bad boy and come and sit at his enjoyment of a not very stimulating game in which maud dave and cy snatched slices of cold tongue from one anothers plates maud it seemed was slightly dizzy from the swim she remarked publicly dr kennicott has helped me so much by putting me on a diet but it was to erik alone that she gave the complete version of her peculiarity in being so sensitive so easily hurt by the slightest cross word that she simply had to have nice cheery friends  erik was nice and cheery  carol assured herself whatever faults i may have i certainly couldnt ever be jealous i do like maud shes always so pleasant but i wonder if she isnt just a bit fond of fishing for mens sympathy playing with erik and her marriedwellbut she looks at him in that languishing swooning midvictorian way disgusting  cy bogart lay between the roots of a big birch smoking his pipe and teasing fern assuring her that a week from now when he was again a highschool boy and she his teacher hed wink at her in class maud dyer wanted erik to come down to the beach to see the darling little minnies carol was left to dave who tried to entertain her with humorous accounts of ella stowbodys fondness for chocolate peppermints she watched maud dyer put her hand on eriks shoulder to steady herself  disgusting she thought  cy bogart covered ferns nervous hand with his red paw and when she bounced with halfanger and shrieked let go i tell you he grinned and waved his pipea gangling twentyyearold satyr  disgusting  when maud and erik returned and the grouping shifted erik muttered at carol theres a boat on shore lets skip off and have a row  what will they think she worried she saw maud dyer peer at erik with moist possessive eyes yes lets she said  she cried to the party with the canonical amount of sprightliness goodby everybody well wireless you from china  as the rhythmic oars plopped and creaked as she floated on an unreality of delicate gray over which the sunset was poured out thin the irritation of cy and maud slipped away erik smiled at her proudly she considered himcoatless in white thin shirt she was conscious of his male differentness of his flat masculine sides his thin thighs his easy rowing they talked of the library of the movies he hummed and she softly sang swing low sweet chariot a breeze shivered across the agate lake the wrinkled water was like armor damascened and polished the breeze flowed round the boat in a chill current carol drew the collar of her middy blouse over her bare throat  getting cold afraid well have to go back she said  lets not go back to them yet theyll be cutting up lets keep along the shore  but you enjoy the cutting up maud and you had a beautiful time  why we just walked on the shore and talked about fishing  she was relieved and apologetic to her friend maud of course i was joking  ill tell you lets land here and sit on the shorethat bunch of hazelbrush will shelter us from the windand watch the sunset its like melted lead just a short while we dont want to go back and listen to them  no but she said nothing while he sped ashore the keel clashed on the stones he stood on the forward seat holding out his hand they were alone in the ripplelapping silence she rose slowly slowly stepped over the water in the bottom of the old boat she took his hand confidently unspeaking they sat on a bleached log in a russet twilight which hinted of autumn linden leaves fluttered about them  i wishare you cold now he whispered  a little she shivered but it was not with cold  i wish we could curl up in the leaves there covered all up and lie looking out at the dark  i wish we could as though it was comfortably understood that he did not mean to be taken seriously  like what all the poets saybrown nymph and faun  no i cant be a nymph any more too olderik am i old am i faded and smalltowny  why youre the youngestyour eyes are like a girls theyre sowell i mean like you believed everything even if you do teach me i feel a thousand years older than you instead of maybe a year younger  four or five years younger  anyway your eyes are so innocent and your cheeks so softdamn it it makes me want to cry somehow youre so defenseless and i want to protect you andtheres nothing to protect you against  am i young am i honestly truly she betrayed for a moment the childish mockimploring tone that comes into the voice of the most serious woman when an agreeable man treats her as a girl the childish tone and childish pursedup lips and shy lift of the cheek  yes you are  youre dear to believe it willerik  will you play with me a lot  perhaps  would you really like to curl in the leaves and watch the stars swing by overhead  i think its rather better to be sitting here he twined his fingers with hers and erik we must go back  why  its somewhat late to outline all the history of social custom  i know we must are you glad we ran away though  yes she was quiet perfectly simple but she rose  he circled her waist with a brusque arm she did not resist she did not care he was neither a peasant tailor a potential artist a social complication nor a peril he was himself and in him in the personality flowing from him she was unreasoningly content in his nearness she caught a new view of his head the last light brought out the planes of his neck his flat ruddied cheeks the side of his nose the depression of his temples not as coy or uneasy lovers but as companions they walked to the boat and he lifted her up on the prow  she began to talk intently as he rowed erik youve got to work you ought to be a personage youre robbed of your kingdom fight for it take one of these correspondence courses in drawingthey maynt be any good in themselves but theyll make you try to draw and  as they reached the picnic ground she perceived that it was dark that they had been gone for a long time  what will they say she wondered  the others greeted them with the inevitable storm of humor and slight vexation where the deuce do you think youve been youre a fine pair you are erik and carol looked selfconscious failed in their effort to be witty all the way home carol was embarrassed once cy winked at her that cy the peeping tom of the garageloft should consider her a fellowsinnershe was furious and frightened and exultant by turns and in all her moods certain that kennicott would read her adventuring in her face  she came into the house awkwardly defiant  her husband half asleep under the lamp greeted her well well have nice time  she could not answer he looked at her but his look did not sharpen he began to wind his watch yawning the old welllllll guess its about time to turn in  that was all yet she was not glad she was almost disappointed   ii   mrs bogart called next day she had a henlike crumbpecking diligent appearance her smile was too innocent the pecking started instantly  cy says you had lots of fun at the picnic yesterday did you enjoy it  oh yes i raced cy at swimming he beat me badly hes so strong isnt he  poor boy just crazy to get into the war too butthis erik valborg was along want he  yes  i think hes an awful handsome fellow and they say hes smart do you like him  he seems very polite  cy says you and him had a lovely boatride my that must have been pleasant  yes except that i couldnt get mr valborg to say a word i wanted to ask him about the suit mr hicks is making for my husband but he insisted on singing still it was restful floating around on the water and singing so happy and innocent dont you think its a shame mrs bogart that people in this town dont do more nice clean things like that instead of all this horrible gossiping  yes    yes  mrs bogart sounded vacant her bonnet was awry she was incomparably dowdy carol stared at her felt contemptuous ready at last to rebel against the trap and as the rusty goodwife fished again plannin some more picnics she flung out i havent the slightest idea oh is that hugh crying i must run up to him  but upstairs she remembered that mrs bogart had seen her walking with erik from the railroad track into town and she was chilly with disquietude  at the jolly seventeen two days after she was effusive to maud dyer to juanita haydock she fancied that every one was watching her but she could not be sure and in rare strong moments she did not care she could rebel against the towns prying now that she had something however indistinct for which to rebel  in a passionate escape there must be not only a place from which to flee but a place to which to flee she had known that she would gladly leave gopher prairie leave main street and all that it signified but she had had no destination she had one now that destination was not erik valborg and the love of erik she continued to assure herself that she wasnt in love with him but merely fond of him and interested in his success yet in him she had discovered both her need of youth and the fact that youth would welcome her it was not erik to whom she must escape but universal and joyous youth in classrooms in studios in offices in meetings to protest against things in general    but universal and joyous youth rather resembled erik  all week she thought of things she wished to say to him high improving things she began to admit that she was lonely without him then she was afraid  it was at the baptist church supper a week after the picnic that she saw him again she had gone with kennicott and aunt bessie to the supper which was spread on oilclothcovered and trestlesupported tables in the church basement erik was helping myrtle cass to fill coffee cups for the waitresses the congregation had doffed their piety children tumbled under the tables and deacon pierson greeted the women with a rolling wheres brother jones sister wheres brother jones not going to be with us tonight well you tell sister perry to hand you a plate and make em give you enough oyster pie  erik shared in the cheerfulness he laughed with myrtle jogged her elbow when she was filling cups made deep mock bows to the waitresses as they came up for coffee myrtle was enchanted by his humor from the other end of the room a matron among matrons carol observed myrtle and hated her and caught herself at it to be jealous of a woodenfaced village girl but she kept it up she detested erik gloated over his gaucherieshis breaks she called them when he was too expressive too much like a russian dancer in saluting deacon pierson carol had the ecstasy of pain in seeing the deacons sneer when trying to talk to three girls at once he dropped a cup and effeminately wailed oh dear she sympathized withand ached overthe insulting secret glances of the girls  from meanly hating him she rose to compassion as she saw that his eyes begged every one to like him she perceived how inaccurate her judgments could be at the picnic she had fancied that maud dyer looked upon erik too sentimentally and she had snarled i hate these married women who cheapen themselves and feed on boys but at the supper maud was one of the waitresses she bustled with platters of cake she was pleasant to old women and to erik she gave no attention at all indeed when she had her own supper she joined the kennicotts and how ludicrous it was to suppose that maud was a gourmet of emotions carol saw in the fact that she talked not to one of the town beaux but to the safe kennicott himself  when carol glanced at erik again she discovered that mrs bogart had an eye on her it was a shock to know that at last there was something which could make her afraid of mrs bogarts spying  what am i doing am i in love with erik unfaithful i i want youth but i dont want himi mean i dont want youthenough to break up my life i must get out of this quick  she said to kennicott on their way home will i want to run away for a few days wouldnt you like to skip down to chicago  still be pretty hot there no fun in a big city till winter what do you want to go for  people to occupy my mind i want stimulus  stimulus he spoke goodnaturedly whos been feeding you meat you got that stimulus out of one of these fool stories about wives that dont know when theyre well off stimulus seriously though to cut out the jollying i cant get away  then why dont i run off by myself  whytisnt the money you understand but what about hugh  leave him with aunt bessie it would be just for a few days  i dont think much of this business of leaving kids around bad for em  so you dont think  ill tell you i think we better stay put till after the war then well have a dandy long trip no i dont think you better plan much about going away now  so she was thrown at erik   iii   she awoke at ebbtime at three of the morning woke sharply and fully and sharply and coldly as her father pronouncing sentence on a cruel swindler she gave judgment  a pitiful and tawdry loveaffair  no splendor no defiance a selfdeceived little woman whispering in corners with a pretentious little man  no he is not he is fine aspiring its not his fault his eyes are sweet when he looks at me sweet so sweet  she pitied herself that her romance should be pitiful she sighed that in this colorless hour to this austere self it should seem tawdry  then in a very great desire of rebellion and unleashing of all her hatreds the pettier and more tawdry it is the more blame to main street it shows how much ive been longing to escape any way out any humility so long as i can flee main street has done this to me i came here eager for nobilities ready for work and nowany way out  i came trusting them they beat me with rods of dullness they dont know they dont understand how agonizing their complacent dullness is like ants and august sun on a wound  tawdry pitiful carolthe clean girl that used to walk so fastsneaking and tittering in dark corners being sentimental and jealous at church suppers  at breakfasttime her agonies were nightblurred and persisted only as a nervous irresolution   iv   few of the aristocrats of the jolly seventeen attended the humble folkmeets of the baptist and methodist church suppers where the willis woodfords the dillons the champ perrys oleson the butcher brad bemis the tinsmith and deacon pierson found release from loneliness but all of the smart set went to the lawnfestivals of the episcopal church and were reprovingly polite to outsiders  the harry haydocks gave the last lawnfestival of the season a splendor of japanese lanterns and cardtables and chicken patties and neapolitan icecream erik was no longer entirely an outsider he was eating his icecream with a group of the people most solidly inthe dyers myrtle cass guy pollock the jackson elders the haydocks themselves kept aloof but the others tolerated him he would never carol fancied be one of the town pillars because he was not orthodox in hunting and motoring and poker but he was winning approbation by his liveliness his gaietythe qualities least important in him  when the group summoned carol she made several very welltaken points in regard to the weather  myrtle cried to erik come on we dont belong with these old folks i want to make you quainted with the jolliest girl she comes from wakamin shes staying with mary howland  carol saw him being profuse to the guest from wakamin she saw him confidentially strolling with myrtle she burst out to mrs westlake valborg and myrtle seem to have quite a crush on each other  mrs westlake glanced at her curiously before she mumbled yes dont they  im mad to talk this way carol worried  she had regained a feeling of social virtue by telling juanita haydock how darling her lawn looked with the japanese lanterns when she saw that erik was stalking her though he was merely ambling about with his hands in his pockets though he did not peep at her she knew that he was calling her she sidled away from juanita erik hastened to her she nodded coolly she was proud of her coolness  carol ive got a wonderful chance dont know but what some ways it might be better than going east to take art myrtle cass saysi dropped in to say howdy to myrtle last evening and had quite a long talk with her father and he said he was hunting for a fellow to go to work in the flour mill and learn the whole business and maybe become general manager i know something about wheat from my farming and i worked a couple of months in the flour mill at curlew when i got sick of tailoring what do you think you said any work was artistic if it was done by an artist and flour is so important what do you think  wait wait  this sensitive boy would be very skilfully stamped into conformity by lyman cass and his sallow daughter but did she detest the plan for this reason i must be honest i mustnt tamper with his future to please my vanity but she had no sure vision she turned on him  how can i decide its up to you do you want to become a person like lym cass or do you want to become a person likeyes like me wait dont be flattering be honest this is important  i know i am a person like you now i mean i want to rebel  yes were alike gravely  only im not sure i can put through my schemes i really cant draw much i guess i have pretty fair taste in fabrics but since ive known you i dont like to think about fussing with dressdesigning but as a miller id have the meansbooks piano travel  im going to be frank and beastly dont you realize that it isnt just because her papa needs a bright young man in the mill that myrtle is amiable to you cant you understand what shell do to you when she has you when she sends you to church and makes you become respectable  he glared at her i dont know i suppose so  you are thoroughly unstable  what if i am most fish out of water are dont talk like mrs bogart how can i be anything but unstablewandering from farm to tailor shop to books no training nothing but trying to make books talk to me probably ill fail oh i know it probably im uneven but im not unstable in thinking about this job in the milland myrtle i know what i want i want you  please please oh please  i do im not a schoolboy any more i want you if i take myrtle its to forget you  please please  its you that are unstable you talk at things and play at things but youre scared would i mind it if you and i went off to poverty and i had to dig ditches i would not but you would i think you would come to like me but you wont admit it i wouldnt have said this but when you sneer at myrtle and the millif im not to have good sensible things like those d you think ill be content with trying to become a damn dressmaker after you are you fair are you  no i suppose not  do you like me do you  yesno please i cant talk any more  not here mrs haydock is looking at us  no nor anywhere o erik i am fond of you but im afraid  what of  of them of my rulersgopher prairie    my dear boy we are talking very foolishly i am a normal wife and a good mother and you areoh a college freshman  you do like me im going to make you love me  she looked at him once recklessly and walked away with a serene gait that was a disordered flight  kennicott grumbled on their way home you and this valborg fellow seem quite chummy  oh we are hes interested in myrtle cass and i was telling him how nice she is  in her room she marveled i have become a liar im snarled with lies and foggy analyses and desiresi who was clear and sure  she hurried into kennicotts room sat on the edge of his bed he flapped a drowsy welcoming hand at her from the expanse of quilt and dented pillows  will i really think i ought to trot off to st paul or chicago or some place  i thought we settled all that few nights ago wait till we can have a real trip he shook himself out of his drowsiness you might give me a goodnight kiss  she diddutifully he held her lips against his for an intolerable time dont you like the old man any more he coaxed he sat up and shyly fitted his palm about the slimness of her waist  of course i like you very much indeed even to herself it sounded flat she longed to be able to throw into her voice the facile passion of a light woman she patted his cheek  he sighed im sorry youre so tired seems likebut of course you arent very strong  yes    then you dont thinkyoure quite sure i ought to stay here in town  i told you so i certainly do  she crept back to her room a small timorous figure in white  i cant face will downdemand the right hed be obstinate and i cant even go off and earn my living again out of the habit of it hes driving meim afraid of what hes driving me to afraid  that man in there snoring in stale air my husband could any ceremony make him my husband  no i dont want to hurt him i want to love him i cant when im thinking of erik am i too honesta funny topsyturvy honestythe faithfulness of unfaith i wish i had a more compartmental mind like men im too monogamoustoward erikmy child erik who needs me  is an illicit affair like a gambling debtdemands stricter honor than the legitimate debt of matrimony because its not legally enforced  thats nonsense i dont care in the least for erik not for any man i want to be let alone in a woman worlda world without main street or politicians or business men or men with that sudden beastly hungry look that glistening unfrank expression that wives know  if erik were here if he would just sit quiet and kind and talk i could be still i could go to sleep  i am so tired if i could sleep    chapter xxxi  their night came unheralded  kennicott was on a country call it was cool but carol huddled on the porch rocking meditating rocking the house was lonely and repellent and though she sighed i ought to go in and readso many things to readought to go in she remained suddenly erik was coming turning in swinging open the screen door touching her hand  erik  saw your husband driving out of town couldnt stand it  wellyou mustnt stay more than five minutes  couldnt stand not seeing you every day towards evening felt i had to see youpictured you so clear ive been good though staying away havent i  and you must go on being good  why must i  we better not stay here on the porch the howlands across the street are such windowpeepers and mrs bogart  she did not look at him but she could divine his tremulousness as he stumbled indoors a moment ago the night had been coldly empty now it was incalculable hot treacherous but it is women who are the calm realists once they discard the fetishes of the premarital hunt carol was serene as she murmured hungry i have some little honeycolored cakes you may have two and then you must skip home  take me up and let me see hugh asleep  i dont believe  just a glimpse  well  she doubtfully led the way to the hallroomnursery their heads close eriks curls pleasant as they touched her cheek they looked in at the baby hugh was pink with slumber he had burrowed into his pillow with such energy that it was almost smothering him beside it was a celluloid rhinoceros tight in his hand a torn picture of old king cole  shhh said carol quite automatically she tiptoed in to pat the pillow as she returned to erik she had a friendly sense of his waiting for her they smiled at each other she did not think of kennicott the babys father what she did think was that some one rather like erik an older and surer erik ought to be hughs father the three of them would playincredible imaginative games  carol youve told me about your own room let me peep in at it  but you mustnt stay not a second we must go downstairs  yes  will you be good  rreasonably he was pale largeeyed serious  youve got to be more than reasonably good she felt sensible and superior she was energetic about pushing open the door  kennicott had always seemed out of place there but erik surprisingly harmonized with the spirit of the room as he stroked the books glanced at the prints he held out his hands he came toward her she was weak betrayed to a warm softness her head was tilted back her eyes were closed her thoughts were formless but manycolored she felt his kiss diffident and reverent on her eyelid  then she knew that it was impossible  she shook herself she sprang from him please she said sharply  he looked at her unyielding  i am fond of you she said dont spoil everything be my friend  how many thousands and millions of women must have said that and now you and it doesnt spoil everything it glorifies everything  dear i do think theres a tiny streak of fairy in youwhatever you do with it perhaps id have loved that once but i wont its too late but ill keep a fondness for you impersonali will be impersonal it neednt be just a thin talky fondness you do need me dont you only you and my son need me ive wanted so to be wanted once i wanted love to be given to me now ill be content if i can give    almost content  we women we like to do things for men poor men we swoop on you when youre defenseless and fuss over you and insist on reforming you but its so pitifully deep in us youll be the one thing in which i havent failed do something definite even if its just selling cottons sell beautiful cottonscaravans from china  carol stop you do love me  i do not its justcant you understand everything crushes in on me so all the gaping dull people and i look for a way outplease go i cant stand any more please  he was gone and she was not relieved by the quiet of the house she was empty and the house was empty and she needed him she wanted to go on talking to get this threshed out to build a sane friendship she wavered down to the livingroom looked out of the baywindow he was not to be seen but mrs westlake was she was walking past and in the light from the corner arclamp she quickly inspected the porch the windows carol dropped the curtain stood with movement and reflection paralyzed automatically without reasoning she mumbled i will see him again soon and make him understand we must be friends butthe house is so empty it echoes so   ii   kennicott had seemed nervous and absentminded through that supperhour two evenings after he prowled about the livingroom then growled  what the dickens have you been saying to ma westlake  carols book rattled what do you mean  i told you that westlake and his wife were jealous of us and here you been chumming up to them andfrom what dave tells me ma westlake has been going around town saying you told her that you hate aunt bessie and that you fixed up your own room because i snore and you said bjornstam was too good for bea and then just recent that you were sore on the town because we dont all go down on our knees and beg this valborg fellow to come take supper with us god only knows what else she says you said  its not true any of it i did like mrs westlake and ive called on her and apparently shes gone and twisted everything ive said  sure of course she would didnt i tell you she would shes an old cat like her pussyfooting handholding husband lord if i was sick id rather have a faithhealer than westlake and shes another slice off the same bacon what i cant understand though  she waited taut  is whatever possessed you to let her pump you bright a girl as you are i dont care what you told herwe all get peeved sometimes and want to blow off steam thats naturalbut if you wanted to keep it dark why didnt you advertise it in the dauntless or get a megaphone and stand on top of the hotel and holler or do anything besides spill it to her  i know you told me but she was so motherly and i didnt have any womanvida s become so married and proprietary  well next time youll have better sense  he patted her head flumped down behind his newspaper said nothing more  enemies leered through the windows stole on her from the hall she had no one save erik this kind good man kennicotthe was an elder brother it was erik her fellow outcast to whom she wanted to run for sanctuary through her storm she was to the eye sitting quietly with her fingers between the pages of a babyblue book on homedressmaking but her dismay at mrs westlakes treachery had risen to active dread what had the woman said of her and erik what did she know what had she seen who else would join in the baying hunt who else had seen her with erik what had she to fear from the dyers cy bogart juanita aunt bessie what precisely had she answered to mrs bogarts questioning  all next day she was too restless to stay home yet as she walked the streets on fictitious errands she was afraid of every person she met she waited for them to speak waited with foreboding she repeated i mustnt ever see erik again but the words did not register she had no ecstatic indulgence in the sense of guilt which is to the women of main street the surest escape from blank tediousness  at five crumpled in a chair in the livingroom she started at the sound of the bell some one opened the door she waited uneasy vida sherwin charged into the room heres the one person i can trust carol rejoiced  vida was serious but affectionate she bustled at carol with oh there you are dearie so glad t find you in sit down want to talk to you  carol sat obedient  vida fussily tugged over a large chair and launched out  ive been hearing vague rumors you were interested in this erik valborg i knew you couldnt be guilty and im surer than ever of it now here we are as blooming as a daisy  how does a respectable matron look when she feels guilty  carol sounded resentful  whyoh it would show besides i know that you of all people are the one that can appreciate dr will  what have you been hearing  nothing really i just heard mrs bogart say shed seen you and valborg walking together a lot vidas chirping slackened she looked at her nails buti suspect you do like valborg oh i dont mean in any wrong way but youre young you dont know what an innocent liking might drift into you always pretend to be so sophisticated and all but youre a baby just because you are so innocent you dont know what evil thoughts may lurk in that fellows brain  you dont suppose valborg could actually think about making love to me  her rather cheap sport ended abruptly as vida cried with contorted face what do you know about the thoughts in hearts you just play at reforming the world you dont know what it means to suffer  there are two insults which no human being will endure the assertion that he hasnt a sense of humor and the doubly impertinent assertion that he has never known trouble carol said furiously you think i dont suffer you think ive always had an easy  no you dont im going to tell you something ive never told a living soul not even ray the dam of repressed imagination which vida had builded for years which now with raymie off at the wars she was building again gave way  i wasi liked will terribly well one time at a partyoh before he met you of coursebut we held hands and we were so happy but i didnt feel i was really suited to him i let him go please dont think i still love him i see now that ray was predestined to be my mate but because i liked him i know how sincere and pure and noble will is and his thoughts never straying from the path of rectitude andif i gave him up to you at least youve got to appreciate him we danced together and laughed so and i gave him up butthis is my affair im not intruding i see the whole thing as he does because of all ive told you maybe its shameless to bare my heart this way but i do it for himfor him and you  carol understood that vida believed herself to have recited minutely and brazenly a story of intimate love understood that in alarm she was trying to cover her shame as she struggled on liked him in the most honorable waysimply cant help it if i still see things through his eyesif i gave him up i certainly am not beyond my rights in demanding that you take care to avoid even the appearance of evil and she was weeping an insignificant flushed ungracefully weeping woman  carol could not endure it she ran to vida kissed her forehead comforted her with a murmur of dovelike sounds sought to reassure her with worn and hastily assembled gifts of words oh i appreciate it so much and you are so fine and splendid and let me assure you there isnt a thing to what youve heard and oh indeed i do know how sincere will is and as you say soso sincere  vida believed that she had explained many deep and devious matters she came out of her hysteria like a sparrow shaking off raindrops she sat up and took advantage of her victory  i dont want to rub it in but you can see for yourself now this is all a result of your being so discontented and not appreciating the dear good people here and another thing people like you and me who want to reform things have to be particularly careful about appearances think how much better you can criticize conventional customs if you yourself live up to them scrupulously then people cant say youre attacking them to excuse your own infractions  to carol was given a sudden great philosophical understanding an explanation of half the cautious reforms in history yes ive heard that plea its a good one it sets revolts aside to cool it keeps strays in the flock to word it differently you must live up to the popular code if you believe in it but if you dont believe in it then you must live up to it  i dont think so at all said vida vaguely she began to look hurt and carol let her be oracular   iii   vida had done her a service had made all agonizing seem so fatuous that she ceased writhing and saw that her whole problem was simple as mutton she was interested in eriks aspiration interest gave her a hesitating fondness for him and the future would take care of the event    but at night thinking in bed she protested im not a falsely accused innocent though if it were some one more resolute than erik a fighter an artist with bearded surly lipstheyre only in books is that the real tragedy that i never shall know tragedy never find anything but blustery complications that turn out to be a farce  no one big enough or pitiful enough to sacrifice for tragedy in neat blouses the eternal flame all nice and safe in a kerosene stove neither heroic faith nor heroic guilt peeping at love from behind lace curtainson main street  aunt bessie crept in next day tried to pump her tried to prime the pump by again hinting that kennicott might have his own affairs carol snapped whatever i may do ill have you to understand that will is only too safe she wished afterward that she had not been so lofty how much would aunt bessie make of whatever i may do  when kennicott came home he poked at things and hemmed and brought out saw aunty this afternoon she said you werent very polite to her  carol laughed he looked at her in a puzzled way and fled to his newspaper   iv   she lay sleepless she alternately considered ways of leaving kennicott and remembered his virtues pitied his bewilderment in face of the subtle corroding sicknesses which he could not dose nor cut out didnt he perhaps need her more than did the booksolaced erik suppose will were to die suddenly suppose she never again saw him at breakfast silent but amiable listening to her chatter suppose he never again played elephant for hugh supposea country call a slippery road his motor skidding the edge of the road crumbling the car turning turtle will pinned beneath suffering brought home maimed looking at her with spaniel eyesor waiting for her calling for her while she was in chicago knowing nothing of it suppose he were sued by some vicious shrieking woman for malpractice he tried to get witnesses westlake spread lies his friends doubted him his selfconfidence was so broken that it was horrible to see the indecision of the decisive man he was convicted handcuffed taken on a train  she ran to his room at her nervous push the door swung sharply in struck a chair he awoke gasped then in a steady voice what is it dear anything wrong she darted to him fumbled for the familiar harsh bristly cheek how well she knew it every seam and hardness of bone and roll of fat yet when he sighed this is a nice visit and dropped his hand on her thincovered shoulder she said too cheerily i thought i heard you moaning so silly of me good night dear   v   she did not see erik for a fortnight save once at church and once when she went to the tailor shop to talk over the plans contingencies and strategy of kennicotts annual campaign for getting a new suit nat hicks was there and he was not so deferential as he had been with unnecessary jauntiness he chuckled some nice flannels them samples heh needlessly he touched her arm to call attention to the fashionplates and humorously he glanced from her to erik at home she wondered if the little beast might not be suggesting himself as a rival to erik but that abysmal bedragglement she would not consider  she saw juanita haydock slowly walking past the houseas mrs westlake had once walked past  she met mrs westlake in uncle whittiers store and before that alert stare forgot her determination to be rude and was shakily cordial  she was sure that all the men on the street even guy pollock and sam clark leered at her in an interested hopeful way as though she were a notorious divorcee she felt as insecure as a shadowed criminal she wished to see erik and wished that she had never seen him she fancied that kennicott was the only person in town who did not know allknow incomparably more than there was to knowabout herself and erik she crouched in her chair as she imagined men talking of her thickvoiced obscene in barber shops and the tobaccostinking pool parlor  through early autumn fern mullins was the only person who broke the suspense the frivolous teacher had come to accept carol as of her own youth and though school had begun she rushed in daily to suggest dances welshrabbit parties  fern begged her to go as chaperon to a barndance in the country on a saturday evening carol could not go the next day the storm crashed    chapter xxxii  i  carol was on the back porch tightening a bolt on the babys gocart this sunday afternoon through an open window of the bogart house she heard a screeching heard mrs bogarts haggish voice      did too and theres no use your denying it no you dont you march yourself right straight out of the house    never in my life heard of such    never had nobody talk to me like    walk in the ways of sin and nastiness    leave your clothes here and heaven knows thats more than you deserve    any of your lip or ill call the policeman  the voice of the other interlocutor carol did not catch nor though mrs bogart was proclaiming that he was her confidant and present assistant did she catch the voice of mrs bogarts god  another row with cy carol inferred  she trundled the gocart down the back steps and tentatively wheeled it across the yard proud of her repairs she heard steps on the sidewalk she saw not cy bogart but fern mullins carrying a suitcase hurrying up the street with her head low the widow standing on the porch with buttery arms akimbo yammered after the fleeing girl  and dont you dare show your face on this block again you can send the drayman for your trunk my house has been contaminated long enough why the lord should afflict me  fern was gone the righteous widow glared banged into the house came out poking at her bonnet marched away by this time carol was staring in a manner not visibly to be distinguished from the windowpeeping of the rest of gopher prairie she saw mrs bogart enter the howland house then the casses not till suppertime did she reach the kennicotts the doctor answered her ring and greeted her well well hows the good neighbor  the good neighbor charged into the livingroom waving the most unctuous of black kid gloves and delightedly sputtering  you may well ask how i am i really do wonder how i could go through the awful scenes of this dayand the impudence i took from that womans tongue that ought to be cut out  whoa whoa hold up roared kennicott whos the hussy sister bogart sit down and take it cool and tell us about it  i cant sit down i must hurry home but i couldnt devote myself to my own selfish cares till id warned you and heaven knows i dont expect any thanks for trying to warn the town against her theres always so much evil in the world that folks simply wont see or appreciate your trying to safeguard themand forcing herself in here to get in with you and carrie many s the time ive seen her doing it and thank heaven she was found out in time before she could do any more harm it simply breaks my heart and prostrates me to think what she may have done already even if some of us that understand and know about things  whoaup who are you talking about  shes talking about fern mullins carol put in not pleasantly  huh  kennicott was incredulous  i certainly am flourished mrs bogart and good and thankful you may be that i found her out in time before she could get you into something carol because even if you are my neighbor and wills wife and a cultured lady let me tell you right now carol kennicott that you aint always as respectful toyou aint as reverentyou dont stick by the good old ways like they was laid down for us by god in the bible and while of course there aint a bit of harm in having a good laugh and i know there aint any real wickedness in you yet just the same you dont fear god and hate the transgressors of his commandments like you ought to and you may be thankful i found out this serpent i nourished in my bosomand oh yes oh yes indeed my lady must have two eggs every morning for breakfast and eggs sixty cents a dozen and want satisfied with one like most folkswhat did she care how much they cost or if a person couldnt make hardly nothing on her board and room in fact i just took her in out of charity and i might have known from the kind of stockings and clothes that she sneaked into my house in her trunk  before they got her story she had five more minutes of obscene wallowing the gutter comedy turned into high tragedy with nemesis in black kid gloves the actual story was simple depressing and unimportant as to details mrs bogart was indefinite and angry that she should be questioned  fern mullins and cy had the evening before driven alone to a barndance in the country carol brought out the admission that fern had tried to get a chaperon at the dance cy had kissed fernshe confessed that cy had obtained a pint of whisky he said that he didnt remember where he had got it mrs bogart implied that fern had given it to him fern herself insisted that he had stolen it from a farmers overcoatwhich mrs bogart raged was obviously a lie he had become soggily drunk fern had driven him home deposited him retching and wabbling on the bogart porch  never before had her boy been drunk shrieked mrs bogart when kennicott grunted she owned well maybe once or twice ive smelled licker on his breath she also with an air of being only too scrupulously exact granted that sometimes he did not come home till morning but he couldnt ever have been drunk for he always had the best excuses the other boys had tempted him to go down the lake spearing pickerel by torchlight or he had been out in a machine that ran out of gas anyway never before had her boy fallen into the hands of a designing woman  what do you suppose miss mullins could design to do with him insisted carol  mrs bogart was puzzled gave it up went on this morning when she had faced both of them cy had manfully confessed that all of the blame was on fern because the teacherhis own teacherhad dared him to take a drink fern had tried to deny it  then gabbled mrs bogart then that woman had the impudence to say to me what purpose could i have in wanting the filthy pup to get drunk thats just what she called himpup ill have no such nasty language in my house i says and you pretending and pulling the wool over peoples eyes and making them think youre educated and fit to be a teacher and look out for young peoples moralsyoure worse n any streetwalker i says i let her have it good i want going to flinch from my bounden duty and let her think that decent folks had to stand for her vile talk purpose i says purpose ill tell you what purpose you had aint i seen you making up to everything in pants thatd waste time and pay attention to your impertnence aint i seen you showing off your legs with them short skirts of yours trying to make out like you was so girlish and ladeda running along the street  carol was very sick at this version of ferns eager youth but she was sicker as mrs bogart hinted that no one could tell what had happened between fern and cy before the drive home without exactly describing the scene by her power of lustful imagination the woman suggested dark country places apart from the lanterns and rude fiddling and banging dancesteps in the barn then madness and harsh hateful conquest carol was too sick to interrupt it was kennicott who cried oh for gods sake quit it you havent any idea what happened you havent given us a single proof yet that fern is anything but a rattlebrained youngster  i havent eh well what do you say to this i come straight out and i says to her did you or did you not taste the whisky cy had and she says i think i did take one sipcy made me she said she owned up to that much so you can imagine  does that prove her a prostitute asked carol  carrie dont you never use a word like that again wailed the outraged puritan  well does it prove her to be a bad woman that she took a taste of whisky ive done it myself  thats different not that i approve your doing it what do the scriptures tell us strong drink is a mocker but thats entirely different from a teacher drinking with one of her own pupils  yes it does sound bad fern was silly undoubtedly but as a matter of fact shes only a year or two older than cy and probably a good many years younger in experience of vice  thatsnottrue she is plenty old enough to corrupt him  the job of corrupting cy was done by your sinless town five years ago  mrs bogart did not rage in return suddenly she was hopeless her head drooped she patted her black kid gloves picked at a thread of her faded brown skirt and sighed hes a good boy and awful affectionate if you treat him right some thinks hes terrible wild but thats because hes young and hes so brave and truthfulwhy he was one of the first in town that wanted to enlist for the war and i had to speak real sharp to him to keep him from running away i didnt want him to get into no bad influences round these campsand then mrs bogart rose from her pitifulness recovered her pace then i go and bring into my own house a woman thats worse when alls said and done than any bad woman he could have met you say this mullins woman is too young and inexperienced to corrupt cy well then shes too young and inexperienced to teach him too one or tother you cant have your cake and eat it so it dont make no difference which reason they fire her for and thats practically almost what i said to the schoolboard  have you been telling this story to the members of the schoolboard  i certainly have every one of em and their wives i says to them taint my affair to decide what you should or should not do with your teachers i says and i aint presuming to dictate in any way shape manner or form i just want to know i says whether youre going to go on record as keeping here in our schools among a lot of innocent boys and girls a woman that drinks smokes curses uses bad language and does such dreadful things as i wouldnt lay tongue to but you know what i mean i says and if so ill just see to it that the town learns about it and thats what i told professor mott too being superintendentand hes a righteous man not going autoing on the sabbath like the schoolboard members and the professor as much as admitted he was suspicious of the mullins woman himself   ii   kennicott was less shocked and much less frightened than carol and more articulate in his description of mrs bogart when she had gone  maud dyer telephoned to carol and after a rather improbable question about cooking lima beans with bacon demanded have you heard the scandal about this miss mullins and cy bogart  im sure its a lie  oh probably is mauds manner indicated that the falsity of the story was an insignificant flaw in its general delightfulness  carol crept to her room sat with hands curled tight together as she listened to a plague of voices she could hear the town yelping with it every soul of them gleeful at new details panting to win importance by having details of their own to add how well they would make up for what they had been afraid to do by imagining it in another they who had not been entirely afraid but merely careful and sneaky all the barbershop roues and millineryparlor mondaines how archly they were giggling this secondshe could hear them at it with what selfcommendation they were cackling their suavest wit you cant tell me she aint a gay bird im wise  and not one man in town to carry out their pioneer tradition of superb and contemptuous cursing not one to verify the myth that their rough chivalry and rugged virtues were more generous than the petty scandalpicking of older lands not one dramatic frontiersman to thunder with fantastic and fictional oaths what are you hinting at what are you snickering at what facts have you what are these unheardof sins you condemn so muchand like so well  no one to say it not kennicott nor guy pollock nor champ perry  erik possibly he would sputter uneasy protest  she suddenly wondered what subterranean connection her interest in erik had with this affair wasnt it because they had been prevented by her caste from bounding on her own trail that they were howling at fern   iii   before supper she found by half a dozen telephone calls that fern had fled to the minniemashie house she hastened there trying not to be selfconscious about the people who looked at her on the street the clerk said indifferently that he guessed miss mullins was up in room 37 and left carol to find the way she hunted along the stalesmelling corridors with their wallpaper of cerise daisies and poisongreen rosettes streaked in white spots from spilled water their frayed red and yellow matting and rows of pine doors painted a sickly blue she could not find the number in the darkness at the end of a corridor she had to feel the aluminum figures on the doorpanels she was startled once by a mans voice yep whadyuh want and fled when she reached the right door she stood listening she made out a long sobbing there was no answer till her third knock then an alarmed who is it go away  her hatred of the town turned resolute as she pushed open the door  yesterday she had seen fern mullins in boots and tweed skirt and canaryyellow sweater fleet and selfpossessed now she lay across the bed in crumpled lavender cotton and shabby pumps very feminine utterly cowed she lifted her head in stupid terror her hair was in tousled strings and her face was sallow creased her eyes were a blur from weeping  i didnt i didnt was all she would say at first and she repeated it while carol kissed her cheek stroked her hair bathed her forehead she rested then while carol looked about the roomthe welcome to strangers the sanctuary of hospitable main street the lucrative property of kennicotts friend jackson elder it smelled of old linen and decaying carpet and ancient tobacco smoke the bed was rickety with a thin knotty mattress the sandcolored walls were scratched and gouged in every corner under everything were fluffy dust and cigar ashes on the tilted washstand was a nicked and squatty pitcher the only chair was a grim straight object of spotty varnish but there was an altogether splendid gilt and rose cuspidor  she did not try to draw out ferns story fern insisted on telling it  she had gone to the party not quite liking cy but willing to endure him for the sake of dancing of escaping from mrs bogarts flow of moral comments of relaxing after the first strained weeks of teaching cy promised to be good he was on the way out there were a few workmen from gopher prairie at the dance with many young farmpeople half a dozen squatters from a degenerate colony in a brushhidden hollow planters of potatoes suspected thieves came in noisily drunk they all pounded the floor of the barn in oldfashioned square dances swinging their partners skipping laughing under the incantations of del snafflin the barber who fiddled and called the figures cy had two drinks from pocketflasks fern saw him fumbling among the overcoats piled on the feedbox at the far end of the barn soon after she heard a farmer declaring that some one had stolen his bottle she taxed cy with the theft he chuckled oh its just a joke im going to give it back he demanded that she take a drink unless she did he wouldnt return the bottle  i just brushed my lips with it and gave it back to him moaned fern she sat up glared at carol did you ever take a drink  i have a few id love to have one right now this contact with righteousness has about done me up  fern could laugh then so would i i dont suppose ive had five drinks in my life but if i meet just one more bogart and sonwell i didnt really touch that bottlehorrible raw whiskythough id have loved some wine i felt so jolly the barn was almost like a stage scenethe high rafters and the dark stalls and tin lanterns swinging and a silagecutter up at the end like some mysterious kind of machine and id been having lots of fun dancing with the nicest young farmer so strong and nice and awfully intelligent but i got uneasy when i saw how cy was so i doubt if i touched two drops of the beastly stuff do you suppose god is punishing me for even wanting wine  my dear mrs bogarts god may bemain streets god but all the courageous intelligent people are fighting him    though he slay us  fern danced again with the young farmer she forgot cy while she was talking with a girl who had taken the university agricultural course cy could not have returned the bottle he came staggering toward hertaking time to make himself offensive to every girl on the way and to dance a jig she insisted on their returning cy went with her chuckling and jigging he kissed her outside the door    and to think i used to think it was interesting to have men kiss you at a dance   she ignored the kiss in the need of getting him home before he started a fight a farmer helped her harness the buggy while cy snored in the seat he awoke before they set out all the way home he alternately slept and tried to make love to her  im almost as strong as he is i managed to keep him away while i drovesuch a rickety buggy i didnt feel like a girl i felt like a scrubwomanno i guess i was too scared to have any feelings at all it was terribly dark i got home somehow but it was hard the time i had to get out and it was quite muddy to read a signposti lit matches that i took from cys coat pocket and he followed mehe fell off the buggy step into the mud and got up and tried to make love to me andi was scared but i hit him quite hard and got in and so he ran after the buggy crying like a baby and i let him in again and right away again he was tryingbut no matter i got him home up on the porch mrs bogart was waiting up     you know it was funny all the time she wasoh talking to meand cy was being terribly sicki just kept thinking ive still got to drive the buggy down to the livery stable i wonder if the livery man will be awake but i got through somehow i took the buggy down to the stable and got to my room i locked my door but mrs bogart kept saying things outside the door stood out there saying things about me dreadful things and rattling the knob and all the while i could hear cy in the back yardbeing sick i dont think ill ever marry any man and then today  she drove me right out of the house she wouldnt listen to me all morning just to cy i suppose hes over his headache now even at breakfast he thought the whole thing was a grand joke i suppose right this minute hes going around town boasting about his conquest you understandoh dont you understand i did keep him away but i dont see how i can face my school they say country towns are fine for bringing up boys in buti cant believe this is me lying here and saying this i dont believe what happened last night  oh this was curious when i took off my dress last nightit was a darling dress i loved it so but of course the mud had spoiled it i cried over it andno matter but my white silk stockings were all torn and the strange thing is i dont know whether i caught my legs in the briers when i got out to look at the signpost or whether cy scratched me when i was fighting him off   iv   sam clark was president of the schoolboard when carol told him ferns story sam looked sympathetic and neighborly and mrs clark sat by cooing oh isnt that too bad carol was interrupted only when mrs clark begged dear dont speak so bitter about pious people theres lots of sincere practising christians that are real tolerant like the champ perrys  yes i know unfortunately there are enough kindly people in the churches to keep them going  when carol had finished mrs clark breathed poor girl i dont doubt her story a bit and sam rumbled yuh sure miss mullins is young and reckless but everybody in town except ma bogart knows what cy is but miss mullins was a fool to go with him  but not wicked enough to pay for it with disgrace  nno but sam avoided verdicts clung to the entrancing horrors of the story ma bogart cussed her out all morning did she jumped her neck eh ma certainly is one hellcat  yes you know how she is so vicious  oh no her best style aint her viciousness what she pulls in our store is to come in smiling with christian fortitude and keep a clerk busy for one hour while she picks out half a dozen fourpenny nails i remember one time  sam carol was uneasy youll fight for fern wont you when mrs bogart came to see you did she make definite charges  well yes you might say she did  but the schoolboard wont act on them  guess well more or less have to  but youll exonerate fern  ill do what i can for the girl personally but you know what the board is theres reverend zitterel sister bogart about half runs his church so of course hell take her sayso and ezra stowbody as a banker he has to be all hell for morality and purity might s well admit it carrie im afraid therell be a majority of the board against her not that any of us would believe a word cy said not if he swore it on a stack of bibles but still after all this gossip miss mullins wouldnt hardly be the party to chaperon our basketball team when it went out of town to play other high schools would she  perhaps not but couldnt some one else  why thats one of the things she was hired for sam sounded stubborn  do you realize that this isnt just a matter of a job and hiring and firing that its actually sending a splendid girl out with a beastly stain on her giving all the other bogarts in the world a chance at her thats what will happen if you discharge her  sam moved uncomfortably looked at his wife scratched his head sighed said nothing  wont you fight for her on the board if you lose wont you and whoever agrees with you make a minority report  no reports made in a case like this our rule is to just decide the thing and announce the final decision whether its unanimous or not  rules against a girls future dear god rules of a schoolboard sam wont you stand by fern and threaten to resign from the board if they try to discharge her  rather testy tired of so many subtleties he complained well ill do what i can but ill have to wait till the board meets  and ill do what i can together with the secret admission of course you and i know what ma bogart is was all carol could get from superintendent george edwin mott ezra stowbody the reverend mr zitterel or any other member of the schoolboard  afterward she wondered whether mr zitterel could have been referring to herself when he observed theres too much license in high places in this town though and the wages of sin is deathor anyway bein fired the holy leer with which the priest said it remained in her mind  she was at the hotel before eight next morning fern longed to go to school to face the tittering but she was too shaky carol read to her all day and by reassuring her convinced her own self that the schoolboard would be just she was less sure of it that evening when at the motion pictures she heard mrs gougerling exclaim to mrs howland she may be so innocent and all and i suppose she probably is but still if she drank a whole bottle of whisky at that dance the way everybody says she did she may have forgotten she was so innocent hee hee hee maud dyer leaning back from her seat put in thats what ive said all along i dont want to roast anybody but have you noticed the way she looks at men  when will they have me on the scaffold carol speculated  nat hicks stopped the kennicotts on their way home carol hated him for his manner of assuming that they two had a mysterious understanding without quite winking he seemed to wink at her as he gurgled what do you folks think about this mullins woman im not straitlaced but i tell you we got to have decent women in our schools d you know what i heard they say whatever she may of done afterwards this mullins dame took two quarts of whisky to the dance with her and got stewed before cy did some tank that wren ha ha ha  rats i dont believe it kennicott muttered  he got carol away before she was able to speak  she saw erik passing the house late alone and she stared after him longing for the lively bitterness of the things he would say about the town kennicott had nothing for her but oh course evbody likes a juicy story but they dont intend to be mean  she went up to bed proving to herself that the members of the schoolboard were superior men  it was tuesday afternoon before she learned that the board had met at ten in the morning and voted to accept miss fern mullinss resignation sam clark telephoned the news to her were not making any charges were just letting her resign would you like to drop over to the hotel and ask her to write the resignation now weve accepted it glad i could get the board to put it that way its thanks to you  but cant you see that the town will take this as proof of the charges  werenotmakingnochargeswhatever sam was obviously finding it hard to be patient  fern left town that evening  carol went with her to the train the two girls elbowed through a silent liplicking crowd carol tried to stare them down but in face of the impishness of the boys and the bovine gaping of the men she was embarrassed fern did not glance at them carol felt her arm tremble though she was tearless listless plodding she squeezed carols hand said something unintelligible stumbled up into the vestibule  carol remembered that miles bjornstam had also taken a train what would be the scene at the station when she herself took departure  she walked uptown behind two strangers  one of them was giggling see that goodlooking wench that got on here the swell kid with the small black hat shes some charmer i was here yesterday before my jump to ojibway falls and i heard all about her seems she was a teacher but she certainly was a highrollero boyhigh wide and fancy her and couple of other skirts bought a whole case of whisky and went on a tear and one night darned if this bunch of cradlerobbers didnt get hold of some young kids just small boys and they all got lit up like a white way and went out to a roughneck dance and they say  the narrator turned saw a woman near and not being a common person nor a coarse workman but a clever salesman and a householder lowered his voice for the rest of the tale during it the other man laughed hoarsely  carol turned off on a sidestreet  she passed cy bogart he was humorously narrating some achievement to a group which included nat hicks del snafflin bert tybee the bartender and a tennyson ohearn the shyster lawyer they were men far older than cy but they accepted him as one of their own and encouraged him to go on  it was a week before she received from fern a letter of which this was a part      of course my family did not really believe the story but as they were sure i must have done something wrong they just lectured me generally in fact jawed me till i have gone to live at a boarding house the teachers agencies must know the story man at one almost slammed the door in my face when i went to ask about a job  at another the woman in charge was beastly dont know what i will do dont seem to feel very well may marry a fellow thats in love with me but hes so stupid that he makes me scream  dear mrs kennicott you were the only one that believed me i guess its a joke on me i was such a simp i felt quite heroic while i was driving the buggy back that night  keeping cy away from me i guess i expected the people in gopher prairie to admire me i did use to be admired for my athletics at the ujust five months ago    chapter xxxiii  for a month which was one suspended moment of doubt she saw erik only casually at an eastern star dance at the shop where in the presence of nat hicks they conferred with immense particularity on the significance of having one or two buttons on the cuff of kennicotts new suit for the benefit of beholders they were respectably vacuous  thus barred from him depressed in the thought of fern carol was suddenly and for the first time convinced that she loved erik  she told herself a thousand inspiriting things which he would say if he had the opportunity for them she admired him loved him but she was afraid to summon him he understood he did not come she forgot her every doubt of him and her discomfort in his background each day it seemed impossible to get through the desolation of not seeing him each morning each afternoon each evening was a compartment divided from all other units of time distinguished by a sudden oh i want to see erik which was as devastating as though she had never said it before  there were wretched periods when she could not picture him usually he stood out in her mind in some little momentglancing up from his preposterous pressingiron or running on the beach with dave dyer but sometimes he had vanished he was only an opinion she worried then about his appearance werent his wrists too large and red wasnt his nose a snub like so many scandinavians was he at all the graceful thing she had fancied when she encountered him on the street she was as much reassuring herself as rejoicing in his presence more disturbing than being unable to visualize him was the darting remembrance of some intimate aspect his face as they had walked to the boat together at the picnic the ruddy light on his temples neckcords flat cheeks  on a november evening when kennicott was in the country she answered the bell and was confused to find erik at the door stooped imploring his hands in the pockets of his topcoat as though he had been rehearsing his speech he instantly besought  saw your husband driving away ive got to see you i cant stand it come for a walk i know people might see us but they wont if we hike into the country ill wait for you by the elevator take as long as you want tooh come quick  in a few minutes she promised  she murmured ill just talk to him for a quarter of an hour and come home she put an her tweed coat and rubber overshoes considering how honest and hopeless are rubbers how clearly their chaperonage proved that she wasnt going to a lovers tryst  she found him in the shadow of the grainelevator sulkily kicking at a rail of the sidetrack as she came toward him she fancied that his whole body expanded but he said nothing nor she he patted her sleeve she returned the pat and they crossed the railroad tracks found a road clumped toward open country  chilly night but i like this melancholy gray he said  yes  they passed a moaning clump of trees and splashed along the wet road he tucked her hand into the sidepocket of his overcoat she caught his thumb and sighing held it exactly as hugh held hers when they went walking she thought about hugh the current maid was in for the evening but was it safe to leave the baby with her the thought was distant and elusive  erik began to talk slowly revealingly he made for her a picture of his work in a large tailor shop in minneapolis the steam and heat and the drudgery the men in darned vests and crumpled trousers men who rushed growlers of beer and were cynical about women who laughed at him and played jokes on him but i didnt mind because i could keep away from them outside i used to go to the art institute and the walker gallery and tramp clear around lake harriet or hike out to the gates house and imagine it was a chateau in italy and i lived in it i was a marquis and collected tapestriesthat was after i was wounded in padua the only really bad time was when a tailor named finkelfarb found a diary i was trying to keep and he read it aloud in the shopit was a bad fight he laughed i got fined five dollars but thats all gone now seems as though you stand between me and the gas stovesthe long flames with mauve edges licking up around the irons and making that sneering sound all dayaaaaah  her fingers tightened about his thumb as she perceived the hot low room the pounding of pressingirons the reek of scorched cloth and erik among giggling gnomes his fingertip crept through the opening of her glove and smoothed her palm she snatched her hand away stripped off her glove tucked her hand back into his  he was saying something about a wonderful person in her tranquillity she let the words blow by and heeded only the beating wings of his voice  she was conscious that he was fumbling for impressive speech  say uhcarol ive written a poem about you  thats nice lets hear it  damn it dont be so casual about it cant you take me seriously  my dear boy if i took you seriously i dont want us to be hurt more thanmore than we will be tell me the poem ive never had a poem written about me  it isnt really a poem its just some words that i love because it seems to me they catch what you are of course probably they wont seem so to anybody else butwell       little and tender and merry and wise      with eyes that meet my eyes  do you get the idea the way i do  yes im terribly grateful and she was gratefulwhile she impersonally noted how bad a verse it was  she was aware of the haggard beauty in the lowering night monstrous tattered clouds sprawled round a forlorn moon puddles and rocks glistened with inner light they were passing a grove of scrub poplars feeble by day but looming now like a menacing wall she stopped they heard the branches dripping the wet leaves sullenly plumping on the soggy earth  waitingwaitingeverything is waiting she whispered she drew her hand from his pressed her clenched fingers against her lips she was lost in the somberness i am happyso we must go home before we have time to become unhappy but cant we sit on a log for a minute and just listen  no too wet but i wish we could build a fire and you could sit on my overcoat beside it im a grand firebuilder my cousin lars and me spent a week one time in a cabin way up in the big woods snowed in the fireplace was filled with a dome of ice when we got there but we chopped it out and jammed the thing full of pineboughs couldnt we build a fire back here in the woods and sit by it for a while  she pondered halfway between yielding and refusal her head ached faintly she was in abeyance everything the night his silhouette the cautioustreading future was as undistinguishable as though she were drifting bodiless in a fourth dimension while her mind groped the lights of a motor car swooped round a bend in the road and they stood farther apart what ought i to do she mused i thinkoh i wont be robbed i am good if im so enslaved that i cant sit by the fire with a man and talk then id better be dead  the lights of the thrumming car grew magically were upon them abruptly stopped from behind the dimness of the windshield a voice annoyed sharp hello there  she realized that it was kennicott  the irritation in his voice smoothed out having a walk  they made schoolboyish sounds of assent  pretty wet isnt it better ride back jump up in front here valborg  his manner of swinging open the door was a command carol was conscious that erik was climbing in that she was apparently to sit in the back and that she had been left to open the rear door for herself instantly the wonder which had flamed to the gusty skies was quenched and she was mrs w p kennicott of gopher prairie riding in a squeaking old car and likely to be lectured by her husband  she feared what kennicott would say to erik she bent toward them kennicott was observing going to have some rain before the night s over all right  yes said erik  been funny season this year anyway never saw it with such a cold october and such a nice november member we had a snow way back on october ninth but it certainly was nice up to the twentyfirst this monthas i remember it not a flake of snow in november so far has there been but i shouldnt wonder if wed be having some snow most any time now  yes good chance of it said erik  wish id had more time to go after the ducks this fall by golly what do you think kennicott sounded appealing fellow wrote me from man trap lake that he shot seven mallards and couple of canvasback in one hour  that must have been fine said erik  carol was ignored but kennicott was blustrously cheerful he shouted to a farmer as he slowed up to pass the frightened team there we areschon gut she sat back neglected frozen unheroic heroine in a drama insanely undramatic she made a decision resolute and enduring she would tell kennicottwhat would she tell him she could not say that she loved erik did she love him but she would have it out she was not sure whether it was pity for kennicotts blindness or irritation at his assumption that he was enough to fill any womans life which prompted her but she knew that she was out of the trap that she could be frank and she was exhilarated with the adventure of it    while in front he was entertaining erik  nothing like an hour on a duckpass to make you relish your victuals andgosh this machine hasnt got the power of a fountain pen guess the cylinders are jamcramfull of carbon again dont know but what maybe ill have to put in another set of pistonrings  he stopped on main street and clucked hospitably there thatll give you just a block to walk g night  carol was in suspense would erik sneak away  he stolidly moved to the back of the car thrust in his hand muttered good nightcarol im glad we had our walk she pressed his hand the car was flapping on he was hidden from herby a corner drug store on main street  kennicott did not recognize her till he drew up before the house then he condescended better jump out here and ill take the boat around back say see if the back door is unlocked will you she unlatched the door for him she realized that she still carried the damp glove she had stripped off for erik she drew it on she stood in the center of the livingroom unmoving in damp coat and muddy rubbers kennicott was as opaque as ever her task wouldnt be anything so lively as having to endure a scolding but only an exasperating effort to command his attention so that he would understand the nebulous things she had to tell him instead of interrupting her by yawning winding the clock and going up to bed she heard him shoveling coal into the furnace he came through the kitchen energetically but before he spoke to her he did stop in the hall did wind the clock  he sauntered into the livingroom and his glance passed from her drenched hat to her smeared rubbers she could hearshe could hear see taste smell touchhis better take your coat off carrie looks kind of wet yes there it was  well carrie you better he chucked his own coat on a chair stalked to her went on with a rising tingling voice you better cut it out now im not going to do the outraged husband stunt i like you and i respect you and id probably look like a boob if i tried to be dramatic but i think its about time for you and valborg to call a halt before you get in dutch like fern mullins did  do you  course i know all about it what d you expect in a town thats as filled with busybodies that have plenty of time to stick their noses into other folks business as this is not that theyve had the nerve to do much tattling to me but theyve hinted around a lot and anyway i could see for myself that you liked him but of course i knew how cold you were i knew you wouldnt stand it even if valborg did try to hold your hand or kiss you so i didnt worry but same time i hope you dont suppose this husky young swede farmer is as innocent and platonic and all that stuff as you are wait now dont get sore im not knocking him he isnt a bad sort and hes young and likes to gas about books course you like him that isnt the real rub but havent you just seen what this town can do once it goes and gets moral on you like it did with fern you probably think that two young folks making love are alone if anybody ever is but theres nothing in this town that you dont do in company with a whole lot of uninvited but awful interested guests dont you realize that if ma westlake and a few others got started theyd drive you up a tree and youd find yourself so well advertised as being in love with this valborg fellow that youd have to be just to spite em  let me sit down was all carol could say she drooped on the couch wearily without elasticity  he yawned gimme your coat and rubbers and while she stripped them off he twiddled his watchchain felt the radiator peered at the thermometer he shook out her wraps in the hall hung them up with exactly his usual care he pushed a chair near to her and sat bolt up he looked like a physician about to give sound and undesired advice  before he could launch into his heavy discourse she desperately got in please i want you to know that i was going to tell you everything tonight  well i dont suppose theres really much to tell  but there is im fond of erik he appeals to something in here she touched her breast and i admire him he isnt just a young swede farmer hes an artist  wait now hes had a chance all evening to tell you what a whale of a fine fellow he is now its my turn i cant talk artistic butcarrie do you understand my work he leaned forward thick capable hands on thick sturdy thighs mature and slow yet beseeching no matter even if you are cold i like you better than anybody in the world one time i said that you were my soul and that still goes youre all the things that i see in a sunset when im driving in from the country the things that i like but cant make poetry of do you realize what my job is i go round twentyfour hours a day in mud and blizzard trying my damnedest to heal everybody rich or poor youthat re always spieling about how scientists ought to rule the world instead of a bunch of spreadeagle politicianscant you see that im all the science there is here and i can stand the cold and the bumpy roads and the lonely rides at night all i need is to have you here at home to welcome me i dont expect you to be passionatenot any more i dontbut i do expect you to appreciate my work i bring babies into the world and save lives and make cranky husbands quit being mean to their wives and then you go and moon over a swede tailor because he can talk about how to put ruchings on a skirt hell of a thing for a man to fuss over  she flew out at him you make your side clear let me give mine i admit all you sayexcept about erik but is it only you and the baby that want me to back you up that demand things from me theyre all on me the whole town i can feel their hot breaths on my neck aunt bessie and that horrible slavering old uncle whittier and juanita and mrs westlake and mrs bogart and all of them and you welcome them you encourage them to drag me down into their cave i wont stand it do you hear now right now im done and its erik who gives me the courage you say he just thinks about ruches which do not usually go on skirts by the way i tell you he thinks about god the god that mrs bogart covers up with greasy gingham wrappers erik will be a great man some day and if i could contribute one tiny bit to his success  wait wait wait now hold up youre assuming that your erik will make good as a matter of fact at my age hell be running a oneman tailor shop in some burg about the size of schoenstrom  he will not  thats what hes headed for now all right and hes twentyfive or six andwhats he done to make you think hell ever be anything but a pantspresser  he has sensitiveness and talent  wait now what has he actually done in the art line has he done one firstclass picture orsketch d you call it or one poem or played the piano or anything except gas about what hes going to do  she looked thoughtful  then its a hundred to one shot that he never will way i understand it even these fellows that do something pretty good at home and get to go to art school there aint more than one out of ten of em maybe one out of a hundred that ever get above grinding out a bum livingabout as artistic as plumbing and when it comes down to this tailor why cant you seeyou that take on so about psychologycant you see that its just by contrast with folks like doc mcganum or lym cass that this fellow seems artistic suppose youd met up with him first in one of these reglar new york studios you wouldnt notice him any more n a rabbit  she huddled over folded hands like a temple virgin shivering on her knees before the thin warmth of a brazier she could not answer  kennicott rose quickly sat on the couch took both her hands suppose he failsas he will suppose he goes back to tailoring and youre his wife is that going to be this artistic life youve been thinking about hes in some bum shack pressing pants all day or stooped over sewing and having to be polite to any grouch that blows in and jams a dirty stinking old suit in his face and says here you fix this and be blame quick about it he wont even have enough savvy to get him a big shop hell pike along doing his own workunless you his wife go help him go help him in the shop and stand over a table all day pushing a big heavy iron your complexion will look fine after about fifteen years of baking that way wont it and youll be humped over like an old hag and probably youll live in one room back of the shop and then at nightoh youll have your artistsure hell come in stinking of gasoline and cranky from hard work and hinting around that if it hadnt been for you hed of gone east and been a great artist sure and youll be entertaining his relativestalk about uncle whit youll be having some old axel axelberg coming in with manure on his boots and sitting down to supper in his socks and yelling at you hurry up now you vimmin make me sick yes and youll have a squalling brat every year tugging at you while you press clothes and you wont love em like you do hugh upstairs all downy and asleep  please not any more  her face was on his knee  he bent to kiss her neck i dont want to be unfair i guess love is a great thing all right but think it would stand much of that kind of stuff oh honey am i so bad cant you like me at all iveive been so fond of you  she snatched up his hand she kissed it presently she sobbed i wont ever see him again i cant now the hot livingroom behind the tailor shopi dont love him enough for that and you areeven if i were sure of him sure he was the real thing i dont think i could actually leave you this marriage it weaves people together its not easy to break even when it ought to be broken  and do you want to break it  no  he lifted her carried her upstairs laid her on her bed turned to the door  come kiss me she whimpered  he kissed her lightly and slipped away for an hour she heard him moving about his room lighting a cigar drumming with his knuckles on a chair she felt that he was a bulwark between her and the darkness that grew thicker as the delayed storm came down in sleet   ii   he was cheery and more casual than ever at breakfast all day she tried to devise a way of giving erik up telephone the village central would unquestionably listen in a letter it might be found go to see him impossible that evening kennicott gave her without comment an envelope the letter was signed e v   i know i cant do anything but make trouble for you i think i am going to minneapolis tonight and from there as soon as i can either to new york or chicago i will do as big things as i can ii cant write i love you too muchgod keep you   until she heard the whistle which told her that the minneapolis train was leaving town she kept herself from thinking from moving then it was all over she had no plan nor desire for anything  when she caught kennicott looking at her over his newspaper she fled to his arms thrusting the paper aside and for the first time in years they were lovers but she knew that she still had no plan in life save always to go along the same streets past the same people to the same shops   iii   a week after eriks going the maid startled her by announcing theres a mr valborg downstairs say he vant to see you  she was conscious of the maids interested stare angry at this shattering of the calm in which she had hidden she crept down peeped into the livingroom it was not erik valborg who stood there it was a small graybearded yellowfaced man in mucky boots canvas jacket and red mittens he glowered at her with shrewd red eyes  you de docs wife  yes  im adolph valborg from up by jefferson im eriks father  oh he was a monkeyfaced little man and not gentle  what you done wit my son  i dont think i understand you  i tink youre going to understand before i get trough where is he  why reallyi presume that hes in minneapolis  you presume he looked through her with a contemptuousness such as she could not have imagined only an insane contortion of spelling could portray his lyric whine his mangled consonants he clamored presume dots a fine word i dont want no fine words and i dont want no more lies i want to know what you know  see here mr valborg you may stop this bullying right now im not one of your farmwomen i dont know where your son is and theres no reason why i should know her defiance ran out in face of his immense flaxen stolidity he raised his fist worked up his anger with the gesture and sneered  you dirty city women wit your fine ways and fine dresses a father come here trying to save his boy from wickedness and you call him a bully by god i dont have to take nothin off you nor your husband i aint one of your hired men for one time a woman like you is going to hear de trut about what you are and no fine city words to it needer  really mr valborg  what you done wit him heh ill yoost tell you what you done he was a good boy

she could smell the manure and sweat it aint no use talkin to women like you get no trut out of you but next time i go by your husband  he was marching into the hall carol flung herself on him her clenching hand on his hayseeddusty shoulder you horrible old man youve always tried to turn erik into a slave to fatten your pocketbook youve sneered at him and overworked him and probably youve succeeded in preventing his ever rising above your muckheap and now because you cant drag him back you come here to ventgo tell my husband go tell him and dont blame me when he kills you when my husband kills youhe will kill you  the man grunted looked at her impassively said one word and walked out  she heard the word very plainly  she did not quite reach the couch her knees gave way she pitched forward she heard her mind saying you havent fainted this is ridiculous youre simply dramatizing yourself get up but she could not move when kennicott arrived she was lying on the couch his step quickened whats happened carrie you havent got a bit of blood in your face  she clutched his arm youve got to be sweet to me and kind im going to californiamountains sea please dont argue about it because im going  quietly all right well go you and i leave the kid here with aunt bessie  now  well yes just as soon as we can get away now dont talk any more just imagine youve already started he smoothed her hair and not till after supper did he continue i meant it about california but i think we better wait three weeks or so till i get hold of some young fellow released from the medical corps to take my practice and if people are gossiping you dont want to give them a chance by running away can you stand it and face em for three weeks or so  yes she said emptily   iv   people covertly stared at her on the street aunt bessie tried to catechize her about eriks disappearance and it was kennicott who silenced the woman with a savage say are you hinting that carrie had anything to do with that fellows beating it then let me tell you and you can go right out and tell the whole bloomin town that carrie and i took valtook erik riding and he asked me about getting a better job in minneapolis and i advised him to go to it    getting much sugar in at the store now  guy pollock crossed the street to be pleasant apropos of california and new novels vida sherwin dragged her to the jolly seventeen there with every one rigidly listening maud dyer shot at carol i hear erik has left town  carol was amiable yes so i hear in fact he called me uptold me he had been offered a lovely job in the city so sorry hes gone he would have been valuable if wed tried to start the dramatic association again still i wouldnt be here for the association myself because will is all in from work and im thinking of taking him to california juanitayou know the coast so welltell me would you start in at los angeles or san francisco and what are the best hotels  the jolly seventeen looked disappointed but the jolly seventeen liked to give advice the jolly seventeen liked to mention the expensive hotels at which they had stayed a meal counted as a stay before they could question her again carol escorted in with drum and fife the topic of raymie wutherspoon vida had news from her husband he had been gassed in the trenches had been in a hospital for two weeks had been promoted to major was learning french  she left hugh with aunt bessie  but for kennicott she would have taken him she hoped that in some miraculous way yet unrevealed she might find it possible to remain in california she did not want to see gopher prairie again  the smails were to occupy the kennicott house and quite the hardest thing to endure in the month of waiting was the series of conferences between kennicott and uncle whittier in regard to heating the garage and having the furnace flues cleaned  did carol kennicott inquired wish to stop in minneapolis to buy new clothes  no i want to get as far away as i can as soon as i can lets wait till los angeles  sure sure just as you like cheer up were going to have a large wide time and everything ll be different when we come back   vi   dusk on a snowy december afternoon the sleeper which would connect at kansas city with the california train rolled out of st paul with a chickachick chickachick chickachick as it crossed the other tracks it bumped through the factory belt gained speed carol could see nothing but gray fields which had closed in on her all the way from gopher prairie ahead was darkness  for an hour in minneapolis i must have been near erik hes still there somewhere hell be gone when i come back ill never know where he has gone  as kennicott switched on the seatlight she turned drearily to the illustrations in a motionpicture magazine    chapter xxxiv  they journeyed for three and a half months they saw the grand canyon the adobe walls of sante fe and in a drive from el paso into mexico their first foreign land they jogged from san diego and la jolla to los angeles pasadena riverside through towns with belltowered missions and orangegroves they viewed monterey and san francisco and a forest of sequoias they bathed in the surf and climbed foothills and danced they saw a polo game and the making of motionpictures they sent one hundred and seventeen souvenir postcards to gopher prairie and once on a dune by a foggy sea when she was walking alone carol found an artist and he looked up at her and said too damned wet to paint sit down and talk and so for ten minutes she lived in a romantic novel  her only struggle was in coaxing kennicott not to spend all his time with the tourists from the ten thousand other gopher prairies in winter california is full of people from iowa and nebraska ohio and oklahoma who having traveled thousands of miles from their familiar villages hasten to secure an illusion of not having left them they hunt for people from their own states to stand between them and the shame of naked mountains they talk steadily in pullmans on hotel porches at cafeterias and motionpicture shows about the motors and crops and county politics back home kennicott discussed landprices with them he went into the merits of the several sorts of motor cars with them he was intimate with train porters and he insisted on seeing the luke dawsons at their flimsy bungalow in pasadena where luke sat and yearned to go back and make some more money but kennicott gave promise of learning to play he shouted in the pool at the coronado and he spoke of though he did nothing more radical than speak of buying eveningclothes carol was touched by his efforts to enjoy picture galleries and the dogged way in which he accumulated dates and dimensions when they followed monkish guides through missions  she felt strong whenever she was restless she dodged her thoughts by the familiar vagabond fallacy of running away from them of moving on to a new place and thus she persuaded herself that she was tranquil in march she willingly agreed with kennicott that it was time to go home she was longing for hugh  they left monterey on april first on a day of high blue skies and poppies and a summer sea  as the train struck in among the hills she resolved im going to love the fine will kennicott quality that there is in gopher prairie the nobility of good sense it will be sweet to see vida and guy and the clarks and im going to see my baby all the words hell be able to say now its a new start everything will be different  thus on april first among dappled hills and the bronze of scrub oaks while kennicott seesawed on his toes and chuckled wonder what hughll say when he sees us  three days later they reached gopher prairie in a sleet storm   ii   no one knew that they were coming no one met them and because of the icy roads the only conveyance at the station was the hotel bus which they missed while kennicott was giving his trunkcheck to the station agentthe only person to welcome them carol waited for him in the station among huddled german women with shawls and umbrellas and raggedbearded farmers in corduroy coats peasants mute as oxen in a room thick with the steam of wet coats the reek of the redhot stove the stench of sawdust boxes which served as cuspidors the afternoon light was as reluctant as a winter dawn  this is a useful marketcenter an interesting pioneer post but it is not a home for me meditated the stranger carol  kennicott suggested id phone for a flivver but itd take quite a while for it to get here lets walk  they stepped uncomfortably from the safety of the plank platform and balancing on their toes taking cautious strides ventured along the road the sleety rain was turning to snow the air was stealthily cold beneath an inch of water was a layer of ice so that as they wavered with their suitcases they slid and almost fell the wet snow drenched their gloves the water underfoot splashed their itching ankles they scuffled inch by inch for three blocks in front of harry haydocks kennicott sighed  we better stop in here and phone for a machine  she followed him like a wet kitten  the haydocks saw them laboring up the slippery concrete walk up the perilous front steps and came to the door chanting  well well well back again eh say this is fine have a fine trip my you look like a rose carol how did you like the coast doc well well well whereall did you go  but as kennicott began to proclaim the list of places achieved harry interrupted with an account of how much he himself had seen two years ago when kennicott boasted we went through the mission at santa barbara harry broke in yeh thats an interesting old mission say ill never forget that hotel there doc it was swell why the rooms were made just like these old monasteries juanita and i went from santa barbara to san luis obispo you folks go to san luis obispo  no but  well you ought to gone to san luis obispo and then we went from there to a ranch least they called it a ranch  kennicott got in only one considerable narrative which began  say i never knewdid you harrythat in the chicago district the kutz kar sells as well as the overland i never thought much of the kutz but i met a gentleman on the trainit was when we were pulling out of albuquerque and i was sitting on the back platform of the observation car and this man was next to me and he asked me for a light and we got to talking and come to find out he came from aurora and when he found out i came from minnesota he asked me if i knew dr clemworth of red wing and of course while ive never met him ive heard of clemworth lots of times and seems hes this mans brother quite a coincidence well we got to talking and we called the porterthat was a pretty good porter on that carand we had a couple bottles of ginger ale and i happened to mention the kutz kar and this manseems hes driven a lot of different kinds of carshes got a franklin nowand he said that hed tried the kutz and liked it firstrate well when we got into a stationi dont remember the name of itcarrie what the deuce was the name of that first stop we made the other side of albuquerquewell anyway i guess we must have stopped there to take on water and this man and i got out to stretch our legs and darned if there wasnt a kutz drawn right up at the depot platform and he pointed out something id never noticed and i was glad to learn about it seems that the gear lever in the kutz is an inch longer  even this chronicle of voyages harry interrupted with remarks on the advantages of the ballgearshift  kennicott gave up hope of adequate credit for being a traveled man and telephoned to a garage for a ford taxicab while juanita kissed carol and made sure of being the first to tell the latest which included seven distinct and proven scandals about mrs swiftwaite and one considerable doubt as to the chastity of cy bogart  they saw the ford sedan making its way over the waterlined ice through the snowstorm like a tugboat in a fog the driver stopped at a corner the car skidded it turned about with comic reluctance crashed into a tree and stood tilted on a broken wheel  the kennicotts refused harry haydocks not too urgent offer to take them home in his car if i can manage to get it out of the garageterrible daystayed home from the storebut if you say so ill take a shot at it carol gurgled no i think wed better walk probably make better time and im just crazy to see my baby with their suitcases they waddled on their coats were soaked through  carol had forgotten her facile hopes she looked about with impersonal eyes but kennicott through rainblurred lashes caught the glory that was back home  she noted bare treetrunks black branches the spongy brown earth between patches of decayed snow on the lawns the vacant lots were full of tall dead weeds stripped of summer leaves the houses were hopelesstemporary shelters  kennicott chuckled by golly look down there jack elder must have painted his garage and look martin mahoney has put up a new fence around his chicken yard say thats a good fence eh chickentight and dogtight thats certainly a dandy fence wonder how much it cost a yard yes sir they been building right along even in winter got more enterprise than these californians pretty good to be home eh  she noted that all winter long the citizens had been throwing garbage into their back yards to be cleaned up in spring the recent thaw had disclosed heaps of ashes dogbones torn bedding clotted paintcans all half covered by the icy pools which filled the hollows of the yards the refuse had stained the water to vile colors of waste thin red sour yellow streaky brown  kennicott chuckled look over there on main street they got the feed store all fixed up and a new sign on it black and gold thatll improve the appearance of the block a lot  she noted that the few people whom they passed wore their raggedest coats for the evil day they were scarecrows in a shanty town    to think she marveled of coming two thousand miles past mountains and cities to get off here and to plan to stay here what conceivable reason for choosing this particular place  she noted a figure in a rusty coat and a cloth cap  kennicott chuckled look whos coming its sam clark gosh all rigged out for the weather  the two men shook hands a dozen times and in the western fashion bumbled well well well well you old hellhound you old devil how are you anyway you old horsethief maybe it aint good to see you again while sam nodded at her over kennicotts shoulder she was embarrassed  perhaps i should never have gone away im out of practise in lying i wish they would get it over just a block more andmy baby  they were home she brushed past the welcoming aunt bessie and knelt by hugh as he stammered o mummy mummy dont go away stay with me mummy she cried no ill never leave you again  he volunteered thats daddy  by golly he knows us just as if wed never been away said kennicott you dont find any of these california kids as bright as he is at his age  when the trunk came they piled about hugh the bewhiskered little wooden men fitting one inside another the miniature junk and the oriental drum from san francisco chinatown the blocks carved by the old frenchman in san diego the lariat from san antonio  will you forgive mummy for going away will you she whispered  absorbed in hugh asking a hundred questions about himhad he had any colds did he still dawdle over his oatmeal what about unfortunate morning incidents she viewed aunt bessie only as a source of information and was able to ignore her hint pointed by a coyly shaken finger now that youve had such a fine long trip and spent so much money and all i hope youre going to settle down and be satisfied and not  does he like carrots yet replied carol  she was cheerful as the snow began to conceal the slatternly yards she assured herself that the streets of new york and chicago were as ugly as gopher prairie in such weather she dismissed the thought but they do have charming interiors for refuge she sang as she energetically looked over hughs clothes  the afternoon grew old and dark aunt bessie went home carol took the baby into her own room the maid came in complaining i cant get no extra milk to make chipped beef for supper hugh was sleepy and he had been spoiled by aunt bessie even to a returned mother his whining and his trick of seven times snatching her silver brush were fatiguing as a background behind the noises of hugh and the kitchen the house reeked with a colorless stillness  from the window she heard kennicott greeting the widow bogart as he had always done always every snowy evening guess this ll keep up all night she waited there they were the furnace sounds unalterable eternal removing ashes shoveling coal  yes she was back home nothing had changed she had never been away california had she seen it had she for one minute left this scraping sound of the small shovel in the ashpit of the furnace but kennicott preposterously supposed that she had never had she been quite so far from going away as now when he believed she had just come back she felt oozing through the walls the spirit of small houses and righteous people at that instant she knew that in running away she had merely hidden her doubts behind the officious stir of travel  dear god dont let me begin agonizing again she sobbed hugh wept with her  wait for mummy a second she hastened down to the cellar to kennicott  he was standing before the furnace however inadequate the rest of the house he had seen to it that the fundamental cellar should be large and clean the square pillars whitewashed and the bins for coal and potatoes and trunks convenient a glow from the drafts fell on the smooth gray cement floor at his feet he was whistling tenderly staring at the furnace with eyes which saw the blackdomed monster as a symbol of home and of the beloved routine to which he had returnedhis gipsying decently accomplished his duty of viewing sights and curios performed with thoroughness unconscious of her he stooped and peered in at the blue flames among the coals he closed the door briskly and made a whirling gesture with his right hand out of pure bliss  he saw her why hello old lady pretty darn good to be back eh  yes she lied while she quaked not now i cant face the job of explaining now hes been so good he trusts me and im going to break his heart  she smiled at him she tidied his sacred cellar by throwing an empty bluing bottle into the trash bin she mourned its only the baby that holds me if hugh died she fled upstairs in panic and made sure that nothing had happened to hugh in these four minutes  she saw a pencilmark on a windowsill she had made it on a september day when she had been planning a picnic for fern mullins and erik fern and she had been hysterical with nonsense had invented mad parties for all the coming winter she glanced across the alley at the room which fern had occupied a rag of a gray curtain masked the still window  she tried to think of some one to whom she wanted to telephone there was no one  the sam clarks called that evening and encouraged her to describe the missions a dozen times they told her how glad they were to have her back  it is good to be wanted she thought it will drug me butoh is all life always an unresolved but    chapter xxxv  she tried to be content which was a contradiction in terms she fanatically cleaned house all april she knitted a sweater for hugh she was diligent at red cross work she was silent when vida raved that though america hated war as much as ever we must invade germany and wipe out every man because it was now proven that there was no soldier in the german army who was not crucifying prisoners and cutting off babies hands  carol was volunteer nurse when mrs champ perry suddenly died of pneumonia  in her funeral procession were the eleven people left out of the grand army and the territorial pioneers old men and women very old and weak who a few decades ago had been boys and girls of the frontier riding broncos through the rank windy grass of this prairie they hobbled behind a band made up of business men and highschool boys who straggled along without uniforms or ranks or leader trying to play chopins funeral marcha shabby group of neighbors with grave eyes stumbling through the slush under a solemnity of faltering music  champ was broken his rheumatism was worse the rooms over the store were silent he could not do his work as buyer at the elevator farmers coming in with sledloads of wheat complained that champ could not read the scale that he seemed always to be watching some one back in the darkness of the bins he was seen slipping through alleys talking to himself trying to avoid observation creeping at last to the cemetery once carol followed him and found the coarse tobaccostained unimaginative old man lying on the snow of the grave his thick arms spread out across the raw mound as if to protect her from the cold her whom he had carefully covered up every night for sixty years who was alone there now uncared for  the elevator company ezra stowbody president let him go the company ezra explained to carol had no funds for giving pensions  she tried to have him appointed to the postmastership which since all the work was done by assistants was the one sinecure in town the one reward for political purity but it proved that mr bert tybee the former bartender desired the postmastership  at her solicitation lyman cass gave champ a warm berth as night watchman small boys played a good many tricks on champ when he fell asleep at the mill   ii   she had vicarious happiness in the return of major raymond wutherspoon he was well but still weak from having been gassed he had been discharged and he came home as the first of the war veterans it was rumored that he surprised vida by coming unannounced that vida fainted when she saw him and for a night and day would not share him with the town when carol saw them vida was hazy about everything except raymie and never went so far from him that she could not slip her hand under his without understanding why carol was troubled by this intensity and raymiesurely this was not raymie but a sterner brother of his this man with the tight blouse the shoulder emblems the trim legs in boots his face seemed different his lips more tight he was not raymie he was major wutherspoon and kennicott and carol were grateful when he divulged that paris wasnt half as pretty as minneapolis that all of the american soldiers had been distinguished by their morality when on leave kennicott was respectful as he inquired whether the germans had good aeroplanes and what a salient was and a cootie and going west  in a week major wutherspoon was made full manager of the bon ton harry haydock was going to devote himself to the halfdozen branch stores which he was establishing at crossroads hamlets harry would be the towns rich man in the coming generation and major wutherspoon would rise with him and vida was jubilant though she was regretful at having to give up most of her red cross work ray still needed nursing she explained  when carol saw him with his uniform off in a pepperand salt suit and a new gray felt hat she was disappointed he was not major wutherspoon he was raymie  for a month small boys followed him down the street and everybody called him major but that was presently shortened to maje and the small boys did not look up from their marbles as he went by    iii   the town was booming as a result of the war price of wheat  the wheat money did not remain in the pockets of the farmers the towns existed to take care of all that iowa farmers were selling their land at four hundred dollars an acre and coming into minnesota but whoever bought or sold or mortgaged the townsmen invited themselves to the feastmillers realestate men lawyers merchants and dr will kennicott they bought land at a hundred and fifty sold it next day at a hundred and seventy and bought again in three months kennicott made seven thousand dollars which was rather more than four times as much as society paid him for healing the sick  in early summer began a campaign of boosting the commercial club decided that gopher prairie was not only a wheatcenter but also the perfect site for factories summer cottages and state institutions in charge of the campaign was mr james blausser who had recently come to town to speculate in land mr blausser was known as a hustler he liked to be called honest jim he was a bulky gauche noisy humorous man with narrow eyes a rustic complexion large red hands and brilliant clothes he was attentive to all women he was the first man in town who had not been sensitive enough to feel carols aloofness he put his arm about her shoulder while he condescended to kennicott nice lil wifey ill say doc and when she answered not warmly thank you very much for the imprimatur he blew on her neck and did not know that he had been insulted  he was a layeron of hands he never came to the house without trying to paw her he touched her arm let his fist brush her side she hated the man and she was afraid of him she wondered if he had heard of erik and was taking advantage she spoke ill of him at home and in public places but kennicott and the other powers insisted maybe he is kind of a roughneck but you got to hand it to him hes got more gitupandgit than any fellow that ever hit this burg and hes pretty cute too hear what he said to old ezra chucked him in the ribs and said say boy what do you want to go to denver for wait ll i get time and ill move the mountains here any mountain will be tickled to death to locate here once we get the white way in  the town welcomed mr blausser as fully as carol snubbed him he was the guest of honor at the commercial club banquet at the minniemashie house an occasion for menus printed in gold but injudiciously proofread for free cigars soft damp slabs of lake superior whitefish served as fillet of sole drenched cigarashes gradually filling the saucers of coffee cups and oratorical references to pep punch go vigor enterprise red blood hemen fair women gods country james j hill the blue sky the green fields the bountiful harvest increasing population fair return on investments alien agitators who threaten the security of our institutions the hearthstone the foundation of the state senator knute nelson one hundred per cent americanism and pointing with pride  harry haydock as chairman introduced honest jim blausser and i am proud to say my fellow citizens that in his brief stay here mr blausser has become my warm personal friend as well as my fellow booster and i advise you all to very carefully attend to the hints of a man who knows how to achieve  mr blausser reared up like an elephant with a camels neckred faced red eyed heavy fisted slightly belchinga born leader divinely intended to be a congressman but deflected to the more lucrative honors of realestate he smiled on his warm personal friends and fellow boosters and boomed  i certainly was astonished in the streets of our lovely little city the other day i met the meanest kind of critter that god ever mademeaner than the horned toad or the texas lallapaluza laughter and do you know what the animile was he was a knocker laughter and applause  i want to tell you good people and its just as sure as god made little apples the thing that distinguishes our american commonwealth from the pikers and tinhorns in other countries is our punch you take a genuwine honesttogod homo americanibus and there aint anything hes afraid to tackle snap and speed are his middle name hell put her across if he has to ride from hell to breakfast and believe me im mighty good and sorry for the boob thats so unlucky as to get in his way because that poor slob is going to wonder where he was at when old mr cyclone hit town laughter  now friens theres some folks so yellow and small and so few in the pod that they go to work and claim that those of us that have the big vision are off our trolleys they say we cant make gopher prairie god bless her just as big as minneapolis or st paul or duluth but lemme tell you right here and now that there aint a town under the blue canopy of heaven thats got a better chance to take a running jump and go scooting right up into the twohundredthousand class than little old g p and if theres anybody thats got such cold kismets that hes afraid to tag after jim blausser on the big going up then we dont want him here way i figger it you folks are just patriotic enough so that you aint going to stand for any guy sneering and knocking his own town no matter how much of a smart aleck he isand just on the side i want to add that this farmers nonpartisan league and the whole bunch of socialists are right in the same category or as the fellow says in the same scategory meaning this way out exit beat it while the goings good this means you for all knockers of prosperity and the rights of property  fellow citizens theres a lot of folks even right here in this fair state fairest and richest of all the glorious union that stand up on their hind legs and claim that the east and europe put it all over the golden northwestland now let me nail that lie right here and now ahha says they so jim blausser is claiming that gopher prairie is as good a place to live in as london and rome andand all the rest of the big burgs is he how does the poor fish know says they well ill tell you how i know ive seen em ive done europe from soup to nuts they cant spring that stuff on jim blausser and get away with it and let me tell you that the only live thing in europe is our boys that are fighting there now londoni spent three days sixteen straight hours a day giving london the onceover and let me tell you that its nothing but a bunch of fog and outofdate buildings that no live american burg would stand for one minute you may not believe it but there aint one firstclass skyscraper in the whole works and the same thing goes for that crowd of crabs and snobs down east and next time you hear some zob from yahoovilleonthehudson chewing the rag and bulling and trying to get your goat you tell him that no twofisted enterprising westerner would have new york for a gift  now the point of this is im not only insisting that gopher prairie is going to be minnesotas pride the brightest ray in the glory of the north star state but also and furthermore that it is right now and still more shall be as good a place to live in and love in and bring up the little ones in and its got as much refinement and culture as any burg on the whole bloomin expanse of gods green footstool and that goes get me that goes  half an hour later chairman haydock moved a vote of thanks to mr blausser  the boosters campaign was on  the town sought that efficient and modern variety of fame which is known as publicity the band was reorganized and provided by the commercial club with uniforms of purple and gold the amateur baseballteam hired a semiprofessional pitcher from des moines and made a schedule of games with every town for fifty miles about the citizens accompanied it as rooters in a special car with banners lettered watch gopher prairie grow and with the band playing smile smile smile whether the team won or lost the dauntless loyally shrieked boost boys and boost togetherput gopher prairie on the mapbrilliant record of our matchless team  then glory of glories the town put in a white way white ways were in fashion in the middlewest they were composed of ornamented posts with clusters of highpowered electric lights along two or three blocks on main street the dauntless confessed white way is installedtown lit up like broadwayspeech by hon james blaussercome on you twin citiesour hat is in the ring  the commercial club issued a booklet prepared by a great and expensive literary person from a minneapolis advertising agency a redheaded young man who smoked cigarettes in a long amber holder carol read the booklet with a certain wonder she learned that plover and minniemashie lakes were worldfamed for their beauteous wooded shores and gamey pike and bass not to be equalled elsewhere in the entire country that the residences of gopher prairie were models of dignity comfort and culture with lawns and gardens known far and wide that the gopher prairie schools and public library in its neat and commodious building were celebrated throughout the state that the gopher prairie mills made the best flour in the country that the surrounding farm lands were renowned whereer men ate bread and butter for their incomparable no 1 hard wheat and holsteinfriesian cattle and that the stores in gopher prairie compared favorably with minneapolis and chicago in their abundance of luxuries and necessities and the evercourteous attention of the skilled clerks she learned in brief that this was the one logical location for factories and wholesale houses  theres where i want to go to that model town gopher prairie said carol  kennicott was triumphant when the commercial club did capture one small shy factory which planned to make wooden automobilewheels but when carol saw the promoter she could not feel that his coming much matteredand a year after when he failed she could not be very sorrowful  retired farmers were moving into town the price of lots had increased a third but carol could discover no more pictures nor interesting food nor gracious voices nor amusing conversation nor questing minds she could she asserted endure a shabby but modest town the town shabby and egomaniac she could not endure she could nurse champ perry and warm to the neighborliness of sam clark but she could not sit applauding honest jim blausser kennicott had begged her in courtship days to convert the town to beauty if it was now as beautiful as mr blausser and the dauntless said then her work was over and she could go    chapter xxxvi  kennicott was not so inhumanly patient that he could continue to forgive carols heresies to woo her as he had on the venture to california she tried to be inconspicuous but she was betrayed by her failure to glow over the boosting kennicott believed in it demanded that she say patriotic things about the white way and the new factory he snorted by golly ive done all i could and now i expect you to play the game here you been complaining for years about us being so poky and now when blausser comes along and does stir up excitement and beautify the town like youve always wanted somebody to why you say hes a roughneck and you wont jump on the bandwagon  once when kennicott announced at noondinner what do you know about this they say theres a chance we may get another factorycreamseparator works he added you might try to look interested even if you aint the baby was frightened by the jovian roar ran wailing to hide his face in carols lap and kennicott had to make himself humble and court both mother and child the dim injustice of not being understood even by his son left him irritable he felt injured  an event which did not directly touch them brought down his wrath  in the early autumn news came from wakamin that the sheriff had forbidden an organizer for the national nonpartisan league to speak anywhere in the county the organizer had defied the sheriff and announced that in a few days he would address a farmers political meeting that night the news ran a mob of a hundred business men led by the sheriffthe tame village street and the smug village faces ruddled by the light of bobbing lanterns the mob flowing between the squatty rows of shopshad taken the organizer from his hotel ridden him on a fencerail put him on a freight train and warned him not to return  the story was threshed out in dave dyers drug store with sam clark kennicott and carol present  thats the way to treat those fellowsonly they ought to have lynched him declared sam and kennicott and dave dyer joined in a proud you bet  carol walked out hastily kennicott observing her  through suppertime she knew that he was bubbling and would soon boil over when the baby was abed and they sat composedly in canvas chairs on the porch he experimented i had a hunch you thought sam was kind of hard on that fellow they kicked out of wakamin  wasnt sam rather needlessly heroic  all these organizers yes and a whole lot of the german and squarehead farmers themselves theyre seditious as the devildisloyal nonpatriotic progerman pacifists thats what they are  did this organizer say anything progerman  not on your life they didnt give him a chance his laugh was stagey  so the whole thing was illegaland led by the sheriff precisely how do you expect these aliens to obey your law if the officer of the law teaches them to break it is it a new kind of logic  maybe it wasnt exactly regular but whats the odds they knew this fellow would try to stir up trouble whenever it comes right down to a question of defending americanism and our constitutional rights its justifiable to set aside ordinary procedure  what editorial did he get that from she wondered as she protested see here my beloved why cant you tories declare war honestly you dont oppose this organizer because you think hes seditious but because youre afraid that the farmers he is organizing will deprive you townsmen of the money you make out of mortgages and wheat and shops of course since were at war with germany anything that any one of us doesnt like is progerman whether its business competition or bad music if we were fighting england youd call the radicals proenglish when this war is over i suppose youll be calling them red anarchists what an eternal art it issuch a glittery delightful artfinding hard names for our opponents how we do sanctify our efforts to keep them from getting the holy dollars we want for ourselves the churches have always done it and the political oratorsand i suppose i do it when i call mrs bogart a puritan and mr stowbody a capitalist but you business men are going to beat all the rest of us at it with your simplehearted energetic pompous  she got so far only because kennicott was slow in shaking off respect for her now he bayed  thatll be about all from you ive stood for your sneering at this town and saying how ugly and dull it is ive stood for your refusing to appreciate good fellows like sam ive even stood for your ridiculing our watch gopher prairie grow campaign but one thing im not going to stand im not going to stand my own wife being seditious you can camouflage all you want to but you know darn well that these radicals as you call em are opposed to the war and let me tell you right here and now and you and all these longhaired men and shorthaired women can beef all you want to but were going to take these fellows and if they aint patriotic were going to make them be patriotic andlord knows i never thought id have to say this to my own wifebut if you go defending these fellows then the same thing applies to you next thing i suppose youll be yapping about free speech free speech theres too much free speech and free gas and free beer and free love and all the rest of your damned mouthy freedom and if i had my way id make you folks live up to the established rules of decency even if i had to take you  will she was not timorous now am i progerman if i fail to throb to honest jim blausser too lets have my whole duty as a wife  he was grumbling the whole things right in line with the criticism youve always been making might have known youd oppose any decent constructive work for the town or for  youre right all ive done has been in line i dont belong to gopher prairie that isnt meant as a condemnation of gopher prairie and it may be a condemnation of me all right i dont care i dont belong here and im going im not asking permission any more im simply going  he grunted do you mind telling me if it isnt too much trouble how long youre going for  i dont know perhaps for a year perhaps for a lifetime  i see well of course ill be tickled to death to sell out my practise and go anywhere you say would you like to have me go with you to paris and study art maybe and wear velveteen pants and a womans bonnet and live on spaghetti  no i think we can save you that trouble you dont quite understand i am goingi really amand alone ive got to find out what my work is  work work sure thats the whole trouble with you you havent got enough work to do if you had five kids and no hired girl and had to help with the chores and separate the cream like these farmers wives then you wouldnt be so discontented  i know thats what most menand womenlike you would say thats how they would explain all i am and all i want and i shouldnt argue with them these business men from their crushing labors of sitting in an office seven hours a day would calmly recommend that i have a dozen children as it happens ive done that sort of thing thereve been a good many times when we hadnt a maid and i did all the housework and cared for hugh and went to red cross and did it all very efficiently im a good cook and a good sweeper and you dont dare say im not  nno youre  but was i more happy when i was drudging i was not i was just bedraggled and unhappy its workbut not my work i could run an office or a library or nurse and teach children but solitary dishwashing isnt enough to satisfy meor many other women were going to chuck it were going to wash em by machinery and come out and play with you men in the offices and clubs and politics youve cleverly kept for yourselves oh were hopeless we dissatisfied women then why do you want to have us about the place to fret you so its for your sake that im going  of course a little thing like hugh makes no difference  yes all the difference thats why im going to take him with me  suppose i refuse  you wont  forlornly uhcarrie what the devil is it you want anyway  oh conversation no its much more than that i think its a greatness of lifea refusal to be content with even the healthiest mud  dont you know that nobody ever solved a problem by running away from it  perhaps only i choose to make my own definition of running away i dont calldo you realize how big a world there is beyond this gopher prairie where youd keep me all my life it may be that some day ill come back but not till i can bring something more than i have now and even if i am cowardly and run awayall right call it cowardly call me anything you want to ive been ruled too long by fear of being called things im going away to be quiet and think imim going i have a right to my own life  so have i to mine  well  i have a right to my lifeand youre it youre my life youve made yourself so im damned if ill agree to all your freak notions but i will say ive got to depend on you never thought of that complication did you in this off to bohemia and express yourself and free love and live your own life stuff  you have a right to me if you can keep me can you  he moved uneasily   ii   for a month they discussed it they hurt each other very much and sometimes they were close to weeping and invariably he used banal phrases about her duties and she used phrases quite as banal about freedom and through it all her discovery that she really could get away from main street was as sweet as the discovery of love kennicott never consented definitely at most he agreed to a public theory that she was going to take a short trip and see what the east was like in wartime  she set out for washington in octoberjust before the war ended  she had determined on washington because it was less intimidating than the obvious new york because she hoped to find streets in which hugh could play and because in the stress of warwork with its demand for thousands of temporary clerks she could be initiated into the world of offices  hugh was to go with her despite the wails and rather extensive comments of aunt bessie  she wondered if she might not encounter erik in the east but it was a chance thought soon forgotten   iii   the last thing she saw on the station platform was kennicott faithfully waving his hand his face so full of uncomprehending loneliness that he could not smile but only twitch up his lips she waved to him as long as she could and when he was lost she wanted to leap from the vestibule and run back to him she thought of a hundred tendernesses she had neglected  she had her freedom and it was empty the moment was not the highest of her life but the lowest and most desolate which was altogether excellent for instead of slipping downward she began to climb  she sighed i couldnt do this if it werent for wills kindness his giving me money but a second after i wonder how many women would always stay home if they had the money  hugh complained notice me mummy he was beside her on the red plush seat of the daycoach a boy of three and a half im tired of playing train lets play something else lets go see auntie bogart  oh no do you really like mrs bogart  yes she gives me cookies and she tells me about the dear lord you never tell me about the dear lord why dont you tell me about the dear lord auntie bogart says im going to be a preacher can i be a preacher can i preach about the dear lord  oh please wait till my generation has stopped rebelling before yours starts in  whats a generation  its a ray in the illumination of the spirit  thats foolish he was a serious and literal person and rather humorless she kissed his frown and marveled  i am running away from my husband after liking a swedish neerdowell and expressing immoral opinions just as in a romantic story and my own son reproves me because i havent given him religious instruction but the story doesnt go right im neither groaning nor being dramatically saved i keep on running away and i enjoy it im mad with joy over it gopher prairie is lost back there in the dust and stubble and i look forward  she continued it to hugh darling do you know what mother and you are going to find beyond the blue horizon rim  what flatly  were going to find elephants with golden howdahs from which peep young maharanees with necklaces of rubies and a dawn sea colored like the breast of a dove and a white and green house filled with books and silver teasets  and cookies  cookies oh most decidedly cookies weve had enough of bread and porridge wed get sick on too many cookies but ever so much sicker on no cookies at all  thats foolish  it is o male kennicott  huh said kennicott ii and went to sleep on her shoulder   iv  the theory of the dauntless regarding carols absence  mrs will kennicott and son hugh left on no 24 on saturday last for a stay of some months in minneapolis chicago new york and washington mrs kennicott confided to ye scribe that she will be connected with one of the multifarious war activities now centering in the nations capital for a brief period before returning her countless friends who appreciate her splendid labors with the local red cross realize how valuable she will be to any war board with which she chooses to become connected gopher prairie thus adds another shining star to its service flag and without wishing to knock any neighboring communities we would like to know any town of anywheres near our size in the state that has such a sterling war record another reason why youd better watch gopher prairie grow      mr and mrs david dyer mrs dyers sister mrs jennie dayborn of jackrabbit and dr will kennicott drove to minniemashie on tuesday for a delightful picnic    chapter xxxvii  i  she found employment in the bureau of war risk insurance though the armistice with germany was signed a few weeks after her coming to washington the work of the bureau continued she filed correspondence all day then she dictated answers to letters of inquiry it was an endurance of monotonous details yet she asserted that she had found real work  disillusions she did have she discovered that in the afternoon office routine stretches to the grave she discovered that an office is as full of cliques and scandals as a gopher prairie she discovered that most of the women in the government bureaus lived unhealthfully dining on snatches in their crammed apartments but she also discovered that business women may have friendships and enmities as frankly as men and may revel in a bliss which no housewife attainsa free sunday it did not appear that the great world needed her inspiration but she felt that her letters her contact with the anxieties of men and women all over the country were a part of vast affairs not confined to main street and a kitchen but linked with paris bangkok madrid  she perceived that she could do office work without losing any of the putative feminine virtue of domesticity that cooking and cleaning when divested of the fussing of an aunt bessie take but a tenth of the time which in a gopher prairie it is but decent to devote to them  not to have to apologize for her thoughts to the jolly seventeen not to have to report to kennicott at the end of the day all that she had done or might do was a relief which made up for the office weariness she felt that she was no longer onehalf of a marriage but the whole of a human being   ii   washington gave her all the graciousness in which she had had faith white columns seen across leafy parks spacious avenues twisty alleys daily she passed a dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard behind it and a tall curtained secondstory window through which a woman was always peering the woman was mystery romance a story which told itself differently every day now she was a murderess now the neglected wife of an ambassador it was mystery which carol had most lacked in gopher prairie where every house was open to view where every person was but too easy to meet where there were no secret gates opening upon moors over which one might walk by mossdeadened paths to strange high adventures in an ancient garden  as she flitted up sixteenth street after a kreisler recital given late in the afternoon for the government clerks as the lamps kindled in spheres of soft fire as the breeze flowed into the street fresh as prairie winds and kindlier as she glanced up the elm alley of massachusetts avenue as she was rested by the integrity of the scottish rite temple she loved the city as she loved no one save hugh she encountered negro shanties turned into studios with orange curtains and pots of mignonette marble houses on new hampshire avenue with butlers and limousines and men who looked like fictional explorers and aviators her days were swift and she knew that in her folly of running away she had found the courage to be wise  she had a dispiriting first month of hunting lodgings in the crowded city she had to roost in a hallroom in a moldy mansion conducted by an indignant decayed gentlewoman and leave hugh to the care of a doubtful nurse but later she made a home   iii   her first acquaintances were the members of the tincomb methodist church a vast redbrick tabernacle vida sherwin had given her a letter to an earnest woman with eyeglasses plaid silk waist and a belief in bible classes who introduced her to the pastor and the nicer members of tincomb carol recognized in washington as she had in california a transplanted and guarded main street twothirds of the churchmembers had come from gopher prairies the church was their society and their standard they went to sunday service sunday school christian endeavor missionary lectures church suppers precisely as they had at home they agreed that ambassadors and flippant newspapermen and infidel scientists of the bureaus were equally wicked and to be avoided and by cleaving to tincomb church they kept their ideals from all contamination  they welcomed carol asked about her husband gave her advice regarding colic in babies passed her the gingerbread and scalloped potatoes at church suppers and in general made her very unhappy and lonely so that she wondered if she might not enlist in the militant suffrage organization and be allowed to go to jail  always she was to perceive in washington as doubtless she would have perceived in new york or london a thick streak of main street the cautious dullness of a gopher prairie appeared in boardinghouses where ladylike bureauclerks gossiped to polite young army officers about the movies a thousand sam clarks and a few widow bogarts were to be identified in the sunday motor procession in theater parties and at the dinners of state societies to which the emigres from texas or michigan surged that they might confirm themselves in the faith that their several gopher prairies were notoriously a whole lot peppier and chummier than this stuckup east  but she found a washington which did not cleave to main street  guy pollock wrote to a cousin a temporary army captain a confiding and buoyant lad who took carol to teadances and laughed as she had always wanted some one to laugh about nothing in particular the captain introduced her to the secretary of a congressman a cynical young widow with many acquaintances in the navy through her carol met commanders and majors newspapermen chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the bureaus and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage headquarters the teacher took her to headquarters carol never became a prominent suffragist indeed her only recognized position was as an able addresser of envelopes but she was casually adopted by this family of friendly women who when they were not being mobbed or arrested took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the chesapeake canal or talked about the politics of the american federation of labor  with the congressmans secretary and the teacher carol leased a small flat here she found home her own place and her own people she had though it absorbed most of her salary an excellent nurse for hugh she herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays there were walks with him there were motionless evenings of reading but chiefly washington was associated with people scores of them sitting about the flat talking talking talking not always wisely but always excitedly it was not at all the artists studio of which because of its persistence in fiction she had dreamed most of them were in offices all day and thought more in cardcatalogues or statistics than in mass and color but they played very simply and they saw no reason why anything which exists cannot also be acknowledged  she was sometimes shocked quite as she had shocked gopher prairie by these girls with their cigarettes and elfish knowledge when they were most eager about soviets or canoeing she listened longed to have some special learning which would distinguish her and sighed that her adventure had come so late kennicott and main street had drained her selfreliance the presence of hugh made her feel temporary some dayoh shed have to take him back to open fields and the right to climb about haylofts  but the fact that she could never be eminent among these scoffing enthusiasts did not keep her from being proud of them from defending them in imaginary conversations with kennicott who grunted she could hear his voice theyre simply a bunch of wild impractical theorists sittin round chewing the rag and i havent got the time to chase after a lot of these fool fads im too busy putting aside a stake for our old age  most of the men who came to the flat whether they were army officers or radicals who hated the army had the easy gentleness the acceptance of women without embarrassed banter for which she had longed in gopher prairie yet they seemed to be as efficient as the sam clarks she concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation not hemmed in by the fire of provincial jealousies kennicott had asserted that the villagers lack of courtesy is due to his poverty were no millionaire dudes he boasted yet these army and navy men these bureau experts and organizers of multitudinous leagues were cheerful on three or four thousand a year while kennicott had outside of his land speculations six thousand or more and sam had eight  nor could she upon inquiry learn that many of this reckless race died in the poorhouse that institution is reserved for men like kennicott who after devoting fifty years to putting aside a stake incontinently invest the stake in spurious oilstocks   iv   she was encouraged to believe that she had not been abnormal in viewing gopher prairie as unduly tedious and slatternly she found the same faith not only in girls escaped from domesticity but also in demure old ladies who tragically deprived of esteemed husbands and huge old houses yet managed to make a very comfortable thing of it by living in small flats and having time to read  but she also learned that by comparison gopher prairie was a model of daring color clever planning and frenzied intellectuality from her teacherhousemate she had a sardonic description of a middlewestern railroaddivision town of the same size as gopher prairie but devoid of lawns and trees a town where the tracks sprawled along the cinderscabbed main street and the railroad shops dripping soot from eaves and doorway rolled out smoke in greasy coils  other towns she came to know by anecdote a prairie village where the wind blew all day long and the mud was two feet thick in spring and in summer the flying sand scarred newpainted houses and dust covered the few flowers set out in pots new england milltowns with the hands living in rows of cottages like blocks of lava a rich farmingcenter in new jersey off the railroad furiously pious ruled by old men unbelievably ignorant old men sitting about the grocery talking of james g blaine a southern town full of the magnolias and white columns which carol had accepted as proof of romance but hating the negroes obsequious to the old families a western miningsettlement like a tumor a booming semicity with parks and clever architects visited by famous pianists and unctuous lecturers but irritable from a struggle between union labor and the manufacturers association so that in even the gayest of the new houses there was a ceaseless and intimidating heresyhunt   v   the chart which plots carols progress is not easy to read the lines are broken and uncertain of direction often instead of rising they sink in wavering scrawls and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray of rubbed pencil marks a few lines are traceable  unhappy women are given to protecting their sensitiveness by cynical gossip by whining by highchurch and newthought religions or by a fog of vagueness carol had hidden in none of these refuges from reality but she who was tender and merry had been made timorous by gopher prairie even her flight had been but the temporary courage of panic the thing she gained in washington was not information about officesystems and labor unions but renewed courage that amiable contempt called poise her glimpse of tasks involving millions of people and a score of nations reduced main street from bloated importance to its actual pettiness she could never again be quite so awed by the power with which she herself had endowed the vidas and blaussers and bogarts  from her work and from her association with women who had organized suffrage associations in hostile cities or had defended political prisoners she caught something of an impersonal attitude saw that she had been as touchily personal as maud dyer  and why she began to ask did she rage at individuals not individuals but institutions are the enemies and they most afflict the disciples who the most generously serve them they insinuate their tyranny under a hundred guises and pompous names such as polite society the family the church sound business the party the country the superior white race and the only defense against them carol beheld is unembittered laughter    chapter xxxviii  she had lived in washington for a year she was tired of the office it was tolerable far more tolerable than housework but it was not adventurous  she was having tea and cinnamon toast alone at a small round table on the balcony of rauschers confiserie four debutantes clattered in she had felt young and dissipated had thought rather well of her black and leafgreen suit but as she watched them thin of ankle soft under the chin seventeen or eighteen at most smoking cigarettes with the correct ennui and talking of bedroom farces and their desire to run up to new york and see something racy she became old and rustic and plain and desirous of retreating from these hard brilliant children to a life easier and more sympathetic when they flickered out and one child gave orders to a chauffeur carol was not a defiant philosopher but a faded government clerk from gopher prairie minnesota  she started dejectedly up connecticut avenue she stopped her heart stopped coming toward her were harry and juanita haydock she ran to them she kissed juanita while harry confided hadnt expected to come to washingtonhad to go to new york for some buyingdidnt have your address alongjust got in this morningwondered how in the world we could get hold of you  she was definitely sorry to hear that they were to leave at nine that evening and she clung to them as long as she could she took them to st marks for dinner stooped her elbows on the table she heard with excitement that cy bogart had the flu but of course he was too goldarn mean to die of it  will wrote me that mr blausser has gone away how did he get on  fine fine great loss to the town there was a real publicspirited fellow all right  she discovered that she now had no opinions whatever about mr blausser and she said sympathetically will you keep up the townboosting campaign  harry fumbled well weve dropped it just temporarily butsure you bet say did the doc write you about the luck b j gougerling had hunting ducks down in texas  when the news had been told and their enthusiasm had slackened she looked about and was proud to be able to point out a senator to explain the cleverness of the canopied garden she fancied that a man with dinnercoat and waxed mustache glanced superciliously at harrys highly formfitting brightbrown suit and juanitas tan silk frock which was doubtful at the seams she glared back defending her own daring the world not to appreciate them  then waving to them she lost them down the long train shed she stood reading the list of stations harrisburg pittsburg chicago beyond chicago she saw the lakes and stubble fields heard the rhythm of insects and the creak of a buggy was greeted by sam clarks well well hows the little lady  nobody in washington cared enough for her to fret about her sins as sam did  but that night they had at the flat a man just back from finland   ii   she was on the powhatan roof with the captain at a table somewhat vociferously buying improbable soft drinks for two fluffy girls was a man with a large familiar back  oh i think i know him she murmured  who there oh bresnahan percy bresnahan  yes youve met him what sort of a man is he  hes a goodhearted idiot i rather like him and i believe that as a salesman of motors hes a wonder but hes a nuisance in the aeronautic section tries so hard to be useful but he doesnt know anythinghe doesnt know anything rather pathetic rich man poking around and trying to be useful do you want to speak to him  nonoi dont think so   iii   she was at a motionpicture show the film was a highly advertised and abysmal thing smacking of simpering hairdressers cheap perfume redplush suites on the back streets of tenderloins and complacent fat women chewing gum it pretended to deal with the life of studios the leading man did a portrait which was a masterpiece he also saw visions in pipesmoke and was very brave and poor and pure he had ringlets and his masterpiece was strangely like an enlarged photograph  carol prepared to leave  on the screen in the role of a composer appeared an actor called eric valour  she was startled incredulous then wretched looking straight out at her wearing a beret and a velvet jacket was erik valborg  he had a pale part which he played neither well nor badly she speculated i could have made so much of him she did not finish her speculation  she went home and read kennicotts letters they had seemed stiff and undetailed but now there strode from them a personality a personality unlike that of the languishing young man in the velvet jacket playing a dummy piano in a canvas room   iv   kennicott first came to see her in november thirteen months after her arrival in washington when he announced that he was coming she was not at all sure that she wished to see him she was glad that he had made the decision himself  she had leave from the office for two days  she watched him marching from the train solid assured carrying his heavy suitcase and she was diffidenthe was such a bulky person to handle they kissed each other questioningly and said at the same time youre looking fine hows the baby and youre looking awfully well dear how is everything  he grumbled i dont want to butt in on any plans youve made or your friends or anything but if youve got time for it id like to chase around washington and take in some restaurants and shows and stuff and forget work for a while  she realized in the taxicab that he was wearing a soft gray suit a soft easy hat a flippant tie  like the new outfit got em in chicago gosh i hope theyre the kind you like  they spent half an hour at the flat with hugh she was flustered but he gave no sign of kissing her again  as he moved about the small rooms she realized that he had had his new tan shoes polished to a brassy luster there was a recent cut on his chin he must have shaved on the train just before coming into washington  it was pleasant to feel how important she was how many people she recognized as she took him to the capitol as she told him he asked and she obligingly guessed how many feet it was to the top of the dome as she pointed out senator lafollette and the vicepresident and at lunchtime showed herself an habitue by leading him through the catacombs to the senate restaurant  she realized that he was slightly more bald the familiar way in which his hair was parted on the left side agitated her she looked down at his hands and the fact that his nails were as illtreated as ever touched her more than his pleading shoeshine  youd like to motor down to mount vernon this afternoon wouldnt you she said  it was the one thing he had planned he was delighted that it seemed to be a perfectly well bred and washingtonian thing to do  he shyly held her hand on the way and told her the news they were excavating the basement for the new schoolbuilding vida made him tired the way she always looked at the maje poor chet dashaway had been killed in a motor accident out on the coast he did not coax her to like him at mount vernon he admired the paneled library and washingtons dental tools  she knew that he would want oysters that he would have heard of harveys apropos of grant and blaine and she took him there at dinner his hearty voice his holiday enjoyment of everything turned into nervousness in his desire to know a number of interesting matters such as whether they still were married but he did not ask questions and he said nothing about her returning he cleared his throat and observed oh say been trying out the old camera dont you think these are pretty good  he tossed over to her thirty prints of gopher prairie and the country about without defense she was thrown into it she remembered that he had lured her with photographs in courtship days she made a note of his sameness his satisfaction with the tactics which had proved good before but she forgot it in the familiar places she was seeing the sunspeckled ferns among birches on the shore of minniemashie windrippled miles of wheat the porch of their own house where hugh had played main street where she knew every window and every face  she handed them back with praise for his photography and he talked of lenses and timeexposures  dinner was over and they were gossiping of her friends at the flat but an intruder was with them sitting back persistent inescapable she could not endure it she stammered  i had you check your bag at the station because i wasnt quite sure where youd stay im dreadfully sorry we havent room to put you up at the flat we ought to have seen about a room for you before dont you think you better call up the willard or the washington now  he peered at her cloudily without words he asked without speech she answered whether she was also going to the willard or the washington but she tried to look as though she did not know that they were debating anything of the sort she would have hated him had he been meek about it but he was neither meek nor angry however impatient he may have been with her blandness he said readily  yes guess i better do that excuse me a second then how about grabbing a taxi gosh isnt it the limit the way these taxi shuffers skin around a corner got more nerve driving than i have and going up to your flat for a while like to meet your friendsmust be fine womenand i might take a look and see how hugh sleeps like to know how he breathes dont think he has adenoids but i better make sure eh he patted her shoulder  at the flat they found her two housemates and a girl who had been to jail for suffrage kennicott fitted in surprisingly he laughed at the girls story of the humors of a hungerstrike he told the secretary what to do when her eyes were tired from typing and the teacher asked himnot as the husband of a friend but as a physicianwhether there was anything to this inoculation for colds  his colloquialisms seemed to carol no more lax than their habitual slang  like an older brother he kissed her goodnight in the midst of the company  hes terribly nice said her housemates and waited for confidences they got none nor did her own heart she could find nothing definite to agonize about she felt that she was no longer analyzing and controlling forces but swept on by them  he came to the flat for breakfast and washed the dishes that was her only occasion for spite back home he never thought of washing dishes  she took him to the obvious sightsthe treasury the monument the corcoran gallery the panamerican building the lincoln memorial with the potomac beyond it and the arlington hills and the columns of the lee mansion for all his willingness to play there was over him a melancholy which piqued her his normally expressionless eyes had depths to them now and strangeness as they walked through lafayette square looking past the jackson statue at the lovely tranquil facade of the white house he sighed i wish id had a shot at places like this when i was in the u i had to earn part of my way and when i wasnt doing that or studying i guess i was roughhousing my gang were a great bunch for bumming around and raising cain maybe if id been caught early and sent to concerts and all thatwould i have been what you call intelligent  oh my dear dont be humble you are intelligent for instance youre the most thorough doctor  he was edging about something he wished to say he pounced on it  you did like those pictures of g p pretty well after all didnt you  yes of course  wouldnt be so bad to have a glimpse of the old town would it  no it wouldnt just as i was terribly glad to see the haydocks but please understand me that doesnt mean that i withdraw all my criticisms the fact that i might like a glimpse of old friends hasnt any particular relation to the question of whether gopher prairie oughtnt to have festivals and lamb chops  hastily no no sure not i undstand  but i know it must have been pretty tiresome to have to live with anybody as perfect as i was  he grinned she liked his grin   v   he was thrilled by old negro coachmen admirals aeroplanes the building to which his income tax would eventually go a rollsroyce lynnhaven oysters the supreme court room a new york theatrical manager down for the tryout of a play the house where lincoln died the cloaks of italian officers the barrows at which clerks buy their boxlunches at noon the barges on the chesapeake canal and the fact that district of columbia cars had both district and maryland licenses  she resolutely took him to her favorite white and green cottages and georgian houses he admitted that fanlights and white shutters against rosy brick were more homelike than a painty wooden box he volunteered i see how you mean they make me think of these pictures of an oldfashioned christmas oh if you keep at it long enough youll have sam and me reading poetry and everything oh say d i tell you about this fierce green jack elders had his machine painted   vi   they were at dinner  he hinted before you showed me those places today id already made up my mind that when i built the new house we used to talk about id fix it the way you wanted it im pretty practical about foundations and radiation and stuff like that but i guess i dont know a whole lot about architecture  my dear it occurs to me with a sudden shock that i dont either  wellanywayyou let me plan the garage and the plumbing and you do the rest if you everi meanif you ever want to  doubtfully thats sweet of you  look here carrie you think im going to ask you to love me im not and im not going to ask you to come back to gopher prairie  she gaped  its been a whale of a fight but i guess ive got myself to see that you wont ever stand g p unless you want to come back to it i neednt say im crazy to have you but i wont ask you i just want you to know how i wait for you every mail i look for a letter and when i get one im kind of scared to open it im hoping so much that youre coming back eveningsyou know i didnt open the cottage down at the lake at all this past summer simply couldnt stand all the others laughing and swimming and you not there i used to sit on the porch in town and ii couldnt get over the feeling that youd simply run up to the drug store and would be right back and till after it got dark id catch myself watching looking up the street and you never came and the house was so empty and still that i didnt like to go in and sometimes i fell asleep there in my chair and didnt wake up till after midnight and the houseoh the devil please get me carrie i just want you to know how welcome youll be if you ever do come but im not asking you to  youreits awfully  nother thing im going to be frank i havent always been absolutely uh absolutely proper ive always loved you more than anything else in the world you and the kid but sometimes when you were chilly to me id get lonely and sore and pike out andnever intended  she rescued him with a pitying its all right lets forget it  but before we were married you said if your husband ever did anything wrong youd want him to tell you  did i i cant remember and i cant seem to think oh my dear i do know how generously youre trying to make me happy the only thing isi cant think i dont know what i think  then listen dont think heres what i want you to do get a twoweeks leave from your office weathers beginning to get chilly here lets run down to charleston and savannah and maybe florida  a second honeymoon indecisively  no dont even call it that call it a second wooing i wont ask anything i just want the chance to chase around with you i guess i never appreciated how lucky i was to have a girl with imagination and lively feet to play with socould you maybe run away and see the south with me if you wanted to you could justyou could just pretend you were my sister andill get an extra nurse for hugh ill get the best doggone nurse in washington   vii   it was in the villa margherita by the palms of the charleston battery and the metallic harbor that her aloofness melted  when they sat on the upper balcony enchanted by the moon glitter she cried shall i go back to gopher prairie with you decide for me im tired of deciding and undeciding  no youve got to do your own deciding as a matter of fact in spite of this honeymoon i dont think i want you to come home not yet  she could only stare  i want you to be satisfied when you get there ill do everything i can to keep you happy but ill make lots of breaks so i want you to take time and think it over  she was relieved she still had a chance to seize splendid indefinite freedoms she might gooh shed see europe somehow before she was recaptured but she also had a firmer respect for kennicott she had fancied that her life might make a story she knew that there was nothing heroic or obviously dramatic in it no magic of rare hours nor valiant challenge but it seemed to her that she was of some significance because she was commonplaceness the ordinary life of the age made articulate and protesting it had not occurred to her that there was also a story of will kennicott into which she entered only so much as he entered into hers that he had bewilderments and concealments as intricate as her own and soft treacherous desires for sympathy  thus she brooded looking at the amazing sea holding his hand   viii   she was in washington kennicott was in gopher prairie writing as dryly as ever about waterpipes and goosehunting and mrs fageross mastoid  she was talking at dinner to a generalissima of suffrage should she return  the leader spoke wearily  my dear im perfectly selfish i cant quite visualize the needs of your husband and it seems to me that your baby will do quite as well in the schools here as in your barracks at home  then you think id better not go back carol sounded disappointed  its more difficult than that when i say that im selfish i mean that the only thing i consider about women is whether theyre likely to prove useful in building up real political power for women and you shall i be frank remember when i say you i dont mean you alone im thinking of thousands of women who come to washington and new york and chicago every year dissatisfied at home and seeking a sign in the heavenswomen of all sorts from timid mothers of fifty in cotton gloves to girls just out of vassar who organize strikes in their own fathers factories all of you are more or less useful to me but only a few of you can take my place because i have one virtue only one i have given up father and mother and children for the love of god  heres the test for you do you come to conquer the east as people say or do you come to conquer yourself  its so much more complicated than any of you knowso much more complicated than i knew when i put on ground grippers and started out to reform the world the final complication in conquering washington or conquering new york is that the conquerors must beyond all things not conquer it must have been so easy in the good old days when authors dreamed only of selling a hundred thousand volumes and sculptors of being feted in big houses and even the uplifters like me had a simplehearted ambition to be elected to important offices and invited to go round lecturing but we meddlers have upset everything now the one thing that is disgraceful to any of us is obvious success the uplifter who is very popular with wealthy patrons can be pretty sure that he has softened his philosophy to please them and the author who is making lots of moneypoor things ive heard em apologizing for it to the shabby bitterenders ive seen em ashamed of the sleek luggage they got from movie rights  do you want to sacrifice yourself in such a topsyturvy world where popularity makes you unpopular with the people you love and the only failure is cheap success and the only individualist is the person who gives up all his individualism to serve a jolly ungrateful proletariat which thumbs its nose at him  carol smiled ingratiatingly to indicate that she was indeed one who desired to sacrifice but she sighed i dont know im afraid im not heroic i certainly wasnt out home why didnt i do big effective  not a matter of heroism matter of endurance your middlewest is doublepuritanprairie puritan on top of new england puritan bluff frontiersman on the surface but in its heart it still has the ideal of plymouth rock in a sleetstorm theres one attack you can make on it perhaps the only kind that accomplishes much anywhere you can keep on looking at one thing after another in your home and church and bank and ask why it is and who first laid down the law that it had to be that way if enough of us do this impolitely enough then well become civilized in merely twenty thousand years or so instead of having to wait the two hundred thousand years that my cynical anthropologist friends allow    easy pleasant lucrative homework for wives asking people to define their jobs thats the most dangerous doctrine i know  carol was mediating i will go back i will go on asking questions ive always done it and always failed at it and its all i can do im going to ask ezra stowbody why hes opposed to the nationalization of railroads and ask dave dyer why a druggist always is pleased when hes called doctor and maybe ask mrs bogart why she wears a widows veil that looks like a dead crow  the woman leader straightened and you have one thing you have a baby to hug thats my temptation i dream of babiesof a babyand i sneak around parks to see them playing the children in dupont circle are like a poppygarden and the antis call me unsexed  carol was thinking in panic oughtnt hugh to have country air i wont let him become a yokel i can guide him away from streetcorner loafing    i think i can  on her way home now that ive made a precedent joined the union and gone out on one strike and learned personal solidarity i wont be so afraid will wont always be resisting my running away some day i really will go to europe with him    or without him  ive lived with people who are not afraid to go to jail i could invite a miles bjornstam to dinner without being afraid of the haydocks    i think i could  ill take back the sound of yvette guilberts songs and elmans violin theyll be only the lovelier against the thrumming of crickets in the stubble on an autumn day  i can laugh now and be serene    i think i can  though she should return she said she would not be utterly defeated she was glad of her rebellion the prairie was no longer empty land in the sunglare it was the living tawny beast which she had fought and made beautiful by fighting and in the village streets were shadows of her desires and the sound of her marching and the seeds of mystery and greatness   ix   her active hatred of gopher prairie had run out she saw it now as a toiling new settlement with sympathy she remembered kennicotts defense of its citizens as a lot of pretty good folks working hard and trying to bring up their families the best they can she recalled tenderly the young awkwardness of main street and the makeshifts of the little brown cottages she pitied their shabbiness and isolation had compassion for their assertion of culture even as expressed in thanatopsis papers for their pretense of greatness even as trumpeted in boosting she saw main street in the dusty prairie sunset a line of frontier shanties with solemn lonely people waiting for her solemn and lonely as an old man who has outlived his friends she remembered that kennicott and sam clark had listened to her songs and she wanted to run to them and sing  at last she rejoiced ive come to a fairer attitude toward the town i can love it now  she was perhaps rather proud of herself for having acquired so much tolerance  she awoke at three in the morning after a dream of being tortured by ella stowbody and the widow bogart  ive been making the town a myth this is how people keep up the tradition of the perfect hometown the happy boyhood the brilliant college friends we forget so ive been forgetting that main street doesnt think its in the least lonely and pitiful it thinks its gods own country it isnt waiting for me it doesnt care  but the next evening she again saw gopher prairie as her home waiting for her in the sunset rimmed round with splendor  she did not return for five months more five months crammed with greedy accumulation of sounds and colors to take back for the long still days  she had spent nearly two years in washington  when she departed for gopher prairie in june her second baby was stirring within her    chapter xxxix  she wondered all the way home what her sensations would be she wondered about it so much that she had every sensation she had imagined she was excited by each familiar porch each hearty well well and flattered to be for a day the most important news of the community she bustled about making calls juanita haydock bubbled over their washington encounter and took carol to her social bosom this ancient opponent seemed likely to be her most intimate friend for vida sherwin though she was cordial stood back and watched for imported heresies  in the evening carol went to the mill the mystical omomom of the dynamos in the electriclight plant behind the mill was louder in the darkness outside sat the night watchman champ perry he held up his stringy hands and squeaked weve all missed you terrible  who in washington would miss her  who in washington could be depended upon like guy pollock when she saw him on the street smiling as always he seemed an eternal thing a part of her own self  after a week she decided that she was neither glad nor sorry to be back she entered each day with the matteroffact attitude with which she had gone to her office in washington it was her task there would be mechanical details and meaningless talk what of it  the only problem which she had approached with emotion proved insignificant she had on the train worked herself up to such devotion that she was willing to give up her own room to try to share all of her life with kennicott  he mumbled ten minutes after she had entered the house say ive kept your room for you like it was ive kind of come round to your way of thinking dont see why folks need to get on each others nerves just because theyre friendly darned if i havent got so i like a little privacy and mulling things over by myself   ii   she had left a city which sat up nights to talk of universal transition of european revolution guild socialism free verse she had fancied that all the world was changing  she found that it was not  in gopher prairie the only ardent new topics were prohibition the place in minneapolis where you could get whisky at thirteen dollars a quart recipes for homemade beer the high cost of living the presidential election clarks new car and not very novel foibles of cy bogart their problems were exactly what they had been two years ago what they had been twenty years ago and what they would be for twenty years to come with the world a possible volcano the husbandmen were plowing at the base of the mountain a volcano does occasionally drop a river of lava on even the best of agriculturists to their astonishment and considerable injury but their cousins inherit the farms and a year or two later go back to the plowing  she was unable to rhapsodize much over the seven new bungalows and the two garages which kennicott had made to seem so important her intensest thought about them was oh yes theyre all right i suppose the change which she did heed was the erection of the schoolbuilding with its cheerful brick walls broad windows gymnasium classrooms for agriculture and cooking it indicated vidas triumph and it stirred her to activityany activity she went to vida with a jaunty i think i shall work for you and ill begin at the bottom  she did she relieved the attendant at the restroom for an hour a day her only innovation was painting the pine table a black and orange rather shocking to the thanatopsis she talked to the farmwives and soothed their babies and was happy  thinking of them she did not think of the ugliness of main street as she hurried along it to the chatter of the jolly seventeen  she wore her eyeglasses on the street now she was beginning to ask kennicott and juanita if she didnt look young much younger than thirtythree the eyeglasses pinched her nose she considered spectacles they would make her seem older and hopelessly settled no she would not wear spectacles yet but she tried on a pair at kennicotts office they really were much more comfortable   iii   dr westlake sam clark nat hicks and del snafflin were talking in dels barber shop  well i see kennicotts wife is taking a whirl at the restroom now said dr westlake he emphasized the now  del interrupted the shaving of sam and with his brush dripping lather he observed jocularly  whatll she be up to next they say she used to claim this burg wasnt swell enough for a city girl like her and would we please tax ourselves about thirtyseven point nine and fix it all up pretty with tidies on the hydrants and statoos on the lawns  sam irritably blew the lather from his lips with milky small bubbles and snorted be a good thing for most of us roughnecks if we did have a smart woman to tell us how to fix up the town just as much to her kicking as there was to jim blaussers gassing about factories and you can bet mrs kennicott is smart even if she is skittish glad to see her back  dr westlake hastened to play safe so was i so was i shes got a nice way about her and she knows a good deal about books or fiction anyway of course shes like all the rest of these womennot solidly foundednot scholarlydoesnt know anything about political economyfalls for every new idea that some windjamming crank puts out but shes a nice woman shell probably fix up the restroom and the restroom is a fine thing brings a lot of business to town and now that mrs kennicotts been away maybe shes got over some of her fool ideas maybe she realizes that folks simply laugh at her when she tries to tell us how to run everything  sure shell take a tumble to herself said nat hicks sucking in his lips judicially as far as im concerned ill say shes as nice a looking skirt as there is in town but yow his tone electrified them guess shell miss that swede valborg that used to work for me they was a pair talking poetry and moonshine if they could of got away with it theyd of been so darn loveydovey  sam clark interrupted rats they never even thought about making love just talking books and all that junk i tell you carrie kennicotts a smart woman and these smart educated women all get funny ideas but they get over em after theyve had three or four kids youll see her settled down one of these days and teaching sunday school and helping at sociables and behaving herself and not trying to butt into business and politics sure  after only fifteen minutes of conference on her stockings her son her separate bedroom her music her ancient interest in guy pollock her probable salary in washington and every remark which she was known to have made since her return the supreme council decided that they would permit carol kennicott to live and they passed on to a consideration of nat hickss new one about the traveling salesman and the old maid   iv   for some reason which was totally mysterious to carol maud dyer seemed to resent her return at the jolly seventeen maud giggled nervously well i suppose you found warwork a good excuse to stay away and have a swell time juanita dont you think we ought to make carrie tell us about the officers she met in washington  they rustled and stared carol looked at them their curiosity seemed natural and unimportant  oh yes yes indeed have to do that some day she yawned  she no longer took aunt bessie smail seriously enough to struggle for independence she saw that aunt bessie did not mean to intrude that she wanted to do things for all the kennicotts thus carol hit upon the tragedy of old age which is not that it is less vigorous than youth but that it is not needed by youth that its love and prosy sageness so important a few years ago so gladly offered now are rejected with laughter she divined that when aunt bessie came in with a jar of wildgrape jelly she was waiting in hope of being asked for the recipe after that she could be irritated but she could not be depressed by aunt bessies simoom of questioning  she wasnt depressed even when she heard mrs bogart observe now weve got prohibition it seems to me that the next problem of the country aint so much abolishing cigarettes as it is to make folks observe the sabbath and arrest these lawbreakers that play baseball and go to the movies and all on the lords day  only one thing bruised carols vanity few people asked her about washington they who had most admiringly begged percy bresnahan for his opinions were least interested in her facts she laughed at herself when she saw that she had expected to be at once a heretic and a returned hero she was very reasonable and merry about it and it hurt just as much as ever  her baby born in august was a girl carol could not decide whether she was to become a feminist leader or marry a scientist or both but did settle on vassar and a tricolette suit with a small black hat for her freshman year   vi   hugh was loquacious at breakfast he desired to give his impressions of owls and f street  dont make so much noise you talk too much growled kennicott  carol flared dont speak to him that way why dont you listen to him he has some very interesting things to tell  whats the idea mean to say you expect me to spend all my time listening to his chatter  why not  for one thing hes got to learn a little discipline time for him to start getting educated  ive learned much more discipline ive had much more education from him than he has from me  whats this some newfangled idea of raising kids you got in washington  perhaps did you ever realize that children are people  thats all right im not going to have him monopolizing the conversation  no of course we have our rights too but im going to bring him up as a human being he has just as many thoughts as we have and i want him to develop them not take gopher prairies version of them thats my biggest work nowkeeping myself keeping you from educating him  well lets not scrap about it but im not going to have him spoiled  kennicott had forgotten it in ten minutes and she forgot itthis time   vii   the kennicotts and the sam clarks had driven north to a duckpass between two lakes on an autumn day of blue and copper  kennicott had given her a light twentygauge shotgun she had a first lesson in shooting in keeping her eyes open not wincing understanding that the bead at the end of the barrel really had something to do with pointing the gun she was radiant she almost believed sam when he insisted that it was she who had shot the mallard at which they had fired together  she sat on the bank of the reedy lake and found rest in mrs clarks drawling comments on nothing the brown dusk was still behind them were dark marshes the plowed acres smelled fresh the lake was garnet and silver the voices of the men waiting for the last flight were clear in the cool air  mark left sang kennicott in a longdrawn call  three ducks were swooping down in a swift line the guns banged and a duck fluttered the men pushed their light boat out on the burnished lake disappeared beyond the reeds their cheerful voices and the slow splash and clank of oars came back to carol from the dimness in the sky a fiery plain sloped down to a serene harbor it dissolved the lake was white marble and kennicott was crying well old lady how about hiking out for home supper taste pretty good eh  ill sit back with ethel she said at the car  it was the first time she had called mrs clark by her given name the first time she had willingly sat back a woman of main street  im hungry its good to be hungry she reflected as they drove away  she looked across the silent fields to the west she was conscious of an unbroken sweep of land to the rockies to alaska a dominion which will rise to unexampled greatness when other empires have grown senile before that time she knew a hundred generations of carols will aspire and go down in tragedy devoid of palls and solemn chanting the humdrum inevitable tragedy of struggle against inertia  lets all go to the movies tomorrow night awfully exciting film said ethel clark  well i was going to read a new book butall right lets go said carol   viii   theyre too much for me carol sighed to kennicott ive been thinking about getting up an annual community day when the whole town would forget feuds and go out and have sports and a picnic and a dance but bert tybee why did you ever elect him mayorhes kidnapped my idea he wants the community day but he wants to have some politician give an address thats just the stilted sort of thing ive tried to avoid he asked vida and of course she agreed with him  kennicott considered the matter while he wound the clock and they tramped upstairs  yes it would jar you to have bert butting in he said amiably are you going to do much fussing over this community stunt dont you ever get tired of fretting and stewing and experimenting  i havent even started look she led him to the nursery door pointed at the fuzzy brown head of her daughter do you see that object on the pillow do you know what it is its a bomb to blow up smugness if you tories were wise you wouldnt arrest anarchists youd arrest all these children while theyre asleep in their cribs think what that baby will see and meddle with before she dies in the year 2000 she may see an industrial union of the whole world she may see aeroplanes going to mars  yump probably be changes all right yawned kennicott  she sat on the edge of his bed while he hunted through his bureau for a collar which ought to be there and persistently wasnt  ill go on always and i am happy but this community day makes me see how thoroughly im beaten  that darn collar certainly is gone for keeps muttered kennicott and louder yes i guess youi didnt quite catch what you said dear  she patted his pillows turned down his sheets as she reflected  but i have won in this ive never excused my failures by sneering at my aspirations by pretending to have gone beyond them i do not admit that main street is as beautiful as it should be i do not admit that gopher prairie is greater or more generous than europe i do not admit that dishwashing is enough to satisfy all women i may not have fought the good fight but i have kept the faith  sure you bet you have said kennicott well good night sort of feels to me like it might snow tomorrow have to be thinking about putting up the stormwindows pretty soon say did you notice whether the girl put that screwdriver back
