58775604	malvina of brittany   by  jerome k jerome     contents  malvina of brittany       the preface      i   the story      ii  how it came about      iii how cousin christopher became mixed up with it      iv  how it was kept from mrs arlington      v   how it was told to mrs marigold      vi  and how it was finished too soon      the prologue  the street of the blank wall  his evening out  the lesson  sylvia of the letters  the fawn gloves     malvina of brittany     the preface  the doctor never did believe this story but claims for it that to a great extent it has altered his whole outlook on life  of course what actually happenedwhat took place under my own nose continued the doctor i do not dispute  and then there is the case of mrs marigold  that was unfortunate i admit and still is especially for marigold  but standing by itself it proves nothing  these fluffy giggling womenas often as not it is a mere shell that they shed with their first youthone never knows what is underneath  with regard to the others the whole thing rests upon a simple scientific basis  the idea was in the air as we saya passing brainwave and when it had worked itself out there was an end of it  as for all this jackandthebeanstalk tomfoolery  there came from the darkening uplands the sound of a lost soul  it rose and fell and died away  blowing stones explained the doctor stopping to refill his pipe one finds them in these parts  hollowed out during the glacial period  always just about twilight that one hears it  rush of air caused by sudden sinking of the temperature  thats how all these sort of ideas get started  the doctor having lit his pipe resumed his stride  i dont say continued the doctor that it would have happened without her coming  undoubtedly it was she who supplied the necessary psychic conditions  there was that about hera sort of atmosphere that quaint archaic french of hersking arthur and the round table and merlin it seemed to recreate it all  an artful minx that is the only explanation  but while she was looking at you out of that curious aloofness of hers  the doctor left the sentence uncompleted  as for old littlecherry the doctor began again quite suddenly thats his specialityfolklore occultism all that flummery  if you knocked at his door with the original sleeping beauty on your arm hed only fuss round her with cushions and hope that shed had a good night found a seed oncechipped it out of an old fossil and grew it in a pot in his study  about the most dilapidated weed you ever saw talked about it as if he had rediscovered the elixir of life  even if he didnt say anything in actually so many words there was the way he went about  that of itself was enough to have started the whole thing to say nothing of that loony old irish housekeeper of his with her head stuffed full of elves and banshees and the lord knows what  again the doctor lapsed into silence  one by one the lights of the village peeped upward out of the depths  a long low line of light creeping like some luminous dragon across the horizon showed the track of the great western express moving stealthily towards swindon  it was altogether out of the common continued the doctor quite out of the common the whole thing  but if you are going to accept old littlecherrys explanation of it  the doctor struck his foot against a long grey stone half hidden in the grass and only just saved himself from falling  remains of some old cromlech explained the doctor  somewhere about here if we were to dig down we should find a withered bundle of bones crouching over the dust of a prehistoric luncheonbasket interesting neighbourhood  the descent was rough  the doctor did not talk again until we had reached the outskirts of the village  i wonder whats become of them mused the doctor  a rum go the whole thing  i should like to have got to the bottom of it  we had reached the doctors gate  the doctor pushed it open and passed in  he seemed to have forgotten me  a taking little minx i heard him muttering to himself as he fumbled with the door  and no doubt meant well  but as for that cockandbull story   i pieced it together from the utterly divergent versions furnished me by the professor and the doctor assisted so far as later incidents are concerned by knowledge common to the village    i   the story  it commenced so i calculate about the year 2000 bc or to be more precisefor figures are not the strong point of the old chroniclerswhen king heremon ruled over ireland and harbundia was queen of the white ladies of brittany the fairy malvina being her favourite attendant  it is with malvina that this story is chiefly concerned  various quite pleasant happenings are recorded to her credit  the white ladies belonged to the good people and on the whole lived up to their reputation  but in malvina side by side with much that is commendable there appears to have existed a most reprehensible spirit of mischief displaying itself in pranks that excusable or at all events understandable in say a pixy or a pigwidgeon strike one as altogether unworthy of a wellprincipled white lady posing as the friend and benefactress of mankind  for merely refusing to dance with herat midnight by the shores of a mountain lake neither the time nor the place calculated to appeal to an elderly gentleman suffering possibly from rheumatismshe on one occasion transformed an eminently respectable proprietor of tin mines into a nightingale necessitating a change of habits that to a business man must have been singularly irritating  on another occasion a quite important queen having had the misfortune to quarrel with malvina over some absurd point of etiquette in connection with a lizard seems on waking the next morning to have found herself changed into what one judges from the somewhat vague description afforded by the ancient chroniclers to have been a sort of vegetable marrow  such changes according to the professor who is prepared to maintain that evidence of an historical nature exists sufficient to prove that the white ladies formed at one time an actual living community must be taken in an allegorical sense  just as modern lunatics believe themselves to be china vases or pollparrots and think and behave as such so it must have been easy the professor argues for beings of superior intelligence to have exerted hypnotic influence upon the superstitious savages by whom they were surrounded and who intellectually considered could have been little more than children  take nebuchadnezzar  i am still quoting the professor  nowadays we should put him into a straitwaistcoat  had he lived in northern europe instead of southern asia legend would have told us how some kobold or stromkarl had turned him into a composite amalgamation of a serpent a cat and a kangaroo  be that as it may this passion for changein other peopleseems to have grown upon malvina until she must have become little short of a public nuisance and eventually it landed her in trouble  the incident is unique in the annals of the white ladies and the chroniclers dwell upon it with evident satisfaction  it came about through the betrothal of king heremons only son prince gerbot to the princess berchta of normandy  malvina seems to have said nothing but to have bided her time  the white ladies of brittany it must be remembered were not fairies pure and simple  under certain conditions they were capable of becoming women and this fact one takes it must have exerted a disturbing influence upon their relationships with eligible male mortals  prince gerbot may not have been altogether blameless  young men in those sadly unenlightened days may not in their dealings with ladies white or otherwise have always been the soul of discretion and propriety one would like to think the best of her  but even the best is indefensible  on the day appointed for the wedding she seems to have surpassed herself  into what particular shape or form she altered the wretched prince gerbot or into what shape or form she persuaded him that he had been altered it really so far as the moral responsibility of malvina is concerned seems to be immaterial the chronicle does not state  evidently something too indelicate for a selfrespecting chronicler to even hint at as judging from other passages in the book squeamishness does not seem to have been the authors literary failing the sensitive reader can feel only grateful for the omission  it would have been altogether too harrowing  it had of course from malvinas point of view the desired effect the princess berchta appears to have given one look and then to have fallen fainting into the arms of her attendants  the marriage was postponed indefinitely and malvina one sadly suspects chortled her triumph was shortlived  unfortunately for her king heremon had always been a patron of the arts and science of his period  among his friends were to be reckoned magicians genii the nine korrigans or fays of brittanyall sorts of parties capable of exerting influence and as events proved only too willing  ambassadors waited upon queen harbundia and harbundia even had she wished as on many previous occasions to stand by her favourite had no alternative  the fairy malvina was called upon to return to prince gerbot his proper body and all therein contained  she flatly refused  a selfwilled obstinate fairy suffering from swelled head  and then there was that personal note  merely that he should marry the princess berchta  she would see king heremon and anniamus in his silly old wizards robe and the fays of brittany and all the rest of them  a really nice white lady may not have cared to finish the sentence even to herself  one imagines the flash of the fairy eye the stamp of the fairy foot what could they do to her any of them with all their clacking of tongues and their wagging of heads she an immortal fairy  she would change prince gerbot back at a time of her own choosing  let them attend to their own tricks and leave her to mind hers  one pictures long walks and talks between the distracted harbundia and her refractory favouriteappeals to reason to sentiment  for my sake  dont you see  after all dear and even if he did  it seems to have ended by harbundia losing all patience  one thing there was she could do that malvina seems either not to have known of or not to have anticipated  a solemn meeting of the white ladies was convened for the night of the midsummer moon  the place of meeting is described by the ancient chroniclers with more than their usual exactitude  it was on the land that the magician kalyb had ages ago raised up above all brittany to form the grave of king taramis  the sea of the seven islands lay to the north  one guesses it to be the ridge formed by the arree mountains  the lady of the fountain appears to have been present suggesting the deep green pool from which the river dargent takes its source  roughly speaking one would place it halfway between the modern towns of morlaix and callac pedestrians even of the present day speak of the still loneliness of that high plateau treeless houseless with no sign of human hand there but that high towering monolith round which the shrill winds moan incessantly  there possibly on some broken fragment of those great grey stones queen harbundia sat in judgment  and the judgment wasand from it there was no appealthat the fairy malvina should be cast out from among the community of the white ladies of brittany over the face of the earth she should wander alone and unforgiven solemnly from the book of the rollcall of the white ladies the name of malvina was struck out for ever  the blow must have fallen upon malvina as heavily as it was unexpected without a word without one backward look she seems to have departed one pictures the white frozen face the wideopen unseeing eyes the trembling uncertain steps the groping hands the deathlike silence clinging like graveclothes round about her  from that night the fairy malvina disappears from the book of the chroniclers of the white ladies of brittany from legend and from folklore whatsoever  she does not appear again in history till the year ad 1914    ii  how it came about  it was on an evening towards the end of june 1914 that flight commander raffleton temporarily attached to the french squadron then harboured at brest received instructions by wireless to return at once to the british air service headquarters at farnborough in hampshire the night thanks to a glorious full moon would afford all the light he required and young raffleton determined to set out at once  he appears to have left the flying ground just outside the arsenal at brest about nine oclock  a little beyond huelgoat he began to experience trouble with the carburettor  his idea at first was to push on to lannion where he would be able to secure expert assistance but matters only getting worse and noticing beneath him a convenient stretch of level ground he decided to descend and attend to it himself  he alighted without difficulty and proceeded to investigate the job took him unaided longer than he had anticipated  it was a warm close night with hardly a breath of wind and when he had finished he was feeling hot and tired  he had drawn on his helmet and was on the point of stepping into his seat when the beauty of the night suggested to him that it would be pleasant before starting off again to stretch his legs and cool himself a little  he lit a cigar and looked round about him  the plateau on which he had alighted was a tableland standing high above the surrounding country  it stretched around him treeless houseless  there was nothing to break the lines of the horizon but a group of gaunt grey stones the remains so he told himself of some ancient menhir common enough to the lonely desert lands of brittany in general the stones lie overthrown and scattered but this particular specimen had by some strange chance remained undisturbed through all the centuries  mildly interested flight commander raffleton strolled leisurely towards it  the moon was at its zenith  how still the quiet night must have been was impressed upon him by the fact that he distinctly heard and counted the strokes of a church clock which must have been at least six miles away  he remembers looking at his watch and noting that there was a slight difference between his own and the church time  he made it eight minutes past twelve  with the dying away of the last vibrations of the distant bell the silence and the solitude of the place seemed to return and settle down upon it with increased insistence  while he was working it had not troubled him but beside the black shadows thrown by those hoary stones it had the effect almost of a presence  it was with a sense of relief that he contemplated returning to his machine and starting up his engine it would whir and buzz and give back to him a comfortable feeling of life and security  he would walk round the stones just once and then be off  it was wonderful how they had defied old time  as they had been placed there quite possibly ten thousand years ago so they still stood the altar of that vast empty skyroofed temple  and while he was gazing at them his cigar between his lips struggling with a strange forgotten impulse that was tugging at his knees there came from the very heart of the great grey stones the measured rise and fall of a soft even breathing  young raffleton frankly confesses that his first impulse was to cut and run  only his soldiers training kept his feet firm on the heather of course the explanation was simple  some animal had made the place its nest  but then what animal was ever known to sleep so soundly as not to be disturbed by human footsteps  if wounded and so unable to escape it would not be breathing with that quiet soft regularity contrasting so strangely with the stillness and the silence all round possibly an owls nest  young owlets make that sort of noisethe snorers so country people call them  young raffleton threw away his cigar and went down upon his knees to grope among the shadows and doing so he touched something warm and soft and yielding  but it wasnt an owl  he must have touched her very lightly for even then she did not wake  she lay there with her head upon her arm  and now close to her his eyes growing used to the shadows he saw her quite plainly the wonder of the parted lips the gleam of the white limbs beneath their flimsy covering  of course what he ought to have done was to have risen gently and moved away  then he could have coughed  and if that did not wake her he might have touched her lightly say on the shoulder and have called to her first softly then a little louder mademoiselle or mon enfant  even better he might have stolen away on tiptoe and left her there sleeping  this idea does not seem to have occurred to him  one makes the excuse for him that he was but threeandtwenty that framed in the purple moonlight she seemed to him the most beautiful creature his eyes had ever seen  and then there was the brooding mystery of it all that atmosphere of faroff primeval times from which the roots of life still draw their sap  one takes it he forgot that he was flight commander raffleton officer and gentleman forgot the proper etiquette applying to the case of ladies found sleeping upon lonely moors without a chaperon  greater still the possibility that he never thought of anything at all but just impelled by a power beyond himself bent down and kissed her  not a platonic kiss upon the brow not a brotherly kiss upon the cheek but a kiss full upon the parted lips a kiss of worship and amazement such as that with which adam in all probability awakened eve  her eyes opened and just a little sleepily she looked at him there could have been no doubt in her mind as to what had happened his lips were still pressing hers  but she did not seem in the least surprised and most certainly not angry  raising herself to a sitting posture she smiled and held out her hand that he might help her up  and alone in that vast temple starroofed and moonillumined beside that grim grey altar of forgotten rites hand in hand they stood and looked at one another  i beg your pardon said commander raffleton  im afraid i have disturbed you  he remembered afterwards that in his confusion he had spoken to her in english  but she answered him in french a quaint oldfashioned french such as one rarely finds but in the pages of old missals  he would have had some difficulty in translating it literally but the meaning of it was adapted to our modern idiom  dont mention it  im so glad youve come  he gathered she had been expecting him  he was not quite sure whether he ought not to apologise for being apparently a little late  true he had no recollection of any such appointment  but then at that particular moment commander raffleton may be said to have had no consciousness of anything beyond just himself and the wondrous other beside him  somewhere outside was moonlight and a world but all that seemed unimportant  it was she who broke the silence  how did you get here she asked  he did not mean to be enigmatical  he was chiefly concerned with still gazing at her  i flew here he answered  her eyes opened wider at that but with interest not doubt  where are your wings she asked  she was leaning sideways trying to get a view of his back  he laughed  it made her seem more human that curiosity about his back  over there he answered  she looked and for the first time saw the great shimmering sails gleaming like silver under the moonlight  she moved towards it and he followed noticing without surprise that the heather seemed to make no sign of yielding to the pressure of her white feet  she halted a little away from it and he came and stood beside her even to commander raffleton himself it looked as if the great wings were quivering like the outstretched pinions of a bird preening itself before flight  is it alive she asked  not till i whisper to it he answered  he was losing a little of his fear of her  she turned to him  shall we go she asked  he stared at her  she was quite serious that was evident  she was to put her hand in his and go away with him  it was all settled that is why he had come  to her it did not matter where  that was his affair but where he went she was to go  that was quite clearly the programme in her mind  to his credit let it be recorded he did make an effort  against all the forces of nature against his twentythree years and the red blood pulsing in his veins against the fumes of the midsummer moonlight encompassing him and the voices of the stars against the demons of poetry and romance and mystery chanting their witches music in his ears against the marvel and the glory of her as she stood beside him clothed in the purple of the night flight commander raffleton fought the good fight for common sense  young persons who scantily clad go to sleep on the heather five miles from the nearest human habitation are to be avoided by wellbroughtup young officers of his majestys aerial service  the incidence of their being uncannily beautiful and alluring should serve as an additional note of warning  the girl had had a row with her mother and wanted to get away  it was this infernal moonlight that was chiefly responsible  no wonder dogs bayed at it  he almost fancied he could hear one now  nice respectable wholesomeminded things dogs no damned sentiment about them what if he had kissed her  one is not bound for life to every woman one kisses  not the first time she had been kissed unless all the young men in brittany were blind or white blooded  all this pretended innocence and simplicity  it was just put on  if not she must be a lunatic  the proper thing to do was to say goodbye with a laugh and a jest start up his machine and be off to englanddear old practical merry england where he could get breakfast and a bath  it wasnt a fair fight one feels it  poor little prim common sense with her defiant turnedup nose and her shrill giggle and her innate vulgarity  and against her the stillness of the night and the music of the ages and the beating of his heart  so it all fell down about his feet a little crumbled dust that a passing breath of wind seemed to scatter leaving him helpless spellbound by the magic of her eyes  who are you he asked her  malvina she answered him  i am a fairy    iii how cousin christopher became mixed up with it  it did just occur to him that maybe he had not made that descent quite as successfully as he had thought he had that maybe he had come down on his head that in consequence he had done with the experiences of flight commander raffleton and was now about to enter on a new and less circumscribed existence  if so the beginning to an adventuresome young spirit seemed promising  it was malvinas voice that recalled him from this train of musing  shall we go she repeated and this time the note in her voice suggested command rather than question  why not  whatever had happened to him at whatever plane of existence he was now arrived the machine apparently had followed him mechanically he started it up  the familiar whir of the engine brought back to him the possibility of his being alive in the ordinary acceptation of the term  it also suggested to him the practical advisability of insisting that malvina should put on his spare coat malvina being five feet three and the coat having been built for a man of six feet one the effect under ordinary circumstances would have been comic  what finally convinced commander raffleton that malvina really was a fairy was that in that coat with the collar standing up some six inches above her head she looked more like one than ever  neither of them spoke  somehow it did not seem to be needed  he helped her to climb into her seat and tucked the coat about her feet she answered by the same smile with which she had first stretched out her hand to him  it was just a smile of endless content as if all her troubles were now over  commander raffleton sincerely hoped they were a momentary flash of intelligence suggested to him that his were just beginning  commander raffletons subconscious self it must have been that took charge of the machine  he seems keeping a few miles inland to have followed the line of the coast to a little south of the hague lighthouse  thereabouts he remembers descending for the purpose of replenishing his tank  not having anticipated a passenger he had filled up before starting with a spare supply of petrol an incident that was fortunate  malvina appears to have been interested in watching what she probably regarded as some novel breed of dragon being nourished from tins extricated from under her feet but to have accepted this together with all other details of the flight as in the natural scheme of things  the monster refreshed tugged spurned the ground and rose again with a roar and the creeping sea rushed down  one has the notion that for flight commander raffleton as for the rest of us there lies in wait to test the heart of him the ugly and the commonplace  so large a portion of the years will be for him a business of mean hopes and fears of sordid struggle of low cares and vulgar fret  but also one has the conviction that there will always remain with him to make life wonderful the memory of that night when godlike he rode upon the winds of heaven crowned with the glory of the worlds desire  now and again he turned his head to look at her and still as ever her eyes answered him with that strange deep content that seemed to wrap them both around as with a garment of immortality one gathers dimly something of what he felt from the look that would unconsciously come into his eyes when speaking of that enchanted journey from the sudden dumbness with which the commonplace words would die away upon his lips  well for him that his lesser self kept firm hold upon the wheel or maybe a few broken spars tossing upon the waves would have been all that was left to tell of a promising young aviator who on a summer night of june had thought he could reach the stars  halfway across the dawn came flaming up over the needles and later there stole from east to west a long low line of mistenshrouded land one by one headland and cliff flashing with gold rose out of the sea and the whitewinged gulls flew out to meet them almost he expected them to turn into spirits circling round malvina with cries of welcome  nearer and nearer they drew while gradually the mist rose upward as the moonlight grew fainter  and all at once the sweep of the chesil bank stood out before them with weymouth sheltering behind it   it may have been the bathingmachines or the gasometer beyond the railway station or the flag above the royal hotel  the curtains of the night fell suddenly away from him  the workaday world came knocking at the door  he looked at his watch  it was a little after four  he had wired them at the camp to expect him in the morning  they would be looking out for him  by continuing his course he and malvina could be there about breakfasttime  he could introduce her to the colonel  allow me colonel goodyer the fairy malvina  it was either that or dropping malvina somewhere between weymouth and farnborough  he decided without much consideration that this latter course would be preferable  but where  what was he to do with her  there was aunt emily  hadnt she said something about wanting a french governess for georgina  true malvinas french was a trifle oldfashioned in form but her accent was charming  and as for salary  there presented itself the thought of uncle felix and the three elder boys instinctively he felt that malvina would not be aunt emilys idea  his father had the dear old gentleman been alive would have been a safe refuge  they had always understood one another he and his father but his mother  he was not at all sure  he visualised the scene  the drawingroom at chester terrace  his mothers soft rustling entrance her affectionate but wellbred greeting  and then the disconcerting silence with which she would await his explanation of malvina  the fact that she was a fairy he would probably omit to mention  faced by his mothers goldrimmed pincenez he did not see himself insisting upon that detail  a young lady i happened to find asleep on a moor in brittany  and seeing it was a fine night and there being just room in the machine  and shei mean iwell here we are  there would follow such a painful silence and then the raising of the delicately arched eyebrows  you mean my dear lad that you have allowed thisthere would be a slight hesitation herethis young person to leave her home her people her friends and relations in brittany in order to attach herself to you  may i ask in what capacity  for that was precisely how it would look and not only to his mother suppose by a miracle it really represented the facts suppose that in spite of the overwhelming evidence in her favourof the night and the moon and the stars and the feeling that had come to him from the moment he had kissed hersuppose that in spite of all this it turned out that she wasnt a fairy suppose that suggestion of vulgar common sense that she was just a little minx that had run away from home had really hit the mark suppose inquiries were already on foot  a hundred horsepower aeroplane does not go about unnoticed  wasnt there a law about this sort of thingsomething about decoying and young girls he hadnt decoyed her  if anything it was the other way about but would her consent be a valid defence  how old was she  that would be the question  in reality he supposed about a thousand years or so possibly more  unfortunately she didnt look it  a coldly suspicious magistrate would probably consider sixteen a much better guess  quite possibly he was going to get into a devil of a mess over this business he cast a glance behind him  malvina responded with her changeless smile of ineffable content  for the first time it caused him a distinct feeling of irritation  they were almost over weymouth by this time  he could read plainly the advertisement posters outside the cinema theatre facing the esplanade wilkins and the mermaid  comic drama  there was a picture of the lady combing her hair also of wilkins a stoutish gentleman in striped bathing costume  that mad impulse that had come to him with the first breath of dawn to shake the dwindling world from his pinions to plunge upward towards the stars never to returnhe wished to heaven he had yielded to it  and then suddenly there leapt to him the thought of cousin christopher   dear old cousin christopher fiftyeight and a bachelor  why had it not occurred to him before  out of the sky there appeared to commander raffleton the vision of cousin christopher as a plump rubicund angel in a panama hat and a pepperandsalt tweed suit holding out a lifebelt  cousin christopher would take to malvina as some motherly hen to an orphaned duckling  a fairy discovered asleep beside one of the ancient menhirs of brittany  his only fear would be that you might want to take her away before he had written a paper about her  he would be down from oxford at his cottage commander raffleton could not for the moment remember the name of the village  it would come to him it was northwest of newbury you crossed salisbury plain and made straight for magdalen tower the downs reached almost to the orchard gate  there was a level stretch of sward nearly half a mile long  it seemed to commander raffleton that cousin christopher had been created and carefully preserved by providence for this particular job  he was no longer the moonstruck youth of the previous night on whom phantasy and imagination could play what pranks they chose  that part of him the keen fresh morning air had driven back into its cell  he was commander raffleton an eager and alert young engineer with all his wits about him  at this point that has to be remembered  descending on a lonely reach of shore he proceeded to again disturb malvina for the purpose of extracting tins  he expected his passenger would in broad daylight prove to be a pretty childishlooking girl somewhat dishevelled with maybe a tinge of blue about the nose the natural result of a threehours flight at fifty miles an hour  it was with a startling return of his original sensations when first she had come to life beneath his kiss that he halted a few feet away and stared at her the night was gone and the silence  she stood there facing the sunlight clad in a burberry overcoat half a dozen sizes too large for her  beyond her was a row of bathingmachines and beyond that again a gasometer  a goods train half a mile away was noisily shunting trucks  and yet the glamour was about her still something indescribable but quite palpablesomething out of which she looked at you as from another world  he took her proffered hand and she leapt out lightly  she was not in the least dishevelled  it seemed as if the air must be her proper element  she looked about her interested but not curious her first thought was for the machine  poor thing she said  he must be tired  that faint tremor of fear that had come to him when beneath the menhirs shadow he had watched the opening of her eyes returned to him  it was not an unpleasant sensation  rather it added a piquancy to their relationship  but it was distinctly real  she watched the feeding of the monster and then he came again and stood beside her on the yellow sands  england he explained with a wave of his hand  one fancies she had the impression that it belonged to him  graciously she repeated the name  and somehow as it fell from her lips it conjured up to commander raffleton a land of wonder and romance  i have heard of it she added  i think i shall like it  he answered that he hoped she would  he was deadly serious about it he possessed generally speaking a sense of humour but for the moment this must have deserted him  he told her he was going to leave her in the care of a wise and learned man called cousin christopher his description no doubt suggesting to malvina a friendly magician  he himself would have to go away for a little while but would return  it did not seem to matter to malvina these minor details  it was evidentthe idea in her mindthat he had been appointed to her whether as master or servant it was less easy to conjecture probably a mixture of both with preference towards the latter  he mentioned again that he would not be away for longer than he could help  there was no necessity for this repetition  she wasnt doubting it  weymouth with its bathing machines and its gasometer faded away king rufus was out ahunting as they passed over the new forest and from salisbury plain as they looked down the pixies waved their hands and laughed  later they heard the clang of the anvil telling them they were in the neighbourhood of wayland smiths cave and so planed down sweetly and without a jar just beyond cousin christophers orchard gate  a shepherds boy was whistling somewhere upon the downs and in the valley a ploughman had just harnessed his team but the village was hidden from them by the sweep of the hills and no other being was in sight  he helped malvina out and leaving her seated on a fallen branch beneath a walnut tree proceeded cautiously towards the house he found a little maid in the garden  she had run out of the house on hearing the sound of his propeller and was staring up into the sky so that she never saw him until he put his hand upon her shoulder and then was fortunately too frightened to scream  he gave her hasty instructions  she was to knock at the professors door and tell him that his cousin commander raffleton was there and would he come down at once by himself into the orchard commander raffleton would rather not come in  would the professor come down at once and speak to commander raffleton in the orchard  she went back into the house repeating it all to herself a little scared  good god said cousin christopher from beneath the bedclothes he isnt hurt is he  the little maid through the jar of the door thought not  anyhow he didnt look it  but would the professor kindly come at once commander raffleton was waiting for himin the orchard  so cousin christopher in bedroom slippers without socks wearing a mustardcoloured dressinggown and a black skull cap upon his headthe very picture of a friendly magiciantrotted hastily downstairs and through the garden talking to himself about foolhardy boys and knowing it would happen and was much relieved to meet young arthur raffleton coming towards him evidently sound in wind and limb  and then began to wonder why the devil he had been frightened out of bed at six oclock in the morning if nothing was the matter  but something clearly was  before speaking arthur raffleton looked carefully about him in a manner suggestive of mystery if not of crime and still without a word taking cousin christopher by the arm led the way to the farther end of the orchard  and there on a fallen branch beneath the walnut tree cousin christopher saw apparently a khaki coat with nothing in it which as they approached it rose up  but it did not rise very high  the back of the coat was towards them its collar stood out against the sky line  but there wasnt any head standing upright it turned round and peeping out of its folds cousin christopher saw a childs face  and then looking closer saw that it wasnt a child  and then wasnt quite sure what it was so that coming to a sudden halt in front of it cousin christopher stared at it with round wide eyes and then at flight commander raffleton  it was to malvina that flight commander raffleton addressed himself  this he said is professor littlecherry my cousin christopher about whom i told you  it was obvious that malvina regarded the professor as a person of importance  evidently her intention was to curtsy an operation that hampered by those trailing yards of clinging khaki might proveso it flashed upon the professornot only difficult but dangerous  allow me said the professor  his idea was to help malvina out of commander raffletons coat and malvina was preparing to assist him  commander raffleton was only just in time  i dont think said commander raffleton  if you dont mind i think wed better leave that for mrs muldoon  the professor let go the coat  malvina appeared a shade disappointed one opines that not unreasonably she may have thought to make a better impression without it  but a smiling acquiescence in all arrangements made for her welfare seems to have been one of her charms  perhaps suggested commander raffleton to malvina while refastening a few of the more important buttons if you wouldnt mind explaining yourself to my cousin christopher just exactly who and what you areyoud do it so much better than i should  what commander raffleton was saying to himself was  if i tell the dear old johnny hell think im pulling his leg  it will sound altogether different the way she will put it  youre sure you dont mind  malvina hadnt the slightest objection  she accomplished her curtsyor rather it looked as if the coat were curtsyingquite gracefully and with a dignity one would not have expected from it  i am the fairy malvina she explained to the professor  you may have heard of me  i was the favourite of harbundia queen of the white ladies of brittany  but that was long ago  the friendly magician was staring at her with a pair of round eyes that in spite of their amazement looked kindly and understanding they probably encouraged malvina to complete the confession of her sad brief history  it was when king heremon ruled over ireland she continued  i did a very foolish and a wicked thing and was punished for it by being cast out from the companionship of my fellows  since thenthe coat made the slightest of pathetic gesturesi have wandered alone  it ought to have sounded so ridiculous to them both told on english soil in the year one thousand nine hundred and fourteen to a smart young officer of engineers and an elderly oxford professor  across the road the doctors odd man was opening garage doors a noisy milk cart was clattering through the village a little late for the london train a faint odour of eggs and bacon came wafted through the garden mingled with the scent of lavender and pinks  for commander raffleton maybe there was excuse  this story so far as it has gone has tried to make that clear  but the professor  he ought to have exploded in a burst of homeric laughter or else to have shaken his head at her and warned her where little girls go to who do this sort of thing  instead of which he stared from commander raffleton to malvina and from malvina back to commander raffleton with eyes so astonishingly round that they might have been drawn with a compass  god bless my soul said the professor  but this is most extraordinary  was there a king heremon of ireland asked commander raffleton the professor was a wellknown authority on these matters  of course there was a king heremon of ireland answered the professor quite petulantlyas if the commander had wanted to know if there had ever been a julius caesar or a napoleon  and so there was a queen harbundia  malvina is always spoken of in connection with her  what did she do inquired commander raffleton  they both of them seemed to be oblivious of malvinas presence  i forget for the moment confessed the professor  i must look it up  something if i remember rightly in connection with the daughter of king dancrat  he founded the norman dynasty  william the conqueror and all that lot  good lord  would you mind her staying with you for a time until i can make arrangements suggested commander raffleton  id be awfully obliged if you would  what the professors answer might have been had he been allowed to exercise such stock of wits as he possessed it is impossible to say of course he was interestedexcited if you will  folklore legend tradition these had been his lifelong hobbies  apart from anything else here at least was a kindred spirit  seemed to know a thing or two  where had she learned it  might not there be sources unknown to the professor  but to take her in  to establish her in the only spare bedroom  to introduce heras what to english village society  to the new people at the manor house  to the member of parliament with his innocent young wife who had taken the vicarage for the summer  to dawson ra and the calthorpes  he might had he thought it worth his while have found some respectable french family and boarded her out  there was a man he had known for years at oxford a cabinetmaker the wife a most worthy woman  he could have gone over there from time to time his notebook in his pocket and have interviewed her  left to himself he might have behaved as a sane and rational citizen or he might not  there are records favouring the latter possibility the thing is not certain  but as regards this particular incident in his career he must be held exonerated  the decision was taken out of his hands  to malvina on first landing in england commander raffleton had stated his intention of leaving her temporarily in the care of the wise and learned christopher  to malvina regarding the commander as a gift from the gods that had settled the matter  the wise and learned christopher of course knew of this coming  in all probability it was heunder the guidance of the godswho had arranged the whole sequence of events  there remained only to tender him her gratitude  she did not wait for the professors reply  the coat a little hindered her but on the other hand added perhaps an appealing touch of its own taking the wise and learned christophers hand in both her own she knelt and kissed it  and in that quaint archaic french of hers that long study of the chronicles of froissart enabled the professor to understand  i thank you she said for your noble courtesy and hospitality   in some mysterious way the whole affair had suddenly become imbued with the dignity of an historical event  the professor had the sudden impressionand indeed it never altogether left him so long as malvina remainedthat he was a great and powerful personage  a sister potentate incidentallythough of course in high politics such points are immaterialthe most bewilderingly beautiful being he had ever seen had graciously consented to become his guest  the professor with a bow that might have been acquired at the court of king rene expressed his sense of the honour done to him  what else could a selfrespecting potentate do  the incident was closed  flight commander raffleton seems to have done nothing in the direction of reopening it  on the contrary he appears to have used this precise moment for explaining to the professor how absolutely necessary it was that he should depart for farnborough without another moments loss of time  commander raffleton added that he would look them both up again the first afternoon he could get away and was sure that if the professor would get malvina to speak slowly he would soon find her french easy to understand  it did occur to the professor to ask commander raffleton where he had found malvinathat is if he remembered  also what he was going to do about herthat is if he happened to know  commander raffleton regretting his great need of haste explained that he had found malvina asleep beside a menhir not far from huelgoat in brittany and was afraid that he had woke her up  for further particulars would the professor kindly apply to malvina  for himself he would never he felt sure be able to thank the professor sufficiently  in conclusion and without giving further opportunity for discussion the commander seems to have shaken his cousin christopher by the hand with much enthusiasm and then to have turned to malvina  she did not move but her eyes were fixed on him  and he came to her slowly  and without a word he kissed her full upon the lips  that is twice you have kissed me said malvinaand a curious little smile played round her mouth  the third time i shall become a woman    iv  how it was kept from mrs arlington  what surprised the professor himself when he came to think of it was that left alone with malvina and in spite of all the circumstances he felt neither embarrassment nor perplexity  it was as if so far as they two were concerned the whole thing was quite simplealmost humorous  it would be the other people who would have to worry  the little serving maid was hovering about the garden  she was evidently curious and trying to get a peep  mrs muldoons voice could be heard calling to her from the kitchen  there was this question of clothes  you havent brought anything with you asked the professor  i mean in the way of a frock of any sort  malvina with a smile gave a little gesture  it implied that all there was of her and hers stood before him  we shall have to find you something said the professor something in which you can go about  the professor had intended to say our world but hesitated not feeling positive at the moment to which he himself belonged malvinas or mrs muldoons  so he made it the world instead another gesture conveyed to him that malvina was entirely in his hands  what really have you got on asked the professor  i mean underneath  is it anything possiblefor a day or two  now commander raffleton for some reason of his own not at all clear to malvina had forbidden the taking off of the coat  but had said nothing about undoing it  so by way of response malvina undid it  upon which the professor to malvinas surprise acted precisely as commander raffleton had done  that is to say he hastily reclosed the coat returning the buttons to their buttonholes  the fear may have come to malvina that she was doomed never to be rid of commander raffletons coat  i wonder mused the professor if anyone in the village  the little serving maid flittering among the gooseberry bushesshe was pretending to be gathering gooseberriescaught the professors eye  we will consult my chatelaine mrs muldoon suggested the professor i think we shall be able to manage  the professor tendered malvina his arm  with her other hand she gathered up the skirts of the commanders coat  i think said the professor with a sudden inspiration as they passed through the garden i think i shall explain to mrs muldoon that you have just come straight from a fancydress ball  they found mrs muldoon in the kitchen  a less convincing story than that by which the professor sought to account to mrs muldoon for the how and the why of malvina it would be impossible to imagine  mrs muldoon out of sheer kindness appears to have cut him short  ill not be asking ye any questions said mrs muldoon so therell be no need for ye to imperil your immortal soul  if yell just give a thought to your own appearance and leave the colleen to me and drusilla well make her maybe a bit dacent  the reference to his own appearance disconcerted the professor  he had not anticipated when hastening into his dressing gown and slippers and not bothering about his socks that he was on his way to meet the chief ladyinwaiting of queen harbundia  demanding that shaving water should be immediately sent up to him he appears to have retired into the bathroom  it was while he was shaving that mrs muldoon knocking at the door demanded to speak to him  from her tone the professor came to the conclusion that the house was on fire  he opened the door and mrs muldoon seeing he was respectable slipped in and closed it behind her  where did ye find her  how did she get here demanded mrs muldoon never before had the professor seen mrs muldoon other than a placid goodhumoured body  she was trembling from head to foot  i told you explained the professor  young arthur  im not asking ye what ye told me interrupted mrs muldoon  im asking ye for the truth if ye know it  the professor put a chair for mrs muldoon and mrs muldoon dropped down upon it  whats the matter questioned the professor  whats happened  mrs muldoon glanced round her and her voice was an hysterical whisper  its no mortal woman yeve brought into the house said mrs muldoon its a fairy  whether up to that moment the professor had really believed malvinas story or whether lurking at the back of his mind there had all along been an innate conviction that the thing was absurd the professor himself is now unable to say  to the front of the professor lay oxfordpolitical economy the higher criticism the rise and progress of rationalism  behind him fading away into the dim horizon of humanity lay an unmapped land where for forty years he had loved to wander a spirithaunted land of buried mysteries lost pathways leading unto hidden gates of knowledge  and now upon the trembling balance descended mrs muldoon plump  how do you know demanded the professor  shure dont i know the mark replied mrs muldoon almost contemptuously  wasnt my own sisters child stolen away the very day of its birth and in its place  the little serving maid tapped at the door  mademoiselle was finished  what was to be done with her  dont ask me protested mrs muldoon still in a terrified whisper i couldnt do it  not if all the saints were to go down upon their knees and pray to me  commonsense argument would not have prevailed with mrs muldoon the professor felt that added to which he had not any handy  he directed through the door that mademoiselle should be shown into the diningroom and listened till drusillas footsteps had died away  have you ever heard of the white ladies whispered the professor to mrs muldoon  there was not much in the fairy line one takes it that mrs muldoon had not heard of and believed  was the professor sure  the professor gave mrs muldoon his word of honour as a gentleman the white ladies as mrs muldoon was of course aware belonged to the good people  provided nobody offended her there was nothing to fear  shure it wont be meself thatll cross her said mrs muldoon  she wont be staying very long added the professor  we will just be nice to her  shes got a kind face admitted mrs muldoon and a pleasant way with her  the good bodys spirits were perceptibly rising  the favour of a white lady might be worth cultivating  we must make a friend of her urged the professor seizing his opportunity  and mind whispered the professor as he opened the door for mrs muldoon to slip out not a word  she doesnt want it known  one is convinced that mrs muldoon left the bathroom resolved that so far as she could help it no breath of suspicion that malvina was other than what in drusillas holiday frock she would appear to be should escape into the village  it was quite a pleasant little frock of a summery character with short sleeves and loose about the neck and fitted malvina in every sense much better than the most elaborate confection would have done  the boots were not so successful  malvina solved the problem by leaving them behind her together with the stockings whenever she went out  that she knew this was wrong is proved by the fact that invariably she tried to hide them  they would be found in the most unlikely places hidden behind books in the professors study crammed into empty tea canisters in mrs muldoons storeroom  mrs muldoon was not to be persuaded even to abstract them the canister with its contents would be placed in silence upon the professors table  malvina on returning would be confronted by a pair of stern unsympathetic boots  the corners of the fairy mouth would droop in lines suggestive of penitence and contrition  had the professor been firm she would have yielded  but from the black accusing boots the professor could not keep his eyes from wandering to the guilty white feet and at once in his heart becoming counsel for the defence  must get a pair of sandals next time he went to oxford anyhow something more dainty than those grim uncompromising boots  besides it was not often that malvina ventured beyond the orchard at least not during the day timeperhaps one ought to say not during that part of the day time when the village was astir  for malvina appears to have been an early riser  somewhere about the middle of the night as any christian body would have timed it mrs muldoonwaking and sleeping during this period in a state of high nervous tensionwould hear the sound of a softly opened door peeping from a raised corner of the blind would catch a glimpse of fluttering garments that seemed to melt into the dawn would hear coming fainter and fainter from the uplands an unknown song mingling with the answering voices of the birds  it was on the uplands between dawn and sunrise that malvina made the acquaintance of the arlington twins   they ought of course to have been in bedall three of them for the matter of that  the excuse for the twins was their uncle george  he had been telling them all about the uffington spectre and wayland smiths cave and had given them puck as a birthday present  they were always given their birthday presents between them because otherwise they did not care for them  they had retired to their respective bedrooms at ten oclock and taken it in turns to lie awake at the first streak of dawn victoria who had been watching by her window woke victor as arranged  victor was for giving it up and going to sleep again but victoria reminding him of the oath they dressed themselves quite simply and let themselves down by the ivy  they came across malvina close to the tail of the white horse  they knew she was a fairy the moment they saw her  but they were not frightenedat least not very much  it was victor who spoke first taking off his hat and going down on one knee he wished malvina good morning and hoped she was quite well  malvina who seemed pleased to see them made answer and here it was that victoria took charge of the affair  the arlington twins until they were nine had shared a french nurse between them and then victor going to school had gradually forgotten while victoria remaining at home had continued her conversations with madame  oh said victoria  then you must be a french fairy  now the professor had impressed upon malvina that for reasons needless to be explainedanyhow he never had explained themshe was not to mention that she was a fairy  but he had not told her to deny it indeed how could she  the most that could be expected from her was that she should maintain silence on the point  so in answer to victoria she explained that her name was malvina and that she had flown across from brittany in company with sir arthur adding that she had often heard of england and had wished to see it  how do you like it demanded victoria  malvina confessed herself charmed with it  nowhere had she ever met so many birds  malvina raised her hand and they all three stood in silence listening  the sky was ablaze and the air seemed filled with their music  the twins were sure that there were millions of them they must have come from miles and miles and miles to sing to malvina  also the people they were so good and kind and round  malvina for the present was staying withaccepting the protection was how she put it of the wise and learned christopher  the habitation could be seen from where they stood its chimneys peeping from among the trees  the twins exchanged a meaning glance  had they not all along suspected the professor  his black skull cap and his big hooked nose and the yellowleaved wormeaten booksof magic  all doubts were now removedthat for hours he would sit poring over through owlish goldrimmed spectacles  victors french was coming back to him  he was anxious to know if malvina had ever met sir launcelotto talk to  a little cloud gathered upon malvinas face  yes she had known them all  king uthur and igraine and sir ulfias of the isles talked with them walked with them in the fair lands of france  it ought to have been england but malvina shook her head  maybe they had travelled it was she who had saved sir tristram from the wiles of morgan le fay though that of course explained malvina was never known  the twins were curious why it should have been of course but did not like to interrupt again  there were others before and after most of them the twins had never heard of until they came to charlemagne beyond which malvinas reminiscences appeared to fade  they had all of them been very courteous to her and some of them indeed quite charming  but  one gathers they had never been to malvina more than mere acquaintances such as one passes the time with while waitingand longing  but you liked sir launcelot urged victor  he was wishful that malvina should admire sir launcelot feeling how much there was in common between that early lamented knight and himself  that little affair with sir bedivere  it was just how he would have behaved himself  ah yes admitted malvina  she had liked him  he was always soso excellent  but he was notnone of them were my own people my own dear companions  the little cloud had settled down again  it was bruno who recalled the three of them to the period of contemporary history  polley the cowmans first duty in the morning was to let bruno loose for a run  he arrived panting and breathless and evidently offended at not having been included in the escapade  he could have given them both away quite easily if he had not been the most forgiving of blackandtan collies  as it was he had been worrying himself crazy for the last halfhour feeling sure they had forgotten the time dont you know its nearly six oclock  that in less than half an hour jane will be knocking at your doors with glasses of hot milk and will probably drop them and scream when she finds your beds empty and the window wide open  that is what he had intended should be his first words but on scenting malvina they went from him entirely  he gave her one look and flopped down flat wriggling towards her whining and wagging his tail at the same time  malvina acknowledged his homage by laughing and patting his head with her foot and that sent him into the seventh heaven of delight  they all four descended the hill together and parted at the orchard gate  the twins expressed a polite but quite sincere hope that they would have the pleasure of seeing malvina again but malvina seized maybe with sudden doubts as to whether she had behaved with discretion appears to have replied evasively  ten minutes later she was lying asleep the golden head pillowed on the round white arm as mrs muldoon on her way down to the kitchen saw for herself  and the twins fortunate enough to find a side door open slipped into the house unnoticed and scrambled back into their beds  it was quarter past nine when mrs arlington came in herself and woke them up  she was shorttempered with them both and had evidently been crying  they had their breakfast in the kitchen  during lunch hardly a word was spoken  and there was no pudding mr arlington a stout florid gentleman had no time for pudding the rest might sit and enjoy it at their leisure but not so mr arlington somebody had to see to thingsthat is if they were not to be allowed to go to rack and ruin  if other people could not be relied upon to do their duty so that everything inside the house and out of it was thrown upon one pair of shoulders then it followed as a natural consequence that that pair of shoulders could not spare the necessary time to properly finish its meals  this it was that was at the root of the decay of english farming  when farmers wives to say nothing of sons and daughters old enough one might imagine to be anxious to do something in repayment for the money and care lavished upon them had all put their shoulders to the wheel then english farming had prospered  when on the other hand other people shirked their fair share of labour and responsibility leaving to one pair of hands  it was the eldest arlington girls quite audible remark that pa could have eaten two helpings of pudding while he had been talking that caused mr arlington to lose the thread of his discourse  to put it quite bluntly what mr arlington meant to say was this  he had never wanted to be a farmerat least not in the beginning other men in his position having acquired competency by years of selfsacrificing labour would have retired to a wellearned leisure  having yielded to persuasion and taken on the job he was going to see it through and everybody else was going to do their share or there would be trouble  mr arlington swallowing the remains of his glass in a single gulp spoilt a dignified exit by violently hiccoughing and mrs arlington rang the bell furiously for the parlourmaid to clear away  the pudding passed untouched from before the very eyes of the twins  it was a blackcurrant pudding with brown sugar  that night mrs arlington appears to have confided in the twins partly for her own relief and partly for their moral benefit  if mrs arlington had enjoyed the blessing in disguise of a less indulgent mother all might have been well  by nature mrs arlington had been endowed with an active and energetic temperament miss cantsitstillaminute her nurse had always called her unfortunately it had been allowed to sink into disuse was now in all probability beyond hope of recovery  their father was quite right when they had lived in bayswater and the business was in mincing lane it did not matter  now it was different  a farmers wife ought to be up at six she ought to see that everybody else was up at six servants looked after kept up to the mark children encouraged by their mothers example  organisation  that was what was wanted  the day mapped out to every hour its appointed task then instead of the morning being gone before you could turn yourself round and confusion made worse confounded by your leaving off what you were doing and trying to do six things at once that you couldnt remember whether you had done or whether you hadnt  here mrs arlington appears to have dissolved into tears  generally speaking she was a placid smiling most amiable lady quite delightful to have about the house provided all you demanded of her were pleasant looks and a sunny disposition  the twins appear to have joined their tears to hers  tucked in and left to themselves one imagines the problem being discussed with grave seriousness much whispered conversation then slept upon the morning bringing with it ideas  the result being that the next evening between high tea and supper mrs muldoon answering herself the knock at the door found twin figures standing hand in hand on the professors step  they asked her if the fairy was in    v  how it was told to mrs marigold  there was no need of the proverbial feather  mrs muldoon made a grab at the settle but missed it  she caught at a chair but that gave way it was the floor that finally stopped her  were so sorry apologised victor  we thought you knew  we ought to have said mademoiselle malvina  mrs muldoon regained her feet and without answering walked straight into the study  they want to know said mrs muldoon if the fairys in  the professor with his back to the window was reading  the light in the room was somewhat faint  who wants to know demanded the professor  the twins from the manor house explained mrs muldoon  but whatbut who began the professor  shall i say not at home suggested mrs muldoon  or hadnt you better see them yourself  show them in directed the professor  they came in looking a little scared and still holding one another by the hand  they wished the professor good evening and when he rose they backed away from him  the professor shook hands with them but they did not let go so that victoria gave him her right hand and victor his left and then at the professors invitation they sat themselves down on the extreme edge of the sofa  i hope we do not disturb you said victor  we wanted to see mademoiselle malvina  why do you want to see mademoiselle malvina inquired the professor  it is something very private said victor  we wanted to ask her a great favour said victoria  im sorry said the professor but she isnt in  at least i dont think so  the professor never was quite sure  she slips in and out making no more noise than a winddriven rose leaf was mrs muldoons explanation  hadnt you better tell me  leave me to put it to her  they looked at one another  it would never do to offend the wise and learned christopher  besides a magician it is to be assumed has more ways than one of learning what people are thinking  it is about mamma explained victoria  we wondered if malvina would mind changing her  the professor had been reading up malvina  it flashed across him that this had always been her speciality  changing people  how had the arlington twins discovered it  and why did they want their mother changed  and what did they want her changed into  it was shocking when you come to think of it  the professor became suddenly so stern that if the twins could have seen his expressionwhich owing to the fading light they couldntthey would have been too frightened to answer  why do you want your mother changed demanded the professor  even as it was his voice alarmed them  its for her own good faltered victoria  of course we dont mean into anything explained victor  only her inside added victoria  we thought that malvina might be able to improve her completed victor  it was still very disgraceful  what were we coming to when children went about clamouring for their mothers to be improved  the atmosphere was charged with indignation  the twins felt it  she wants to be persisted victoria  she wants to be energetic and to get up early in the morning and do things  you see added victor she was never properly brought up   the professor maintains stoutly that his only intention was a joke it was not even as if anything objectionable had been suggested the professor himself had on occasions been made the confidant of both  best woman that ever lived if only one could graft a little energy upon her  no sense of time  too easygoing  no idea of keeping people up to the mark  so mr arlington over the nuts and wine  its pure laziness  oh yes it is  my friends say im so restful but thats the proper explanation of itborn laziness and yet i try you have no idea professor littlecherry how much i try  so mrs arlington laughingly while admiring the professors roses  besides how absurd to believe that malvina could possibly change anybody  way back when the human brain was yet in process of evolution such things may have been possible  hypnotic suggestion mesmeric influence dormant brain cells quickened into activity by magnetic vibration  all that had been lost  these were the days of george the fifth not of king heremon  what the professor was really after was  how would malvina receive the proposal  of course she would try to get out of it  a dear little thing  but could any sane man professor of mathematics  malvina was standing beside him  no one had remarked her entrance the eyes of the twins had been glued upon the wise and learned christopher the professor when he was thinking never saw anything  still it was rather startling  we should never change what the good god has once fashioned said malvina  she spoke very gravely  the childishness seemed to have fallen from her  you didnt always think so said the professor  it nettled the professor that all idea of this being a good joke had departed with the sound of malvinas voice  she had that way with her  she made a little gesture  it conveyed to the professor that his remark had not been altogether in good taste  i speak as one who has learned said malvina  i beg your pardon said the professor  i ought not to have said that  malvina accepted the professors apology with a bow  but this is something very different continued the professor quite another interest had taken hold of the professor  it was easy enough to summon dame commonsense to ones aid when malvina was not present before those strange eyes the good lady had a habit of sneaking away supposeof course the idea was ridiculous but supposesomething did happen  as a psychological experiment was not one justified  what was the beginning of all science but applied curiosity  malvina might be ableand willingto explain how it was done  that is if anything did happen which of course it wouldnt and so much the better this thing had got to be ended  it would be using a gift not for ones own purposes but to help others urged the professor  you see urged victor mamma really wants to be changed  and papa wants it too urged victoria  it seems to me if i may so express it added the professor that really it would be in the nature of making amends forwell forfor our youthful follies concluded the professor a little nervously  malvinas eyes were fixed on the professor  in the dim light of the lowceilinged room those eyes seemed all of her that was visible  you wish it said malvina  it was not at all fair as the professor told himself afterwards her laying the responsibility on him  if she really was the original malvina ladyinwaiting to queen harbundia then she was quite old enough to have decided for herself  from the professors calculations she must now be about three thousand eight hundred the professor himself was not yet sixty in comparison a mere babe but malvinas eyes were compelling  well it cant do any harm said the professor  and malvina seems to have accepted that as her authority  let her come to the cross stones at sundown directed malvina   the professor saw the twins to the door  for some reason the professor could not have explained they all three walked out on tiptoe  old mr brent the postman was passing and the twins ran after him and each took a hand  malvina was still standing where the professor had left her  it was very absurd but the professor felt frightened  he went into the kitchen where it was light and cheerful and started mrs muldoon on home rule  when he returned to the parlour malvina was gone  the twins did not talk that night and decided next morning not to say a word but just to ask their mother to come for an evening walk with them  the fear was that she might demand reasons  but quite oddly she consented without question  it seemed to the twins that it was mrs arlington herself who took the pathway leading past the cave and when they reached the cross stones she sat down and apparently had forgotten their existence  they stole away without her noticing them but did not quite know what to do with themselves  they ran for half a mile till they came to the wood there they remained awhile careful not to venture within and then they crept back  they found their mother sitting just as they had left her  they thought she was asleep but her eyes were wide open they were tremendously relieved though what they had feared they never knew  they sat down one on each side of her and each took a hand but in spite of her eyes being open it was quite a time before she seemed conscious of their return  she rose and slowly looked about her and as she did so the church clock struck nine she could not at first believe it was so late  convinced by looking at her watchthere was just light enough for her to see itshe became all at once more angry than the twins had ever known her and for the first time in their lives they both experienced the sensation of having their ears boxed  nine oclock was the proper time for supper and they were half an hour from home and it was all their fault  it did not take them half an hour  it took them twenty minutes mrs arlington striding ahead and the twins panting breathless behind her  mr arlington had not yet returned  he came in five minutes afterwards and mrs arlington told him what she thought of him  it was the shortest supper within the twins recollection  they found themselves in bed ten minutes in advance of the record  they could hear their mothers voice from the kitchen  a jug of milk had been overlooked and had gone sour  she had given jane a weeks notice before the clock struck ten  it was from mr arlington that the professor heard the news  mr arlington could not stop an instant dinner being at twelve sharp and it wanting but ten minutes to but seems to have yielded to temptation the breakfast hour at the manor farm was now six am had been so since thursday the whole family fully dressed and mrs arlington presiding  if the professor did not believe it he could come round any morning and see for himself  the professor appears to have taken mr arlingtons word for it  by sixthirty everybody at their job and mrs arlington at hers consisting chiefly of seeing to it for the rest of the day that everybody was  lights out at ten and everybody in bed most of them only too glad to be there quite right keeps us all up to the mark was mr arlingtons opinion this was on saturday  just what was wanted  not perhaps for a permanency and of course there were drawbacks  the strenuous lifeseeing to it that everybody else leads the strenuous life it does not go with unmixed amiability particularly in the beginning  newborn zeal  must expect it to outrun discretion does not do to discourage it  modifications to be suggested later taken all round mr arlingtons view was that the thing must be regarded almost as the answer to a prayer  mr arlingtons eyes on their way to higher levels appear to have been arrested by the church clock  it decided mr arlington to resume his homeward way without further loss of time  at the bend of the lane the professor looking back observed that mr arlington had broken into a trot   this seems to have been the end of the professor regarded as a sane and intelligent member of modern society  he had not been sure at the time but it was now revealed to him that when he had urged malvina to test her strength so to express it on the unfortunate mrs arlington it was with the conviction that the result would restore him to his mental equilibrium  that malvina with a wave of her wandor whatever the hocuspocus may have beenwould be able to transform the hitherto incorrigibly indolent and easygoing mrs arlington into a sort of feminine lloyd george had not really entered into his calculations  forgetting his lunch he must have wandered aimlessly about not returning home until late in the afternoon  during dinner he appears to have been rather restless and nervousjumpy according to the evidence of the little serving maid  once he sprang out of his chair as if shot when the little serving maid accidentally let fall a tablespoon and twice he upset the salt  it was at mealtime that as a rule the professor found his attitude towards malvina most sceptical  a fairy who could put away quite a respectable cut from the joint followed by two helpings of pie does take a bit of believing in  tonight the professor found no difficulty  the white ladies had never been averse to accepting mortal hospitality there must always have been a certain adaptability  malvina since that fateful night of her banishment had one supposes passed through varied experiences for present purposes she had assumed the form of a jeune fille of the twentieth century anno domini an appreciation of mrs muldoons excellent cooking together with a glass of light sound claret would naturally go with it  one takes it that he could not for a moment get mrs arlington out of his mind  more than once stealing a covert glance across the table it seemed to him that malvina was regarding him with a mocking smile some impish spirit it must have been that had prompted him  for thousands of years malvina had ledat all events so far as was knowna reformed and blameless existence had subdued and put behind her that fatal passion of hers for change  in other people  what madness to have revived it  and no queen harbundia handy now to keep her in check  the professor had a distinct sensation while peeling a pear that he was being turned into a guineapiga curious feeling of shrinking about the legs  so vivid was the impression that involuntarily the professor jumped off his chair and ran to look at himself in the mirror over the sideboard he was not fully relieved even then  it may have been the mirror it was very old one of those things with little gilt balls all round it and it looked to the professor as if his nose was growing straight out of his face malvina trusting he had not been taken suddenly ill asked if there was anything she could do for him  he seems to have earnestly begged her not to think of it  the professor had taught malvina cribbage and usually of an evening they played a hand or two  but tonight the professor was not in the mood and malvina had contented herself with a book  she was particularly fond of the old chroniclers  the  professor had an entire shelf of them many in the original french  making believe to be reading himself he heard malvina break into a cheerful laugh and went and looked over her shoulder  she was reading the history of her own encounter with the proprietor of tin mines an elderly gentleman disliking late hours whom she had turned into a nightingale  it occurred to the professor that prior to the arlington case the recalling of this incident would have brought to her shame and remorse now she seemed to think it funny  a silly trick commented the professor  he spoke quite heatedly no one has any right to go about changing people  muddling up things they dont understand  no right whatever  malvina looked up  she gave a little sigh  not for ones own pleasure or revenge she made answer  her tone was filled with meekness  it had a touch of selfreproach  that is very wrong of course  but changing them for their own goodat least not changing improving  little hypocrite muttered the professor to himself  shes got back a taste for her old tricks and lord knows now where shell stop  the professor spent the rest of the evening among his indexes in search of the latest information regarding queen harbundia   meanwhile the arlington affair had got about the village  the twins in all probability had been unable to keep their secret  jane the dismissed had looked in to give mrs muldoon her version of thursday nights scene in the arlington kitchen and mrs muldoon with a sense of things impending may unconsciously have dropped hints  the marigolds met the arlingtons on sunday after morning service and heard all about it  that is to say they met mr arlington and the other children mrs arlington with the two elder girls having already attended early communion at seven  mrs marigold was a pretty fluffy engaging little woman ten years younger than her husband  she could not have been altogether a fool or she would not have known it marigold rising politician ought of course to have married a woman able to help him but seems to have fallen in love with her a few miles out of brussels over a convent wall mr arlington was not a regular churchgoer but felt on this occasion that he owed it to his maker he was still in love with his new wife  but not blindly  later on a guiding hand might be necessary  but first let the new seed get firmly rooted marigolds engagements necessitated his returning to town on sunday afternoon and mrs marigold walked part of the way with him to the station  on her way back across the fields she picked up the arlington twins  later she seems to have called in at the cottage and spoken to mrs muldoon about jane who she had heard was in want of a place  a little before sunset she was seen by the doctor climbing the path to the warren  malvina that evening was missing for dinner  when she returned she seemed pleased with herself    vi  and how it was finished too soon  some days laterit may have been the next week the exact date appears to have got mislaidmarigold mp looked in on the professor  they talked about tariff reform and then marigold got up and made sure for himself that the door was tight closed  you know my wife he said  weve been married six years and theres never been a cloud between us except one  of course shes not brainy  that is at least  the professor jumped out of his chair  if you take my advice he said youll leave her alone  he spoke with passion and conviction  marigold looked up  its just what i wish to goodness i had done he answered  i blame myself entirely  so long as we see our own mistakes said the professor there is hope for us all  you go straight home young man and tell her youve changed your mind  tell her you dont want her with brains tell her you like her best without  you get that into her head before anything else happens  ive tried to said marigold  she says its too late  that the light has come to her and she cant help it  it was the professors turn to stare  he had not heard anything of sundays transactions  he had been hoping against hope that the arlington affair would remain a locked secret between himself and the twins and had done his best to think about everything else  shes joined the fabian society continued marigold gloomily theyve put her in the nursery  and the wspu  if it gets about before the next election ill have to look out for another constituencythats all  how did you hear about her asked the professor  i didnt hear about her answered marigold  if i had i mightnt have gone up to town  you think it right he added toto encourage such people  whos encouraging her demanded the professor  if fools didnt go about thinking they could improve every other fool but themselves this sort of thing wouldnt happen  arlington had an amiable sweettempered wife and instead of thanking god and keeping quiet about it he worries her out of her life because she is not the managing woman  well now hes got the managing woman i met him on wednesday with a bump on his forehead as big as an egg says he fell over the mat  it cant be done  you cant have a person changed just as far as you want them changed and there stop you let em alone or you change them altogether and then they dont know themselves what theyre going to turn out  a sensible man in your position would have been only too thankful for a wife who didnt poke her nose into his affairs and with whom he could get away from his confounded politics youve been hinting to her about once a month i expect what a tragedy it was that you hadnt married a woman with brains  well now shes found her brains and is using them  why shouldnt she belong to the fabian society and the wspu  shows independence of character  best thing for you to do is to join them yourself  then youll be able to work together  im sorry said marigold rising  i didnt know you agreed with her  who said i agreed with her snapped the professor  im in a very awkward position  i suppose said marigoldhe was hesitating with the door in his handit wouldnt be of any use my seeing her myself  i believe said the professor that she is fond of the neighbourhood of the cross stones towards sundown  you can choose for yourself but if i were you i should think twice about it  i was wondering said marigold whether if i put it to her as a personal favour she might not be willing to see edith again and persuade her that she was only joking  a light began to break upon the professor  what do you think has happened he asked  well explained marigold i take it that your young foreign friend has met my wife and talked politics to her and that what has happened is the result  she must be a young person of extraordinary ability but it would be only losing one convert and i could make it up to her inin other ways  he spoke with unconscious pathos it rather touched the professor  it might mean said the professorthat is assuming that it can be done at allmrs marigolds returning to her former self entirely taking no further interest in politics whatever  i should be so very grateful answered marigold  the professor had mislaid his spectacles but thinks there was a tear in marigolds eye  ill do what i can said the professor  of course you mustnt count on it  it may be easier to start a woman thinking than to stop her even for a  the professor checked himself just in time ill talk to her he said and marigold gripped his hand and departed   it was about time he did  the full extent of malvinas activities during those few midsummer weeks till the return of flight commander raffleton will never perhaps be fully revealed according to the doctor the whole business has been grossly exaggerated  there are those who talk as if half the village had been taken to pieces altered and improved and sent back home again in a mental state unrecognisable by their own mothers  certain it is that dawson ra generally described by everybody except his wife as a lovable little man and whose only fault was an incurable habit of punning both in seasonif such a period there beand more often out suddenly one morning smashed a dutch interior fifteen inches by nine over the astonished head of mrs dawson  it clung round her neck recalling biblical pictures of the head of john the baptist and the framework had to be sawn through before she could get it off  as to the story about his having been caught by mrs dawsons aunt kissing the housemaid behind the waterbutt that as the doctor admits is a bit of bad luck that might have happened to anyone  but whether there was really any evidence connecting him with dolly calthorpes unaccountable missing of the last train home is of course a more serious matter  mrs dawson a handsome highspirited woman herself may have found dawson as originally fashioned trying to the nerves though even then the question arises  why have married him  but there is a difference as mrs dawson has pointed out between a husband who hasnt enough of the natural man in him and a husband who has a deal too much  it is difficult to regulate these matters  altogether and taking an outside estimate the doctors opinion is that there may have been half a dozen who with malvinas assistance succeeded in hypnotising themselves into temporary insanity  when malvina a little disappointed but yielding quite sweetly her own judgment to that of the wise and learned christopher consented to restore them the explanation was that having spent their burst of illacquired energy they fell back at the first suggestion to their former selves  mrs arlington does not agree with the doctor  she had been trying to reform herself for quite a long time and had miserably failed there was something about themit might almost be described as an aromathat prompted her that evening to take the twins into her confidence a sort of intuition that in some way they could help her it remained with her all the next day and when the twins returned in the evening in company with the postman she knew instinctively that they had been about her business  it was this same intuitive desire that drew her to the downs  she is confident she would have taken that walk to the cross stones even if the twins had not proposed it indeed according to her own account she was not aware that the twins had accompanied her  there was something about the stones a sense as of a presence  she knew when she reached them that she had arrived at the appointed place and when there appeared to hercoming from where she could not tella diminutive figure that seemed in some mysterious way as if it were clothed merely in the fading light she remembered distinctly that she was neither surprised nor alarmed  the diminutive lady sat down beside her and took mrs arlingtons hands in both her own  she spoke in a strange language but mrs arlington at the time understood it though now the meaning of it had passed from her mrs arlington felt as if her body were being taken away from her she had a sense of falling a feeling that she must make some desperate effort to rise again  the strange little lady was helping her assisting her to make this supreme effort  it was as if ages were passing  she was wrestling with unknown powers  suddenly she seemed to slip from them the little lady was holding her up clasping each other they rose and rose and rose  mrs arlington had a firm conviction that she must always be struggling upward or they would overtake her and drag her down again  when she awoke the little lady had gone but that feeling remained with her that passionate acceptance of ceaseless struggle activity contention as now the end and aim of her existence  at first she did not recollect where she was  a strange colourless light was around her and a strange singing as of myriads of birds  and then the clock struck nine and life came back to her with a rush  but with it still that conviction that she must seize hold of herself and everybody else and get things done  its immediate expression as already has been mentioned was experienced by the twins  when after a talk with the professor aided and abetted by mr arlington and the eldest arlington girl she consented to pay that second visit to the stones it was with very different sensations that she climbed the grassgrown path  the little lady had met her as before but the curious deep eyes looked sadly and mrs arlington had the impression generally speaking that she was about to assist at her own funeral  again the little lady took her by the hands and again she experienced that terror of falling  but instead of ending with contest and effort she seemed to pass into a sleep and when she opened her eyes she was again alone  feeling a little chilly and unreasonably tired she walked slowly home and not being hungry retired supperless to bed  quite unable to explain why she seems to have cried herself to sleep  one supposes that something of a similar nature may have occurred to the otherswith the exception of mrs marigold  it was the case of mrs marigold that as the doctor grudgingly admits went far to weaken his hypothesis  mrs marigold having emerged was spreading herself much to her own satisfaction  she had discarded her wedding ring as a relic of barbarismof the days when women were mere goods and chattels and had made her first speech at a meeting in favour of marriage reform  subterfuge in her case had to be resorted to malvina had tearfully consented and marigold mp was to bring mrs marigold to the cross stones that same evening and there leave her explaining to her that malvina had expressed a wish to see her againjust for a chat   all might have ended well if only commander raffleton had not appeared framed in the parlour door just as malvina was starting his cousin christopher had written to the commander  indeed after the arlington affair quite pressingly and once or twice had thought he heard the sound of flight commander raffletons propeller but on each occasion had been disappointed  affairs of state cousin christopher had explained to malvina who familiar one takes it with the calls upon knights and warriors through all the ages had approved  he stood there with his helmet in his hand  only arrived this afternoon from france  he explained  havent a moment to spare  but he had just time to go straight to malvina  he laughed as he took her in his arms and kissed her full upon the lips  when last he had kissed herit had been in the orchard the professor had been witness to itmalvina had remained quite passive only that curious little smile about her lips  but now an odd thing happened  a quivering seemed to pass through all her body so that it swayed and trembled  the professor feared she was going to fall and maybe to save herself she put up her arms about commander raffletons neck and with a strange low cryit sounded to the professor like the cry one sometimes hears at night from some little dying creature of the woodsshe clung to him sobbing   it must have been a while later when the chiming of the clock recalled to the professor the appointment with mrs marigold  you will only just have time he said gently seeking to release her ill promise to keep him till you come back  and as malvina did not seem to understand he reminded her  but still she made no movement save for a little gesture of the hands as if she were seeking to lay hold of something unseen  and then she dropped her arms and looked from one of them to the other the professor did not think of it at the time but remembered afterwards that strange aloofness of hers as if she were looking at you from another world  one no longer felt it  i am so sorry she said  it is too late  i am only a woman  and mrs marigold is still thinking    the prologue  and here follows the prologue  it ought of course to have been written first but nobody knew of it until quite the end entirely it was told to commander raffleton by a french comrade who in days of peace had been a painter mingling with others of his kind especially such as found their inspiration in the wide horizons and legendhaunted dells of oldworld brittany  afterwards the commander told it to the professor and the professors only stipulation was that it should not be told to the doctor at least for a time  for the doctor would see in it only confirmation for his own narrow sensebound theories while to the professor it confirmed beyond a doubt the absolute truth of this story   it commenced in the year eighteen hundred and ninetyeight anno domini on a particularly unpleasant evening in late februarya stormy winters night one would describe it were one writing mere romance  it came to the lonely cottage of madame lavigne on the edge of the moor that surrounds the sunken village of avenachrist madame lavigne who was knitting stockingsfor she lived by knitting stockingsheard as she thought a passing of feet and what seemed like a tap at the door  she dismissed the idea for who would be passing at such an hour and where there was no road  but a few minutes later the tapping came again and madame lavigne taking her candle in her hand went to see who was there  the instant she released the latch a gust of wind blew out the candle and madame lavigne could see no one  she called but there was no answer  she was about to close the door again when she heard a faint sound  it was not exactly a cry  it was as if someone she could not see in the tiniest of voices had said something she could not understand  madame lavigne crossed herself and muttered a prayer and then she heard it again  it seemed to come from close at her feet and feeling with her handsfor she thought it might be a stray catshe found quite a large parcel it was warm and soft though of course a bit wet and madame lavigne brought it in and having closed the door and relit her candle laid it on the table  and then she saw it was the tiniest of babies  it must always be a difficult situation  madame lavigne did what most people would have done in the case  she unrolled the wrappings and taking the little thing on her lap sat down in front of the dull peat fire and considered  it seemed wonderfully contented and madame lavigne thought the best thing to do would be to undress it and put it to bed and then go on with her knitting she would consult father jean in the morning and take his advice she had never seen such fine clothes  she took them off one by one lovingly feeling their texture and when she finally removed the last little shift and the little white thing lay exposed madame lavigne sprang up with a cry and all but dropped it into the fire for she saw by the mark that every breton peasant knows that it was not a child but a fairy  her proper course as she well knew was to have opened the door and flung it out into the darkness  most women of the village would have done so and spent the rest of the night on their knees  but someone must have chosen with foresight  there came to madame lavigne the memory of her good man and her three tall sons taken from her one by one by the jealous sea and come what might of it she could not do it  the little thing understood that was clear for it smiled quite knowingly and stretched out its little hands touching madame lavignes brown withered skin and stirring forgotten beatings of her heart  father jeanone takes him to have been a tolerant gently wise old gentlemancould see no harm  that is if madame lavigne could afford the luxury  maybe it was a good fairy  would bring her luck  and certain it is that the cackling of madames hens was heard more often than before and the weeds seemed fewer in the little patch of garden that madame lavigne had rescued from the moor  of course the news spread  one gathers that madame lavigne rather gave herself airs  but the neighbours shook their heads  and the child grew up lonely and avoided  fortunately the cottage was far from other houses and there was always the great moor with its deep hidingplaces  father jean was her sole playmate  he would take her with him on his long tramps through his scattered district leaving her screened among the furze and bracken near to the solitary farmsteads where he made his visitations  he had learnt it was useless  all attempt of mother church to scold out of this sea and moorgirt flock their pagan superstitions  he would leave it to time  later perhaps opportunity might occur to place the child in some convent where she would learn to forget and grow into a good catholic  meanwhile one had to take pity on the little lonely creature  not entirely for her own sake maybe a dear affectionate little soul strangely wise so she seemed to father jean under the shade of trees or sharing warm shelter with the softeyed cows he would teach her from his small stock of knowledge  every now and then she would startle him with an intuition a comment strangely unchildlike  it was as if she had known all about it long ago father jean would steal a swift glance at her from under his shaggy eyebrows and fall into a silence  it was curious also how the wild things of the field and wood seemed unafraid of her  at times returning to where  he had left her hidden he would pause wondering to whom she was talking and then as he drew nearer would hear the stealing away of little feet the startled flutter of wings  she had elfish ways of which it seemed impossible to cure her  often the good man returning from some late visit of mercy with his lantern and his stout oak cudgel would  pause and listen to a wandering voice  it was never near enough for him to hear the  words and the voice was strange to him though he knew it could be no one else  madame lavigne would shrug her shoulders  how could she help it  it was not for her to cross the child even supposing bolts and bars likely to be of any use  father jean gave it up in despair  neither was it for him either to be too often forbidding and lecturing  maybe the cunning tender ways had wove their web about the childless old gentlemans heart making him also somewhat afraid  perhaps other distractions for madame lavigne would never allow her to do anything but the lightest of work  he would teach her to read  so quickly she learnt that it seemed to father jean she must be making believe not to have known it already  but he had his reward in watching the joy with which she would devour for preference the quaint printed volumes of romance and history that he would bring home to her from his rare journeyings to the distant town   it was when she was about thirteen that the ladies and gentlemen came from paris  of course they were not real ladies and gentlemen only a little company of artists seeking new fields  they had done the coast and the timbered houses of the narrow streets and one of them had suggested exploring the solitary unknown inlands they came across her seated on an old grey stone reading from an ancientlooking book and she had risen and curtsied to them  she was never afraid  it was she who excited fear  often she would look after the children flying from her feeling a little sad  but of course it could not be helped  she was a fairy  she would have done them no harm but this they could not be expected to understand  it was a delightful change meeting human beings who neither screamed nor hastily recited their paternosters but who instead returned ones smile  they asked her where she lived and she showed them  they were staying at avenachrist and one of the ladies was brave enough even to kiss her laughing and talking they all walked down the hill together  they found madame lavigne working in her garden  madame lavigne washed her hands of all responsibility  it was for suzanne to decide  it seemed they wanted to make a picture of her sitting on the grey stone where they had found her  it was surely only kind to let them so next morning she was there again waiting for them  they gave her a fivefranc piece  madame lavigne was doubtful of handling it but father jean vouched for it as being good republican money and as the days went by madame lavignes black stocking grew heavier and heavier as she hung it again each night in the chimney  it was the lady who had first kissed her that discovered who she was they had all of them felt sure from the beginning that she was a fairy and that suzanne could not be her real name  they found it in the heptameron of friar bonnet  in which is recorded the numerous adventures of the valiant and puissant king ryence of bretagne which one of them had picked up on the quai aux fleurs and brought with him it told all about the white ladies and therein she was described there could be no mistaking her the fair body that was like to a willow swayed by the wind  the white feet that could pass leaving the dew unshaken from the grass  the eyes blue and deep as mountain lakes the golden locks of which the sun was jealous  it was all quite clear  she was malvina once favourite to harbundia queen of the white ladies of brittany  for reasonsfurther allusion to which politeness forbadeshe had been a wanderer no one knowing what had become of her  and now the whim had taken her to reappear as a little breton peasant girl near to the scene of her past glories they knelt before her offering her homage and all the ladies kissed her  the gentlemen of the party thought their turn would follow  but it never did  it was not their own shyness that stood in their way one must do them that justice  it was as if some youthful queen exiled and unknown amongst strangers had been suddenly recognised by a little band of her faithful subjects passing by chance that way  so that instead of frolic and laughter as had been intended they remained standing with bared heads and no one liked to be the first to speak  she put them at their easeor tried towith a gracious gesture but enjoined upon them all her wish for secrecy  and so dismissed they seem to have returned to the village a marvellously sober little party experiencing all the sensations of honest folk admitted to their first glimpse of high society  they came again next yearat least a few of thembringing with them a dress more worthy of malvinas wearing  it was as near as paris could achieve to the true and original costume as described by the good friar bonnet the which had been woven in a single night by the wizard spider karai out of moonlight  malvina accepted it with gracious thanks and was evidently pleased to find herself again in fit and proper clothes it was hidden away for rare occasions where only malvina knew  but the lady who had first kissed her and whose speciality was fairies craving permission malvina consented to wear it while sitting for her portrait  the picture one may still see in the palais des beaux arts at nantes the bretonne room  it represents her standing straight as an arrow a lone little figure in the centre of a treeless moor  the painting of the robe is said to be very wonderful  malvina of brittany is the inscription the date being nineteen hundred and thirteen   the next year malvina was no longer there  madame lavigne folding knotted hands had muttered her last paternoster  pere jean had urged the convent  but for the first time with him she had been frankly obstinate  some fancy seemed to have got into the childs head something that she evidently connected with the vast treeless moor rising southward to where the ancient menhir of king taramis crowned its summit  the good man yielded as usual  for the present there were madame lavignes small savings  suzannes wants were but few the rare shopping necessary father jean could see to himself  with the coming of winter he would broach the subject again and then be quite firm  just these were the summer nights when suzanne loved to roam and as for danger there was not a lad for ten leagues round who would not have run a mile to avoid passing even in daylight that cottage standing where the moor dips down to the sealands  but one surmises that even a fairy may feel lonesome  especially a banished fairy hanging as it were between earth and air knowing mortal maidens kissed and courted while ones own companions kept away from one in hiding  maybe the fancy came to her that after all these years they might forgive her  still it was their meeting place so legend ran especially of midsummer nights  rare it was now for human eye to catch a glimpse of the shimmering robes but high on the treeless moor to the music of the lady of the fountain one might still hear were one brave enough to venture the rhythm of their dancing feet  if she sought them softly calling might they not reveal themselves to her make room for her once again in the whirling circle one has the idea that the moonlight frock may have added to her hopes philosophy admits that feeling oneself well dressed gives confidence  if all of them had not disappearedbeen kissed three times upon the lips by mortal man and so become a woman  it seems to have been a possibility for which your white lady had to be prepared  that is if she chose to suffer it  if not it was unfortunate for the too daring mortal  but if he gained favour in her eyes  that he was brave his wooing proved  if added thereto he were comely with kind strong ways and eyes that drew you  history proves that such dreams must have come even to white ladies  maybe more especially on midsummer nights when the moon is at its full  it was on such a night that sir gerylon had woke malvinas sister sighile with a kiss  a true white lady must always dare to face her fate   it seems to have befallen malvina  some told father jean how he had arrived in a chariot drawn by winged horses the thunder of his passing waking many in the sleeping villages beneath  and others how he had come in the form of a great bird  father jean had heard strange sounds himself and certain it was that suzanne had disappeared  father jean heard another version a few weeks later told him by an english officer of engineers who had ridden from the nearest station on a bicycle and who arrived hot and ravenously thirsty  and father jean under promise of seeing suzanne on the first opportunity believed it but to most of his flock it sounded an impossible rigmarole told for the purpose of disguising the truth   so ends my storyor rather the story i have pieced together from information of a contradictory nature received  whatever you make of it whether with the doctor you explain it away or whether with professor littlecherry lld frs you believe the world not altogether explored and mapped the fact remains that malvina of brittany has passed away  to the younger mrs raffleton listening on the sussex downs to dull distant sounds that make her heart beat and very nervous of telegraph boys has come already some of the disadvantages attendant on her new rank of womanhood  and yet one gathers looking down into those strange deep eyes that she would not change anything about her even if now she could     the street of the blank wall  i had turned off from the edgware road into a street leading west the atmosphere of which had appealed to me  it was a place of quiet houses standing behind little gardens  they had the usual names printed on the stuccoed gateposts  the fading twilight was just sufficient to enable one to read them  there was a laburnum villa and the cedars and a cairngorm rising to the height of three storeys with a curious little turret that branched out at the top and was crowned with a conical roof so that it looked as if wearing a witchs hat especially when two small windows just below the eaves sprang suddenly into light and gave one the feeling of a pair of wicked eyes suddenly flashed upon one  the street curved to the right ending in an open space through which passed a canal beneath a low arched bridge  there were still the same quiet houses behind their small gardens and i watched for a while the lamplighter picking out the shape of the canal that widened just above the bridge into a lake with an island in the middle  after that i must have wandered in a circle for later on i found myself back in the same spot though i do not suppose i had passed a dozen people on my way and then i set to work to find my way back to paddington  i thought i had taken the road by which i had come but the half light must have deceived me  not that it mattered  they had a lurking mystery about them these silent streets with their suggestion of hushed movement behind drawn curtains of whispered voices behind the flimsy walls  occasionally there would escape the sound of laughter suddenly stifled as it seemed and once the sudden cry of a child  it was in a short street of semidetached villas facing a high blank wall that as i passed i saw a blind move halfway up revealing a womans face  a gas lamp the only one the street possessed was nearly opposite  i thought at first it was the face of a girl and then as i looked again it might have been the face of an old woman one could not distinguish the colouring  in any case the cold blue gaslight would have made it seem pallid  the remarkable feature was the eyes  it might have been of course that they alone caught the light and held it rendering them uncannily large and brilliant  or it might have been that the rest of the face was small and delicate out of all proportion to them she may have seen me for the blind was drawn down again and i passed on  there was no particular reason why but the incident lingered with me the sudden raising of the blind as of the curtain of some small theatre the barely furnished room coming dimly into view and the woman standing there close to the footlights as to my fancy it seemed  and then the sudden ringing down of the curtain before the play had begun  i turned at the corner of the street  the blind had been drawn up again and i saw again the slight girlish figure silhouetted against the side panes of the bow window  at the same moment a man knocked up against me  it was not his fault i had stopped abruptly not giving him time to avoid me  we both apologised blaming the darkness  it may have been my fancy but i had the feeling that instead of going on his way he had turned and was following me  i waited till the next corner and then swung round on my heel  but there was no sign of him and after a while i found myself back in the edgware road  once or twice in idle mood i sought the street again but without success and the thing would i expect have faded from my memory but that one evening on my way home from paddington i came across the woman in the harrow road  there was no mistaking her  she almost touched me as she came out of a fishmongers shop and unconsciously at the beginning i found myself following her  this time i noticed the turnings and five minutes walking brought us to the street  half a dozen times i must have been within a hundred yards of it  i lingered at the corner  she had not noticed me and just as she reached the house a man came out of the shadows beyond the lamppost and joined her  i was due at a bachelor gathering that evening and after dinner the affair being fresh in my mind i talked about it  i am not sure but i think it was in connection with a discussion on maeterlinck  it was that sudden lifting of the blind that had caught hold of me  as if blundering into an empty theatre i had caught a glimpse of some drama being played in secret  we passed to other topics and when i was leaving a fellow guest asked me which way i was going  i told him and it being a fine night he proposed that we should walk together and in the quiet of harley street he confessed that his desire had not been entirely the pleasure of my company  it is rather curious he said but today there suddenly came to my remembrance a case that for nearly eleven years i have never given a thought to  and now on top of it comes your description of that womans face  i am wondering if it can be the same  it was the eyes i said that struck me as so remarkable  it was the eyes that i chiefly remember her by he replied would you know the street again  we walked a little while in silence  it may seem perhaps odd to you i answered but it would trouble me the idea of any harm coming to her through me  what was the case  you can feel quite safe on that point he assured me  i was her counselthat is if it is the same woman  how was she dressed  i could not see the reason for his question  he could hardly expect her to be wearing the clothes of eleven years ago  i dont think i noticed i answered  some sort of a blouse i suppose  and then i recollected  ah yes there was something uncommon i added  an unusually broad band of velvet it looked like round her neck  i thought so he said  yes  it must be the same  we had reached marylebone road where our ways parted  i will look you up tomorrow afternoon if i may he said  we might take a stroll round together  he called on me about halfpast five and we reached the street just as the one solitary gaslamp had been lighted  i pointed out the house to him and he crossed over and looked at the number  quite right he said on returning  i made inquiries this morning she was released six weeks ago on ticketofleave  he took my arm  not much use hanging about he said  the blind wont go up tonight  rather a clever idea selecting a house just opposite a lamppost  he had an engagement that evening but later on he told me the storythat is so far as he then knew it                                            it was in the early days of the garden suburb movement  one of the first sites chosen was off the finchley road  the place was in the building and one of the streetslaleham gardenshad only some half a dozen houses in it all unoccupied save one  it was a lonely loose end of the suburb terminating suddenly in open fields  from the unfinished end of the road the ground sloped down somewhat steeply to a pond and beyond that began a small wood  the one house occupied had been bought by a young married couple named hepworth  the husband was a goodlooking pleasant young fellow  being cleanshaven his exact age was difficult to judge  the wife it was quite evident was little more than a girl  about the man there was a suggestion of weakness  at least that was the impression left on the mind of the houseagent  today he would decide and tomorrow he changed his mind  jetson the agent had almost given up hope of bringing off a deal  in the end it was mrs hepworth who taking the matter into her own hands fixed upon the house in laleham gardens young hepworth found fault with it on the ground of its isolation  he himself was often away for days at a time travelling on business and was afraid she would be nervous  he had been very persistent on this point but in whispered conversations she had persuaded him out of his objection  it was one of those pretty fussy little houses and it seemed to have taken her fancy added to which according to her argument it was just within their means which none of the others were  young hepworth may have given the usual references but if so they were never taken up  the house was sold on the companys usual terms  the deposit was paid by a cheque which was duly cleared and the house itself was security for the rest  the companys solicitor with hepworths consent acted for both parties  it was early in june when the hepworths moved in  they furnished only one bedroom and kept no servant a charwoman coming in every morning and going away about six in the evening  jetson was their nearest neighbour  his wife and daughters called on them and confess to have taken a liking to them both  indeed between one of the jetson girls the youngest and mrs hepworth there seems to have sprung up a close friendship  young hepworth the husband was always charming and evidently took great pains to make himself agreeable  but with regard to him they had the feeling that he was never altogether at his ease they described himthough that of course was after the eventas having left upon them the impression of a haunted man  there was one occasion in particular  it was about ten oclock the jetsons had been spending the evening with the hepworths and were just on the point of leaving when there came a sudden clear knock at the door  it turned out to be jetsons foreman who had to leave by an early train in the morning and had found that he needed some further instructions  but the terror in hepworths face was unmistakable  he had turned a look towards his wife that was almost of despair and it had seemed to the jetsonsor talking it over afterwards they may have suggested the idea to each otherthat there came a flash of contempt into her eyes though it yielded the next instant to an expression of pity  she had risen and already moved some steps towards the door when young hepworth had stopped her and gone out himself  but the curious thing was that according to the foremans account hepworth never opened the front door but came upon him stealthily from behind  he must have slipped out by the back and crept round the house  the incident had puzzled the jetsons especially that involuntary flash of contempt that had come into mrs hepworths eyes  she had always appeared to adore her husband and of the two if possible to be the one most in love with the other  they had no friends or acquaintances except the jetsons  no one else among their neighbours had taken the trouble to call on them and no stranger to the suburb had so far as was known ever been seen in laleham gardens  until one evening a little before christmas  jetson was on his way home from his office in the finchley road there had been a mist hanging about all day and with nightfall it had settled down into a whitish fog  soon after leaving the finchley road jetson noticed in front of him a man wearing a long yellow mackintosh and some sort of soft felt hat  he gave jetson the idea of being a sailor it may have been merely the stiff serviceable mackintosh  at the corner of laleham gardens the man turned and glanced up at the name upon the lamppost so that jetson had a full view of him evidently it was the street for which he was looking  jetson somewhat curious the hepworths house being still the only one occupied paused at the corner and watched  the hepworths house was of course the only one in the road that showed any light  the man when he came to the gate struck a match for the purpose of reading the number satisfied it was the house he wanted he pushed open the gate and went up the path  but instead of using the bell or knocker jetson was surprised to hear him give three raps on the door with his stick  there was no answer and jetson whose interest was now thoroughly aroused crossed to the other corner from where he could command a better view  twice the man repeated his three raps on the door each time a little louder and the third time the door was opened  jetson could not tell by whom for whoever it was kept behind it  he could just see one wall of the passage with a pair of old naval cutlasses crossed above the picture of a threemasted schooner that he knew hung there  the door was opened just sufficient and the man slipped in and the door was closed behind him  jetson had turned to continue his way when the fancy seized him to give one glance back the house was in complete darkness though a moment before jetson was positive there had been a light in the ground floor window  it all sounded very important afterwards but at the time there was nothing to suggest to jetson anything very much out of the common because for six months no friend or relation had called to see them that was no reason why one never should  in the fog a stranger may have thought it simpler to knock at the door with his stick than to fumble in search of a bell  the hepworths lived chiefly in the room at the back  the light in the drawingroom may have been switched off for economys sake  jetson recounted the incident on reaching home not as anything remarkable but just as one mentions an item of gossip  the only one who appears to have attached any meaning to the affair was jetsons youngest daughter then a girl of eighteen she asked one or two questions about the man and during the evening slipped out by herself and ran round to the hepworths  she found the house empty  at all events she could obtain no answer and the place back and front seemed to her to be uncannily silent  jetson called the next morning something of his daughters uneasiness having communicated itself to him  mrs hepworth herself opened the door to him  in his evidence at the trial jetson admitted that her appearance had startled him  she seems to have anticipated his questions by at once explaining that she had had news of an unpleasant nature and had been worrying over it all night  her husband had been called away suddenly to america where it would be necessary for her to join him as soon as possible  she would come round to jetsons office later in the day to make arrangements about getting rid of the house and furniture  the story seemed to reasonably account for the strangers visit and jetson expressing his sympathy and promising all help in his power continued his way to the office  she called in the afternoon and handed him over the keys retaining one for herself  she wished the furniture to be sold by auction and he was to accept almost any offer for the house  she would try and see him again before sailing if not she would write him with her address  she was perfectly cool and collected  she had called on his wife and daughters in the afternoon and had wished them goodbye  outside jetsons office she hailed a cab and returned in it to laleham gardens to collect her boxes  the next time jetson saw her she was in the dock charged with being an accomplice in the murder of her husband                                            the body had been discovered in a pond some hundred yards from the unfinished end of laleham gardens  a house was in course of erection on a neighbouring plot and a workman in dipping up a pail of water had dropped in his watch  he and his mate worrying round with a rake had drawn up pieces of torn clothing and this of course had led to the pond being properly dragged  otherwise the discovery might never have been made  the body heavily weighted with a number of flatirons fastened to it by a chain and padlock had sunk deep into the soft mud and might have remained there till it rotted  a valuable gold repeater that jetson remembered young hepworth having told him had been a presentation to his father was in its usual pocket and a cameo ring that hepworth had always worn on his third finger was likewise fished up from the mud evidently the murder belonged to the category of crimes passionel  the theory of the prosecution was that it had been committed by a man who before her marriage had been mrs hepworths lover  the evidence contrasted with the almost spiritually beautiful face of the woman in the dock came as a surprise to everyone in court originally connected with an english circus troupe touring in holland she appears about seventeen to have been engaged as a song and dance artiste at a particularly shady cafe chantant in rotterdam frequented chiefly by sailors  from there a man an english sailor known as charlie martin took her away and for some months she had lived with him at a small estaminet the other side of the river  later they left rotterdam and came to london where they took lodgings in poplar near to the docks  it was from this address in poplar that some ten months before the murder she had married young hepworth  what had become of martin was not known  the natural assumption was that his money being exhausted he had returned to his calling though his name for some reason could not be found in any ships list  that he was one and the same with the man that jetson had watched till the door of the hepworths house had closed upon him there could be no doubt  jetson described him as a thickset handsomelooking man with a reddish beard and moustache  earlier in the day he had been seen at hampstead where he had dined at a small coffeeshop in the high street  the girl who had waited on him had also been struck by the bold piercing eyes and the curly red beard  it had been an offtime between two and three when he had dined there and the girl admitted that she had found him a pleasantspoken gentleman and inclined to be merry  he had told her that he had arrived in england only three days ago and that he hoped that evening to see his sweetheart  he had accompanied the words with a laugh and the girl thoughtthough of course this may have been aftersuggestionthat an ugly look followed the laugh  one imagines that it was this mans return that had been the fear constantly haunting young hepworth  the three raps on the door it was urged by the prosecution was a prearranged or preunderstood signal and the door had been opened by the woman  whether the husband was in the house or whether they waited for him could not be said  he had been killed by a bullet entering through the back of the neck the man had evidently come prepared  ten days had elapsed between the murder and the finding of the body and the man was never traced  a postman had met him coming from the neighbourhood of laleham gardens at about halfpast nine  in the fog they had all but bumped into one another and the man had immediately turned away his face  about the soft felt hat there was nothing to excite attention but the long stiff yellow mackintosh was quite unusual  the postman had caught only a momentary glimpse of the face but was certain it was clean shaven  this made a sensation in court for the moment but only until the calling of the next witness  the charwoman usually employed by the hepworths had not been admitted to the house on the morning of mrs hepworths departure  mrs hepworth had met her at the door and paid her a weeks money in lieu of notice explaining to her that she would not be wanted any more  jetson thinking he might possibly do better by letting the house furnished had sent for this woman and instructed her to give the place a thorough cleaning  sweeping the carpet in the diningroom with a dustpan and brush she had discovered a number of short red hairs the man before leaving the house had shaved himself  that he had still retained the long yellow mackintosh may have been with the idea of starting a false clue  having served its purpose it could be discarded  the beard would not have been so easy  what roundabout way he may have taken one cannot say but it must have been some time during the night or early morning that he reached young hepworths office in fenchurch street  mrs hepworth had evidently provided him with the key  there he seems to have hidden the hat and mackintosh and to have taken in exchange some clothes belonging to the murdered man hepworths clerk ellenby an elderly manof the type that one generally describes as of gentlemanly appearancewas accustomed to his master being away unexpectedly on business which was that of a ships furnisher  he always kept an overcoat and a bag ready packed in the office  missing them ellenby had assumed that his master had been called away by an early train  he would have been worried after a few days but that he had received a telegramas he then supposed from his masterexplaining that young hepworth had gone to ireland and would be away for some days  it was nothing unusual for hepworth to be absent superintending the furnishing of a ship for a fortnight at a time and nothing had transpired in the office necessitating special instructions  the telegram had been handed in at charing cross but the time chosen had been a busy period of the day and no one had any recollection of the sender  hepworths clerk unhesitatingly identified the body as that of his employer for whom it was evident that he had entertained a feeling of affection  about mrs hepworth he said as little as he could while she was awaiting her trial it had been necessary for him to see her once or twice with reference to the business  previous to this he knew nothing about her  the womans own attitude throughout the trial had been quite unexplainable  beyond agreeing to a formal plea of not guilty she had made no attempt to defend herself  what little assistance her solicitors had obtained had been given them not by the woman herself but by hepworths clerk more for the sake of his dead master than out of any sympathy towards the wife  she herself appeared utterly indifferent  only once had she been betrayed into a momentary emotion it was when her solicitors were urging her almost angrily to give them some particulars upon a point they thought might be helpful to her case  hes dead she had cried out almost with a note of exultation dead dead  what else matters  the next moment she had apologised for her outburst  nothing can do any good she had said  let the thing take its course  it was the astounding callousness of the woman that told against her both with the judge and the jury  that shaving in the diningroom the murdered mans body not yet cold  it must have been done with hepworths safetyrazor  she must have brought it down to him found him a lookingglass brought him soap and water and a towel afterwards removing all traces  except those few red hairs that had clung unnoticed to the carpet  that nest of flatirons used to weight the body  it must have been she who had thought of them the idea would never have occurred to a man  the chain and padlock with which to fasten them  she only could have known that such things were in the house  it must have been she who had planned the exchange of clothes in hepworths office giving him the key  she it must have been who had thought of the pond holding open the door while the man had staggered out under his ghastly burden waited keeping watch listening to hear the splash  evidently it had been her intention to go off with the murdererto live with him  that story about america  if all had gone well it would have accounted for everything  after leaving laleham gardens she had taken lodgings in a small house in kentish town under the name of howard giving herself out to be a chorus singer her husband being an actor on tour  to make the thing plausible she had obtained employment in one of the pantomimes  not for a moment had she lost her head  no one had ever called at her lodgings and there had come no letters for her  every hour of her day could be accounted for  their plans must have been worked out over the corpse of her murdered husband  she was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact and sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude  that brought the story up to eleven years ago  after the trial interested in spite of himself my friend had ferreted out some further particulars  inquiries at liverpool had procured him the information that hepworths father a shipowner in a small way had been well known and highly respected  he was retired from business when he died some three years previous to the date of the murder his wife had survived him by only a few months  besides michael the murdered son there were two other childrenan elder brother who was thought to have gone abroad to one of the colonies and a sister who had married a french naval officer  either they had not heard of the case or had not wished to have their names dragged into it  young michael had started life as an architect and was supposed to have been doing well but after the death of his parents had disappeared from the neighbourhood and until the trial none of his acquaintances up north ever knew what had become of him  but a further item of knowledge that my friends inquiries had elicited had somewhat puzzled him  hepworths clerk ellenby had been the confidential clerk of hepworths father  he had entered the service of the firm as a boy and when hepworth senior retired ellenbywith the old gentlemans assistancehad started in business for himself as a ships furnisher  nothing of all this came out at the trial  ellenby had not been crossexamined  there was no need for it  but it seemed odd under all the circumstances that he had not volunteered the information  it may of course have been for the sake of the brother and sister  hepworth is a common enough name in the north  he may have hoped to keep the family out of connection with the case  as regards the woman my friend could learn nothing further beyond the fact that in her contract with the musichall agent in rotterdam she had described herself as the daughter of an english musician and had stated that both her parents were dead  she may have engaged herself without knowing the character of the hall and the man charlie martin with his handsome face and pleasing sailor ways and at least an englishman may have seemed to her a welcome escape  she may have been passionately fond of him and young hepworthcrazy about her for she was beautiful enough to turn any mans headmay in martins absence have lied to her told her he was deadlord knows whatto induce her to marry him  the murder may have seemed to her a sort of grim justice  but even so her coldblooded callousness was surely abnormal  she had married him lived with him for nearly a year  to the jetsons she had given the impression of being a woman deeply in love with her husband it could not have been mere acting kept up day after day  there was something else  we were discussing the case in my friends chambers  his brief of eleven years ago was open before him  he was pacing up and down with his hands in his pockets thinking as he talked  something that never came out  there was a curious feeling she gave me in that moment when sentence was pronounced upon her  it was as if instead of being condemned she had triumphed  acting  if she had acted during the trial pretended remorse even pity i could have got her off with five years  she seemed to be unable to disguise the absolute physical relief she felt at the thought that he was dead that his hand would never again touch her  there must have been something that had suddenly been revealed to her something that had turned her love to hate  there must be something fine about the man too  that was another suggestion that came to him as he stood staring out of the window across the river  shes paid and has got her receipt but he is still wanted  he is risking his neck every evening he watches for the raising of that blind  his thought took another turn  yet how could he have let her go through those ten years of living death while he walked the streets scot free  some time during the trialthe evidence piling up against her day by daywhy didnt he come forward if only to stand beside her  get himself hanged if only out of mere decency  he sat down took the brief up in his hand without looking at it  or was that the reward that she claimed  that he should wait keeping alive the one hope that would make the suffering possible to her yes he continued musing i can see a man who cared for a woman taking that as his punishment  now that his interest in the case had been revived he seemed unable to keep it out of his mind  since our joint visit i had once or twice passed through the street by myself and on the last occasion had again seen the raising of the blind  it obsessed himthe desire to meet the man face to face  a handsome bold masterful man he conceived him but there must be something more for such a woman to have sold her soulalmost one might sayfor the sake of him  there was just one chance of succeeding  each time he had come from the direction of the edgware road  by keeping well out of sight at the other end of the street and watching till he entered it one might time oneself to come upon him just under the lamp  he would hardly be likely to turn and go back that would be to give himself away  he would probably content himself with pretending to be like ourselves merely hurrying through and in his turn watching till we had disappeared  fortune seemed inclined to favour us  about the usual time the blind was gently raised and very soon afterwards there came round the corner the figure of a man  we entered the street ourselves a few seconds later and it seemed likely that as we had planned we should come face to face with him under the gaslight  he walked towards us stooping and with bent head  we expected him to pass the house by  to our surprise he stopped when he came to it and pushed open the gate in another moment we should have lost all chance of seeing anything more of him except his bent back  with a couple of strides my friend was behind him  he laid his hand on the mans shoulder and forced him to turn round  it was an old wrinkled face with gentle rather watery eyes  we were both so taken aback that for a moment we could say nothing my friend stammered out an apology about having mistaken the house and rejoined me  at the corner we burst out laughing almost simultaneously  and then my friend suddenly stopped and stared at me  hepworths old clerk he said  ellenby                                            it seemed to him monstrous  the man had been more than a clerk the family had treated him as a friend  hepworths father had set him up in business  for the murdered lad he had had a sincere attachment he had left that conviction on all of them  what was the meaning of it  a directory was on the mantelpiece  it was the next afternoon  i had called upon him in his chambers  it was just an idea that came to me i crossed over and opened it and there was his name ellenby and co ships furnishers in a court off the minories  was he helping her for the sake of his dead mastertrying to get her away from the man  but why  the woman had stood by and watched the lad murdered  how could he bear even to look on her again  unless there had been that something that had not come outsomething he had learnt laterthat excused even that monstrous callousness of hers  yet what could there be  it had all been so planned so coldblooded that shaving in the diningroom  it was that seemed most to stick in his throat  she must have brought him down a lookingglass there was not one in the room  why couldnt he have gone upstairs into the bathroom where hepworth always shaved himself where he would have found everything to his hand  he had been moving about the room talking disjointedly as he paced and suddenly he stopped and looked at me  why in the diningroom he demanded of me  he was jingling some keys in his pocket  it was a habit of his when crossexamining and i felt as if somehow i knew and without thinkingso it seemed to mei answered him  perhaps i said it was easier to bring a razor down than to carry a dead man up  he leant with his arms across the table his eyes glittering with excitement  cant you see it he said  that little back parlour with its fussy ornaments  the three of them standing round the table hepworths hands nervously clutching a chair  the reproaches the taunts the threats  young hepworthhe struck everyone as a weak man a man physically afraidwhite stammering not knowing which way to look the womans eyes turning from one to the other  that flash of contempt againshe could not help itfollowed worse still by pity  if only he could have answered back held his own if only he had not been afraid  and then that fatal turning away with a sneering laugh one imagines the bold dominating eyes no longer there to cower him  that must have been the moment  the bullet if you remember entered through the back of the mans neck  hepworth must always have been picturing to himself this meetingtenants of garden suburbs do not carry loaded revolvers as a habitdwelling upon it till he had worked himself up into a frenzy of hate and fear  weak men always fly to extremes  if there was no other way he would kill him  cant you hear the silence  after the reverberations had died away and then they are both down on their knees patting him feeling for his heart  the man must have gone down like a felled ox there were no traces of blood on the carpet  the house is far from any neighbour the shot in all probability has not been heard if only they can get rid of the body  the pondnot a hundred yards away  he reached for the brief still lying among his papers hurriedly turned the scored pages  what easier  a house being built on the very next plot wheelbarrows to be had for the taking  a line of planks reaching down to the edge depth of water where the body was discovered four feet six inches nothing to do but just tip up the barrow  think a minute  must weigh him down lest he rise to accuse us weight him heavily so that he will sink lower and lower into the soft mud lie there till he rots  think again  think it out to the end  suppose in spite of all our precautions he does rise  suppose the chain slips  the workmen going to and fro for watersuppose they do discover him  he is lying on his back remember  they would have turned him over to feel for his heart  have closed his eyes most probably not liking their stare  it would be the woman who first thought of it  she has seen them both lying with closed eyes beside her  it may have always been in her mind the likeness between them  with hepworths watch in his pocket hepworths ring on his finger  if only it was not for the beardthat fierce curling red beard  they creep to the window and peer out  fog still thick as soup not a soul not a sound  plenty of time  then to get away to hide till one is sure  put on the mackintosh a man in a yellow mackintosh may have been seen to enter let him be seen to go away  in some dark corner or some empty railway carriage take it off and roll it up  then make for the office  wait there for ellenby true as steel ellenby good business man  be guided by ellenby  he flung the brief from him with a laugh  why theres not a missing link he cried  and to think that not a fool among us ever thought of it  everything fitting into its place i suggested except young hepworth  can you see him from your description of him sitting down and coolly elaborating plans for escape the corpse of the murdered man stretched beside him on the hearthrug  no he answered  but i can see her doing it a woman who for week after week kept silence while we raged and stormed at her a woman who for three hours sat like a statue while old cutbush painted her to a crowded court as a modern jezebel who rose up from her seat when that sentence of fifteen years penal servitude was pronounced upon her with a look of triumph in her eyes and walked out of court as if she had been a girl going to meet her lover  ill wager he added it was she who did the shaving  hepworth would have cut him even with a safetyrazor  it must have been the other one martin i said that she loathed that almost exultation at the thought that he was dead i reminded him  yes he mused  she made no attempt to disguise it  curious there having been that likeness between them  he looked at his watch  do you care to come with me he said  where are you going i asked him  we may just catch him he answered  ellenby and co                                            the office was on the top floor of an oldfashioned house in a culdesac off the minories  mr ellenby was out so the lanky officeboy informed us but would be sure to return before evening and we sat and waited by the meagre fire till as the dusk was falling we heard his footsteps on the creaking stairs  he halted a moment in the doorway recognising us apparently without surprise and then with a hope that we had not been kept waiting long he led the way into an inner room  i do not suppose you remember me said my friend as soon as the door was closed  i fancy that until last night you never saw me without my wig and gown  it makes a difference  i was mrs hepworths senior counsel  it was unmistakable the look of relief that came into the old dim eyes  evidently the incident of the previous evening had suggested to him an enemy  you were very good he murmured  mrs hepworth was overwrought at the time but she was very grateful i know for all your efforts  i thought i detected a faint smile on my friends lips  i must apologise for my rudeness to you of last night he continued i expected when i took the liberty of turning you round that i was going to find myself face to face with a much younger man  i took you to be a detective answered ellenby in his soft gentle voice  you will forgive me im sure  i am rather shortsighted  of course i can only conjecture but if you will take my word i can assure you that mrs hepworth has never seen or heard from the man charlie martin since the date ofhe hesitated a momentof the murder  it would have been difficult agreed my friend seeing that charlie martin lies buried in highgate cemetery  old as he was he sprang from his chair white and trembling  what have you come here for he demanded  i took more than a professional interest in the case answered my friend  ten years ago i was younger than i am now  it may have been her youthher extreme beauty  i think mrs hepworth in allowing her husband to visit herhere where her address is known to the police and watch at any moment may be set upon heris placing him in a position of grave danger  if you care to lay before me any facts that will allow me to judge of the case i am prepared to put my experience and if need be my assistance at her service  his selfpossession had returned to him  if you will excuse me he said i will tell the boy that he can go  we heard him a moment later turn the key in the outer door and when he came back and had made up the fire he told us the beginning of the story  the name of the man buried in highgate cemetery was hepworth after all  not michael but alex the elder brother  from boyhood he had been violent brutal unscrupulous  judging from ellenbys story it was difficult to accept him as a product of modern civilisation  rather he would seem to have been a throwback to some savage buccaneering ancestor  to expect him to work while he could live in vicious idleness at somebody elses expense was found to be hopeless  his debts were paid for about the third or fourth time and he was shipped off to the colonies  unfortunately there were no means of keeping him there  so soon as the money provided him had been squandered he returned demanding more by menaces and threats meeting with unexpected firmness he seems to have regarded theft and forgery as the only alternative left to him to save him from punishment and the family name from disgrace his parents savings were sacrificed  it was grief and shame that according to ellenby killed them both within a few months of one another  deprived by this blow of what he no doubt had come to consider his natural means of support and his sister fortunately for herself being well out of his reach he next fixed upon his brother michael as his stayby  michael weak timid and not perhaps without some remains of boyish affection for a strong handsome elder brother foolishly yielded  the demands of course increased until in the end it came almost as a relief when the mans vicious life led to his getting mixed up with a crime of a particularly odious nature he was anxious now for his own sake to get away and michael with little enough to spare for himself provided him with the means on the solemn understanding that he would never return  but the worry and misery of it all had left young michael a broken man unable to concentrate his mind any longer upon his profession his craving was to get away from all his old associationsto make a fresh start in life  it was ellenby who suggested london and the ship furnishing business where michaels small remaining capital would be of service  the name of hepworth would be valuable in shipping circles and ellenby arguing this consideration but chiefly with the hope of giving young michael more interest in the business had insisted that the firm should be hepworth and co  they had not been started a year before the man returned as usual demanding more money  michael acting under ellenbys guidance refused in terms that convinced his brother that the game of bullying was up  he waited a while and then wrote pathetically that he was ill and starving  if only for the sake of his young wife would not michael come and see them  this was the first they had heard of his marriage  there was just a faint hope that it might have effected a change and michael against ellenbys advice decided to go  in a miserable lodginghouse in the east end he found the young wife but not his brother who did not return till he was on the point of leaving  in the interval the girl seems to have confided her story to michael  she had been a singer engaged at a musichall in rotterdam  there alex hepworth calling himself charlie martin had met her and made love to her  when he chose he could be agreeable enough and no doubt her youth and beauty had given to his protestations for the time being a genuine ring of admiration and desire  it was to escape from her surroundings more than anything else that she had consented  she was little more than a child and anything seemed preferable to the nightly horror to which her life exposed her  he had never married her  at least that was her belief at the time during his first drunken bout he had flung it in her face that the form they had gone through was mere bunkum  unfortunately for her this was a lie  he had always been coolly calculating  it was probably with the idea of a safe investment that he had seen to it that the ceremony had been strictly legal  her life with him so soon as the first novelty of her had worn off had been unspeakable  the band that she wore round her neck was to hide where in a fit of savagery because she had refused to earn money for him on the streets he had tried to cut her throat  now that she had got back to england she intended to leave him  if he followed and killed her she did not care  it was for her sake that young hepworth eventually offered to help his brother again on the condition that he would go away by himself  to this the other agreed  he seems to have given a short display of remorse  there must have been a grin on his face as he turned away his cunning eyes had foreseen what was likely to happen  the idea of blackmail was no doubt in his mind from the beginning  with the charge of bigamy as a weapon in his hand he might rely for the rest of his life upon a steady and increasing income  michael saw his brother off as a secondclass passenger on a ship bound for the cape  of course there was little chance of his keeping his word but there was always the chance of his getting himself knocked on the head in some brawl  anyhow he would be out of the way for a season and the girl lola would be left  a month later he married her and four months after that received a letter from his brother containing messages to mrs martin from her loving husband charlie who hoped before long to have the pleasure of seeing her again  inquiries through the english consul in rotterdam proved that the threat was no mere bluff  the marriage had been legal and binding  what happened on the night of the murder was very much as my friend had reconstructed it  ellenby reaching the office at his usual time the next morning had found hepworth waiting for him  there he had remained in hiding until one morning with dyed hair and a slight moustache he had ventured forth  had the mans death been brought about by any other means ellenby would have counselled his coming forward and facing his trial as he himself was anxious to do but viewed in conjunction with the relief the mans death must have been to both of them that loaded revolver was too suggestive of premeditation  the isolation of the house that conveniently near pond would look as if thought of beforehand  even if pleading extreme provocation michael escaped the rope a long term of penal servitude would be inevitable  nor was it certain that even then the woman would go free  the murdered man would still by a strange freak be her husband the murdererin the eye of the lawher lover  her passionate will had prevailed  young hepworth had sailed for america  there he had no difficulty in obtaining employmentof course under another namein an architects office and later had set up for himself  since the night of the murder they had not seen each other till some three weeks ago                                            i never saw the woman again  my friend i believe called on her hepworth had already returned to america and my friend had succeeded in obtaining for her some sort of a police permit that practically left her free  sometimes of an evening i find myself passing through the street and always i have the feeling of having blundered into an empty theatrewhere the play is ended     his evening out  the evidence of the parkkeeper david bristow of gilder street camden town is as follows  i was on duty in st jamess park on thursday evening my sphere extending from the mall to the northern shore of the ornamental water east of the suspension bridge  at fiveandtwenty to seven i took up a position between the peninsula and the bridge to await my colleague he ought to have relieved me at halfpast six but did not arrive until a few minutes before seven owing so he explained to the breaking down of his motorbuswhich may have been true or may not as the saying is  i had just come to a halt when my attention was arrested by a lady i am unable to explain why the presence of a lady in st jamess park should have seemed in any way worthy of notice except that for certain reasons she reminded me of my first wife  i observed that she hesitated between one of the public seats and two vacant chairs standing by themselves a little farther to the east  eventually she selected one of the chairs and having cleaned it with an evening paperthe birds in this portion of the park being extremely prolificsat down upon it  there was plenty of room upon the public seat close to it except for some children who were playing touch and in consequence of this i judged her to be a person of means  i walked to a point from where i could command the southern approaches to the bridge my colleague arriving sometimes by way of birdcage walk and sometimes by way of the horse guards parade  not seeing any signs of him in the direction of the bridge i turned back  a little way past the chair where the lady was sitting i met mr parable  i know mr parable quite well by sight  he was wearing the usual grey suit and soft felt hat with which the pictures in the newspapers have made us all familiar  i judged that mr parable had come from the houses of parliament and the next morning my suspicions were confirmed by reading that he had been present at a teaparty given on the terrace by mr will crooks  mr parable conveyed to me the suggestion of a man absorbed in thought and not quite aware of what he was doing but in this of course i may have been mistaken  he paused for a moment to look over the railings at the pelican  mr parable said something to the pelican which i was not near enough to overhear and then still apparently in a state of abstraction crossed the path and seated himself on the chair next to that occupied by the young lady  from the tree against which i was standing i was able to watch the subsequent proceedings unobserved  the lady looked at mr parable and then turned away and smiled to herself  it was a peculiar smile and again in some way i am unable to explain reminded me of my first wife it was not till the pelican put down his other leg and walked away that mr parable turning his gaze westward became aware of the ladys presence  from information that has subsequently come to my knowledge i am prepared to believe that mr parable from the beginning really thought the lady was a friend of his  what the lady thought is a matter for conjecture i can only speak to the facts  mr parable looked at the lady once or twice  indeed one might say with truth that he kept on doing it  the lady it must be admitted behaved for a while with extreme propriety but after a time as i felt must happen their eyes met and then it was i heard her say  good evening mr parable  she accompanied the words with the same peculiar smile to which i have already alluded  the exact words of mr parables reply i cannot remember  but it was to the effect that he had thought from the first that he had known her but had not been quite sure  it was at this point that thinking i saw my colleague approaching i went to meet him  i found i was mistaken and slowly retraced my steps i passed mr parable and the lady  they were talking together with what i should describe as animation  i went as far as the southern extremity of the suspension bridge and must have waited there quite ten minutes before returning eastward  it was while i was passing behind them on the grass partially screened by the rhododendrons that i heard mr parable say to the lady  why shouldnt we have it together  to which the lady replied  but what about miss clebb  i could not overhear what followed owing to their sinking their voices  it seemed to be an argument  it ended with the young lady laughing and then rising  mr parable also rose and they walked off together  as they passed me i heard the lady say  i wonder if theres any place in london where youre not likely to be recognised  mr parable who gave me the idea of being in a state of growing excitement replied quite loudly  oh let em  i was following behind them when the lady suddenly stopped  i know she said  the popular cafe   the parkkeeper said he was convinced he would know the lady again having taken particular notice of her  she had brown eyes and was wearing a black hat supplemented with poppies                                            arthur horton waiter at the popular cafe states as follows  i know mr john parable by sight  have often heard him speak at public meetings  am a bit of a socialist myself  remember his dining at the popular cafe on the evening of thursday  didnt recognise him immediately on his entrance for two reasons  one was his hat and the other was his girl  i took it from him and hung it up  i mean of course the hat  it was a brandnew bowler a trifle ikey about the brim  have always associated him with a soft grey felt  but never with girls  females yes to any extent  but this was the real article  you know what i meanthe sort of girl that you turn round to look after  it was she who selected the table in the corner behind the door  been there before i should say  i should in the ordinary course of business have addressed mr parable by name such being our instructions in the case of customers known to us  but putting the hat and the girl together i decided not to  mr parable was all for our threeandsixpenny table dhote he evidently not wanting to think  but the lady wouldnt hear of it  remember miss clebb she reminded him  of course at the time i did not know what was meant  she ordered thin soup a grilled sole and cutlets au gratin  it certainly couldnt have been the dinner  with regard to the champagne he would have his own way  i picked him out a dry 94 that you might have weaned a baby on  i suppose it was the whole thing combined  it was after the sole that i heard mr parable laugh  i could hardly credit my ears but halfway through the cutlets he did it again  there are two kinds of women  there is the woman who the more she eats and drinks the stodgier she gets and the woman who lights up after it  i suggested a peche melba between them and when i returned with it mr parable was sitting with his elbows on the table gazing across at her with an expression that i can only describe as quite human  it was when i brought the coffee that he turned to me and asked  whats doing nothing stuffy he added  is there an exhibition anywheresomething in the open air  you are forgetting miss clebb the lady reminded him  for two pins said mr parable i would get up at the meeting and tell miss clebb what i really think about her  i suggested the earls court exhibition little thinking at the time what it was going to lead to but the lady at first wouldnt hear of it and the party at the next table calling for their bill they had asked for it once or twice before when i came to think of it i had to go across to them  when i got back the argument had just concluded and the lady was holding up her finger  on condition that we leave at halfpast nine and that you go straight to caxton hall she said  well see about it said mr parable and offered me half a crown  tips being against the rules i couldnt take it  besides one of the jumpers had his eye on me  i explained to him jocosely that i was doing it for a bet  he was surprised when i handed him his hat but the lady whispering to him he remembered himself in time  as they went out together i heard mr parable say to the lady  its funny what a shocking memory i have for names  to which the lady replied  youll think it funnier still tomorrow and then she laughed   mr horton thought he would know the lady again  he puts down her age at about twentysix describing herto use his own piquant expressionas a bit of all right  she had brown eyes and a taking way with her                                            miss ida jenks in charge of the eastern cigarette kiosk at the earls court exhibition gives the following particulars  from where i generally stand i can easily command a view of the interior of the victoria hall that is of course to say when the doors are open as on a warm night is usually the case  on the evening of thursday the twentyseventh it was fairly well occupied but not to any great extent  one couple attracted my attention by reason of the gentlemans erratic steering  had he been my partner i should have suggested a polka the tango not being the sort of dance that can be picked up in an evening  what i mean to say is that he struck me as being more willing than experienced some of the bumps she got would have made me cross but we all have our fancies and so far as i could judge they both appeared to be enjoying themselves  it was after the hitchy koo that they came outside  the seat to the left of the door is popular by reason of its being partly screened by bushes but by leaning forward a little it is quite possible for me to see what goes on there  they were the first couple out having had a bad collision near the bandstand so easily secured it  the gentleman was laughing  there was something about him from the first that made me think i knew him and when he took off his hat to wipe his head it came to me all of a sudden he being the exact image of his effigy at madame tussauds which by a curious coincidence i happened to have visited with a friend that very afternoon  the lady was what some people would call goodlooking and others mightnt  i was watching them naturally a little interested  mr parable in helping the lady to adjust her cloak drew herit may have been by accidenttowards him and then it was that a florid gentleman with a short pipe in his mouth stepped forward and addressed the lady he raised his hat and remarking good evening added that he hoped she was having a pleasant time  his tone i should explain was sarcastic  the young woman whatever else may be said of her struck me as behaving quite correctly  replying to his salutation with a cold and distant bow she rose and turning to mr parable observed that she thought it was perhaps time for them to be going  the gentleman who had taken his pipe from his mouth saidagain in a sarcastic tonethat he thought so too and offered the lady his arm  i dont think we need trouble you said mr parable and stepped between them  to describe what followed i being a lady am hampered for words  i remember seeing mr parables hat go up into the air and then the next moment the florid gentlemans head was lying on my counter smothered in cigarettes  i naturally screamed for the police but the crowd was dead against me and it was only after what i believe in technical language would be termed the fourth round that they appeared upon the scene  the last i saw of mr parable he was shaking a young constable who had lost his helmet while three other policemen had hold of him from behind  the florid gentlemans hat i found on the floor of my kiosk and returned to him but after a useless attempt to get it on his head he disappeared with it in his hand  the lady was nowhere to be seen   miss jenks thinks she would know her again  she was wearing a hat trimmed with black chiffon and a spray of poppies and was slightly freckled                                            superintendent s wade in answer to questions put to him by our representative vouchsafed the following replies  yes  i was in charge at the vine street police station on the night of thursday the twentyseventh  no  i have no recollection of a charge of any description being preferred against any gentleman of the name of parable  yes  a gentleman was brought in about ten oclock charged with brawling at the earls court exhibition and assaulting a constable in the discharge of his duty  the gentleman gave the name of mr archibald quincey harcourt buildings temple  no  the gentleman made no application respecting bail electing to pass the night in the cells  a certain amount of discretion is permitted to us and we made him as comfortable as possible  yes  a lady  no  about a gentleman who had got himself into trouble at the earls court exhibition  she mentioned no name  i showed her the charge sheet  she thanked me and went away  that i cannot say  i can only tell you that at ninefifteen on friday morning bail was tendered and after inquiries accepted in the person of julius addison tupp of the sunnybrook steam laundry twickenham  that is no business of ours  the accused who i had seen to it had had a cup of tea and a little toast at seventhirty left in company with mr tupp soon after ten   superintendent wade admitted he had known cases where accused parties to avoid unpleasantness had stated their names to be other than their own but declined to discuss the matter further  superintendent wade while expressing his regret that he had no more time to bestow upon our representative thought it highly probable that he would know the lady again if he saw her  without professing to be a judge of such matters superintendent wade thinks she might be described as a highly intelligent young woman and of exceptionally prepossessing appearance                                            from mr julius tupp of the sunnybrook steam laundry twickenham upon whom our representative next called we have been unable to obtain much assistance mr tupp replying to all questions put to him by the one formula not talking  fortunately our representative on his way out through the drying ground was able to obtain a brief interview with mrs tupp  mrs tupp remembers admitting a young lady to the house on the morning of friday the twentyeighth when she opened the door to take in the milk  the lady mrs tupp remembers spoke in a husky voice the result as the young lady explained with a pleasant laugh of having passed the night wandering about ham common she having been misdirected the previous evening by a fool of a railway porter and not wishing to disturb the neighbourhood by waking people up at two oclock in the morning which in mrs tupps opinion was sensible of her  mrs tupp describes the young lady as of agreeable manners but looking naturally a bit washed out  the lady asked for mr tupp explaining that a friend of his was in trouble which did not in the least surprise mrs tupp she herself not holding with socialists and such like  mr tupp on being informed dressed hastily and went downstairs and he and the young lady left the house together mr tupp on being questioned as to the name of his friend had called up that it was no one mrs tupp would know a mr quinceit may have been quincey  mrs tupp is aware that mr parable is also a socialist and is acquainted with the saying about thieves hanging together  but has worked for mr parable for years and has always found him a most satisfactory client and mr tupp appearing at this point our representative thanked mrs tupp for her information and took his departure                                            mr horatius condor junior who consented to partake of luncheon in company with our representative at the holborn restaurant was at first disinclined to be of much assistance but eventually supplied our representative with the following information  my relationship to mr archibald quincey harcourt buildings temple is perhaps a little difficult to define  how he himself regards me i am never quite sure  there will be days together when we will be quite friendly like and at other times he will be that offhanded and peremptory you might think i was his blooming office boy  on friday morning the twentyeighth i didnt get to harcourt buildings at the usual time knowing that mr quincey would not be there himself he having arranged to interview mr parable for the daily chronicle at ten oclock  i allowed him half an hour to be quite safe and he came in at a quarter past eleven  he took no notice of me  for about ten minutesit may have been lesshe walked up and down the room cursing and swearing and kicking the furniture about  he landed an occasional walnut table in the middle of my shins upon which i took the opportunity of wishing him good morning and he sort of woke up as you might say  how did the interview go off i says  got anything interesting  yes he says quite interesting  oh yes decidedly interesting  he was holding himself in if you understand speaking with horrible slowness and deliberation  dyou know where he was last night he asks me  yes i says caxton hall wasnt itmeeting to demand the release of miss clebb  he leans across the table till his face was within a few inches of mine  guess again he says  i wasnt doing any guessing  he had hurt me with the walnut table and i was feeling a bit shorttempered  oh dont make a game of it i says  its too early in the morning  at the earls court exhibition he says dancing the tango with a lady that he picked up in st jamess park  well i says why not  he dont often get much fun  i thought it best to treat it lightly  he takes no notice of my observation  a rival comes upon the scene he continuesa fatheaded ass according to my informationand they have a standup fight  he gets run in and spends the night in a vine street police cell  i suppose i was grinning without knowing it  funny aint it he says  well i says it has its humorous side hasnt it  whatll he get  i am not worrying about what he is going to get he answers back i am worrying about what i am going to get  i thought he had gone dotty  whats it got to do with you i says  if old wotherspoon is in a good humour he continues and the constables head has gone down a bit between now and wednesday i may get off with forty shillings and a public reprimand  on the other hand he goes onhe was working himself into a sort of fitif the constables head goes on swelling and old wotherspoons liver gets worse ive got to be prepared for a month without the option  that is if i am fool enough  he had left both the doors open which in the daytime we generally do our chambers being at the top  miss dortonthats mr parables secretarybarges into the room  she didnt seem to notice me  she staggers to a chair and bursts into tears  hes gone she says hes taken cook with him and gone  gone says the guvnor  wheres he gone  to fingest she says through her sobsto the cottage  miss bulstrode came in just after you had left she says  he wants to get away from everyone and have a few days quiet  and then he is coming back and he is going to do it himself  do what says the guvnor irritable like  fourteen days she wails  itll kill him  but the case doesnt come on till wednesday says the guvnor how do you know its going to be fourteen days  miss bulstrode she says shes seen the magistrate  he says he always gives fourteen days in cases of unprovoked assault  but it wasnt unprovoked says the guvnor  the other man began it by knocking off his hat  it was selfdefence  she put that to him she says and he agreed that that would alter his view of the case  but you see she continues we cant find the other man  he isnt likely to come forward of his own accord  the girl must know says the guvnorthis girl he picks up in st jamess park and goes dancing with  the man must have been some friend of hers  but we cant find her either she says  he doesnt even know her namehe cant remember it  you will do it wont you she says  do what says the guvnor again  the fourteen days she says  but i thought you said he was going to do it himself he says  but he mustnt she says  miss bulstrode is coming round to see you  think of it  think of the headlines in the papers she says think of the fabian society  think of the suffrage cause  we mustnt let him  what about me says the guvnor  doesnt anybody care for me  you dont matter she says  besides she says with your influence youll be able to keep it out of the papers  if it comes out that it was mr parable nothing on earth will be able to  the guvnor was almost as much excited by this time as she was  ill see the fabian society and the womens vote and the home for lost cats at battersea and all the rest of the blessed bag of tricks  id been thinking to myself and had just worked it out  whats he want to take his cook down with him for i says  to cook for him says the guvnor  what dyou generally want a cook for  rats i says  does he usually take his cook with him  no answered miss dorton  now i come to think of it he has always hitherto put up with mrs meadows  you will find the lady down at fingest i says sitting opposite him and enjoying a recherche dinner for two  the guvnor slaps me on the back and lifts miss dorton out of her chair  you get on back he says and telephone to miss bulstrode  ill be round at halfpast twelve  miss dorton went out in a dazed sort of condition and the guvnor gives me a sovereign and tells me i can have the rest of the day to myself   mr condor junior considers that what happened subsequently goes to prove that he was right more than it proves that he was wrong  mr condor junior also promised to send us a photograph of himself for reproduction but unfortunately up to the time of going to press it had not arrived                                            from mrs meadows widow of the late corporal john meadows vc turberville bucks the following further particulars were obtained by our local representative  i have done for mr parable now for some years past my cottage being only a mile off which makes it easy for me to look after him  mr parable likes the place to be always ready so that he can drop in when he chooses he sometimes giving me warning and sometimes not  it was about the end of last monthon a friday if i remember rightlythat he suddenly turned up  as a rule he walks from henley station but on this occasion he arrived in a fly he having a young woman with him and she having a baghis cook as he explained to me  as a rule i do everything for mr parable sleeping in the cottage when he is there but to tell the truth i was glad to see her  i never was much of a cook myself as my poor dead husband has remarked on more than one occasion and i dont pretend to be  mr parable added apologetic like that he had been suffering lately from indigestion  i am only too pleased to see her i says  there are the two beds in my room and we shant quarrel  she was quite a sensible young woman as i had judged from the first look at her though suffering at the time from a cold  she hires a bicycle from emma tidd who only uses it on a sunday and taking a market basket off she starts for henley mr parable saying he would go with her to show her the way  they were gone a goodish time which seeing its eight miles didnt so much surprise me and when they got back we all three had dinner together mr parable arguing that it made for what he called labour saving  afterwards i cleared away leaving them talking together and later on they had a walk round the garden it being a moonlight night but a bit too cold for my fancy  in the morning i had a chat with her before he was down  she seemed a bit worried  i hope people wont get talking she says  he would insist on my coming  well i says surely a gent can bring his cook along with him to cook for him  and as for people talking what i always say is one may just as well give them something to talk about and save them the trouble of making it up  if only i was a plain middleaged woman she says it would be all right  perhaps you will be all in good time i says but of course i could see what she was driving at  a nice clean pleasantfaced young woman she was and not of the ordinary class  meanwhile i says if you dont mind taking a bit of motherly advice you might remember that your place is the kitchen and his the parlour  hes a dear good man i know but human nature is human nature and its no good pretending it isnt  she and i had our breakfast together before he was up so that when he came down he had to have his alone but afterwards she comes into the kitchen and closes the door  he wants to show me the way to high wycombe she says  he will have it there are better shops at wycombe  what ought i to do  my experience is that advising folks to do what they dont want to do isnt the way to do it  what dyou think yourself i asked her  i feel like going with him she says and making the most of every mile  and then she began to cry  whats the harm she says  i have heard him from a dozen platforms ridiculing class distinctions  besides she says my people have been farmers for generations  what was miss bulstrodes father but a grocer  he ran a hundred shops instead of one  what difference does that make  when did it all begin i says  when did he first take notice of you like  the day before yesterday she answers  he had never seen me before she says  i was just cooksomething in a cap and apron that he passed occasionally on the stairs  on thursday he saw me in my best clothes and fell in love with me  he doesnt know it himself poor dear not yet but thats what hes done  well i couldnt contradict her not after the way i had seen him looking at her across the table  what are your feelings towards him i says to be quite honest hes rather a good catch for a young person in your position  thats my trouble she says  i cant help thinking of that  and then to be mrs john parable  thats enough to turn a womans head  hed be a bit difficult to live with i says  geniuses always are she says its easy enough if you just think of them as children  hed be a bit fractious at times thats all underneath hes just the kindest dearest  oh you take your basket and go to high wycombe i says  he might do worse  i wasnt expecting them back soon and they didnt come back soon in the afternoon a motor stops at the gate and out of it steps miss bulstrode miss dortonthats the young lady that writes for himand mr quincey  i told them i couldnt say when hed be back and they said it didnt matter they just happening to be passing  did anybody call on him yesterday asks miss bulstrode careless likea lady  no i says you are the first as yet  hes brought his cook down with him hasnt he says mr quincey  yes i says and a very good cook too which was the truth  id like just to speak a few words with her says miss bulstrode  sorry mam i says but shes out at present shes gone to wycombe  gone to wycombe they all says together  to market i says  its a little farther but of course it stands to reason the shops there are better  they looked at one another  that settles it says mr quincey  delicacies worthy to be set before her not available nearer than wycombe but must be had theres going to be a pleasant little dinner here tonight  the hussy says miss bulstrode under her breath  they whispered together for a moment then they turns to me  good afternoon mrs meadows says mr quincey  you neednt say we called  he wanted to be alone and it might vex him  i said i wouldnt and i didnt  they climbed back into the motor and went off  before dinner i had call to go into the woodshed  i heard a scuttling as i opened the door  if i am not mistaken miss dorton was hiding in the corner where we keep the coke  i didnt see any good in making a fuss so i left her there  when i got back to the kitchen cook asked me if wed got any parsley  youll find a bit in the front i says to the left of the gate and she went out  she came back looking scared  anybody keep goats round here she asked me  not that i know of nearer than ibstone common i says  i could have sworn i saw a goats face looking at me out of the gooseberry bushes while i was picking the parsley she says  it had a beard  its the half light i says  one can imagine anything  i do hope im not getting nervy she says  i thought id have another look round and made the excuse that i wanted a pail of water  i was stooping over the well which is just under the mulberry tree when something fell close to me and lodged upon the bricks  it was a hairpin  i fixed the cover carefully upon the well in case of accident and when i got in i went round myself and was careful to see that all the curtains were drawn  just before we three sat down to dinner again i took cook aside  i shouldnt go for any stroll in the garden tonight i says people from the village may be about and we dont want them gossiping  and she thanked me  next night they were there again  i thought i wouldnt spoil the dinner but mention it afterwards  i saw to it again that the curtains were drawn and slipped the catch of both the doors  and just as well that i did  i had always heard that mr parable was an amusing speaker but on previous visits had not myself noticed it  but this time he seemed ten years younger than i had ever known him before and during dinner while we were talking and laughing quite merry like i had the feeling more than once that people were meandering about outside  i had just finished clearing away and cook was making the coffee when there came a knock at the door  whos that says mr parable  i am not at home to anyone  ill see i says  and on my way i slipped into the kitchen  coffee for one cook i says and she understood  her cap and apron were hanging behind the door  i flung them across to her and she caught them and then i opened the front door  they pushed past me without speaking and went straight into the parlour  and they didnt waste many words on him either  where is she asked miss bulstrode  wheres who says mr parable  dont lie about it said miss bulstrode making no effort to control herself  the hussy youve been dining with  do you mean mrs meadows says mr parable  i thought she was going to shake him  where have you hidden her she says  it was at that moment cook entered with the coffee  if they had taken the trouble to look at her they might have had an idea  the tray was trembling in her hands and in her haste and excitement she had put on her cap the wrong way round  but she kept control of her voice and asked if she should bring some more coffee  ah yes youd all like some coffee wouldnt you says mr parable miss bulstrode did not reply but mr quincey said he was cold and would like it  it was a nasty night with a thin rain  thank you sir says cook and we went out together  cottages are only cottages and if people in the parlour persist in talking loudly people in the kitchen cant very well help overhearing  there was a good deal of talk about fourteen days which mr parable said he was going to do himself and which miss dorton said he mustnt because if he did it would be a victory for the enemies of humanity mr parable said something about humanity which i didnt rightly hear but whatever it was it started miss dorton crying and miss bulstrode called mr parable a blind samson who had had his hair cut by a designing minx who had been hired to do it  it was all french to me but cook was drinking in every word and when she returned from taking them in their coffee she made no bones about it but took up her place at the door with her ear to the keyhole  it was mr quincey who got them all quiet and then he began to explain things  it seemed that if they could only find a certain gentleman and persuade him to come forward and acknowledge that he began a row that then all would be well  mr quincey would be fined forty shillings and mr parables name would never appear failing that mr parable according to mr quincey could do his fourteen days himself  ive told you once says mr parable and i tell you again that i dont know the mans name and cant give it you  we are not asking you to says mr quincey  you give us the name of your tango partner and well do the rest  i could see cooks face i had got a bit interested myself and we were both close to the door  she hardly seemed to be breathing  i am sorry says mr parable speaking very deliberatelike but i am not going to have her name dragged into this business  it wouldnt be says mr quincey  all we want to get out of her is the name and address of the gentleman who was so anxious to see her home  who was he says miss bulstrode  her husband  no says mr parable he wasnt  then who was he says miss bulstrode  he must have been something to herfiance  i am going to do the fourteen days myself says mr parable  i shall come out all the fresher after a fortnights complete rest and change  cook leaves the door with a smile on her face that made her look quite beautiful and taking some paper from the dresser drawer began to write a letter  they went on talking in the other room for another ten minutes and then mr parable lets them out himself and goes a little way with them  when he came back we could hear him walking up and down the other room  she had written and stamped the envelope it was lying on the table  joseph onions esq i says reading the address  auctioneer and house agent broadway hammersmith is that the young man  that is the young man she says folding her letter and putting it in the envelope  and was he your fiance i asked  no she says  but he will be if he does what im telling him to do  and what about mr parable i says  a little joke that will amuse him later on she says slipping a cloak on her shoulders  how once he nearly married his cook  i shant be a minute she says  and with the letter in her hand she slips out   mrs meadows we understand has expressed indignation at our publication of this interview she being under the impression that she was simply having a friendly gossip with a neighbour  our representative however is sure he explained to mrs meadows that his visit was official and in any case our duty to the public must be held to exonerate us from all blame in the matter                                            mr joseph onions of the broadway hammersmith auctioneer and house agent expressed himself to our representative as most surprised at the turn that events had subsequently taken  the letter that mr onions received from miss comfort price was explicit and definite  it was to the effect that if he would call upon a certain mr quincey of harcourt buildings temple and acknowledge that it was he who began the row at the earls court exhibition on the evening of the twentyseventh that then the engagement between himself and miss price hitherto unacknowledged by the lady might be regarded as a fact  mr onions who describes himself as essentially a business man decided before complying with miss prices request to take a few preliminary steps  as the result of judiciously conducted inquiries first at the vine street police station and secondly at twickenham mr onions arrived later in the day at mr quinceys chambers with to use his own expression all the cards in his hand  it was mr quincey who professing himself unable to comply with mr onions suggestion arranged the interview with miss bulstrode  and it was miss bulstrode herself who on condition that mr onions added to the undertaking the further condition that he would marry miss price before the end of the month offered to make it two hundred  it was in their joint interestmr onions regarding himself and miss price as now onethat mr onions suggested her making it three using such arguments as under the circumstances naturally occurred to himas for example the damage caused to the ladys reputation by the whole proceedings culminating in a night spent by the lady according to her own account on ham common  that the price demanded was reasonable mr onions considers as proved by miss bulstrodes eventual acceptance of his terms  that having got out of him all that he wanted mr quincey should have considered it his duty to communicate the entire details of the transaction to miss price through the medium of mr andrews thinking it as well she should know the character of the man she proposed to marry mr onions considers a gross breach of etiquette as between gentlemen and having regard to miss prices after behaviour mr onions can only say that she is not the girl he took her for  mr aaron andrews on whom our representative called was desirous at first of not being drawn into the matter but on our representative explaining to him that our only desire was to contradict false rumours likely to be harmful to mr parables reputation mr andrews saw the necessity of putting our representative in possession of the truth   she came back on tuesday afternoon explained mr andrews and i had a talk with her  it is all right mr andrews she told me theyve been in communication with my young man and miss bulstrode has seen the magistrate privately  the case will be dismissed with a fine of forty shillings and mr quincey has arranged to keep it out of the papers  well alls well that ends well i answered but it might have been better my girl if you had mentioned that young man of yours a bit earlier  i did not know it was of any importance she explained  mr parable told me nothing  if it hadnt been for chance i should never have known what was happening  i had always liked the young woman  mr quincey had suggested my waiting till after wednesday  but there seemed to me no particular object in delay  are you fond of him i asked her  yes she answered  i am fonder than  and then she stopped herself suddenly and flared scarlet  who are you talking about she demanded  this young man of yours i said  mrwhats his nameonions  oh that she answered  oh yes hes all right  and if he wasnt i said and she looked at me hard  i told him she said that if he would do what i asked him to do id marry him  and he seems to have done it  there are ways of doing everything i said and seeing it wasnt going to break her heart i told her just the plain facts  she listened without a word and when i had finished she put her arms round my neck and kissed me  i am old enough to be her grandfather but twenty years ago it might have upset me  i think i shall be able to save miss bulstrode that three hundred pounds she laughed and ran upstairs and changed her things  when later i looked into the kitchen she was humming  mr john came up by the car and i could see he was in one of his moods  pack me some things for a walking tour he said  dont forget the knapsack  i am going to scotland by the eightthirty  will you be away long i asked him  it depends upon how long it takes me he answered  when i come back i am going to be married  who is the lady i asked though of course i knew  miss bulstrode he said  well i said she  that will do he said i have had all that from the three of them for the last two days  she is a socialist and a suffragist and all the rest of it and my ideal helpmate  she is well off and that will enable me to devote all my time to putting the world to rights without bothering about anything else  our home will be the nursery of advanced ideas  we shall share together the joys and delights of the public platform  what more can any man want  you will want your dinner early i said if you are going by the eightthirty  i had better tell cook  he interrupted me again  you can tell cook to go to the devil he said  i naturally stared at him  she is going to marry a beastly little rotter of a rent collector that she doesnt care a damn for he went on  i could not understand why he seemed so mad about it  i dont see in any case what its got to do with you i said but as a matter of fact she isnt  isnt what he said stopping short and turning on me  isnt going to marry him i answered  why not he demanded  better ask her i suggested  i didnt know at the time that it was a silly thing to say and i am not sure that i should not have said it if i had  when he is in one of his moods i always seem to get into one of mine  i have looked after mr john ever since he was a baby so that we do not either of us treat the other quite as perhaps we ought to  tell cook i want her he said  she is just in the middle i began  i dont care where she is he said  he seemed determined never to let me finish a sentence  send her up here  she was in the kitchen by herself  he wants to see you at once i said  who does she asked  mr john i said  whats he want to see me for she asked  how do i know i answered  but you do she said  she always had an obstinate twist in her and feeling it would save time i told her what had happened  well i said arent you going  she was standing stock still staring at the pastry she was making she turned to me and there was a curious smile about her lips  do you know what you ought to be wearing she said  wings and a little bow and arrow  she didnt even think to wipe her hands but went straight upstairs it was about half an hour later when the bell rang  mr john was standing by the window  is that bag ready he said  it will be i said  i went out into the hall and returned with the clothes brush  what are you going to do he said  perhaps you dont know it i said but you are all over flour  cooks going with me to scotland he said  i have looked after mr john ever since he was a boy  he was fortytwo last birthday but when i shook hands with him through the cab window i could have sworn he was twentyfive again     the lesson  the first time i met him to my knowledge was on an evilsmelling onefunnelled steam boat that in those days plied between london bridge and antwerp  he was walking the deck arminarm with a showily dressed but decidedly attractive young woman both of them talking and laughing loudly  it struck me as odd finding him a fellowtraveller by such a route  the passage occupied eighteen hours and the firstclass return fare was one pound twelve and six including three meals each way drinks as the contract was careful to explain being extra  i was earning thirty shillings a week at the time as clerk with a firm of agents in fenchurch street  our business was the purchasing of articles on commission for customers in india and i had learned to be a judge of values  the beaver lined coat he was wearingfor the evening although it was late summer was chillymust have cost him a couple of hundred pounds while his carelessly displayed jewellery he could easily have pawned for a thousand or more  i could not help staring at him and once as they passed he returned my look  after dinner as i was leaning with my back against the gunwale on the starboard side he came out of the only private cabin that the vessel boasted and taking up a position opposite to me with his legs well apart and a big cigar between his thick lips stood coolly regarding me as if appraising me  treating yourself to a little holiday on the continent he inquired  i had not been quite sure before he spoke but his lisp though slight betrayed the jew  his features were coarse almost brutal but the restless eyes were so brilliant the whole face so suggestive of power and character that taking him as a whole the feeling he inspired was admiration tempered by fear  his tone was one of kindly contemptthe tone of a man accustomed to find most people his inferiors and too used to the discovery to be conceited about it  behind it was a note of authority that it did not occur to me to dispute  yes i answered adding the information that i had never been abroad before and had heard that antwerp was an interesting town  how long have you got he asked  a fortnight i told him  like to see a bit more than antwerp if you could afford it wouldnt you he suggested  fascinating little country holland just long enougha fortnightto do the whole of it  im a dutchman a dutch jew  you speak english just like an englishman i told him  it was somehow in my mind to please him  i could hardly have explained why  and half a dozen other languages equally well he answered laughing i left amsterdam when i was eighteen as steerage passenger in an emigrant ship  i havent seen it since  he closed the cabin door behind him and crossing over laid a strong hand on my shoulder  i will make a proposal to you he said  my business is not of the kind that can be put out of mind even for a few days and there are reasonshe glanced over his shoulder towards the cabin door and gave vent to a short laughwhy i did not want to bring any of my own staff with me  if you care for a short tour all expenses paid at slapup hotels and a tenpound note in your pocket at the end you can have it for two hours work a day  i suppose my face expressed my acceptance for he did not wait for me to speak  only one thing i stipulate for he added that you mind your own business and keep your mouth shut  youre by yourself arent you  yes i told him  he wrote on a sheet of his notebook and tearing it out handed it to me  thats your hotel at antwerp he said  you are mr horatio joness secretary  he chuckled to himself as he repeated the name which certainly did not fit him  knock at my sittingroom door at nine oclock tomorrow morning  good night  he ended the conversation as abruptly as he had begun it and returned to his cabin  i got a glimpse of him next morning coming out of the hotel bureau he was speaking to the manager in french and had evidently given instructions concerning me for i found myself preceded by an obsequious waiter to quite a charming bedroom on the second floor while the english breakfast placed before me later in the coffeeroom was of a size and character that in those days i did not often enjoy about the work also he was as good as his word  i was rarely occupied for more than two hours each morning  the duties consisted chiefly of writing letters and sending off telegrams  the letters he signed and had posted himself so that i never learnt his real namenot during that fortnightbut i gathered enough to be aware that he was a man whose business interests must have been colossal and worldwide  he never introduced me to mrs horatio jones and after a few days he seemed to be bored with her so that often i would take her place as his companion in afternoon excursions  i could not help liking the man  strength always compels the adoration of youth and there was something big and heroic about him  his daring his swift decisions his utter unscrupulousness his occasional cruelty when necessity seemed to demand it  one could imagine him in earlier days a born leader of savage hordes a lover of fighting for its own sake meeting all obstacles with fierce welcome forcing his way onward indifferent to the misery and destruction caused by his progress his eyes never swerving from their goal yet not without a sense of rough justice not altogether without kindliness when it could be indulged in without danger  one afternoon he took me with him into the jewish quarter of amsterdam and threading his way without hesitation through its maze of unsavoury slums paused before a narrow threestoreyed house overlooking a stagnant backwater  the room i was born in he explained  window with the broken pane on the second floor  it has never been mended  i stole a glance at him  his face betrayed no suggestion of sentiment but rather of amusement  he offered me a cigar which i was glad of for the stench from the offalladen water behind us was distracting and for a while we both smoked in silence  he with his eyes halfclosed it was a trick of his when working out a business problem  curious my making such a choice he remarked  a butchers assistant for my father and a consumptive buttonholemaker for my mother  i suppose i knew what i was about  quite the right thing for me to have done as it turned out  i stared at him wondering whether he was speaking seriously or in grim jest  he was given at times to making odd remarks  there was a vein of the fantastic in him that was continually cropping out and astonishing me  it was a bit risky i suggested  better choose something a little safer next time  he looked round at me sharply and not quite sure of his mood i kept a grave face  perhaps you are right he agreed with a laugh  we must have a talk about it one day  after that visit to the goortgasse he was less reserved with me and would often talk to me on subjects that i should never have guessed would have interested him  i found him a curious mixture  behind the shrewd cynical man of business i caught continual glimpses of the visionary  i parted from him at the hague  he paid my fare back to london and gave me an extra pound for travelling expenses together with the tenpound note he had promised me  he had packed off mrs horatio jones some days before to the relief i imagine of both of them and he himself continued his journey to berlin  i never expected to see him again although for the next few months i often thought of him and even tried to discover him by inquiries in the city  i had however very little to go upon and after i had left fenchurch street behind me and drifted into literature i forgot him  until one day i received a letter addressed to the care of my publishers  it bore the swiss postmark and opening it and turning to the signature i sat wondering for the moment where i had met horatio jones  and then i remembered  he was lying bruised and broken in a woodcutters hut on the slopes of the jungfrau  had been playing a fools trick so he described it thinking he could climb mountains at his age  they would carry him down to lauterbrunnen as soon as he could be moved farther with safety but for the present he had no one to talk to but the nurse and a swiss doctor who climbed up to see him every third day  he begged me if i could spare the time to come over and spend a week with him  he enclosed a hundredpound cheque for my expenses making no apology for doing so  he was complimentary about my first book which he had been reading and asked me to telegraph him my reply giving me his real name which as i had guessed it would proved to be one of the best known in the financial world  my time was my own now and i wired him that i would be with him the following monday  he was lying in the sun outside the hut when i arrived late in the afternoon after a threehours climb followed by a porter carrying my small amount of luggage  he could not raise his hand but his strangely brilliant eyes spoke their welcome  i am glad you were able to come he said  i have no near relations and my friendsif that is the right termare business men who would be bored to tears  besides they are not the people i feel i want to talk to now  he was entirely reconciled to the coming of death  indeed there were moments when he gave me the idea that he was looking forward to it with an awed curiosity  with the conventional notion of cheering him i talked of staying till he was able to return with me to civilisation but he only laughed  i am not going back he said  not that way  what they may do afterwards with these broken bones does not much concern either you or me  its a good place to die in he continued  a man can think up here  it was difficult to feel sorry for him his own fate appearing to make so little difference to himself  the world was still full of interest to himnot his own particular corner of it  that he gave me to understand he had tidied up and dismissed from his mind  it was the future its coming problems its possibilities its new developments about which he seemed eager to talk  one might have imagined him a young man with the years before him  one eveningit was near the endwe were alone together  the woodcutter and his wife had gone down into the valley to see their children and the nurse leaving him in my charge had gone for a walk we had carried him round to his favourite side of the hut facing the towering mass of the jungfrau  as the shadows lengthened it seemed to come nearer to us and there fell a silence upon us  gradually i became aware that his piercing eyes were fixed on me and in answer i turned and looked at him  i wonder if we shall meet again he said or what is more important if we shall remember one another  i was puzzled for the moment  we had discussed more than once the various religions of mankind and his attitude towards the orthodox beliefs had always been that of amused contempt  it has been growing upon me these last few days he continued it flashed across me the first time i saw you on the boat  we were fellowstudents  something i dont know what drew us very close together  there was a woman  they were burning her  and then there was a rush of people and a sudden darkness and your eyes close to mine  i suppose it was some form of hypnotism for as he spoke his searching eyes fixed on mine there came to me a dream of narrow streets filled with a strange crowd of painted houses such as i had never seen and a haunting fear that seemed to be always lurking behind each shadow  i shook myself free but not without an effort  so thats what you meant i said that evening in the goortgasse you believe in it  a curious thing happened to me he said when i was a child  i could hardly have been six years old  i had gone to ghent with my parents  i think it was to visit some relative  one day we went into the castle  it was in ruins then but has since been restored we were in what was once the council chamber  i stole away by myself to the other end of the great room and not knowing why i did so i touched a spring concealed in the masonry and a door swung open with a harsh grinding noise  i remember peering round the opening  the others had their backs towards me and i slipped through and closed the door behind me  i seemed instinctively to know my way  i ran down a flight of steps and along dark corridors through which i had to feel my way with my hands till i came to a small door in an angle of the wall  i knew the room that lay the other side  a photograph was taken of it and published years afterwards when the place was discovered and it was exactly as i knew it with its way out underneath the city wall through one of the small houses in the aussermarkt  i could not open the door  some stones had fallen against it and fearing to get punished i made my way back into the council room it was empty when i reached it  they were searching for me in the other rooms and i never told them of my adventure  at any other time i might have laughed  later recalling his talk that evening i dismissed the whole story as mere suggestion based upon the imagination of a child but at the time those strangely brilliant eyes had taken possession of me  they remained still fixed upon me as i sat on the low rail of the veranda watching his white face into which the hues of death seemed already to be creeping  i had a feeling that through them he was trying to force remembrance of himself upon me  the man himselfthe very soul of himseemed to be concentrated in them  something formless and yet distinct was visualising itself before me  it came to me as a physical relief when a spasm of pain caused him to turn his eyes away from me  you will find a letter when i am gone he went on after a moments silence  i thought that you might come too late or that i might not have strength enough to tell you  i felt that out of the few people i have met outside business you would be the most likely not to dismiss the matter as mere nonsense  what i am glad of myself and what i wish you to remember is that i am dying with all my faculties about me the one thing i have always feared through life was old age with its gradual mental decay  it has always seemed to me that i have died more or less suddenly while still in possession of my will  i have always thanked god for that  he closed his eyes but i do not think he was sleeping and a little later the nurse returned and we carried him indoors  i had no further conversation with him though at his wish during the following two days i continued to read to him and on the third day he died  i found the letter he had spoken of  he had told me where it would be it contained a bundle of banknotes which he was giving meso he wrotewith the advice to get rid of them as quickly as possible  if i had not loved you the letter continued i would have left you an income and you would have blessed me instead of cursing me as you should have done for spoiling your life  this world was a school so he viewed it for the making of men and the one thing essential to a man was strength  one gathered the impression of a deeply religious man  in these days he would no doubt have been claimed as a theosophist but his beliefs he had made for and adapted to himselfto his vehement conquering temperament god needed men to serve himto help him  so through many changes through many ages god gave men life  that by contest and by struggle they might ever increase in strength to those who proved themselves most fit the sterner task the humbler beginnings the greater obstacles  and the crown of welldoing was ever victory  he appeared to have convinced himself that he was one of the chosen that he was destined for great ends  he had been a slave in the time of the pharaohs a priest in babylon had clung to the swaying ladders in the sack of rome had won his way into the councils when europe was a battlefield of contending tribes had climbed to power in the days of the borgias  to most of us i suppose there come at odd moments haunting thoughts of strangely familiar faroff things and one wonders whether they are memories or dreams  we dismiss them as we grow older and the present with its crowding interests shuts them out but in youth they were more persistent  with him they appeared to have remained growing in reality  his recent existence closed under the white sheet in the hut behind me as i read was only one chapter of the story he was looking forward to the next  he wondered so the letter ran whether he would have any voice in choosing it  in either event he was curious of the result  what he anticipated confidently were new opportunities wider experience in what shape would these come to him  the letter ended with a strange request  it was that on returning to england i should continue to think of him  not of the dead man i had known the jewish banker the voice familiar to me the trick of speech of mannerall such being but the changing clothesbut of the man himself the soul of him that would seek and perhaps succeed in revealing itself to me  a postscript concluded the letter to which at the time i attached no importance  he had made a purchase of the hut in which he had died after his removal it was to remain empty  i folded the letter and placed it among other papers and passing into the hut took a farewell glance at the massive rugged face the mask might have served a sculptor for the embodiment of strength  he gave one the feeling that having conquered death he was sleeping  i did what he had requested of me  indeed i could not help it  i thought of him constantly  that may have been the explanation of it  i was bicycling through norfolk and one afternoon to escape a coming thunderstorm i knocked at the door of a lonely cottage on the outskirts of a common  the woman a kindly bustling person asked me in and hoping i would excuse her as she was busy ironing returned to her work in another room  i thought myself alone and was standing at the window watching the pouring rain  after a while without knowing why i turned  and then i saw a child seated on a high chair behind a table in a dark corner of the room  a book of pictures was open before it but it was looking at me  i could hear the sound of the woman at her ironing in the other room outside there was the steady thrashing of the rain  the child was looking at me with large round eyes filled with a terrible pathos i noticed that the little body was misshapen it never moved it made no sound but i had the feeling that out of those strangely wistful eyes something was trying to speak to me something was forming itself before menot visible to my sight but it was there in the room  it was the man i had last looked upon as dying he sat beside me in the hut below the jungfrau  but something had happened to him  moved by instinct i went over to him and lifted him out of his chair and with a sob the little wizened arms closed round my neck and he clung to me cryinga pitiful low wailing cry  hearing his cry the woman came back  a comely healthylooking woman she took him from my arms and comforted him  he gets a bit sorry for himself at times she explained  at least so i fancy  you see he cant run about like other children or do anything without getting pains  was it an accident i asked  no she answered and his father as fine a man as you would find in a days march  just a visitation of god as they tell me  sure i dont know why  there never was a better little lad and clever too when hes not in pain  draws wonderfully  the storm had passed  he grew quieter in her arms and when i had promised to come again and bring him a new picturebook a little grateful smile flickered across the drawn face but he would not talk  i kept in touch with him  mere curiosity would have made me do that he grew more normal as the years went by and gradually the fancy that had come to me at our first meeting faded farther into the background sometimes using the very language of the dead mans letter i would talk to him wondering if by any chance some flash of memory would come back to him and once or twice it seemed to me that into the mild pathetic eyes there came a look that i had seen before but it passed away and indeed it was difficult to think of this sad little human oddity with its pleading helplessness in connection with the strong swift conquering spirit that i had watched passing away amid the silence of the mountains  the one thing that brought joy to him was his art  i cannot help thinking that but for his health he would have made a name for himself  his work was always clever and original but it was the work of an invalid  i shall never be great he said to me once  i have such wonderful dreams but when it comes to working them out there is something that hampers me  it always seems to me as if at the last moment a hand was stretched out that clutched me by the feet  i long so but i have not the strength  it is terrible to be one of the weaklings  it clung to me that word he had used  for a man to know he is weak it sounds a paradox but a man must be strong to know that and dwelling upon this and upon his patience and his gentleness there came to me suddenly remembrance of that postscript the significance of which i had not understood  he was a young man of about three or fourandtwenty at the time his father had died and he was living in poor lodgings in the south of london supporting himself and his mother by strenuous illpaid work  i want you to come with me for a few days holiday i told him  i had some difficulty in getting him to accept my help for he was very proud in his sensitive apologetic way  but i succeeded eventually persuading him it would be good for his work physically the journey must have cost him dear for he could never move his body without pain but the changing landscapes and the strange cities more than repaid him and when one morning i woke him early and he saw for the first time the distant mountains clothed in dawn there came a new light into his eyes  we reached the hut late in the afternoon  i had made my arrangements so that we should be there alone  our needs were simple and in various wanderings i had learnt to be independent  i did not tell him why i had brought him there beyond the beauty and stillness of the place  purposely i left him much alone there making everlengthening walks my excuse and though he was always glad of my return i felt that the desire was growing upon him to be there by himself  one evening having climbed farther than i had intended i lost my way it was not safe in that neighbourhood to try new pathways in the dark and chancing upon a deserted shelter i made myself a bed upon the straw  i found him seated outside the hut when i returned and he greeted me as if he had been expecting me just at that moment and not before  he guessed just what had happened he told me and had not been alarmed during the day i found him watching me and in the evening as we sat in his favourite place outside the hut he turned to me  you think it true he said  that you and i sat here years ago and talked  i cannot tell i answered  i only know that he died here if there be such a thing as deaththat no one has ever lived here since  i doubt if the door has ever been opened till we came  they have always been with me he continued these dreams  but i have always dismissed them  they seemed so ludicrous  always there came to me wealth power victory  life was so easy  he laid his thin hand on mine  a strange new look came into his eyesa look of hope almost of joy  do you know what it seems to me he said  you will laugh perhaps but the thought has come to me up here that god has some fine use for me  success was making me feeble  he has given me weakness and failure that i may learn strength  the great thing is to be strong     sylvia of the letters  old ab herrick so most people called him  not that he was actually old the term was an expression of liking rather than any reflection on his years  he lived in an oldfashioned houseoldfashioned that is for new yorkon the south side of west twentieth street once upon a time but that was long ago quite a fashionable quarter  the house together with mrs travers had been left him by a maiden aunt  an apartment would of course have been more suitable to a bachelor of simple habits but the situation was convenient from a journalistic point of view and for fifteen years abner herrick had lived and worked there  then one evening after a three days absence abner herrick returned to west twentieth street bringing with him a little girl wrapped up in a shawl and a wooden box tied with a piece of cord he put the box on the table and the young lady loosening her shawl walked to the window and sat down facing the room  mrs travers took the box off the table and put it on the floorit was quite a little boxand waited  this young lady explained abner herrick is miss ann kavanagh daughter ofof an old friend of mine  oh said mrs travers and remained still expectant  miss kavanagh continued abner herrick will be staying with us for  he appeared to be uncertain of the length of miss kavanaghs visit  he left the sentence unfinished and took refuge in more pressing questions  what about the bedroom on the second floor  is it ready  sheets airedall that sort of thing  it can be replied mrs travers  the tone was suggestive of judgment reserved  i think if you dont mind mrs travers that wed like to go to bed as soon as possible  from force of habit abner s herrick in speaking employed as a rule the editorial we  we have been travelling all day and we are very tired  tomorrow morning  id like some supper said miss kavanagh from her seat in the window without moving  of course agreed miss kavanaghs host with a feeble pretence that the subject had been on the tip of his tongue  as a matter of fact he really had forgotten all about it  we might have it up here while the room is being got ready  perhaps a little  a soft boiled egg and a glass of milk if you please mrs travers interrupted miss kavanagh still from her seat at the window  ill see about it said mrs travers and went out taking the quite small box with her  such was the coming into this story of ann kavanagh at the age of eight years or as miss kavanagh herself would have explained had the question been put to her eight years and seven months for ann kavanagh was a precise young lady  she was not beautifulnot then she was much too sharp featured the little pointed chin protruding into space to quite a dangerous extent  her large dark eyes were her one redeeming feature  but the level brows above them were much too ready with their frown  a sallow complexion and nondescript hair deprived her of that charm of colouring on which youth can generally depend for attraction whatever its faults of form  nor could it truthfully be said that sweetness of disposition afforded compensation  a selfwilled cantankerous little imp i call her was mrs traverss comment expressed after one of the many trials of strength between them from which miss kavanagh had as usual emerged triumphant  its her father explained abner herrick feeling himself unable to contradict  its unfortunate answered mrs travers whatever it is  to uncle ab himself as she had come to call him she could on occasion be yielding and affectionate but that as mrs travers took care to point out to her was a small thing to her credit  if you had the instincts of an ordinary christian child explained mrs travers to her youd be thinking twentyfour hours a day of what you could do to repay him for all his loving kindness to you instead of causing him as you know you do a dozen heartaches in a week youre an ungrateful little monkey and when hes gone youll  upon which miss kavanagh not waiting to hear more flew upstairs and locking herself in her own room gave herself up to howling and remorse but was careful not to emerge until she felt bad tempered again and able should opportunity present itself to renew the contest with mrs travers unhampered by sentiment  but mrs traverss words had sunk in deeper than that good lady herself had hoped for and one evening when abner herrick was seated at his desk penning a scathing indictment of the president for lack of firmness and decision on the tariff question ann putting her thin arms round his neck and rubbing her little sallow face against his righthand whisker took him to task on the subject  youre not bringing me up properlynot as you ought to explained ann  you give way to me too much and you never scold me  not scold you exclaimed abner with a certain warmth of indignation why im doing it all  not what i call scolding continued ann  its very wrong of you i shall grow up horrid if you dont help me  as ann with great clearness pointed out to him there was no one else to undertake the job with any chance of success  if abner failed her then she supposed there was no hope for her  she would end by becoming a wicked woman and everybody including herself would hate her  it was a sad prospect  the contemplation of it brought tears to anns eyes  he saw the justice of her complaint and promised to turn over a new leaf  he honestly meant to do so but like many another repentant sinner found himself feeble before the difficulties of performance he might have succeeded better had it not been for her soft deep eyes beneath her level brows  youre not much like your mother so he explained to her one day except about the eyes  looking into your eyes i can almost see your mother  he was smoking a pipe beside the fire and ann who ought to have been in bed had perched herself upon one of the arms of his chair and was kicking a hole in the worn leather with her little heels  she was very beautiful my mother wasnt she suggested ann  abner herrick blew a cloud from his pipe and watched carefully the curling smoke  in a way yes he answered  quite beautiful  what do you mean in a way demanded ann with some asperity  it was a spiritual beauty your mothers abner explained  the soul looking out of her eyes  i dont think it possible to imagine a more beautiful disposition than your mothers  whenever i think of your mother continued abner after a pause wordsworths lines always come into my mind  he murmured the quotation to himself but loud enough to be heard by sharp ears  miss kavanagh was mollified  you were in love with my mother werent you she questioned him kindly  yes i suppose i was mused abner still with his gaze upon the curling smoke  what do you mean by you suppose you were snapped ann  didnt you know  the tone recalled him from his dreams  i was in love with your mother very much he corrected himself turning to her with a smile  then why didnt you marry her asked ann  wouldnt she have you  i never asked her explained abner  why not persisted ann returning to asperity  he thought a moment  you wouldnt understand he told her  yes i would retorted ann  no you wouldnt he contradicted her quite shortly  they were both beginning to lose patience with one another  no woman ever could  im not a woman explained ann and im very smart  youve said so yourself  not so smart as all that growled abner  added to which its time for you to go to bed  her anger with him was such that it rendered her absolutely polite it had that occasional effect upon her  she slid from the arm of his chair and stood beside him a rigid figure of frozen femininity  i think you are quite right uncle herrick  good night  but at the door she could not resist a parting shot  you might have been my father and then perhaps she wouldnt have died  i think it was very wicked of you  after she was gone abner sat gazing into the fire and his pipe went out  eventually the beginnings of a smile stole to the corners of his mouth but before it could spread any farther he dismissed it with a sigh  abner for the next day or two feared a renewal of the conversation but ann appeared to have forgotten it and as time went by it faded from abners own memory  until one evening quite a while later  the morning had brought him his english mail  it had been arriving with some regularity and ann had noticed that abner always opened it before his other correspondence  one letter he read through twice and ann who was pretending to be reading the newspaper felt that he was looking at her  i have been thinking my dear said abner that it must be rather lonely for you here all by yourself  it would be answered ann if i were here all by myself  i mean said abner without any other young person to talk to andand to play with  you forget said ann that im nearly thirteen  god bless my soul said abner  how time does fly  who is she asked ann  it isnt a she explained abner  its a he poor little chap lost his mother two years ago and now his fathers dead  i thoughtit occurred to me we might put him up for a time  look after him a bit  what do you think  it would make the house more lively wouldnt it  it might said ann  she sat very silent and abner whose conscience was troubling him watched her a little anxiously  after a time she looked up  whats he like she asked  precisely what i am wondering myself confessed abner  we shall have to wait and see  but his motherhis mother repeated abner was the most beautiful woman i have ever known  if he is anything like she was as a girl  he left the sentence unfinished  you have not seen her sincesince she was young questioned ann  abner shook his head  she married an englishman  he took her back with him to london  i dont like englishmen said ann  they have their points suggested abner  besides boys take after their mothers they say  and abner rose and gathered his letters together  ann remained very thoughtful all that day  in the evening when abner for a moment laid down his pen for the purpose of relighting his pipe ann came to him seating herself on the corner of the desk  i suppose she said thats why you never married mother  abners mind at the moment was much occupied with the panama canal  what mother he asked  whose mother  my mother answered ann  i suppose men are like that  what are you talking about said abner dismissing altogether the panama canal  you loved my mother very much explained ann with cold deliberation she always made you think of wordsworths perfect woman  who told you all that demanded abner  you did  i did  it was the day you took me away from miss carews because she said she couldnt manage me ann informed him  good lord why that must be two years ago mused abner  three ann corrected him  all but a few days  i wish youd use your memory for things youre wanted to remember growled abner  you said you had never asked her to marry you pursued ann relentlessly you wouldnt tell me why  you said i shouldnt understand  my fault muttered abner  i forget youre a child  you ask all sorts of questions that never ought to enter your head and im fool enough to answer you  one small tear that had made its escape unnoticed by her was stealing down her cheek  he wiped it away and took one of her small paws in both his hands  i loved your mother very dearly he said gravely  i had loved her from a child  but no woman will ever understand the power that beauty has upon a man  you see were built that way  its natures lure later on of course i might have forgotten but then it was too late can you forgive me  but you still love her reasoned ann through her tears or you wouldnt want him to come here  she had such a hard time of it pleaded abner  it made things easier to her my giving her my word that i would always look after the boy  youll help me  ill try said ann  but there was not much promise in the tone  nor did matthew pole himself when he arrived do much to help matters he was so hopelessly english  at least that was the way ann put it he was shy and sensitive  it is a trying combination it made him appear stupid and conceited  a lonely childhood had rendered him unsociable unadaptable  a dreamy imaginative temperament imposed upon him long moods of silence  a liking for long solitary walks  for the first time ann and mrs travers were in agreement  a sulky young dog commented mrs travers  if i were your uncle id look out for a job for him in san francisco  you see said ann in excuse for him its such a foggy country england  it makes them like that  its a pity they cant get out of it said mrs travers  also sixteen is an awkward age for a boy  virtues still in the chrysalis state are struggling to escape from their parent vices pride an excellent quality making for courage and patience still appears in the swathings of arrogance  sincerity still expresses itself in the language of rudeness  kindness itself is apt to be mistaken for amazing impertinence and love of interference  it was kindnessa genuine desire to be useful that prompted him to point out to ann her undoubted faults and failings nerved him to the task of bringing her up in the way she should go  mrs travers had long since washed her hands of the entire business  uncle ab as matthew also called him had proved himself a weakling providence so it seemed to matthew must have been waiting impatiently for his advent  ann at first thought it was some new school of humour  when she found he was serious she set herself to cure him  but she never did  he was too conscientious for that the instincts of the guide philosopher and friend to humanity in general were already too strong in him  there were times when abner almost wished that matthew pole senior had lived a little longer  but he did not lose hope  at the back of his mind was the fancy that these two children of his loves would come together  nothing is quite so sentimental as a healthy old bachelor  he pictured them making unity from his confusions in imagination heard the patter on the stairs of tiny feet  to all intents and purposes he would be a grandfather  priding himself on his cunning he kept his dream to himself as he thought but underestimated anns smartness  for days together she would follow matthew with her eyes watching him from behind her long lashes listening in silence to everything he said vainly seeking to find points in him  he was unaware of her generous intentions  he had a vague feeling he was being criticised he resented it even in those days  i do try said ann suddenly one evening apropos of nothing at all no one will ever know how hard i try not to dislike him  abner looked up  sometimes continued ann i tell myself i have almost succeeded and then he will go and do something that will bring it all on again  what does he do asked abner  oh i cant tell you confessed ann  if i told you it would sound as if it was my fault  its all so silly  and then he thinks such a lot of himself  if one only knew why  he cant tell you himself when you ask him  you have asked him queried abner  i wanted to know explained ann  i thought there might be something in him that i could like  why do you want to like him asked abner wondering how much she had guessed  i know wailed ann  you are hoping that when i am grown up i shall marry him  and i dont want to  its so ungrateful of me  well youre not grown up yet abner consoled her  and so long as you are feeling like that about it im not likely to want you to marry him  it would make you so happy sobbed ann  yes but weve got to think of the boy dont forget that laughed abner  perhaps he might object  he would  i know he would cried ann with conviction  hes no better than i am  have you been asking him to demanded abner springing up from his chair  not to marry me explained ann  but i told him he must be an unnatural little beast not to try to like me when he knew how you loved me  helpful way of putting it growled abner  and what did he say to that  admitted it flashed ann indignantly  said he had tried  abner succeeded in persuading her that the path of dignity and virtue lay in her dismissing the whole subject from her mind  he had made a mistake so he told himself  age may be attracted by contrast but youth has no use for its opposite  he would send matthew away  he could return for weekends  continually so close to one another they saw only one anothers specks and flaws there is no beauty without perspective  matthew wanted the corners rubbed off him that was all  mixing more with men his priggishness would be laughed out of him  otherwise he was quite a decent youngster clean minded high principled  clever too  he often said quite unexpected things with approaching womanhood changes were taking place in ann  seeing her every day one hardly noticed them but there were times when standing before him flushed from a walk or bending over him to kiss him before starting for some friendly dance abner would blink his eyes and be puzzled  the thin arms were growing round and firm the sallow complexion warming into olive the once patchy mousecoloured hair darkening into a rich harmony of brown  the eyes beneath her level brows that had always been her charm still reminded abner of her mother but there was more light in them more danger  ill run down to albany and talk to jephson about him decided abner he can come home on saturdays  the plot might have succeeded  one never can tell  but a new york blizzard put a stop to it  the cars broke down and abner walking home in thin shoes from a meeting caught a chill which being neglected proved fatal  abner was troubled as he lay upon his bed  the children were sitting very silent by the window  he sent matthew out on a message and then beckoned ann to come to him  he loved the boy too but ann was nearer to him  you havent thought any more he whispered about  no answered ann  you wished me not to  you must never think he said to show your love for my memory by doing anything that would not make you happy  if i am anywhere around he continued with a smile it will be your good i shall be watching for not my own way  you will remember that  he had meant to do more for them but the end had come so much sooner than he had expected  to ann he left the house mrs travers had already retired on a small pension and a sum that judiciously invested the friend and attorney thought should be sufficient for her needs even supposingthe friend and attorney pausing to dwell upon the oval face with its dark eyes left the sentence unfinished  to matthew he wrote a loving letter enclosing a thousand dollars he knew that matthew now in a position to earn his living as a journalist would rather have taken nothing  it was to be looked upon merely as a parting gift  matthew decided to spend it on travel  it would fit him the better for his journalistic career so he explained to ann  but in his heart he had other ambitions  it would enable him to put them to the test  so there came an evening when ann stood waving a handkerchief as a great liner cast its moorings  she watched it till its lights grew dim and then returned to west twentieth street  strangers would take possession of it on the morrow  ann had her supper in the kitchen in company with the nurse who had stayed on at her request and that night slipping noiselessly from her room she lay upon the floor her head resting against the arm of the chair where abner had been wont to sit and smoke his evening pipe somehow it seemed to comfort her  and matthew the while beneath the stars was pacing the silent deck of the great liner and planning out the future  to only one other being had he ever confided his dreams  she lay in the churchyard and there was nothing left to encourage him but his own heart  but he had no doubts  he would be a great writer  his two hundred pounds would support him till he had gained a foothold after that he would climb swiftly  he had done right so he told himself to turn his back on journalism  the grave of literature he would see men and cities writing as he went  looking back years later he was able to congratulate himself on having chosen the right road  he thought it would lead him by easy ascent to fame and fortune  it did better for him than that  it led him through poverty and loneliness through hope deferred and heartachethrough long nights of fear when pride and confidence fell upon him leaving him only the courage to endure  his great poems his brilliant essays had been rejected so often that even he himself had lost all love for them  at the suggestion of an editor more kindly than the general run and urged by need he had written some short pieces of a less ambitious nature  it was in bitter disappointment he commenced them regarding them as mere potboilers he would not give them his name  he signed them aston rowant  it was the name of the village in oxfordshire where he had been born  it occurred to him by chance  it would serve the purpose as well as another  as the work progressed it grew upon him  he made his stories out of incidents and people he had seen everyday comedies and tragedies that he had lived among of things that he had felt and when after their appearance in the magazine a publisher was found willing to make them into a book hope revived in him  it was but shortlived  the few reviews that reached him contained nothing but ridicule  so he had no place even as a literary hack  he was living in paris at the time in a noisy evilsmelling street leading out of the quai saintmichel  he thought of chatterton and would loaf on the bridges looking down into the river where the drowned lights twinkled  and then one day there came to him a letter sent on to him from the publisher of his one book  it was signed sylvia nothing else and bore no address  matthew picked up the envelope  the postmark was london se  it was a childish letter  a prosperous wellfed genius familiar with such might have smiled at it  to matthew in his despair it brought healing  she had found the book lying in an empty railway carriage and undeterred by moral scruples had taken it home with her  it had remained forgotten for a time until when the end really seemed to have come her hand by chance had fallen on it  she fancied some kind little wandering spiritthe spirit perhaps of someone who had known what it was to be lonely and very sad and just about broken almostmust have manoeuvred the whole thing  it had seemed to her as though some strong and gentle hand had been laid upon her in the darkness  she no longer felt friendless  and so on  the book he remembered contained a reference to the magazine in which the sketches had first appeared  she would be sure to have noticed this  he would send her his answer  he drew his chair up to the flimsy table and all that night he wrote  he did not have to think  it came to him and for the first time since the beginning of things he had no fear of its not being accepted  it was mostly about himself and the rest was about her but to most of those who read it two months later it seemed to be about themselves the editor wrote a charming letter thanking him for it but at the time the chief thing that worried him was whether sylvia had seen it he waited anxiously for a few weeks and then received her second letter  it was a more womanly letter than the first  she had understood the story and her words of thanks almost conveyed to him the flush of pleasure with which she had read it his friendship she confessed would be very sweet to her and still more delightful the thought that he had need of her  that she also had something to give she would write as he wished her real thoughts and feelings  they would never know one another and that would give her boldness  they would be comrades meeting only in dreamland  in this way commenced the whimsical romance of sylvia and aston rowant for it was too late now to change the nameit had become a name to conjure with  the stories poems and essays followed now in regular succession  the anxiously expected letters reached him in orderly procession  they grew in interest in helpfulness  they became the letters of a wonderfully sane broadminded thoughtful womana woman of insight of fine judgment  their praise was rare enough to be precious  often they would contain just criticism tempered by sympathy lightened by humour  of her troubles sorrows fears she came to write less and less and even then not until they were past and she could laugh at them  the subtlest flattery she gave him was the suggestion that he had taught her to put these things into their proper place  intimate selfrevealing as her letters were it was curious he never shaped from them any satisfactory image of the writer  a brave kind tender woman  a selfforgetting quicklyforgiving woman  a manysided woman responding to joy to laughter  a merry lady at times  yet by no means a perfect woman  there could be flashes of temper one felt that quite often occasional unreasonableness a tongue that could be cutting  a sweet restful greatly loving woman but still a woman  it would be wise to remember that  so he read her from her letters  but herself the eyes and hair and lips of her the voice and laugh and smile of her the hands and feet of her always they eluded him   he was in alaska one spring where he had gone to collect material for his work when he received the last letter she ever wrote him they neither of them knew then it would be the last  she was leaving london so the postscript informed him sailing on the following saturday for new york where for the future she intended to live  it worried him that postscript  he could not make out for a long time why it worried him  suddenly in a waste of endless snows the explanation flashed across him  sylvia of the letters was a living woman  she could travelwith a box he supposed possibly with two or three and parcels  could take tickets walk up a gangway stagger about a deck feeling maybe a little seasick  all these years he had been living with her in dreamland she had been if he had only known it a miss somebodyorother who must have stood every morning in front of a lookingglass with hairpins in her mouth  he had never thought of her doing these things it shocked him  he could not help feeling it was indelicate of hercoming to life in this sudden uncalledfor manner  he struggled with this new conception of her and had almost forgiven her when a further and still more startling suggestion arrived to plague him  if she really lived why should he not see her speak to her  so long as she had remained in her hidden temple situate in the vague recesses of london se her letters had contented him  but now that she had moved now that she was no longer a voice but a woman well it would be interesting to see what she was like  he imagined the introduction  miss somebodyorother allow me to present you to mr matthew pole  she would have no idea he was aston rowant  if she happened to be young beautiful in all ways satisfactory he would announce himself  how astonished how delighted she would be  but if not  if she were elderly plain  the wisest wittiest of women have been known to have an incipient moustache  a beautiful spirit can and sometimes does look out of goggle eyes  suppose she suffered from indigestion and had a shiny nose  would her letters ever again have the same charm for him  absurd that they should not  but would they  the risk was too great  giving the matter long and careful consideration he decided to send her back into dreamland  but somehow she would not go back into dreamland would persist in remaining in new york a living breathing woman  yet even so how could he find her  he might say in a poem convey to her his desire for a meeting  would she comply  and if she did what would be his position supposing the inspection to result unfavourably for her  could he in effect say to her  thank you for letting me have a look at you that is all i wanted  goodbye  she must she should remain in dreamland  he would forget her postscript in future throw her envelopes unglanced at into the wastepaper basket  having by this simple exercise of his will replaced her in london he himself started for new yorkon his way back to europe so he told himself  still being in new york there was no reason for not lingering there a while if merely to renew old memories  of course if he had really wanted to find sylvia it would have been easy from the date upon the envelope to have discovered the ship sailing the following saturday  passengers were compelled to register their names in full and to state their intended movements after arrival in america  sylvia was not a common christian name by the help of a fivedollar bill or two  the idea had not occurred to him before  he dismissed it from his mind and sought a quiet hotel up town   new york was changed less than he had anticipated  west twentieth street in particular was precisely as leaning out of the cab window he had looked back upon it ten years ago  business had more and more taken possession of it but had not as yet altered its appearance  his conscience smote him as he turned the corner that he had never once written to ann  he had meant to it goes without saying but during those first years of struggle and failure his pride had held him back she had always thought him a fool he had felt she did  he would wait till he could write to her of success of victory  and then when it had slowly almost imperceptibly arrived  he wondered why he never had  quite a nice little girl in some respects  if only she had been less conceited less selfwilled  also rather a pretty girl she had shown signs of becoming  there were times  he remembered an evening before the lamps were lighted  she had fallen asleep curled up in abners easy chair one small hand resting upon the arm  she had always had quite attractive handsa little too thin  something had moved him to steal across softly without waking her  he smiled at the memory  and then her eyes beneath the level brows  it was surprising how ann was coming back to him  perhaps they would be able to tell him the people of the house what had become of her  if they were decent people they would let him wander round a while  he would explain that he had lived there in abner herricks time  the room where they had sometimes been agreeable to one another while abner pretending to read had sat watching them out of the corner of an eye  he would like to sit there for a few moments by himself  he forgot that he had rung the bell  a very young servant had answered the door and was staring at him  he would have walked in if the small servant had not planted herself deliberately in his way  it recalled him to himself  i beg pardon said matthew but would you please tell me who lives here  the small servant looked him up and down with growing suspicion  miss kavanagh lives here she said  what do you want  the surprise was so great it rendered him speechless  in another moment the small servant would have slammed the door  miss ann kavanagh he inquired just in time  thats her name admitted the small servant less suspicious  will you please tell her mr polemr matthew pole he requested  ill see first if she is in said the small servant and shut the door  it gave matthew a few minutes to recover himself for which he was glad  then the door opened again suddenly  you are to come upstairs said the small servant  it sounded so like ann that it quite put him at his ease  he followed the small servant up the stairs  mr matthew pole she announced severely and closed the door behind him  ann was standing by the window and came to meet him  it was in front of abners empty chair that they shook hands  so you have come back to the old house said matthew  yes she answered  it never let well  the last people who had it gave it up at christmas  it seemed the best thing to do even from a purely economical point of view  what have you been doing all these years she asked him  oh knocking about he answered  earning my living  he was curious to discover what she thought of matthew first of all  it seems to have agreed with you she commented with a glance that took him in generally including his clothes  yes he answered  i have had more luck than perhaps i deserved  i am glad of that said ann  he laughed  so you havent changed so very much he said except in appearance  isnt that the most important part of a woman suggested ann  yes he answered thinking  i suppose it is  she was certainly very beautiful  how long are you stopping in new york she asked him  oh not long he explained  dont leave it for another ten years she said before letting me know what is happening to you  we didnt get on very well together as children but we mustnt let him think were not friends  it would hurt him  she spoke quite seriously as if she were expecting him any moment to open the door and join them  involuntarily matthew glanced round the room  nothing seemed altered  the worn carpet the faded curtains abners easy chair his pipe upon the corner of the mantelpiece beside the vase of spills  it is curious he said finding this vein of fancy of tenderness in you  i always regarded you as such a practical unsentimental young person  perhaps we neither of us knew each other too well in those days she answered  the small servant entered with the tea  what have you been doing with yourself he asked drawing his chair up to the table  she waited till the small servant had withdrawn  oh knocking about she answered  earning my living  it seems to have agreed with you he repeated smiling  its all right now she answered  it was a bit of a struggle at first  yes he agreed  life doesnt temper the wind to the human lamb but was there any need in your case he asked  i thought  oh that all went she explained  except the house  im sorry said matthew  i didnt know  oh we have been a couple of pigs she laughed replying to his thoughts  i did sometimes think of writing you  i kept the address you gave me  not for any assistance i wanted to fight it out for myself  but i was a bit lonely  why didnt you he asked  she hesitated for a moment  its rather soon to make up ones mind she said but you seem to me to have changed  your voice sounds so different  but as a boywell you were a bit of a prig werent you  i imagined you writing me good advice and excellent short sermons  and it wasnt that that i was wanting  i think i understand he said  im glad you got through  what is your line he asked  journalism  no she answered  too selfopinionated  she opened a bureau that had always been her own and handed him a programme  miss ann kavanagh contralto was announced on it as one of the chief attractions  i didnt know you had a voice said matthew  you used to complain of it she reminded him  your speaking voice he corrected her  and it wasnt the quality of that i objected to  it was the quantity  she laughed  yes we kept ourselves pretty busy bringing one another up she admitted  they talked a while longer  of abner and his kind quaint ways of old friends  ann had lost touch with most of them  she had studied singing in brussels and afterwards her master had moved to london and she had followed him  she had only just lately returned to new york  the small servant entered to clear away the tea things  she said she thought that ann had rung  her tone implied that anyhow it was time she had  matthew rose and ann held out her hand  i shall be at the concert he said  it isnt till next week ann reminded him  oh im not in any particular hurry said matthew  are you generally in of an afternoon  sometimes said ann   he thought as he sat watching her from his stall that she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen  her voice was not great she had warned him not to expect too much  it will never set the thames on fire she had said  i thought at first that it would  but such as it is i thank god for it  it was worth that  it was sweet and clear and had a tender quality  matthew waited for her at the end  she was feeling well disposed towards all creatures and accepted his suggestion of supper with gracious condescension  he had called on her once or twice during the preceding days  it was due to her after his long neglect of her he told himself and had found improvement in her  but tonight she seemed to take a freakish pleasure in letting him see that there was much of the old ann still left in her  the frank conceit of her the amazing selfopinionatedness of her the waywardness the wilfulness the unreasonableness of her the general uppishness and dictatorialness of her the contradictoriness and flat impertinence of her the swift temper and exasperating tongue of her  it was almost as if she were warning him  you see i am not changed except as you say in appearance  i am still ann with all the old faults and failings that once made life in the same house with me a constant trial to you  just now my very imperfections appear charms you have been looking at the sunat the glory of my face at the wonder of my arms and hands  your eyes are blinded but that will pass  and underneath i am still ann  just ann  they had quarrelled in the cab on the way home  he forgot what it was about but ann had said some quite rude things and her face not being there in the darkness to excuse her it had made him very angry  she had laughed again on the steps and they had shaken hands  but walking home through the still streets sylvia had plucked at his elbow  what fools we mortals beespecially men  here was a noble womana restful understanding tenderly loving woman a woman as nearly approaching perfection as it was safe for a woman to go  this marvellous woman was waiting for him with outstretched arms why should he doubt itand just because nature had at last succeeded in making a temporary success of anns skin and had fashioned a rounded line above her shoulderblade  it made him quite cross with himself  ten years ago she had been gawky and sallowcomplexioned ten years hence she might catch the yellow jaundice and lose it all passages in sylvias letters returned to him  he remembered that faroff evening in his paris attic when she had knocked at his door with her great gift of thanks  recalled how her soft shadow hand had stilled his pain  he spent the next two days with sylvia  he reread all her letters lived again the scenes and moods in which he had replied to them  her personality still defied the efforts of his imagination but he ended by convincing himself that he would know her when he saw her but counting up the women on fifth avenue towards whom he had felt instinctively drawn and finding that the number had already reached eleven began to doubt his intuition  on the morning of the third day he met ann by chance in a booksellers shop  her back was towards him she was glancing through aston rowants latest volume  what i said the cheerful young lady who was attending to her like about him is that he understands women so well  what i like about him said ann is that he doesnt pretend to  theres something in that agreed the cheerful young lady  they say hes here in new york  ann looked up  so ive been told said the cheerful young lady  i wonder what hes like said ann  he wrote for a long time under another name volunteered the cheerful young lady  hes quite an elderly man  it irritated matthew  he spoke without thinking  no he isnt he said  hes quite young  the ladies turned and looked at him  you know him queried ann  she was most astonished and appeared disbelieving  that irritated him further  if you care about it he said  i will introduce you to him  ann made no answer  he bought a copy of the book for himself and they went out together  they turned towards the park  ann seemed thoughtful  what is he doing here in new york she wondered  looking for a lady named sylvia answered matthew  he thought the time was come to break it to her that he was a great and famous man  then perhaps she would be sorry she had said what she had said in the cab  seeing he had made up his mind that his relationship to her in the future would be that of an affectionate brother there would be no harm in also letting her know about sylvia  that also might be good for her  they walked two blocks before ann spoke  matthew anticipating a pleasurable conversation felt no desire to hasten matters  how intimate are you with him she demanded  i dont think he would have said that to a mere acquaintance  im not a mere acquaintance said matthew  ive known him a long time  you never told me complained ann  didnt know it would interest you replied matthew  he waited for further questions but they did not come  at thirtyfourth street he saved her from being run over and killed and again at fortysecond street  just inside the park she stopped abruptly and held out her hand  tell him she replied that if he is really serious about finding sylvia i mayi dont say i canbut i may be able to help him  he did not take her hand but stood stock still in the middle of the path and stared at her  you he said  you know her  she was prepared for his surprise  she was also preparednot with a lie that implies evil intention  her only object was to have a talk with the gentleman and see what he was like before deciding on her future proceedingslet us say with a plausible story  we crossed on the same boat she said  we found there was a good deal in common between us  sheshe told me things  when you came to think it out it was almost the truth  what is she like demanded matthew  oh justwell not exactly  it was an awkward question  there came to her relief the reflection that there was really no need for her to answer it  whats it got to do with you she said  i am aston rowant said matthew  the central park together with the universe in general fell away and disappeared  somewhere out of chaos was sounding a plaintive voice what is she like  cant you tell me  is she young or old  it seemed to have been going on for ages  she made one supreme gigantic effort causing the central park to reappear dimly faintly but it was there again  she was sitting on a seat matthewaston rowant whatever it waswas seated beside her  youve seen her  what is she like  i cant tell you  he was evidently very cross with her  it seemed so unkind of him  why cant you tell meor why wont you tell me  do you mean shes too awful for words  no certainly notas a matter of fact  well what  she felt she must get away or there would be hysterics somewhere she sprang up and began to walk rapidly towards the gate  he followed her  ill write you said ann  but why  i cant said ann  ive got a rehearsal  a car was passing  she made a dash for it and clambered on  before he could make up his mind it had gathered speed  ann let herself in with her key  she called downstairs to the small servant that she wasnt to be disturbed for anything  she locked the door  so it was to matthew that for six years she had been pouring out her inmost thoughts and feelings  it was to matthew that she had laid bare her tenderest most sacred dreams  it was at matthews feet that for six years she had been sitting gazing up with respectful admiration with reverential devotion  she recalled her letters almost passage for passage till she had to hold her hands to her face to cool it her indignation one might almost say fury lasted till teatime  in the eveningit was in the evening time that she had always written to hima more reasonable frame of mind asserted itself after all it was hardly his fault  he couldnt have known who she was  he didnt know now  she had wanted to write  without doubt he had helped her comforted her loneliness had given her a charming friendship a delightful comradeship  much of his work had been written for her to her  it was fine work  she had been proud of her share in it  even allowing there were faultsirritability shortness of temper a tendency to bossinessunderneath it all was a man  the gallant struggle the difficulties overcome the long suffering the high courageall that she reading between the lines had divined of his lifes battle  yes it was a man she had worshipped  a woman need not be ashamed of that  as matthew he had seemed to her conceited priggish  as aston rowant she wondered at his modesty his patience  and all these years he had been dreaming of her had followed her to new york had  there came a sudden mood so ludicrous so absurdly unreasonable that ann herself stopped to laugh at it  yet it was real and it hurt he had come to new york thinking of sylvia yearning for sylvia  he had come to new york with one desire  to find sylvia  and the first pretty woman that had come across his path had sent sylvia clean out of his head  there could be no question of that  when ann kavanagh stretched out her hand to him in that very room a fortnight ago he had stood before her dazzled captured  from that moment sylvia had been tossed aside and forgotten  ann kavanagh could have done what she liked with him  she had quarrelled with him that evening of the concert  she had meant to quarrel with him  and then for the first time he had remembered sylvia  that was her rewardsylvias  it was sylvia she was thinking offor six years devoted friendship for the help the inspiration she had given him  as sylvia she suffered from a very genuine and explainable wave of indignant jealousy  as ann she admitted he ought not to have done it but felt there was excuse for him  between the two she feared her mind would eventually give way  on the morning of the second day she sent matthew a note asking him to call in the afternoon sylvia might be there or she might not  she would mention it to her  she dressed herself in a quiet darkcoloured frock  it seemed uncommittal and suitable to the occasion  it also happened to be the colour that best suited her  she would not have the lamps lighted  matthew arrived in a dark serge suit and a blue necktie so that the general effect was quiet  ann greeted him with kindliness and put him with his face to what little light there was  she chose for herself the windowseat  sylvia had not arrived  she might be a little latethat is if she came at all  they talked about the weather for a while  matthew was of opinion they were going to have some rain  ann who was in one of her contradictory moods thought there was frost in the air  what did you say to her he asked  sylvia  oh what you told me replied ann  that you had come to new york toto look for her  what did she say he asked  said youd taken your time about it retorted ann  matthew looked up with an injured expression  it was her own idea that we should never meet he explained  um ann grunted  what do you think yourself she will be like she continued  have you formed any notion  it is curious he replied  i have never been able to conjure up any picture of her until just now  why just now demanded ann  i had an idea i should find her here when i opened the door he answered  you were standing in the shadow  it seemed to be just what i had expected  you would have been satisfied she asked  yes he said  there was silence for a moment  uncle ab made a mistake he continued  he ought to have sent me away  let me come home now and then  you mean said ann that if you had seen less of me you might have liked me better  quite right he admitted  we never see the things that are always there  a thin gawky girl with a bad complexion she suggested  would it have been of any use  you must always have been wonderful with those eyes he answered and your hands were beautiful even then  i used to cry sometimes when i looked at myself in the glass as a child she confessed  my hands were the only thing that consoled me  i kissed them once he told her  you were asleep curled up in uncle abs chair  i wasnt asleep said ann  she was seated with one foot tucked underneath her  she didnt look a bit grown up  you always thought me a fool he said  it used to make me so angry with you said ann that you seemed to have no go no ambition in you  i wanted you to wake updo something if i had known you were a budding genius  i did hint it to you said he  oh of course it was all my fault said ann  he rose  you think she means to come he asked  ann also had risen  is she so very wonderful she asked  i may be exaggerating to myself he answered  but i am not sure that i could go on with my work without hernot now  you forgot her flashed ann till we happened to quarrel in the cab  i often do he confessed  till something goes wrong  then she comes to me  as she did on that first evening six years ago  you see i have been more or less living with her since then he added with a smile  in dreamland ann corrected  yes but in my case he answered the best part of my life is passed in dreamland  and when you are not in dreamland she demanded  when youre just irritable shorttempered cranky matthew pole  whats she going to do about you then  shell put up with me said matthew  no she wont said ann  shell snap your head off  most of the putting up with youll have to do  he tried to get between her and the window but she kept her face close to the pane  you make me tired with sylvia she said  its about time you did know what shes like  shes just the commonplace shorttempered disagreeableifshedoesntgetherownway unreasonable woman only more so  he drew her away from the window by brute force  so youre sylvia he said  i thought that would get it into your head said ann  it was not at all the way she had meant to break it to him  she had meant the conversation to be chiefly about sylvia  she had a high opinion of sylvia a much higher opinion than she had of ann kavanagh if he proved to be worthy of herof sylvia that is then with the whimsical smile that she felt belonged to sylvia she would remark quite simply well what have you got to say to her  what had happened to interfere with the programme was ann kavanagh it seemed that ann kavanagh had disliked matthew pole less than she had thought she did  it was after he had sailed away that little ann kavanagh had discovered this  if only he had shown a little more interest in a little more appreciation of ann kavanagh  he could be kind and thoughtful in a patronising sort of way  even that would not have mattered if there had been any justification for his airs of superiority  ann kavanagh who ought to have taken a back seat on this occasion had persisted in coming to the front  it was so like her  well she said what are you going to say to her  she did get it in after all  i was going said matthew to talk to her about art and literature touching maybe upon a few other subjects  also i might have suggested our seeing each other again once or twice just to get better acquainted  and then i was going away  why going away asked ann  to see if i could forget you  she turned to him  the fading light was full upon her face  i dont believe you couldagain she said  no he agreed  im afraid i couldnt  youre sure theres nobody else said ann that youre in love with only us two  only you two he said  she was standing with her hand on old abners empty chair  youve got to choose she said  she was trembling  her voice sounded just a little hard  he came and stood beside her  i want ann he said  she held out her hand to him  im so glad you said ann she laughed     the fawn gloves  always he remembered her as he saw her first  the little spiritual face the little brown shoes pointed downwards their toes just touching the ground the little fawn gloves folded upon her lap  he was not conscious of having noticed her with any particular attention a plainly dressed childishlooking figure alone on a seat between him and the setting sun  even had he felt curious his shyness would have prevented his deliberately running the risk of meeting her eyes  yet immediately he had passed her he saw her again quite clearly  the pale oval face the brown shoes and between them the little fawn gloves folded one over the other  all down the broad walk and across primrose hill he saw her silhouetted against the sinking sun  at least that much of her  the wistful face and the trim brown shoes and the little folded hands until the sun went down behind the high chimneys of the brewery beyond swiss cottage and then she faded  she was there again the next evening precisely in the same place usually he walked home by the hampstead road  only occasionally when the beauty of the evening tempted him would he take the longer way by regent street and through the park  but so often it made him feel sad the quiet park forcing upon him the sense of his own loneliness  he would walk down merely as far as the great vase so he arranged with himself  if she were not thereit was not likely that she would behe would turn back into albany street  the newsvendors shops with their display of the cheaper illustrated papers the secondhand furniture dealers with their faded engravings and old prints would give him something to look at to take away his thoughts from himself but seeing her in the distance almost the moment he had entered the gate it came to him how disappointed he would have been had the seat in front of the red tulip bed been vacant  a little away from her he paused turning to look at the flowers  he thought that waiting his opportunity he might be able to steal a glance at her undetected once for a moment he did so but venturing a second time their eyes met or he fancied they did and blushing furiously he hurried past but again she came with him or rather preceded him  on each empty seat between him and the sinking sun he saw her quite plainly  the pale oval face and the brown shoes and between them the fawn gloves folded one upon the other  only this evening about the small sensitive mouth there seemed to be hovering just the faintest suggestion of a timid smile  and this time she lingered with him past queens crescent and the malden road till he turned into carlton street  it was dark in the passage and he had to grope his way up the stairs but with his hand on the door of the bedsitting room on the third floor he felt less afraid of the solitude that would rise to meet him  all day long in the dingy back office in abingdon street westminster where from ten to six each day he sat copying briefs and petitions he thought over what he would say to her tactful beginnings by means of which he would slide into conversation with her  up portland place he would rehearse them to himself  but at cambridge gate when the little fawn gloves came in view the words would run away to join him again maybe at the gate into the chester road leaving him meanwhile to pass her with stiff hurried steps and eyes fixed straight in front of him and so it might have continued but that one evening she was no longer at her usual seat a crowd of noisy children swarmed over it and suddenly it seemed to him as if the trees and flowers had all turned drab  a terror gnawed at his heart and he hurried on more for the need of movement than with any definite object  and just beyond a bed of geraniums that had hidden his view she was seated on a chair and stopping with a jerk absolutely in front of her he said quite angrily  oh there you are  which was not a bit the speech with which he had intended to introduce himself but served his purpose just as wellperhaps better  she did not resent his words or the tone  it was the children she explained  they wanted to play so i thought i would come on a little farther  upon which as a matter of course he took the chair beside her and it did not occur to either of them that they had not known one another since the beginning when between st johns wood and albany street god planted a garden  each evening they would linger there listening to the pleading passion of the blackbirds note the thrushs call to joy and hope he loved her gentle ways  from the bold challenges the sly glances of invitation flashed upon him in the street or from some neighbouring table in the cheap luncheon room he had always shrunk confused and awkward  her shyness gave him confidence  it was she who was half afraid whose eyes would fall beneath his gaze who would tremble at his touch giving him the delights of manly dominion of tender authority  it was he who insisted on the aristocratic seclusion afforded by the private chair who with the careless indifference of a man to whom pennies were unimportant would pay for them both  once on his way through piccadilly circus he had paused by the fountain to glance at a great basket of lilies of the valley struck suddenly by the thought how strangely their little pale petals seemed suggestive of her  ere y are honey  her favourite flower cried the girl with a grin holding a bunch towards him  how much he had asked vainly trying to keep the blood from rushing to his face  the girl paused a moment a coarse kindly creature  sixpence she demanded and he bought them  she had meant to ask him a shilling and knew he would have paid it  same as silly fool she called herself as she pocketed the money  he gave them to her with a fine lordly air and watched her while she pinned them to her blouse and a squirrel halting in the middle of the walk watched her also with his head on one side wondering what was the good of them that she should store them with so much care  she did not thank him in words but there were tears in her eyes when she turned her face to his and one of the little fawn gloves stole out and sought his hand  he took it in both his and would have held it but she withdrew it almost hurriedly  they appealed to him her gloves in spite of their being old and much mended and he was glad they were of kid  had they been of cotton such as girls of her class usually wore the thought of pressing his lips to them would have put his teeth on edge  he loved the little brown shoes that must have been expensive when new for they still kept their shape  and the fringe of dainty petticoat always so spotless and with never a tear and the neat plain stockings that showed below the closely fitting frock  so often he had noticed girls showily extravagantly dressed but with red bare hands and sloppy shoes  handsome girls some of them attractive enough if you were not of a finicking nature to whom the little accessories are almost of more importance than the whole  he loved her voice so different from the strident tones that every now and then as some couple laughing and talking passed them would fall upon him almost like a blow her quick graceful movements that always brought back to his memory the vision of hill and stream  in her little brown shoes and gloves and the frock which was also of a shade of brown though darker she was strangely suggestive to him of a fawn the gentle look the swift soft movements that have taken place before they are seen the haunting suggestion of fear never quite conquered as if the little nervous limbs were always ready for sudden flight  he called her that one day  neither of them had ever thought to ask one anothers names it did not seem to matter  my little brown fawn he had whispered i am always expecting you to suddenly dig your little heels into the ground and spring away and she had laughed and drawn a little closer to him  and even that was just the movement of a fawn  he had known them creeping near to them upon the hillsides when he was a child  there was much in common between them so they found  though he could claim a few distant relatives scattered about the north they were both for all practical purposes alone in the world  to her also home meant a bedsitting roomover there as she indicated with a wave of the little fawn glove embracing the northwest district generally and he did not press her for any more precise address  it was easy enough for him to picture it  the mean closesmelling street somewhere in the neighbourhood of lisson grove or farther on towards the harrow road  always he preferred to say goodbye to her at some point in the outer circle with its peaceful vista of fine trees and stately houses watching her little fawnlike figure fading away into the twilight  no friend or relative had she ever known except the pale girlishlooking mother who had died soon after they had come to london the elderly landlady had let her stay on helping in the work of the house and when even this last refuge had failed her wellmeaning folk had interested themselves and secured her employment  it was light and fairly well paid but there were objections to it so he gathered more from her halting silences than from what she said  she had tried for a time to find something else but it was so difficult without help or resources  there was nothing really to complain about it except and then she paused with a sudden clasp of the gloved hands and seeing the troubled look in her eyes he had changed the conversation  it did not matter he would take her away from it  it was very sweet to him the thought of putting a protective arm about this little fragile creature whose weakness gave him strength  he was not always going to be a clerk in an office  he was going to write poetry books plays  already he had earned a little  he told her of his hopes and her great faith in him gave him new courage  one evening finding a seat where few people ever passed he read to her  and she had understood  all unconsciously she laughed in the right places and when his own voice trembled and he found it difficult to continue for the lump in his own throat glancing at her he saw the tears were in her eyes  it was the first time he had tasted sympathy  and so spring grew to summer  and then one evening a great thing happened  he could not make out at first what it was about her some little added fragrance that made itself oddly felt while she herself seemed to be conscious of increased dignity  it was not until he took her hand to say goodbye that he discovered it  there was something different about the feel of her and looking down at the little hand that lay in his he found the reason  she had on a pair of new gloves they were still of the same fawn colour but so smooth and soft and cool  they fitted closely without a wrinkle displaying the slightness and the gracefulness of the hands beneath the twilight had almost faded and save for the broad back of a disappearing policeman they had the outer circle to themselves and the sudden impulse coming to him he dropped on one knee as they do in plays and story books and sometimes elsewhere and pressed the little fawn gloves to his lips in a long passionate kiss  the sound of approaching footsteps made him rise hurriedly she did not move but her whole body was trembling and in her eyes was a look that was almost of fear  the approaching footsteps came nearer but a bend of the road still screened them swiftly and in silence she put her arms about his neck and kissed him it was a strange cold kiss but almost fierce and then without a word she turned and walked away and he watched her to the corner of hanover gate but she did not look back  it was almost as if it had raised a barrier between them that kiss the next evening she came to meet him with a smile as usual but in her eyes was still that odd suggestion of lurking fear and when seated beside her he put his hand on hers it seemed to him she shrank away from him  it was an unconscious movement  it brought back to him that haunting memory of hill and stream when some softeyed fawn strayed from her fellows would let him approach quite close to her and then when he put out his hand to caress her would start away with a swift quivering movement  do you always wear gloves he asked her one evening a little later  yes she answered speaking low when im out of doors  but this is not out of doors he had pleaded  we have come into the garden  wont you take them off  she had looked at him from under bent brows as if trying to read him she did not answer him then  but on the way out on the last seat close to the gate she had sat down motioning him to sit beside her quietly she unbuttoned the fawn gloves drew each one off and laid them aside  and then for the first time he saw her hands  had he looked at her seen the faint hope die out the mute agony in the quiet eyes watching him he would have tried to hide the disgust the physical repulsion that showed itself so plainly in his face in the involuntary movement with which he drew away from her they were small and shapely with rounded curves but raw and seared as with hot irons with a growth of red angrycoloured warts and the nails all worn away  i ought to have shown them to you before she said simply as she drew the gloves on again  it was silly of me  i ought to have known  he tried to comfort her but his phrases came meaningless and halting  it was the work she explained as they walked on  it made your hands like that after a time  if only she could have got out of it earlier but now  it was no good worrying about it now  they parted near to the hanover gate but tonight he did not stand watching her as he had always done till she waved a last goodbye to him just before disappearing so whether she turned or not he never knew  he did not go to meet her the next evening  a dozen times his footsteps led him unconsciously almost to the gate  then he would hurry away again pace the mean streets jostling stupidly against the passersby  the pale sweet face the little nymphlike figure the little brown shoes kept calling to him  if only there would pass away the horror of those hands  all the artist in him shuddered at the memory of them  always he had imagined them under the neat smooth gloves as fitting in with all the rest of her dreaming of the time when he would hold them in his own caressing them kissing them would it be possible to forget them to reconcile oneself to them  he must thinkmust get away from these crowded streets where faces seemed to grin at him  he remembered that parliament had just risen that work was slack in the office he would ask that he might take his holiday nowthe next day  and they had agreed  he packed a few things into a knapsack  from the voices of the hills and streams he would find counsel  he took no count of his wanderings  one evening at a lonely inn he met a young doctor  the innkeepers wife was expecting to be taken with child that night and the doctor was waiting downstairs till summoned while they were talking the idea came to him  why had he not thought of it  overcoming his shyness he put his questions what work would it be that would cause such injuries  he described them seeing them before him in the shadows of the dimly lighted room those poor pitiful little hands  oh a dozen things might account for itthe doctors voice sounded callousthe handling of flax even of linen under certain conditions chemicals entered so much nowadays into all sorts of processes and preparations  all this new photography cheap colour printing dyeing and cleaning metal work  might all be avoided by providing rubber gloves  it ought to be made compulsory  the doctor seemed inclined to hold forth  he interrupted him  but could it be cured  was there any hope  cured  hope  of course it could be cured  it was only localthe effect being confined to the hands proved that  a poisoned condition of the skin aggravated by general poverty of blood  take her away from it let her have plenty of fresh air and careful diet using some such simple ointment or another as any local man seeing them would prescribe and in three or four months they would recover  he could hardly stay to thank the young doctor  he wanted to get away by himself to shout to wave his arms to leap  had it been possible he would have returned that very night  he cursed himself for the fancifulness that had prevented his inquiring her address he could have sent a telegram  rising at dawn for he had not attempted to sleep he walked the ten miles to the nearest railway station and waited for the train  all day long it seemed to creep with him through the endless country  but london came at last  it was still the afternoon but he did not care to go to his room leaving his knapsack at the station he made his way to westminster he wanted all things to be unchanged so that between this evening and their parting it might seem as if there had merely passed an ugly dream and timing himself he reached the park just at their usual hour  he waited till the gates were closed but she did not come  all day long at the back of his mind had been that fear but he had driven it away  she was ill just a headache or merely tired  and the next evening he told himself the same  he dared not whisper to himself anything else  and each succeeding evening again  he never remembered how many  for a time he would sit watching the path by which she had always come and when the hour was long past he would rise and walk towards the gate look east and west and then return one evening he stopped one of the parkkeepers and questioned him yes the man remembered her quite well  the young lady with the fawn gloves  she had come once or twicemaybe oftener the parkkeeper could not be sureand had waited  no there had been nothing to show that she was in any way upset  she had just sat there for a time now and then walking a little way and then coming back again until the closing hour and then she had gone  he left his address with the parkkeeper  the man promised to let him know if he ever saw her there again  sometimes instead of the park he would haunt the mean streets about lisson grove and far beyond the other side of the edgware road pacing them till night fell  but he never found her  he wondered beating against the bars of his poverty if money would have helped him  but the grim endless city hiding its million secrets seemed to mock the thought  a few pounds he had scraped together he spent in advertisements but he expected no response and none came  it was not likely she would see them  and so after a time the park and even the streets round about it became hateful to him and he moved away to another part of london hoping to forget  but he never quite succeeded  always it would come back to him when he was not thinking  the broad quiet walk with its prim trees and gay beds of flowers  and always he would see her seated there framed by the fading light  at least that much of her  the little spiritual face and the brown shoes pointing downwards and between them the little fawn gloves folded upon her lap
