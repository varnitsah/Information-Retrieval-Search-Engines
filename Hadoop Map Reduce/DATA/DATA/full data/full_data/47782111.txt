47782111	toby tyler  or  ten weeks with a circus  by james otis     i tobys introduction to the circus   wouldnt you give more n six peanuts for a cent was a question asked by a very small boy with big staring eyes of a candy vender at a circus booth and as he spoke he looked wistfully at the quantity of nuts piled high up on the basket and then at the six each of which now looked so small as he held them in his hand  couldnt do it was the reply of the proprietor of the booth as he put the boys penny carefully away in the drawer  the little fellow looked for another moment at his purchase and then carefully cracked the largest one  a shadeand a very deep shade it wasof disappointment passed over his face and then looking up anxiously he asked dont you swap em when theyre bad  the mans face looked as if a smile had been a stranger to it for a long time but one did pay it a visit just then and he tossed the boy two nuts and asked him a question at the same time what is your name  the big brown eyes looked up for an instant as if to learn whether the question was asked in good faith and then their owner said as he carefully picked apart another nut toby tyler  well thats a queer name  yes i spose so myself but you see i dont expect thats the name that belongs to me but the fellers call me so an so does uncle danl  who is uncle daniel was the next question in the absence of other customers the man seemed disposed to get as much amusement out of the boy as possible  he haint my uncle at all i only call him so because all the boys do an i live with him  wheres your father and mother  i dont know said toby rather carelessly i dont know much about em an uncle danl says they dont know much about me heres another bad nut goin to give me two more  the two nuts were given him and he said as he put them in his pocket and turned over and over again those which he held in his hand i shouldnt wonder if all of these was bad sposen you give me two for each one of em before i crack em an then they wont be spoiled so you cant sell em again  as this offer of barter was made the man looked amused and he asked as he counted out the number which toby desired if i give you these i suppose youll want me to give you two more for each one and youll keep that kind of a trade going until you get my whole stock  i wont open my head if every one of ems bad  all right you can keep what youve got and ill give you these besides but i dont want you to buy any more for i dont want to do that kind of business  toby took the nuts offered not in the least abashed and seated himself on a convenient stone to eat them and at the same time to see all that was going on around him the coming of a circus to the little town of guilford was an event and toby had hardly thought of anything else since the highly colored posters had first been put up it was yet quite early in the morning and the tents were just being erected by the men toby had followed with eager eyes everything that looked as if it belonged to the circus from the time the first wagon had entered the town until the street parade had been made and everything was being prepared for the afternoons performance  the man who had made the losing trade in peanuts seemed disposed to question the boy still further probably owing to the fact that he had nothing better to do  who is this uncle daniel you say you live with is he a farmer  no hes a deacon an he raps me over the head with the hymn book whenever i go to sleep in meetin an he says i eat four times as much as i earn i blame him for hittin so hard when i go to sleep but i spose hes right about my eatin you see and here his tone grew both confidential and mournful i am an awful eater an i cant seem to help it somehow im hungry all the time i dont seem ever to get enough till carrot time comes an then i can get all i want without troublin anybody  didnt you ever have enough to eat  i spose i did but you see uncle danl he found me one mornin on his hay an he says i was cryin for something to eat then an ive kept it up ever since i tried to get him to give me money enough to go into the circus with but he said a cent was all he could spare these hard times an id better take that an buy something to eat with it for the show wasnt very good anyway i wish peanuts wasnt but a cent a bushel  then you would make yourself sick eating them  yes i spose i should uncle danl says id eat till i was sick if i got the chance but id like to try it once  he was a very small boy with a round head covered with short red hair a face as speckled as any turkeys egg but thoroughly good natured looking and as he sat there on the rather sharp point of the rock swaying his body to and fro as he hugged his knees with his hands and kept his eyes fastened on the tempting display of good things before him it would have been a very hard hearted man who would not have given him something  but mr job lord the proprietor of the booth was a hard hearted man and he did not make the slightest advance toward offering the little fellow anything  toby rocked himself silently for a moment and then he said hesitatingly i dont suppose youd like to sell me some things an let me pay you when i get older would you  mr lord shook his head decidedly at this proposition  i didnt spose you would said toby quickly but you didnt seem to be selling anything an i thought id just see what youd say about it and then he appeared suddenly to see something wonderfully interesting behind him which served as an excuse to turn his reddening face away  i suppose your uncle daniel makes you work for your living dont he asked mr lord after he had rearranged his stock of candy and had added a couple of slices of lemon peel to what was popularly supposed to be lemonade  thats what i think but he says that all the work i do wouldnt pay for the meal that one chicken would eat an i spose its so for i dont like to work as well as a feller without any father and mother ought to i dont know why it is but i guess its because i take up so much time eatin that it kinder tires me out i spose you go into the circus whenever you want to dont you  oh yes im there at every performance for i keep the stand under the big canvas as well as this one out here  there was a great big sigh from out tobys little round stomach as he thought what bliss it must be to own all those good things and to see the circus wherever it went  it must be nice he said as he faced the booth and its hard visaged proprietor once more  how would you like it asked mr lord patronizingly as he looked toby over in a business way very much as if he contemplated purchasing him  like it echoed toby why id grow fat on it  i dont know as that would be any advantage continued mr lord reflectively for it strikes me that youre about as fat now as a boy of your age ought to be but ive a great mind to give you a chance  what cried toby in amazement and his eyes opened to their widest extent as this possible opportunity of leading a delightful life presented itself  yes ive a great mind to give you the chance you see and now it was mr lords turn to grow confidential ive had a boy with me this season but he cleared out at the last town and im running the business alone now  tobys face expressed all the contempt he felt for the boy who would run away from such a glorious life as mr lords assistant must lead but he said not a word waiting in breathless expectation for the offer which he now felt certain would be made him  now i aint hard on a boy continued mr lord still confidentially and yet that one seemed to think that he was treated worse and made to work harder than any boy in the world  he ought to live with uncle danl a week said toby eagerly  here i was just like a father to him said mr lord paying no attention to the interruption and i gave him his board and lodging and a dollar a week besides  could he do what he wanted to with the dollar  of course he could i never checked him no matter how extravagant he was an yet ive seen him spend his whole weeks wages at this very stand in one afternoon and even after his money had all gone that way ive paid for peppermint and ginger out of my own pocket just to cure his stomach ache  toby shook his head mournfully as if deploring that depravity which could cause a boy to run away from such a tender hearted employer and from such a desirable position but even as he shook his head so sadly he looked wistfully at the peanuts and mr lord observed the look  it may have been that mr job lord was the tender hearted man he prided himself upon being or it may have been that he wished to purchase tobys sympathy but at all events he gave him a large handful of nuts and toby never bothered his little round head as to what motive prompted the gift now he could listen to the story of the boys treachery and eat at the same time therefore he was an attentive listener  all in the world that boy had to do continued mr lord in the same injured tone he had previously used was to help me set things to rights when we struck a town in the morning and then tend to the counter till we left the town at night and all the rest of the time he had to himself yet that boy was ungrateful enough to run away  mr lord paused as if expecting some expression of sympathy from his listener but toby was so busily engaged with his unexpected feast and his mouth was so full that it did not seem even possible for him to shake his head  now what should you say if i told you that you looked to me like a boy that was made especially to help run a candy counter at a circus and if i offered the place to you  toby made one frantic effort to swallow the very large mouthful and in a choking voice he answered quickly i should say id go with you an be mighty glad of the chance  then its a bargain my boy and you shall leave town with me tonight     ii toby runs away from home   toby could scarcely restrain himself at the prospect of this golden future that had so suddenly opened before him he tried to express his gratitude but could only do so by evincing his willingness to commence work at once  no no that wont do said mr lord cautiously if your uncle daniel should see you working here he might mistrust something and then you couldnt get away  i dont believe hed try to stop me said toby confidently for hes told me lots of times that it was a sorry day for him when he found me  we wont take any chances my son was the reply in a very benevolent tone as he patted toby on the head and at the same time handed him a piece of pasteboard theres a ticket for the circus and you come around to see me about ten oclock tonight ill put you on one of the wagons and by tomorrow morning your uncle daniel will have hard work to find you  if toby had followed his inclinations the chances are that he would have fallen on his knees and kissed mr lords hands in the excess of his gratitude but not knowing exactly how such a show of thankfulness might be received he contented himself by repeatedly promising that he would be punctual to the time and place appointed  he would have loitered in the vicinity of the candy stand in order that he might gain some insight into the business but mr lord advised him to remain away lest his uncle daniel would see him and suspect where he had gone when he was missed in the morning  as toby walked around the circus grounds whereon was so much to attract his attention he could not prevent himself from assuming an air of proprietorship his interest in all that was going on was redoubled and in his anxiety that everything should be done correctly and in the proper order he actually and perhaps for the first time in his life forgot that he was hungry he was really to travel with a circus to become a part as it were of the whole and to be able to see its many wonderful and beautiful attractions every day  even the very tent ropes had acquired a new interest for him and the faces of the men at work seemed suddenly to have become those of friends how hard it was for him to walk around unconcernedly and how especially hard to prevent his feet from straying toward that tempting display of dainties which he was to sell to those who came to see and enjoy and who would look at him with wonder and curiosity it was very hard not to be allowed to tell his playmates of his wonderfully good fortune but silence meant success and he locked his secret in his bosom not even daring to talk with anyone he knew lest he should betray himself by some incautious word  he did not go home to dinner that day and once or twice he felt impelled to walk past the candy stand giving a mysterious shake of the head at the proprietor as he did so the afternoon performance passed off as usual to all of the spectators save toby he imagined that each one of the performers knew that he was about to join them and even as he passed the cage containing the monkeys he fancied that one particularly old one knew all about his intention of running away  of course it was necessary for him to go home at the close of the afternoons performance in order to get one or two valuable articles of his ownsuch as a boat a kite and a pair of skatesand in order that his actions might not seem suspicious before he left the grounds however he stole slyly around to the candy stand and informed mr job lord in a very hoarse whisper that he would be on hand at the time appointed  mr lord patted him on the head gave him two large sticks of candy and what was more kind and surprising considering the fact that he wore glasses and was cross eyed he winked at toby a wink from mr lord must have been intended to convey a great deal because owing to the defect in his eyes it required no little exertion and even then could not be considered as a really first class wink  that wink distorted as it was gladdened tobys heart immensely and took away nearly all the sting of the scolding with which uncle daniel greeted him when he reached home  that nightdespite the fact that he was going to travel with the circus despite the fact that his home was not a happy or cheerful onetoby was not in a pleasant frame of mind he began to feel for the first time that he was doing wrong and as he gazed at uncle daniels stern forbidding looking face it seemed to have changed somewhat from its severity and caused a great lump of something to come up in his throat as he thought that perhaps he should never see it again just then one or two kind words would have prevented him from running away bright as the prospect of circus life appeared  it was almost impossible for him to eat anything and this very surprising state of affairs attracted the attention of uncle daniel  bless my heart what ails the boy asked the old man as he peered over his glasses at tobys well filled plate which was usually emptied so quickly are ye sick toby or what is the matter with ye  no i haint sick said toby with a sigh but ive been to the circus an i got a good deal to eat  oho you spent that cent i give ye eh an got so much that it made ye sick  toby thought of the six peanuts which he had bought with the penny uncle daniel had given him and amid all his homesickness he could not help wondering if uncle daniel ever made himself sick with only six peanuts when he was a boy  as no one paid any further attention to toby he pushed back his plate arose from the table and went with a heavy heart to attend to his regular evening chores the cow the hens and even the pigs came in for a share of his unusually kind attention and as he fed them all the big tears rolled down his cheeks as he thought that perhaps never again would he see any of them these dumb animals had all been tobys confidants he had poured out his griefs in their ears and fancied when the world or uncle daniel had used him unusually hard that they sympathized with him now he was leaving them forever and as he locked the stable door he could hear the sounds of music coming from the direction of the circus grounds and he was angry at it because it represented that which was taking him away from his home even though it was not as pleasant as it might have been  still he had no thought of breaking the engagement which he had made he went to his room made a bundle of his worldly possessions and crept out of the back door down the road to the circus  mr lord saw him as soon as he arrived on the grounds and as he passed another ticket to toby he took his bundle from him saying as he did so ill pack up your bundle with my things and then youll be sure not to lose it dont you want some candy  toby shook his head he had just discovered that there was possibly some connection between his heart and his stomach for his grief at leaving home had taken from him all desire for good things it is also more than possible that mr lord had had experience enough with boys to know that they might be homesick on the eve of starting to travel with a circus and in order to make sure that toby would keep to his engagement he was unusually kind  that evening was the longest toby ever knew he wandered from one cage of animals to another then to see the performance in the ring and back again to the animals in the vain hope of passing the time pleasantly  but it was of no use that lump in his throat would remain there and the thoughts of what he was about to do would trouble him severely the performance failed to interest him and the animals did not attract until he had visited the monkey cage for the third or fourth time then he fancied that the same venerable monkey who had looked so knowing in the afternoon was gazing at him with a sadness which could only have come from a thorough knowledge of all the grief and doubt that was in his heart  there was no one around the cages and toby got just as near to the iron bars as possible no sooner had he flattened his little pug nose against the iron than the aged monkey came down from the ring in which he had been swinging and seating himself directly in front of tobys face looked at him most compassionately  it would not have surprised the boy just then if the animal had spoken but as he did not toby did the next best thing and spoke to him  i spose you remember that you saw me this afternoon an somebody told you that i was goin to join the circus didnt they  the monkey made no reply though toby fancied that he winked an affirmative answer and he looked so sympathetic that he continued confidentially  well im the same feller an i dont mind telling you that im awfully sorry that i promised that candy man id go with him do you know that i came near crying at the supper table tonight an uncle danl looked real good an nice though i never thought so before i wish i wasnt goin after all cause it dont seem a bit like a good time now but i spose i must cause i promised to an cause the candy man has got all my things  the big tears had begun to roll down tobys cheeks and as he ceased speaking the monkey reached out one little paw which toby took as earnestly as if it had been done purposely to console him  youre real good you are continued toby an i hope i shall see you real often for it seems to me now when there haint any folks around as if you was the only friend ive got in this great big world its awful when a feller feels the way i do an when he dont seem to want anything to eat now if youll stick to me ill stick to you an then it wont be half so bad when we feel this way  during this speech toby had still clung to the little brown paw which the monkey now withdrew and continued to gaze into the boys face  the fellers all say i dont amount to anything sobbed toby an uncle danl says i dont an i spose they know but i tell you i feel just as bad now that im goin away from them all as if i was as good as any of them  at this moment toby saw mr lord enter the tent and he knew that the summons to start was about to be given  goodby he said to the monkey as he vainly tried to take him by the hand again remember what ive told you an dont forget that toby tyler is feelin worse tonight than if he was twice as big an twice as good  mr lord had come to summon him away and he now told toby that he would show him with which man he was to ride that night  toby looked another goodby at the venerable monkey who was watching him closely and then followed his employer out of the tent among the ropes and poles and general confusion attendant upon the removal of a circus from one place to another     iii the night ride   the wagon on which mr lord was to send his new found employee was by the most singular chance the one containing the monkeys and toby accepted this as a good omen he would be near his venerable friend all night and there was some consolation in that the driver instructed the boy to watch his movements and when he saw him leading his horses around to look lively and be on hand for he never waited for anyone  toby not only promised to do as ordered but he followed the driver around so closely that had he desired he could not have rid himself of his little companion  the scene which presented itself to tobys view was strange and weird in the extreme shortly after he had attached himself to the man with whom he was to ride the performance was over and the work of putting the show and its belongings into such a shape as could be conveyed from one town to another was soon in active operation toby forgot his grief forgot that he was running away from the only home he had ever knownin fact forgot everything concerning himselfso interested was he in that which was going on about him  as soon as the audience had got out of the tent and almost before the work of taking down the canvas was begun  torches were stuck in the earth at regular intervals the lights that had shone so brilliantly in and around the ring had been extinguished the canvas sides had been taken off and the boards that had formed the seats were being packed into one of the carts with a rattling sound that seemed as if a regular fusillade of musketry was being indulged in men were shouting horses were being driven hither and thither harnessed to the wagons or drawing the huge carts away as soon as they were loaded and everything seemed in the greatest state of confusion while really the work was being done in the most systematic manner possible  toby had not long to wait before the driver informed him that the time for starting had arrived and assisted him to climb up to the narrow seat whereon he was to ride that night  the scene was so exciting and his efforts to stick to the narrow seat so great that he really had no time to attend to the homesick feeling that had crept over him during the first part of the evening  the long procession of carts and wagons drove slowly out of the town and when the last familiar house had been passed the driver spoke to toby for the first time since they started  pretty hard work to keep oneh sonny  yes replied the boy as the wagon jolted over a rock bouncing him high in air and he by strenuous efforts barely succeeded in alighting on the seat again it is pretty hard work an my names toby tyler  toby heard a queer sound that seemed to come from the mans throat and for a few moments he feared that his companion was choking but he soon understood that this was simply an attempt to laugh and he at once decided that it was a very poor style of laughing  so you object to being called sonny do you  well id rather be called toby for you see thats my name  all right my boy well call you toby i suppose you thought it was a mighty fine thing to run away an jine a circus didnt you  toby started in affright looked around cautiously and then tried to peer down through the small square aperture guarded by iron rods that opened into the cage just back of the seat they were sitting on then he turned slowly around to the driver and asked in a voice sunk to a whisper how did you know that i was runnin away did he tell you and toby motioned with his thumb as if he were pointing out someone behind him  it was the drivers turn now to look around in search of the he referred to by toby  who do you mean asked the man impatiently  why the old feller the one in the cart there i think he knew i was runnin away though he didnt say anything about it but he looked just as if he did  the driver looked at toby in perfect amazement for a moment and then as if suddenly understanding the boy relapsed into one of those convulsive efforts that caused the blood to rush up into his face and gave him every appearance of having a fit  you must mean one of the monkeys said the driver after he had recovered his breath which had been almost shaken out of his body by the silent laughter so you thought a monkey had told me what any fool could have seen if he had watched you for five minutes  well said toby slowly as if he feared he might provoke one of those terrible laughing spells again i saw him tonight an he looked as if he knew what i was doin so i up an told him an i didnt know but hed told you though he didnt look to me like a feller that would be mean  there was another internal shaking on the part of the driver which toby did not fear so much since he was getting accustomed to it and then the man said well you are the queerest little cove i ever saw  i spose i am was the reply accompanied by a long drawn sigh i dont seem to amount to so much as the other fellers do an i guess its because im always hungry you see i eat awful uncle danl says  the only reply which the driver made to this plaintive confession was to put his hand down into the deepest recesses of one of his deep pockets and to draw therefrom a huge doughnut which he handed to his companion  toby was so much at his ease by this time that the appetite which had failed him at supper had now returned in full force and he devoured the doughnut in a most ravenous manner  youre too small to eat so fast said the man in a warning tone as the last morsel of the greasy sweetness disappeared and he fished up another for the boy some time youll get hold of one of the india rubber doughnuts that they feed to circus people an choke yourself to death  toby shook his head and devoured this second cake as quickly as he had the first craning his neck and uttering a funny little squeak as the last bit went down just as a chicken does when he gets too large a mouthful of dough  ill never choke he said confidently im used to it and uncle danl says i could eat a pair of boots an never wink at em but i dont just believe that  as the driver made no reply to this remark toby watched with no little interest all that was passing on around him each of the wagons had a lantern fastened to the hind axle and these lights could be seen far ahead on the road as if a party of fireflies had started in single file on an excursion the trees by the side of the road stood out weird and ghostly looking in the darkness and the rumble of the carts ahead and behind formed a musical accompaniment to the picture that sounded strangely doleful  mile after mile was passed over in perfect silence save now and then when the driver would whistle a few bars of some very dismal tune that would fairly make toby shiver with its mournfulness eighteen miles was the distance from guilford to the town where the next performance of the circus was to be given and as toby thought of the ride before them it seemed as if the time would be almost interminable he curled himself up on one corner of the seat and tried very hard to go to sleep but just as his eyes began to grow heavy the wagon would jolt over some rock or sink deep in some rut till toby the breath very nearly shaken out of his body and his neck almost dislocated would sit bolt upright clinging to the seat with both hands as if he expected each moment to be pitched out into the mud  the driver watched him closely and each time that he saw him shaken up and awakened so thoroughly he would indulge in one of his silent laughing spells until toby would wonder whether he would ever recover from it several times had toby been awakened and each time he had seen the amusement his sufferings caused until he finally resolved to put an end to the sport by keeping awake  what is your name he asked of the driver thinking a conversation would be the best way to rouse himself into wakefulness  waal said the driver as he gathered the reins carefully in one hand and seemed to be debating in his mind how he should answer the question i dont know as i know myself its been so long since ive heard it  toby was wide enough awake now as this rather singular problem was forced upon his mind he revolved the matter silently for some moments and at last he asked what do folks call you when they want to speak to you  they always call me old ben an ive got so used to the name that i dont need any other  toby wanted very much to ask more questions but he wisely concluded that it would not be agreeable to his companion  ill ask the old man about it said toby to himself referring to the aged monkey whom he seemed to feel acquainted with he most likely knows if hell say anything  after this the conversation ceased until toby again ventured to suggest its a pretty long drive haint it  you want to wait till youve been in this business a year or two said ben sagely an then you wont think much of it why ive known the show towns to be thirty miles apart an them was the times when we had lively work of it riding all night and working all day kind of wears on a fellow  yes i spose so said toby with a sigh as he wondered whether he had got to work as hard as that but i spose you get all you want to eat dont you  now youve struck it said ben with the air of one about to impart a world of wisdom as he crossed one leg over the other that his position might be as comfortable as possible while he was initiating his young companion into the mysteries of the life ive had all the boys ride with me since ive been with this show an ive tried to start them right but they didnt seem to profit by it an always got sick of the show an run away just because they didnt look out for themselves as they ought to now listen to me toby an remember what i say you see they put us all in a hotel together an some of these places where we go dont have any too much stuff on the table whenever we strike a new town you find out at the hotel what time they have the grub ready an you be on hand sos to get in with the first eat all you can an fill your pockets  if thats all a feller has to do to travel with a circus said toby im just the one cause i always used to do just that when i hadnt any idea of bein a circus man  then youll get along all right said ben as he checked the speed of his horses and looking carefully ahead said as he guided his team to one side of the road this is as far as were going tonight  toby learned that they were within a couple of miles of the town and that the entire procession would remain by the roadside until time to make the grand entree into the village when every wagon horse and man would be decked out in the most gorgeous array as they had been when they entered guilford  under bens direction he wrapped himself in an old horse blanket and lay down on the top of the wagon and he was so tired from the excitement of the day and night that he had hardly stretched out at full length before he was fast asleep     iv the first day with the circus   when toby awakened and looked around he could hardly realize where he was or bow he came there as far ahead and behind on the road as he could see the carts were drawn up on one side men were hurrying to and fro orders were being shouted and everything showed that the entry into the town was about to be made directly opposite the wagon on which he had been sleeping were the four elephants and two camels and close behind contentedly munching their breakfasts were a number of tiny ponies troops of horses were being groomed and attended to the road was littered with saddles flags and general decorations until it seemed to toby that there must have been a smash up and that he now beheld ruins rather than systematic disorder  how different everything looked now compared to the time when the cavalcade marched into guilford dazzling everyone with the gorgeous display then the horses pranced gayly under their gaudy decorations the wagons were bright with glass gilt and flags the lumbering elephants and awkward camels were covered with fancifully embroidered velvets and even the drivers of the wagons were resplendent in their uniforms of scarlet and gold now in the gray light of the early morning everything was changed the horses were tired and muddy and wore old and dirty harness the gilded chariots were covered with mud bespattered canvas which caused them to look like the most ordinary of market wagons the elephants and camels looked dingy dirty almost repulsive and the drivers were only a sleepy looking set of men who in their shirt sleeves were getting ready for the change which would dazzle the eyes of the inhabitants of the town  toby descended from his lofty bed rubbed his eyes to thoroughly awaken himself and under the guidance of ben went to a little brook near by and washed his face he had been with the circus not quite ten hours but now he could not realize that it had ever seemed bright and beautiful he missed his comfortable bed the quiet and cleanliness and the well spread table even although he had felt the lack of parents care uncle daniels home seemed the very abode of love and friendly feeling compared with this condition where no one appeared to care even enough for him to scold at him he was thoroughly homesick and heartily wished that he was back in his old native town  while he was washing his face in the brook he saw some of the boys who had come out from the town to catch the first glimpse of the circus and he saw at once that he was the object of their admiring gaze he heard one of the boys say when they first discovered him  theres one of them an hes only a little feller so im going to talk to him  the evident admiration which the boys had for toby pleased him and this pleasure was the only drop of comfort he had had since he started he hoped they would come and talk with him and that they might have the opportunity he was purposely slow in making his toilet  the boys approached him shyly as if they had their doubts whether he was made of the same material as themselves and when they got quite near to him and satisfied themselves that he was only washing his face in much the same way that any well regulated boy would do the one who had called attention to him said half timidly hello  hello responded toby in a tone that was meant to invite confidence  do you belong to the circus  yes said toby a little doubtfully  then the boys stared at him again as if he were one of the strange looking animals and the one who had been the spokesman drew a long breath of envy as he said longingly my what a nice time you must have  toby remembered that only yesterday he himself had thought that boys must have a nice time with a circus and he now felt what a mistake that thought was but he concluded that he would not undeceive his new acquaintance  and do they give you frogs to eat sos to make you limber  this was the first time that toby had thought of breakfast and the very mention of eating made him hungry he was just at that moment so very hungry that he did not think he was replying to the question when he said quickly eat frogs i could eat anything if i only had the chance  the boys took this as an answer to their question and felt perfectly convinced that the agility of circus riders and tumblers depended upon the quantity of frogs eaten and they looked upon toby with no little degree of awe  toby might have undeceived them as to the kind of food he ate but just at that moment the harsh voice of mr job lord was heard calling him and he hurried away to commence his first days work  tobys employer was not the same pleasant kindly spoken man that he had been during the time they were in guilford and before the boy was absolutely under his control he looked cross he acted cross and it did not take the boy very long to find out that he was very cross  he scolded toby roundly and launched more oaths at his defenseless head than toby had ever heard in his life he was angry that the boy had not been on hand to help him and also that he had been obliged to hunt for him  toby tried to explain that he had no idea of what he was expected to do and that he had been on the wagon to which he had been sent only leaving it to wash his face but the angry man grew still more furious  went to wash your face did yer want to set yourself up for a dandy i suppose and think that you must souse that speckled face of yours into every brook you come to ill soon break you of that and the sooner you understand that i cant afford to have you wasting your time in washing the better it will be for you  toby now grew angry and not realizing how wholly he was in the mans power he retorted if you think im going round with a dirty face even if it is speckled for a dollar a week youre mistaken thats all how many folks would eat your candy if they knew you handled it over before you washed your hands  oho ive picked up a preacher have i now i want you to understand my bantam that i do all the preaching as well as the practicing myself and this is about as quick a way as i know of to make you understand it  as the man spoke he grasped the boy by the coat collar with one hand and with the other plied a thin rubber cane with no gentle force to every portion of tobys body that he could reach  every blow caused the poor boy the most intense pain but he determined that his tormentor should not have the satisfaction of forcing an outcry from him and he closed his lips so tightly that not a single sound could escape from them  this very silence enraged the man so much that he redoubled the force and rapidity of his blows and it is impossible to say what might have been the consequences had not ben come that way just then and changed the aspect of affairs  up to your old tricks of whipping the boys are you job he said as he wrested the cane from the mans hand and held him off at arms length to prevent him from doing toby more mischief  mr lord struggled to release himself and insisted that since the boy was in his employ he should do with him just as he saw fit  now look here mr lord said ben as gravely as if he was delivering some profound piece of wisdom ive never interfered with you before but now im going to stop your game of thrashing your boy every morning before breakfast you just tell this youngster what you want him to do and if he dont do it you can discharge him if i hear of your flogging him i shall attend to your case at once you hear me  ben shook the now terrified candy vender much as if he had been a child and then released him saying to toby as he did so now my boy you attend to your business as you ought to and ill settle his accounts if he tries the flogging game again  you see i dont know what there is for me to do sobbed toby for the kindly interference of ben had made him show more feeling than mr lords blows had done  tell him what he must do said ben sternly  i want him to go to work and wash the tumblers and fix up the things in that green box so we can commence to sell as soon as we get into town snarled mr lord as he motioned toward a large green chest that had been taken out of one of the carts and which toby saw was filled with dirty glasses spoons knives and other utensils such as were necessary to carry on the business  toby got a pail of water from the brook hunted around and found towels and soap and devoted himself to his work with such industry that mr lord could not repress a grunt of satisfaction as he passed him however angry he felt because he could not administer the whipping which would have smoothed his ruffled temper  by the time the procession was ready to start for the town toby had as much of his work done as he could find that it was necessary to do and his master in his surly way half acknowledged that this last boy of his was better than any he had had before  although toby had done his work so well he was far from feeling happy he was both angry and sad as he thought of the cruel blows that had been inflicted and he had plenty of leisure to repent of the rash step he had taken although he could not see very clearly how he was to get away from it he thought that he could not go back to guilford for uncle daniel would not allow him to come to his house again and the hot scalding tears ran down his cheeks as he realized that he was homeless and friendless in this great big world  it was while he was in this frame of mind that the procession all gaudy with flags streamers and banners entered the town under different circumstances this would have been a most delightful day for him for the entrance of a circus into guilford had always been a source of one days solid enjoyment but now he was the most disconsolate and unhappy boy in all that crowd  he did not ride throughout the entire route of the procession for mr lord was anxious to begin business and the moment the tenting ground was reached the wagon containing mr lords goods was driven into the inclosure and tobys days work began  he was obliged to bring water to cut up the lemons fetch and carry fruit from the booth in the big tent to the booth on the outside until he was ready to drop with fatigue and having had no time for breakfast was nearly famished  it was quite noon before he was permitted to go to the hotel for something to eat and then bens advice to be one of the first to get to the tables was not needed  in the eating line that day he astonished the servants the members of the company and even himself and by the time he arose from the table with both pockets and his stomach full to bursting the tables had been set and cleared away twice while he was making one meal  well i guess you didnt hurry yourself much said mr lord when toby returned to the circus ground  oh yes i did was tobys innocent reply i ate just as fast as i could and a satisfied smile stole over the boys face as he thought of the amount of solid food he had consumed  the answer was not one which was calculated to make mr lord feel any more agreeably disposed toward his new clerk and he showed his ill temper very plainly as he said it must take a good deal to satisfy you  i spose it does calmly replied toby sam merrill used to say that i took after aunt olive and uncle danl one ate a good while an the other ate awful fast  toby could not understand what it was that mr lord said in reply but he could understand that his employer was angry at somebody or something and he tried unusually hard to please him he talked to the boys who had gathered around to induce them to buy washed the glasses as fast as they were used tried to keep off the flies and in every way he could think of endeavored to please his master     v the counterfeit ten cent piece   when the doors of the big tent were opened and the people began to crowd in just as toby had seen them do at guilford mr lord announced to his young clerk that it was time for him to go into the tent to work then it was that toby learned for the first time that he had two masters instead of one and this knowledge caused him no little uneasiness if the other one was anything like mr lord his lot would be just twice as bad and he began to wonder whether he could even stand it one day longer  as the boy passed through the tent on his way to the candy stand where he was really to enter upon the duties for which he had run away from home he wanted to stop for a moment and speak with the old monkey who he thought had taken such an interest in him but when he reached the cage in which his friend was confined there was such a crowd around it that it was impossible for him to get near enough to speak without being overheard  this was such a disappointment to the little fellow that the big tears came into his eyes and in another instant would have gone rolling down his cheeks if his aged friend had not chanced to look toward him toby fancied that the monkey looked at him in the most friendly way and then he was certain that he winked one eye toby felt that there was no mistake about that wink and it seemed as if it was intended to convey comfort to him in his troubles he winked back at the monkey in the most emphatic and grave manner possible and then went on his way feeling wonderfully comforted  the work inside the tent was far different and much harder than it was outside he was obliged to carry around among the audience trays of candy nuts and lemonade for sale and he was expected to cry aloud the description of that which he offered the partner of mr lord who had charge of the stand inside the tent showed himself to be neither better nor worse than mr lord himself when toby first presented himself for work he handed him a tray filled with glasses of lemonade and told him to go among the audience crying heres your nice cold lemonade only five cents a glass  toby started to do as he was bidden but when he tried to repeat the words in anything like a loud tone of voice they stuck in his throat and he found it next to impossible to utter a sound above a whisper it seemed to him that everyone in the audience was looking only at him and the very sound of his own voice made him afraid  he went entirely around the tent once without making a sale and when he returned to the stand he was at once convinced that one of his masters was quite as bad as the other this oneand he knew that his name was jacobs for he heard someone call him sovery kindly told him that he would break every bone in his body if he didnt sell something and toby confidently believed that he would carry out his threat  it was with a very heavy heart that he started around again in obedience to mr jacobss angry command but this time he did manage to cry out in a very thin and very squeaky voice the words which he had been told to repeat  this timeperhaps owing to his pitiful and imploring look certainly not because of the noise he madehe met with very good luck and sold every glass of the mixture which messrs lord and jacobs called lemonade and went back to the stand for more  he certainly thought he had earned a word of praise and fully expected it as he put the empty glasses and money on the stand in front of mr jacobs but instead of the kind words he was greeted with a volley of curses and the reason for it was that he had taken in payment for two of the glasses a lead ten cent piece mr jacobs after scolding poor little toby to his hearts content vowed that the amount should be kept from his first weeks wages and then handed back the coin with orders to give it to the first man who gave him money to change under the penalty of a severe flogging if he failed to do so  poor toby tried to explain matters by saying you see i dont know anything about money i never had more n a cent at a time an you mustnt expect me to get posted all at once  ill post you with a stick if you do it again an it wont be well for you if you bring that ten cent piece back here  now toby was very well aware that to pass the coin knowing it to be bad would be a crime and be resolved to take the consequences of which mr jacobs had intimated if he could not find the one who had given him the counterfeit and persuade him to give him good money in its stead he remembered very plainly where he had sold each glass of lemonade and he retraced his steps glancing at each face carefully as he passed at last he was confident that he saw the man who had gotten him into such trouble and he climbed up the board seats saying as he stood in front of him and held out the coin mister this money that you gave me is bad wont you give me another one for it  the man was a rough looking party who had taken his girl to the circus and who did not seem at all disposed to pay any heed to tobys request therefore he repeated it and this time more loudly  get out the way said the man angrily how can you expect me to see the show if you stand right in front of me  youll like it better said toby earnestly if you give me another ten cent piece  get out an dont bother me was the angry rejoinder and the little fellow began to think that perhaps he would be obliged to get out without getting his money  it was becoming a desperate case for the man was growing angry very fast and if toby did not succeed in getting good money for the bad he would have to take the consequences of which mr jacobs had spoken  please mister he said imploringlyfor his heart began to grow very heavy and he was fearing that he should not succeedwont you please give me the money back you know you gave it to me an ill have to pay it if you dont  the boys lip was quivering and those around began to be interested in the affair while several in the immediate vicinity gave vent to their indignation that a man should try to cheat a boy out of ten cents by giving him counterfeit money  the man whom toby was speaking to was about to dismiss him with an angry reply when he saw that those about him were not only interested in the matter but were evidently taking sides with the boy against him and knowing well that he had given the counterfeit money he took another coin from his pocket and handing it to toby said i didnt give you the lead piece but youre making such a fuss about it that heres ten cents to make you keep quiet  im sure you did give me the money said toby as he took the extended coin an im much obliged to you for takin it back i didnt want to tell you before cause youd thought i was beggin but if you hadnt given me this i xpect id have got an awful whippin for mr jacobs said hed fix me if i didnt get the money for it  the man looked sheepish enough as he put the bad money in his pocket and tobys innocently told story caused such a feeling in his behalf among those who sat near that he not only disposed of his entire stock then and there but received from one gentleman twentyfive cents for himself he was both proud and happy as he returned to mr jacobs with empty glasses and with the money to refund the amount of loss which would have been caused by the counterfeit  but the worthy partner of mr lords candy business had no words of encouragement for the boy who was trying so hard to please  let that make you keep your eyes open he growled out sulkily an if you get caught in that trap again you wont be let off so easy  poor little toby his heart seemed ready to break but his few hours previous experience had taught him that there was but one thing to do and that was to work just as hard as possible trusting to some good fortune to enable him to get out of the very disagreeable position in which he had voluntarily placed himself  he took the basket of candy that mr jacobs handed him and trudged around the circle of seats selling far more because of the pitifulness of his face than because of the excellence of his goods and even this worked to his disadvantage mr jacobs was keen enough to see why his little clerk sold so many goods and each time that he returned to the stand he said something to him in an angry tone which had the effect of deepening the shadow on the boys face and at the same time increasing trade  by the time the performance was over toby had in his pocket a dollar and twentyfive cents which had been given him for himself by some of the kind hearted in the audience and he kept his hand almost constantly upon it for the money seemed to him like some kind friend who would help him out of his present difficulties  after the audience had dispersed mr jacobs set toby at work washing the glasses and clearing up generally and then the boy started toward the other portion of the storethat watched over by mr lord not a person save the watchman was in the tent and as toby went toward the door he saw his friend the monkey sitting in one corner of the cage and apparently watching his every movement  it was as if he had suddenly seen one of the boys from home and toby uttering an exclamation of delight ran up to the cage and put his hand through the wires  the monkey in the gravest possible manner took one of the fingers in his paw and toby shook hands with him very earnestly  i was sorry that i couldnt speak to you when i went in this noon said toby as if making an apology but you see there were so many around here to see you that i couldnt get the chance did you see me wink at you  the monkey made no reply but he twisted his face into such a funny little grimace that toby was quite as well satisfied as if he had spoken  i wonder if you haint some relation to steve stubbs toby continued earnestly for you look just like him only he dont have quite so many whiskers what i wanted to say was that im awful sorry i run away i used to think that uncle danl was bad enough but he was just a perfect good samarathon to what mr lord an mr jacobs are an when mr lord looks at me with that crooked eye of his i feel it way down in my boots do you knowand here toby put his mouth nearer to the monkeys head and whisperedid run away from this circus if i could get the chance wouldnt you  just at this point as if in answer to the question the monkey stood up on his hind feet and reached out his paw to the boy who seemed to think this was his way of being more emphatic in saying yes  toby took the paw in his hand shook it again earnestly and said as he released it i was pretty sure you felt just about the same way i did mr stubbs when i passed you this noon look hereand toby took the money from his pocket which had been given himi got all that this afternoon an ill try an stick it out somehow till i get as much as ten dollars an then well run away some night an go way off as far asasas out west an well stay there too  the monkey probably tired with remaining in one position so long started toward the top of the cage chattering and screaming joining the other monkeys who had gathered in a little group in one of the swings  now see here mr stubbs said toby in alarm you mustnt go to telling everybody about it or mr lord will know an then well be dished sure  the monkey sat quietly in the swing as if he felt reproved by what the boy had said and toby considerably relieved by his silence said as he started toward the door thats rightmums the word you keep quiet an so will i an pretty soon well get away from the whole crowd  all the monkeys chattered and toby believing that everything which he had said had been understood by the animals went out of the door to meet his other taskmaster     vi a tender hearted skeleton   now then lazybones was mr lords warning cry as toby came out of the tent if youve fooled away enough of your time you can come here an tend shop for me while i go to supper you crammed yourself this noon an it ll teach you a good lesson to make you go without anything to eat tonight it ll make you move round more lively in future  instead of becoming accustomed to such treatment as he was receiving from his employers tobys heart grew more tender with each brutal word and this last punishmentthat of losing his suppercaused the poor boy more sorrow than blows would mr lord started for the hotel as he concluded his cruel speech and poor little toby going behind the counter leaned his head upon the rough boards and cried as if his heart would break  all the fancied brightness and pleasure of a circus life had vanished and in its place was the bitterness of remorse that he had repaid uncle daniels kindness by the ingratitude of running away toby thought that if he could only nestle his little red head on the pillows of his little bed in that rough room at uncle daniels he would be the happiest and best boy in the future in all the great wide world  while he was still sobbing away at a most furious rate he heard a voice close at his elbow and looking up saw the thinnest man he had ever seen in all his life the man had flesh colored tights on and a spangled red velvet garmentthat was neither pants because there were no legs to it nor a coat because it did not come above his waistmade up the remainder of his costume  because he was so wonderfully thin because of the costume which he wore and because of a highly colored painting which was hanging in front of one of the small tents toby knew that the living skeleton was before him and his big brown eyes opened all the wider as he gazed at him  what is the matter little fellow asked the man in a kindly tone what makes you cry so has job been up to his old tricks again  i dont know what his old tricks are and toby sobbed the tears coming again because of the sympathy which this mans voice expressed for himbut i know that hes a mean ugly thingthats what i know an if i could only get back to uncle danl there haint elephants enough in all the circuses in the world to pull me away again  oh you run away from home did you  yes i did sobbed toby an there haint any boy in any sunday school book that ever i read that was half so sorry hed been bad as i am its awful an now i cant have any supper cause i stopped to talk with mr stubbs  is mr stubbs one of your friends asked the skeleton as he seated himself in mr lords own private chair  yes he is an hes the only one in this whole circus who pears to be sorry for me youd better not let mr lord see you sittin in that chair or hell raise a row  job wont raise any row with me said the skeleton but who is this mr stubbs i dont seem to know anybody by that name  i dont think that is his name i only call him so cause he looks so much like a feller i know who is named stubbs  this satisfied the skeleton that this mr stubbs must be someone attached to the show and he asked  has job been whipping you  no ben the driver on the wagon where i ride told him not to do that again but he haint going to let me have any supper cause i was so slow about my workthough i wasnt slow i only talked to mr stubbs when there wasnt anybody round his cage  sam sam samuel  this name which was shouted twice in a quick loud voice and the third time in a slow manner ending almost in a screech did not come from either toby or the skeleton but from an enormously large woman dressed in a gaudy red and black dress cut very short and with low neck and an apology for sleeves who had just come out from the tent whereon the picture of the living skeleton hung  samuel she screamed again come inside this minute or youll catch your death o cold an i shall have you wheezin around with the phthisic all night come in samuel  thats her said the skeleton to toby as he pointed his thumb in the direction of the fat woman but paying no attention to the outcry she was makingthats my wife lilly an shes the fat woman of the show shes always yellin after me that way the minute i get out for a little fresh air an shes always sayin just the same thing bless you i never have the phthisic but she does awful an i spose cause shes so large she cant feel all over her an thinks its me that has it  isis all thatis that your wife stammered toby in astonishment as he looked at the enormously fat woman who stood in the tent door and then at the wonderfully thin man who sat beside him  yes thats her said the skeleton she weighs pretty nigh four hundred though of course the show cards says its over six hundred an she earns almost as much money as i do of course she cant get so much for skeletons is much scarcer than fat folks but we make a pretty good thing travelin together  samuel again came the cry from the fat woman are you never coming in  not yet my angel said the skeleton placidly as he crossed one thin leg over the other and looked calmly at her come here an see jobs new boy  your imprudence is wearin me away so that i shant be worth five dollars a week to any circus she said impatiently at the same time coming toward the candy stand quite as rapidly as her very great size would admit  this is my wife lillymrs treat said the skeleton with a proud wave of his hand as he rose from his seat and gazed admiringly at her this is my flowermy queen mr  mr   tyler said toby supplying the name which the skeletonor mr treat as toby now learned his name wasdid not know tyler is my nametoby tyler  why what a little chap you are said mrs treat paying no attention to the awkward little bend of the head which toby intended for a bow how small he is samuel  yes said the skeleton reflectively as he looked toby over from head to foot as if he were mentally trying to calculate exactly how many inches high he was he is small but hes got all the world before him to grow in an if he only eats enoughthere that reminds me job isnt going to give him any supper because he didnt work hard enough  he wont wont he exclaimed the large lady savagely oh hes a precious one he is an some day i shall just give him a good shakin up thats what ill do i get all out of patience with that mans ugliness  an shell do just what she says said the skeleton to toby with an admiring shake of the head that woman haint afraid of anybody an i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she did give job a pretty rough time  toby thought as he looked at her that she was large enough to give most anyone a pretty rough time but he did not venture to say so while he was looking first at her and then at her very thin husband the skeleton told his wife the little that he had learned regarding the boys history and when he had concluded she waddled away toward her tent  great woman that said the skeleton as he saw her disappear within the tent  yes said toby shes the greatest i ever saw  i mean that shes got a great head now youll see about how much she cares for what job says  if i was as big as her said toby with just a shade of envy in his voice i wouldnt be afraid of anybody  it haint so much the size said the skeleton sagelyit haint so much the size my boy for i can scare that woman almost to death when i feel like it  toby looked for a moment at mr treats thin legs and arms and then he said warningly i wouldnt feel like it very often if i was you mr treat cause she might break some of your bones if you didnt happen to scare her enough  dont fear for me my boydont fear for me youll see how i manage her if you stay with the circus long enough now i often  if mr treat was about to confide a family secret to toby it was fated that he should not hear it then for mrs treat had just come out of her tent carrying in her hands a large tin plate piled high with a miscellaneous assortment of pie cake bread and meat  she placed this in front of toby and as she did so she handed him two pictures  there little toby tyler she saidtheres something for you to eat if mr job lord and his precious partner jacobs did say you shouldnt have any supper an ive brought you a picture of samuel an me we sell em for ten cents apiece but im going to give them to you because i like the looks of you  toby was quite overcome with the presents and seemed at a loss how to thank her for them he attempted to speak but could not get the words out at first and then he said as he put the two photographs in the same pocket with his money youre awful good to me an when i get to be a man ill give you lots of things i wasnt so very hungry if i am such a big eater but i did want something  bless your dear little heart and you shall have something to eat said the fat woman as she seized toby squeezed him close up to her and kissed his freckled face as kindly as if it had been as fair and white as possible you shall eat all you want to an if you get the stomachache as samuel does sometimes when hes been eatin too much ill give you some catnip tea out of the same dipper that i give him his hes a great eater samuel is she added in a burst of confidence an its a wonder to me what he does with it all sometimes  is he exclaimed toby quickly how funny that is for im an awful eater why uncle danl used to say that i ate twice as much as i ought to an it never made me any bigger i wonder whats the reason  i declare i dont know said the fat woman thoughtfully an ive wondered at it time an time again some folks is made that way an some folks is made different now i dont eat enough to keep a chicken alive an yet i grow fatter an fatter every daydont i samuel  indeed you do my love said the skeleton with a world of pride in his voice but you mustnt feel bad about it for every pound you gain makes you worth just so much more to the show  oh i wasnt worryin i was only wonderin but we must go samuel for the poor child wont eat a bit while we are here after youve eaten what there is there bring the plate in to me she said to toby as she took her lean husband by the arm and walked him off toward their own tent  toby gazed after them a moment and then he commenced a vigorous attack upon the eatables which had been so kindly given him of the food which he had taken from the dinner table he had eaten some while he was in the tent and after that he had entirely forgotten that he had any in his pocket therefore at the time that mrs treat had brought him such a liberal supply he was really very hungry  he succeeded in eating nearly all the food which had been brought to him and the very small quantity which remained he readily found room for in his pockets then he washed the plate nicely and seeing no one in sight he thought he could leave the booth long enough to return the plate  he ran with it quickly into the tent occupied by the thin man and fat woman and handed it to her with a profusion of thanks for her kindness  did you eat it all she asked  well hesitated toby there was two doughnuts an a piece of pie left over an i put them in my pocket if you dont care ill eat them some time tonight  you shall eat it whenever you want to an any time that you get hungry again you come right to me  thank you marm i must go now for i left the store all alone  run then an if job abuses you just let me know it an ill keep him from cuttin up any monkeyshines  toby hardly heard the end of her sentence so great was his haste to get back to the booth and just as he emerged from the tent on a quick run he received a blow on the ear which sent him sprawling in the dust and he heard mr job lords angry voice as it said  so just the moment my back is turned you leave the stand to take care of itself do you an run around tryin to plot some mischief against me eh and the brute kicked the prostrate boy twice with his heavy boot  please dont kick me again pleaded toby i wasnt gone but a minute an i wasnt doing anything bad  youre lying now an you know it you young cub exclaimed the angry man as he advanced to kick the boy again ill let you know who youve got to deal with when you get hold of me  and ill let you know who youve got to deal with when you get hold of me said a womans voice and just as mr lord raised his foot to kick the boy again the fat woman seized him by the collar jerked him back over one of the tent ropes and left him quite as prostrate as he had left toby  now job lord said the angry woman as she towered above the thoroughly enraged but thoroughly frightened man i want you to understand that you cant knock and beat this boy while im around ive seen enough of your capers an im going to put a stop to them that boy wasnt in this tent more than two minutes an he attends to his work better than anyone you have ever had so see that you treat him decent get up she said to toby who had not dared to rise from the ground and if he offers to strike you again come to me  toby scrambled to his feet and ran to the booth in time to attend to one or two customers who had just come up he could see from out the corner of his eye that mr lord had arisen to his feet also and was engaged in an angry conversation with mrs treat the result of which he very much feared would be another and a worse whipping for him  but in this he was mistaken for mr lord after the conversation was ended came toward the booth and began to attend to his business without speaking one word to toby when mr jacobs returned from his supper mr lord took him by the arm and walked him out toward the rear of the tents and tony was very positive that he was to be the subject of their conversation which made him not a little uneasy  it was not until nearly time for the performance to begin that mr lord returned and he had nothing to say to toby save to tell him to go into the tent and begin his work there the boy was only too glad to escape so easily and he went to his work with as much alacrity as if he were about entering upon some pleasure  when he met mr jacobs that gentleman spoke to him very sharply about being late and seemed to think it no excuse at all that he had just been relieved from the outside work by mr lord     vii an accident and its consequences   tobys experience in the evening was very similar to that of the afternoon save that he was so fortunate as not to take any more bad money in payment for his goods mr jacobs scolded and swore alternately and the boy really surprised him by his way of selling goods though he was very careful not to say anything about it but made toby believe that he was doing only about half as much work as he ought to do tobys private hoard of money was increased that evening by presents ninety cents and he began to look upon himself as almost a rich man  when the performance was nearly over mr jacobs called to him to help in packing up and by the time the last spectator had left the tent the worldly possessions of messrs lord and jacobs were ready for removal and toby allowed to do as he had a mind to so long as he was careful to be on hand when old ben was ready to start  toby thought that he would have time to pay a visit to his friends the skeleton and the fat woman and to that end started toward the place where their tent had been standing but to his sorrow he found that it was already being taken down and he had only time to thank mrs treat and to press the fleshless hand of her shadowy husband as they entered their wagon to drive away  he was disappointed for he had hoped to be able to speak with his new made friends a few moments before the weary nights ride commenced but failing in that he went hastily back to the monkeys cage old ben was there getting things ready for a start but the wooden sides of the cage had not been put up and toby had no difficulty in calling the aged monkey up to the bars he held one of the fat womans doughnuts in his hand and said as he passed it through to the animal  i thought perhaps you might be hungry mr stubbs and this is some of what the skeletons wife gave me i haint got very much time to talk with you now but the first chance i can get away tomorrow an when there haint anybody round i want to tell you something  the monkey had taken the doughnut in his handlike paws and was tearing it to pieces eating small portions of it very rapidly  dont hurry yourself said toby warningly for uncle danl always told me the worst thing a feller could do was to eat fast if you want any more after we start just put your hand through the little hole up there near the seat an ill give you all you want  from the look on his face toby confidently believed the monkey was about to make some reply but just then ben shut up the sides separating toby and mr stubbs and the order was given to start  toby clambered up on to the high seat ben followed him and in another instant the team was moving along slowly down the dusty road preceded and followed by the many wagons with their tiny swinging lights  well said ben when he had got his team well under way and felt that he could indulge in a little conversation how did you get along today  toby related all of his movements and gave the driver a faithful account of all that had happened to him concluding his story by saying that was one of mrs treats doughnuts that i just gave to mr stubbs  to whom asked ben in surprise  to mr stubbsthe old fellow here in the cart you know thats been so good to me  toby heard a sort of gurgling sound saw the drivers body sway back and forth in a trembling way and was just becoming thoroughly alarmed when he thought of the previous night and understood that ben was only laughing in his own peculiar way  how did you know his name was stubbs asked ben after he had recovered his breath  oh i dont know that that is his real name was the quick reply i only call him that because he looks so much like a feller with that name that i knew at home he dont seem to mind because i call him stubbs  ben looked at toby earnestly for a moment acting all the time as if he wanted to laugh again but didnt dare to for fear he might burst a blood vessel and then he said as he patted him on the shoulder well you are the queerest little fish that i ever saw in all my travels you seem to think that that monkey knows all you say to him  im sure he does said toby positively he dont say anything right out to me but he knows everything i tell him do you suppose he could talk if he tried to  look here mr toby tylerand ben turned half around in his seat and looked toby full in the face so as to give more emphasis to his wordsare you heathen enough to think that that monkey could talk if he wanted to  i know i haint a heathen said toby thoughtfully for if i had been some of the missionaries would have found me out a good while ago but i never saw anybody like this old mr stubbs before an i thought he could talk if he wanted to just as the living skeleton does or his wife anyhow mr stubbs winked at me an how could he do that if he didnt know what ive been sayin to him  look here my son said ben in a most fatherly fashion monkeys haint anything but beasts an they dont know how to talk any more than they know what you say to em  didnt you ever hear any of them speak a word  never ive been in a circus man an boy nigh on to forty years an i never seen nothin in a monkey more n any other beast except their awful mischiefness  well said toby still unconvinced i believe mr stubbs knows what i say to him anyway  now dont be foolish toby pleaded ben you cant show me one thing that a monkey ever did because you told him to  just at this moment toby felt someone pulling at the back of his coat and looking round he saw it was a little brown hand reaching through the bars of the air hole of the cage that was tugging away at his coat  there he said triumphantly to ben look there i told mr stubbs if he wanted anything more to eat to tell me an i would give it to him now you can see for yourself that hes come for it and toby took a doughnut from his pocket and put it into the tiny hand which was immediately withdrawn  now what do you think of mr stubbs knowing what i say to him  they often stick their paws up through there said ben in a matter of fact tone ive had em pull my coat in the night till they made me as nervous as ever any old woman was you see toby my boy monkeys is monkeys an you mustnt go to gettin the idea that theyre anything else for its a mistake you think this old monkey in here knows what you say why thats just the cuteness of the old fellowhe watches you to see if he cant do just as you do an thats all there is about it  toby was more than half convinced that ben was putting the matter in its proper light and he would have believed all that had been said if just at that moment he had not seen that brown hand reaching through the hole to clutch him again by the coat  the action seemed so natural so like a hungry boy who gropes in the dark pantry for something to eat that it would have taken more arguments than ben had at his disposal to persuade toby that his mr stubbs could not understand all that was said to him toby put another doughnut in the outstretched hand and then sat silently as if in a brown study over some difficult problem  for some time the ride was continued in silence ben was going through all the motions of whistling without uttering a sounda favorite amusement of hisand tobys thoughts were far away in the humble home he had scorned with uncle daniel whose virtues had increased in his esteem with every mile of distance which had been put between them and whose faults had decreased in a corresponding ratio  tobys thoughtfulness had made him sleepy and his eyes were almost closed in slumber when he was startled by a crashing sound was conscious of a feeling of being hurled from his seat by some great force and then he lay senseless by the side of the road while the wagon became a perfect wreck from out of which a small army of monkeys was escaping  bens experienced ear had told him at the first crash that his wagon was breaking down and without having time to warn toby of his peril he had leaped clear of the wreck keeping his horses under perfect control and thus averting more trouble it was the breaking of one of the axles which toby had heard just before he was thrown from his seat and when the body of the wagon came down upon the hard road  the monkeys thus suddenly released from confinement had scampered off in every direction and by a singular chance tobys aged friend started for the woods in such a direction as to bring him directly before the boys insensible form the monkey on coming up to toby stopped urged by the well known curiosity of its race and began to examine the boys person carefully prying into pockets and trying to open the boys half closed eyelids fortunately for toby he had fallen upon a mud bank and was only stunned for the moment having received no serious bruises the attentions bestowed upon him by the monkey served the purpose of bringing him to his senses and after he had looked around him in the gray light of the coming morning it would have taken far more of a philosopher than old ben was to persuade the boy that monkeys did not possess reasoning faculties  the monkey was busy at tobys ears nose and mouth as monkeys will do when they get an opportunity and the expression of its face was as grave as possible toby firmly believed that the monkeys face showed sorrow at his fall and he imagined that the attentions which were bestowed upon him were for the purpose of learning whether he had been injured or not  dont worry mr stubbs said toby anxious to reassure his friend as he sat upright and looked about him i didnt get hurt any but i would like to know how i got way over here  it really seemed as if the monkey was pleased to know that his little friend was not hurt for he seated himself on his haunches and his face expressed the liveliest pleasure that toby was well againor at least that was how the boy interpreted the look  by this time the news of the accident had been shouted ahead from one team to the other and all hands were hurrying to the scene for the purpose of rendering aid as toby saw them coming he also saw a number of small forms looking something like diminutive men hurrying past him and for the first time he understood how it was that the aged monkey was at liberty and knew that those little dusky forms were the other occupants of the cage escaping to the woods  see there mr stubbs see there he exclaimed pointing toward the fugitives theyre all going off into the woods what shall we do  the sight of the runaways seemed to excite the old monkey quite as much as it did the boy he sprang to his feet chattering in the most excited way screamed two or three times as if he were calling them back and then started off in vigorous pursuit  now hes gone too said toby disconsolately believing the old fellow had run away from him i didnt think mr stubbs would treat me this way     viii capture of the monkeys   the boy tried to rise to his feet but his head whirled so and he felt so dizzy and sick from the effects of his fall that he was obliged to sit down again until he should feel able to stand meanwhile the crowd around the wagon paid no attention to him and he lay there quietly enough until he heard the hateful voice of mr lord asking if his boy were hurt  the sound of his voice affected toby very much as the chills and fever affect a sufferer and he shook so with fear and his heart beat so loudly that he thought mr lord must know where he was by the sound seeing however that his employer did not come directly toward him the thought flashed upon his mind that now would be a good chance to run away and he acted upon it at once he rolled himself over in the mud until he reached a low growth of fir trees that skirted the road and when beneath their friendly shade he rose to his feet and walked swiftly toward the woods following the direction the monkeys had taken  he no longer felt dizzy and sick the fear of mr lord had dispelled all that and he felt strong and active again  he had walked rapidly for some distance and was nearly beyond the sound of the voices in the road when he was startled by seeing quite a procession of figures emerge from the trees and come directly toward him  he could not understand the meaning of this strange company and it so frightened him that he attempted to hide behind a tree in the hope that they might pass without seeing him but no sooner had he secreted himself than a strange shrill chattering came from the foremost of the group and in an instant toby emerged from his place of concealment  he had recognized the peculiar sound as that of the old monkey who had left him a few moments before and he knew now what he did not know then owing to the darkness the newcomers were the monkeys that had escaped from the cage and had been overtaken and compelled to come back by the old monkey who seemed to have the most perfect control over them  the old fellow was leading the band and all were linked hand in hand with each other which gave the whole crowd a most comical appearance as they came up to toby half hopping half walking upright and all chattering and screaming like a crowd of children out for a holiday  toby stepped toward the noisy crowd held out his hand gravely to the old monkey and said in tones of heartfelt sorrow  i felt awful bad because i thought you had gone off an left me when you went off to find the other fellows youre awful good mr stubbs an now instead of runnin away as i was goin to do well all go back together  the old monkey grasped tobys extended hand with his disengaged paw and clinging firmly to it the whole crowd followed in unbroken line chattering and scolding at the most furious rate while every now and then mr stubbs would look back and scream out something which would cause the confusion to cease for an instant  it was really a comical sight but toby seemed to think it the most natural thing in the world that they should follow him in this manner and he chattered to the old monkey quite as fast as any of the others were doing he told him very gravely all that he knew about the accident explained why it was that he conceived the idea of running away and really believed that mr stubbs understood every word he was saying  very shortly after toby had started to run away the proprietor of the circus drove up to the scene of disaster and after seeing that the wagon was being rapidly fixed up so that it could be hauled to the next town he ordered that search should be made for the monkeys it was very important that they should be captured at once and he appeared to think more of the loss of the animals than of the damage done to the wagon  while the men were forming a plan for a search for the truants so that in case of a capture they could let one another know the noise made by toby and his party was heard and the men stood still to learn what it meant  the entire party burst into shouts of laughter as toby and his companions walked into the circle of light formed by the glare of the lanterns and the merriment was by no means abated at tobys serious demeanor the wagon was now standing upright with the door open and toby therefore led his companions directly to it gravely motioning them to enter  the old monkey instead of obeying stepped back to tobys side and screamed to the others in such a manner that they all entered the cage leaving him on the outside with the boy  toby motioned him to get in too but he clung to his hand and scolded so furiously that it was apparent he had no idea of leaving his boy companion one of the men stepped up and was about to force him into the wagon when the proprietor ordered him to stop  what boy is that he asked  job lords new boy said someone in the crowd  the man asked toby how it was that he had succeeded in capturing all the runaways and he answered gravely  mr stubbs an i are good friends an when he saw the others runnin away he just stopped em an brought em back to me i wish youd let mr stubbs ride with me we like each other a good deal  you can do just what you please with mr stubbs as you call him i expected to lose half the monkeys in that cage and you have brought back every one that monkey shall be yours and you may put him in the cage whenever you want to or take him with you just as you choose for he belongs entirely to you  tobys joy knew no bounds he put his arm around the monkeys neck and the monkey clung firmly to him until even job lord was touched at the evidence of affection between the two  while the wagon was being repaired toby and the monkey stood hand in hand watching the work go on while those in the cage scolded and raved because they had been induced to return to captivity after a while the old monkey seated himself on tobys arm and cuddled close up to him uttering now and then a contented sort of a little squeak as the boy talked to him  that night mr stubbs slept in tobys arms in the band wagon and both boy and monkey appeared very well contented with their lot which a short time previous had seemed so hard  when toby awakened to his second days work with the circus his monkey friend was seated by his side gravely exploring his pockets and all the boys treasures were being spread out on the floor of the wagon by his side toby remonstrated with him on this breach of confidence but mr stubbs was more in the mood for sport than for grave conversation and the more toby talked the more mischievous did he become until at length the boy gathered up his little store of treasures took the monkey by the paw and walked him toward the cage from which he had escaped on the previous night  now mr stubbs said toby speaking in an injured tone you must go in here and stay till i have got more time to fool with you  he opened the door of the cage but the monkey struggled as well as he was able and toby was obliged to exert all his strength to put him in  when once the door was fastened upon him toby tried to impress upon his monkey friends mind the importance of being more sedate and he was convinced that the words had sunk deep into mr stubbss heart for by the time he had concluded the old monkey was seated in the corner of the cage looking up from under his shaggy eyebrows in the most reproachful manner possible  toby felt sorry that he had spoken so harshly and was about to make amends for his severity when mr lords gruff voice recalled him to the fact that his time was not his own and he therefore commenced his days work but with a lighter heart than he had had since he stole away from uncle daniel and guilford  this day was not very much different from the preceding one so far as the manner of mr lord and his partner toward the boy was concerned they seemed to have an idea that he was doing only about half as much work as he ought to and both united in swearing at and abusing him as much as possible  so far as his relations with other members of the company were concerned toby now stood in a much better position than before those who had witnessed the scene told the others how toby had led in the monkeys on the night previous and nearly every member of the company had a kind word for the little fellow whose head could hardly be seen above the counter of messrs lord and jacobss booth     ix the dinner party   at noon toby was thoroughly tired out for whenever anyone spoke kindly to him mr lord seemed to take a malicious pleasure in giving him extra tasks to do until toby began to hope that no one else would pay any attention to him on this day he was permitted to go to dinner first and after he returned he was left in charge of the booth trade being dullas it usually was during the dinner hourhe had very little work to do after he had cleaned the glasses and set things to rights generally  when therefore he saw the gaunt form of the skeleton emerge from his tent and come toward him he was particularly pleased for he had begun to think very kindly of the thin man and his fleshy wife  well toby said the skeleton as he came up to the booth carefully dusted mr lords private chair and sat down very cautiously in it as if he expected that it would break down under his weight i hear youve been making quite a hero of yourself by capturing the monkeys last night  tobys freckled face reddened with pleasure as he heard these words and he stammered out with considerable difficulty i didnt do anything it was mr stubbs that brought em back  mr stubbs and the skeleton laughed so heartily that toby was afraid he would dislocate some of his thinly covered joints when you was tellin about mr stubbs yesterday i thought you meant someone belonging to the company you ought to have seen my wife lilly shake with laughing when i told her who mr stubbs was  yes said toby at a loss to know just what to say i should think she would shake when she laughs  she does replied the skeleton if you could see her when something funny strikes her youd think she was one of those big plates of jelly that they have in the bakeshop windows and mr treat looked proudly at the gaudy picture which represented his wife in all her monstrosity of flesh shes a great woman toby an shes got a great head  toby nodded his head in assent he would have liked to say something nice regarding mrs treat but he really did not know what to say so he simply contented himself and the fond husband by nodding  she thinks a good deal of you toby continued the skeleton as he moved his chair to a position more favorable for him to elevate his feet on the edge of the counter and placed his handkerchief under him as a cushion shes talking of you all the time and if you wasnt such a little fellow i should begin to be jealous of youi should upon my word  yourebothverygood stammered toby so weighted down by a sense of the honor heaped upon him as to be at a loss for words  an she wants to see more of you she made me come out here now when she knew mr lord would be away to tell you that were goin to have a little kind of a friendly dinner in our tent tomorrowshes cooked it all herself or shes going toand we want you to come in an have some with us  tobys eyes glistened at the thought of the unexpected pleasure and then his face grew sad as he replied id like to come first rate mr treat but i dont spose mr lord would let me stay away from the shop long enough  why you wont have any work to do tomorrow tobyits sunday  so it is said the boy with a pleased smile as he thought of the day of rest which was so near and then he added quickly an this is saturday afternoon what fun the boys at home are havin you see there haint any school saturday afternoon an all the fellers go out in the woods  and you wish you were there to go with them dont you asked the skeleton sympathetically  indeed i do exclaimed toby quickly its twice as good as any circus that ever was  but you didnt think so before you came with us did you  i didnt know so much about circuses then as i do now replied the boy sadly  mr treat saw that he was touching on a sore subject and one which was arousing sad thoughts in his little companions mind and he hastened to change it at once  then i can tell lilly that youll come can i  oh yes ill be sure to be there an i want you to know just how good i think you both are to me  thats all right toby said mr treat with a pleased expression on his face an you may bring mr stubbs with you if you want  thank you said toby im sure mr stubbs will be just as glad to come as i shall but where will we be tomorrow  right here we always stay over sunday at the place where we show saturday but i must be going or lilly will worry her life out of her for fear im somewhere getting cold shes awful careful of me that woman is youll be on hand tomorrow at one oclock wont you  indeed i will said toby emphatically an ill bring mr stubbs with me too  with a friendly nod of his head the skeleton hurried away to reassure his wife that he was safe and well and before he had hardly disappeared within the tent toby had another caller who was none other than his old friend old ben the driver  well my boy shouted ben in his cheery hearty tones i havent seen you since you left the wagon so sudden last night did you get shook up much  oh no replied toby you see i haint very big an then i struck in the mud so i got off pretty easy  thats a fact an you can thank your lucky stars for it too for ive seen grown up men get pitched off a wagon in that way an break their necks doin it but has job told you where you was going to sleep tonight you know we stay over here till tomorrow  i didnt think anything about that but i spose ill sleep in the wagon wont i  you can sleep at the hotel if you want to but the beds will likely be dirty an if you take my advice youll crawl into some of the wagons in the tent  ben then explained to him that after his work was done that night he would not be expected to report for duty until the time for starting on sunday night and concluded his remarks by saying  now you know what your rights are an dont you let job impose on you in any way ill be round here after you get through work an well bunk in somewhere together  the arrival of messrs lord and jacobs put a stop to the conversation and was the signal for tobys time of trial it seemed to him and with good reason that the chief delight these men had in life was to torment him for neither ever spoke a pleasant word to him and when one was not giving him some difficult work to do or finding fault in some way the other would be sure to do so and toby had very little comfort from the time he began work in the morning until he stopped at night  it was not until after the evening performance was over that toby had a chance to speak with mr stubbs and then he was so tired that he simply took the old monkey from the cage nestled him under his jacket and lay down with him to sleep in the place which old ben had selected  when the morning came mr stubbs aroused his young master at a much earlier hour than he would have awakened had he been left to himself and the two went out for a short walk before breakfast they went instinctively toward the woods and when the shade of the trees was once reached how the two reveled in their freedom mr stubbs climbed into the trees swung himself from one to the other by means of his tail gathered half ripe nuts which he threw at his master tried to catch the birds and had a good time generally  toby stretched at full length on the mossy bank watched the antics of his pet laughing boisterously at times as mr stubbs would do some one thing more comical than usual and forgot there was in this world such a thing as a circus or such a man as job lord it was to toby a morning without a flaw and he took no heed of the time until the sound of the church bells warned him of the lateness of the hour reminding him at the same time of where he should bewhere he would be if he were at home with uncle daniel  in the mean time the old monkey had been trying to attract his young masters attention and failing in his efforts he came down from the tree crept softly up to toby and nestled his head under the boys arm  this little act of devotion seemed to cause tobys grief to burst forth afresh and clasping the monkey around the neck hugging him close to his bosom he sobbed  oh mr stubbs mr stubbs how lonesome we are if we was only at uncle danls wed be the two happiest people in all this world we could play on the hay or go up to the pasture or go down to the village an id work my fingers off if i could only be there just once more it was wicked for me to run away an now im gettin paid for it  he hugged the monkey closely swaying his body to and fro and presenting a perfect picture of grief the monkey not knowing what to make of this changed mood cowered whimperingly in his arms looking up into his face and licking the boys hands whenever he had the opportunity  it was some time before tobys grief exhausted itself and then still clasping the monkey he hurried out of the woods toward the town and the now thoroughly hated circus tents  the clocks were just striking one as toby entered the inclosure used by the show as a place of performance and remembering his engagement with the skeleton and his wife he went directly to their tent from the odors which assailed him as he entered it was very evident that a feast of no mean proportions was in course of preparation and tobys keen appetite returned in full vigor even the monkey seemed affected by the odor for he danced about on his masters shoulder and chattered so that toby was obliged to choke him a little in order to make him present a respectable appearance  when toby reached the interior of the tent he was astonished at the extent of the preparations that were being made and gazed around him in surprise the platform on which the lean man and fat woman were in the habit of exhibiting themselves now bore a long table loaded with eatables and from the fact that eight or ten chairs were ranged around it toby understood that he was not the only guest invited to the feast some little attempt had also been made at decoration by festooning that end of the tent where the platform was placed with two or three flags and some streamers and the tent poles also were fringed with tissue paper of the brightest colors  toby had only time enough to notice this when the skeleton advanced toward him and with the liveliest appearance of pleasure said as he took him by the hands with a grip that made him wince  it gives me great joy mr tyler to welcome you at one of our little home reunions if one can call a tent that is moved every day in the week home  toby hardly knew whom mr treat referred to when he said mr tyler but by the time his hands were released from the bony grasp he understood that it was himself who was spoken to  the skeleton then formally introduced him to the other guests present who were sitting at one end of the tent and evidently anxiously awaiting the coming feast  these said mr treat as he waved his hand toward two white haired pink eyed young ladies who sat with their arms twined around each others waist and had been eying the monkey with some appearance of fear are the miss cushings known to the world as the albino children they command a large salary and form a very attractive feature of our exhibition  the young ladies arose at the same time as if they had been the siamese twins and could not act independently of each other and bowed  toby made the best bow he was capable of and the monkey made frantic efforts to escape as if he would enjoy twisting his paws in their perpendicular hair  and this continued mr treat pointing to a sickly sour looking individual who was sitting apart from the others with his arms folded and looking as if he was counting the very seconds before the dinner should begin is the wonderful signor castro whose sword swallowing feats you have doubtless heard of  toby stepped back just one step as if overwhelmed by awe at beholding the signor in the guise of a humble individual and the gentleman who gained his livelihood by swallowing swords unbent his dignity so far as to unfold his arms and present a very dirty looking hand for toby to shake the boy took hold of the outstretched hand wondering why the signor never used soap and water and mr stubbs apparently afraid of the sour looking man retreated to tobys shoulder where he sat chattering and scolding about the introduction  again the skeleton waved his hand and this time he introduced mademoiselle spelletti the wonderful snake charmer whose exploits in this country and before the crowned heads of europe had caused the whole world to stand aghast at her daring  mademoiselle spelletti was a very ordinary looking young lady of about twentyfive years of age who looked very much as if her name might originally have been murphy and she too extended a hand for toby to grasponly her hand was clean and she appeared to be a very much more pleasant acquaintance than the gentleman who swallowed swords  this ended the introductions and toby was just looking around for a seat when mrs treat the fat lady and the giver of the feast which was about to come and which already smelled so invitingly entered from behind a curtain of canvas where the cooking stove was supposed to be located  she had every appearance of being the cook for the occasion her sleeves were rolled up her hair tumbled and frowzy and there were several unmistakable marks of grease on the front of her calico dress  she waited for no ceremony but rushed up to toby and taking him in her arms gave him such a squeeze that there seemed to be every possibility that she would break all the bones in his body and she kept him so long in this bearlike embrace that mr stubbs reached his little brown paws over and got such a hold of her hair that all present save signor castro rushed forward to release her from the monkeys grasp  you dear little thing said mrs treat paying but slight attention to the hair pulling she had just undergone and holding toby at arms length so that she could look into his face you were so late that i was afraid you wasnt coming and my dinner wouldnt have tasted half so good if you hadnt been here to eat some  toby hardly knew what to say for this hearty welcome and he managed to tell the large and kind hearted lady that he had had no idea of missing the dinner and that he was very glad she wanted him to come  want you to come you dear little thing she exclaimed as she gave him another hug but careful not to give mr stubbs a chance of grasping her hair again of course i wanted you to come for this dinner has been got up so that you could meet these people here and so that they could see you  toby was entirely at a loss to know what to say to this overwhelming compliment and for that reason did not say anything only submitting patiently to the third hug which was all mrs treat had time to give him as she was obliged to rush behind the canvas screen again as there were unmistakable sounds of something boiling over on the stove  youll excuse me said the skeleton with an air of dignity waving his hand once more toward the assembled company but while introducing you to mr tyler i had almost forgotten to introduce him to you this ladies and gentlemenand here he touched toby on the shoulder as if he were some living curiosity whose habits and mode of capture he was about to explain to a party of spectatorsis mr toby tyler of whom you heard on the night when the monkey cage was smashed and who now carries with him the identical monkey which was presented to him by the manager of this great show as a token of esteem for his skill and bravery in capturing the entire lot of monkeys without a single blow  by the time that mr treat got through with his long speech toby felt very much as if he were some wonderful creature whom the skeleton was exhibiting but he managed to rise to his feet and duck his little red head in his best imitation of a bow then he sat down and hugged mr stubbs to cover his confusion  one of the albino children now came forward and while stroking mr stubbss hair looked so intently at toby that for the life of him he couldnt say which she regarded as the curiosity himself or the monkey therefore he hastened to say modestly  i didnt do much toward catchin the monkeys mr stubbs here did almost all of it an i only led em in  there there my boy said the skeleton in a fatherly tone ive heard the whole story from old ben an i shant let you get out of it like that we all know what you did an its no use for you to deny any part of it     x mr stubbs at a party   toby was about to say that he did not intend to represent the matter other than it really was when a voice from behind the canvas screen arrested further conversation  samuel come an help me carry these things in  something very like a smile of satisfaction passed over signor castros face as he heard this which told him that the time for the feast was near at hand and the snake charmer as well as the albino children seemed quite as much pleased as did the sword swallower  you will excuse me ladies and gentlemen said the skeleton in an important tone i must help lilly and then i shall have the pleasure of helping you to some of her cooking which if i do say it that oughtnt is as good as can be found in this entire country  then he too disappeared behind the canvas screen  left alone toby looked at the ladies and the ladies looked at him in perfect silence while the sword swallower grimly regarded them all until mr treat reappeared bearing on a platter an immense turkey as nicely browned as any thanksgiving turkey toby ever saw behind him came his fat wife carrying several dishes each of which emitted a most fragrant odor and as these were placed upon the table the spirits of the sword swallower seemed to revive and he smiled pleasantly while even the ladies appeared animated by the sight and odor of the good things which they were to be called upon so soon to pass judgment  several times did mr and mrs treat bustle in and out from behind the screen and each time they made some addition to that which was upon the table until toby began to fear that they would never finish and the sword swallower seemed unable to restrain his impatience  at last the finishing touch had been put to the table the last dish placed in position and then with a certain kind of grace which no one but a man as thin as mr treat could assume he advanced to the edge of the platform and said  ladies and gentlemen nothing gives me greater pleasure than to invite you all including mr tylers friend stubbs to the bountiful repast which my lilly has prepared for  at this point mr treats speechfor it certainly seemed as if he had commenced to make onewas broken off in a most summary manner his wife had come up behind him and with as much ease as if he had been a child lifted him from off the floor and placed him gently in the chair at the head of the table  come right up and get dinner she said to her guests if you had waited until samuel had finished his speech everything on the table would have been stone cold  the guests proceeded to obey her kindly command and it is to be regretted that the sword swallower had no better manners than to jump on to the platform with one bound and seat himself at the table with the most unseemly haste the others and more especially toby proceeded in a leisurely and more dignified manner  a seat had been placed by the side of the one intended for toby for the accommodation of mr stubbs who suffered a napkin to be tied under his chin and behaved generally in a manner that gladdened the heart of his young master  mr treat cut generous slices from the turkey for each guest and mrs treat piled their plates high with all sorts of vegetables complaining after the manner of housewives generally that the food was not cooked as she would like to have had it and declaring that she had had poor luck with everything that morning when she firmly believed in her heart that her table had never looked better  after the company had had the edge taken off their appetiteswhich effect was produced on the sword swallower only after he had been helped three different times the conversation began by the fat woman asking toby how he got along with mr lord  toby could not give a very good account of his employer but he had the good sense not to cast a damper on a party of pleasure by reciting his own troubles so he said evasively  i guess i shall get along pretty well now that i have got so many friends  just as he had commenced to speak the skeleton had put into his mouth a very large piece of turkeyvery much larger in proportion than himselfand when toby had finished speaking he started to say something evidently not very complimentary to mr lord but what it was the company never knew for just as he opened his mouth to speak the food went down the wrong way his face became a bright purple and it was quite evident that he was choking  toby was alarmed and sprang from his chair to assist his friend upsetting mr stubbs from his seat causing him to scamper up the tent pole with the napkin still tied around his neck and to scold in his most vehement manner before toby could reach the skeleton however the fat woman had darted toward her lean husband caught him by the arm and was pounding his back by the time toby got there so vigorously that the boy was afraid her enormous hand would go through his tissue paper like frame  i wouldnt said toby in alarm you may break him  dont you get frightened said mrs treat turning her husband completely over and still continuing the drumming process hes often taken this way hes such a glutton that hed try to swallow the turkey whole if he could get it in his mouth an hes so thin that most anything sticks in his throat  i should think youd break him all up said toby apologetically as he resumed his seat at the table he dont look as if he could stand very much of that sort of thing  but apparently mr treat could stand very much more than toby gave him credit for because at this juncture he stopped coughing and his face fast assumed its natural hue  his attentive wife seeing that he had ceased struggling lifted him in her arms and sat him down in his chair with a force that threatened to snap his head off  there she said as he wheezed a little from the effects of the shock now see if you can behave yourself an chew your meat as you ought to one of these days when youre alone youll try that game and that ll be the last of you  if hed try to do one of my tricks long enough hed get so that there wouldnt hardly anything choke him the sword swallower ventured to suggest mildly as he wiped a small stream of cranberry sauce from his chin and laid a well polished turkey bone by the side of his plate  id like to see him try it said the fat lady with just a shade of anger in her voice then turning toward her husband she said emphatically samuel dont you ever let me catch you swallowing a sword  i wont my love i wont and i will try to chew my meat more replied the very thin glutton in a feeble tone toby thought that perhaps the skeleton might keep the first part of that promise but he was not quite sure about the last  it required no little coaxing on the part of both toby and mrs treat to induce mr stubbs to come down from his lofty perch but the task was accomplished at last and by the gift of a very large doughnut he was induced to resume his seat at the table  the time had now come when the duties of a host in his own peculiar way of viewing them devolved upon mr treat and he said as he pushed his chair back a short distance from the table and tried to polish the front of his vest with his napkin  i dont want this fact lost sight of because it is an important one everyone must remember that we have gathered here to meet and become better acquainted with the latest and best addition to this circus mr toby tyler  poor toby as the company all looked directly at him and mrs treat nodded her enormous head energetically as if to say that she agreed exactly with her husband the poor boys face grew very red and the squash pie lost its flavor  although mr tyler may not be exactly one of us owing to the fact that he does not belong to the profession but is only one of the adjuncts to it so to speak continued the skeleton in a voice which was fast being raised to its highest pitch we feel proud after his exploits at the time of the accident to have him with us and gladly welcome him now through the medium of this little feast prepared by my lilly  here the albino children nodded their heads in approval and the sword swallower gave a grunt of assent and thus encouraged the skeleton proceeded  i feel when i say that we like and admire mr tyler all present will agree with me and all would like to hear him say a word for himself  the skeleton seemed to have expressed the views of those present remarkably well judging from their expressions of pleasure and assent and all waited for the honored guest to speak  toby knew that he must say something but he couldnt think of a single thing he tried over and over again to call to his mind something which he had read as to how people acted and what they said when they were expected to speak at a dinner table but his thoughts refused to go back for him and the silence was actually becoming painful finally and with the greatest effort he managed to say with a very perceptible stammer and while his face was growing very red  i know i ought to say something to pay for this big dinner that you said was gotten up for me but i dont know what to say unless to thank you for it you see i haint big enough to say much an as uncle danl says i dont amount to very much cept for eatin an i guess hes right youre all real good to me an when i get to be a man ill try to do as much for you  toby had risen to his feet when he began to make his speech and while he was speaking mr stubbs had crawled over into his chair when he finished he sat down again without looking behind him and of course sat plump on the monkey there was a loud outcry from mr stubbs a little frightened noise from toby an instants scrambling and then boy monkey and chair tumbled off the platform landing on the ground in an indescribable mass from which the monkey extricated himself more quickly than toby could and again took refuge on the top of the tent pole  of course all the guests ran to tobys assistance and while the fat woman poked him all over to see that none of his bones were broken the skeleton brushed the dirt from his clothes  all this time the monkey screamed yelled and danced around on the tent pole and ropes as if his feelings had received a shock from which he could never recover  i didnt mean to end it up that way but it was mr stubbss fault said toby as soon as quiet had been restored and the guests with the exception of the monkey were seated at the table once more  of course you didnt said mrs treat in a kindly tone but dont you feel bad about it one bit for you ought to thank your lucky stars that you didnt break any of your bones  i spose i had said toby soberly as he looked back at the scene of his disaster and then up at the chattering monkey that had caused all the trouble  shortly after this mr stubbs having again been coaxed down from his lofty position toby took his departure promising to call as often during the week as he could get away from his exacting employers  just outside the tent he met old ben who said as he showed signs of indulging in another of his internal laughing spells  hello has the skeleton an his lily of a wife been givin a blowout to you too  they invited me in there to dinner said toby modestly  of course they didof course they did replied ben with a chuckle they carries a cookin stove along with em sos they can give these little spreads whenever we stay over a day in a place oh ive been there  and did they ask you to make a speech  of course did they try it on you  yes said toby mournfully an i tumbled off the platform when i got through  i didnt do exactly that replied ben thoughtfully but i spose you got too much steam on seein s how it was likely your first speech now youd better go into the tent an try to get a little sleep cause weve got a long ride tonight over a rough road an you wont get more n a cat nap all night  but where are you going asked toby as he shifted mr stubbs over to his other shoulder preparatory to following his friends advice  im goin to church said ben and then toby noticed for the first time that the old driver had made some attempt at dressing up ive been with the circus man an boy for nigh to forty years an i allus go to meetin once on sunday its somethin i promised my old mother i would do an i haint broke my promise yet  why dont you take me with you asked toby wistfully as he thought of the little church on the hill at home and wishedoh so earnestlythat he was there then even at the risk of being thumped on the head with uncle daniels book  if id seen you this mornin i would said ben but now you must try to bottle up some sleep agin tonight an next sunday ill take you  with these words old ben started off and toby proceeded to carry out his wishes although he rather doubted the possibility of bottling up any sleep that afternoon  he lay down on the top of the wagon after having put mr stubbs inside with the others of his tribe and in a very few moments the boy was sound asleep dreaming of a dinner party at which mr stubbs made a speech and he himself scampered up and down the tent pole     xi a stormy night   when toby awoke it was nearly dark and the bustle around him told very plainly that the time for departure was near at hand he rubbed his eyes just enough to make sure that he was thoroughly awake and then jumped down from his rather lofty bed and ran around to the door of the cage to assure himself that mr stubbs was safe this done his preparations for the journey were made  now toby noticed that each one of the drivers was clad in rubber clothing and after listening for a moment he learned the cause of their waterproof garments it was raining very hard and toby thought with dismay of the long ride that he would have to take on the top of the monkeys cage with no protection whatever save that afforded by his ordinary clothing  while he was standing by the side of his wagon wondering how he should get along old ben came in the water was pouring from his clothes in little rivulets and he afforded most unmistakable evidence of the damp state of the weather  its a nasty night my boy said the old driver in much the same cheery tone that he would have used had he been informing toby that it was a beautiful moonlight evening  i guess ill get wet said toby ruefully as he looked up at the lofty seat which he was to occupy  bless me said ben as if the thought had just come to him it wont do for you to ride outside on a night like this you wait here an ill see what i can do for you  the old man hurried off to the other end of the tent and almost before toby thought he had time to go as far as the ring he returned  its all right he said and this time in a gruff voice as if he were announcing some misfortune you re to ride in the womens wagon come with me  toby followed without a question though he was wholly at a loss to understand what the womens wagon was for he had never seen anything which looked like one  he soon learned however when old ben stopped in frontor rather at the endof a long covered wagon that looked like an omnibus except that it was considerably longer and the seats inside were divided by arms padded to make them comfortable to lean against  heres the boy said ben as he lifted toby up on the step gave him a gentle push to intimate that he was to get inside and then left him  as toby stepped inside he saw that the wagon was nearly full of women and children and fearing lest he should take a seat that belonged to someone else he stood in the middle of the wagon not knowing what to do  why dont you sit down little boy asked one of the ladies after toby had remained standing nearly five minutes and the wagon was about to start  well said toby with some hesitation as he looked around at the two or three empty seats that remained i didnt want to get in anybody elses place an i didnt know where to sit  come right here said the lady as she pointed to a seat by the side of a little girl who did not look any older than toby the lady who usually occupies that seat will not be here tonight and you can have it  thank you maam said toby as he sat timidly down on the edge of the seat hardly daring to sit back comfortably and feeling very awkward meanwhile but congratulating himself on being thus protected from the pouring rain  the wagon started and as each one talked with her neighbor toby felt a most dismal sense of loneliness and almost wished that he was riding on the monkey cart with ben where he could have someone to talk with he gradually pushed himself back into a more comfortable position and had then an opportunity of seeing more plainly the young girl who rode by his side  she was quite as young as toby and small of her age but there was an old look about her face that made the boy think of her as being an old woman cut down to fit childrens clothes toby had looked at her so earnestly that she observed him and asked what is your name  toby tyler  what do you do in the circus  sell candy for mr lord  oh i thought you was a new member of the company  toby knew by the tone of her voice that he had fallen considerably in her estimation by not being one of the performers and it was some little time before he ventured to speak and then he asked timidly what do you do  i ride one of the horses with mother  are you the little girl that comes out with the lady an four horses asked toby in awe that he should be conversing with so famous a person  yes i am dont i do it nicely  why youre a perfect littlelittlefairy exclaimed toby after hesitating a moment to find some word which would exactly express his idea  this praise seemed to please the young lady and in a short time the two became very good friends even if toby did not occupy a more exalted position than that of candy seller she had learned from him all about the accident to the monkey cage and about mr stubbs and in return had told him that her name was ella mason though on the bills she was called mademoiselle jeannette  for a long time the two children sat talking together and then mademoiselle jeannette curled herself up on the seat with her head in her mothers lap and went to sleep  toby had resolved to keep awake and watch her for he was struck with admiration at her face but sleep got the better of him in less than five minutes after he had made the resolution and he sat bolt upright with his little round head nodding and bobbing until it seemed almost certain that he would shake it off  when toby awoke the wagon was drawn up by the side of the road the sun was shining brightly preparations were being made for the entree into town and the harsh voice of mr job lord was shouting his name in a tone that boded no good for poor toby when he should make his appearance  toby would have hesitated before meeting his angry employer but that he knew it would only make matters worse for him when he did show himself and he mentally braced himself for the trouble which he knew was coming the little girl whose acquaintance he had made the night previous was still sleeping and wishing to say goodby to her in some way without awakening her he stooped down and gently kissed the skirt of her dress then he went out to meet his master  mr lord was thoroughly enraged when toby left the wagon and saw the boy just as he stepped to the ground the angry man gave a quick glance around to make sure that none of tobys friends were in sight and then caught him by the coat collar and commenced to whip him severely with the small rubber cane that he usually carried  mr job lord lifted the poor boy entirely clear of the ground and each blow that he struck could be heard almost the entire length of the circus train  youve been makin so many acquaintances here that you haint willin to do any work he said savagely as he redoubled the force of his blows  oh please stop please stop shrieked the poor boy in his agony ill do everything you tell me to if you wont strike me again  this piteous appeal seemed to have no effect upon the cruel man and he continued to whip the boy despite his cries and entreaties until his arm fairly ached from the exertion and tobys body was crossed and recrossed with the livid marks of the cane  now lets see whether youll tend to your work or not said the man as he flung toby from him with such force that the boy staggered reeled and nearly fell into the little brook that flowed by the roadside ill make you understand that all the friends youve whined around in this show cant save you from a lickin when i get ready to give you one now go an do your work that ought to have been done an hour ago  mr lord walked away with the proud consciousness of a man who has achieved a great victory and toby was limping painfully along toward the cart that was used in conveying mr lords stock in trade when he felt a tiny hand slip into his and heard a childish voice say  dont cry toby sometime when i get big enough ill make mr lord sorry that he whipped you as he did and im big enough now to tell him just what kind of a man i think he is  looking around toby saw his little acquaintance of the evening previous and he tried to force back the big tears that were rolling down his cheeks as he said in a voice choked with grief youre awful good an i dont mind the lickin when you say youre sorry for me i spose i deserve it for runnin away from uncle danl  did it hurt you much she asked feelingly  it did when he was doin it replied toby manfully but it dont a bit now that youve come  then ill go and talk to that mr lord and ill come and see you again after we get into town said the little miss as she hurried away to tell the candy vender what she thought of him  that day as on all others since he had been with the circus toby went to his work with a heavy heart and time and time again did he count the money which had been given him by kind hearted strangers to see whether he had enough to warrant his attempting to run away three dollars and twentyfive cents was the total amount of his treasure and large as that sum appeared to him he could not satisfy himself that he had sufficient to enable him to get back to the home which he had so wickedly left whenever he thought of this home of the uncle daniel who had in charity cared for hima motherless fatherless boyand of returning to it with not even as much right as the prodigal son of whom he had heard uncle daniel tell his heart sank within him and he doubted whether he would be allowed to remain even if he should be so fortunate as ever to reach guilford again  this day passed so far as toby was concerned very much as had the others he could not satisfy either of his employers try as hard as he might but as usual he met with two or three kindly disposed people who added to the fund that he was accumulating for his second venture of running away by little gifts of money each one of which gladdened his heart and made his trouble a trifle less hard to bear  during the entire week he was thus equally fortunate each day added something to his fund and each night it seemed to toby that he was one day nearer the freedom for which he so ardently longed  the skeleton the fat lady old ben the albino children little ella and even the sword swallower all gave him a kindly word as they passed him while he was at his work or saw him as the preparations for the grand entree were being made  the time had passed slowly to toby and yet sunday came againas sundays always come and on this day old ben hunted him up made him wash his face and hands until they fairly shone from very cleanliness and then took him to church toby was surprised to find that it was really a pleasant thing to be able to go to church after being deprived of it and was more light hearted than he had yet been since he left guilford when he returned to the tent at noon  the skeleton had invited him to another dinner party but toby had declined the invitation agreeing to present himself in time for supper instead he hardly cared to go through the ordeal of another state dinner and besides he wanted to go off to the woods with the old monkey where he could enjoy the silence of the forest which seemed like a friend to him because it reminded him of home  taking the monkey with him as usual he inquired the nearest way to a grove and without waiting for dinner started off for an afternoons quiet enjoyment     xii tobys great misfortune   the town in which the circus remained over sunday was a small one and a brisk walk of ten minutes sufficed to take toby into a secluded portion of a very thickly grown wood where he could lie upon the mossy ground and fairly revel in freedom  as he lay upon his back his hands under his head and his eyes directed to the branches of the trees above where the birds twittered and sung and the squirrels played in fearless sport the monkey enjoyed himself in his way by playing all the monkey antics he knew of  he scrambled from tree to tree swung himself from one branch to the other by the aid of his tail and amused both himself and his master until tired by his exertions he crept down by tobys side and lay there in quiet restful content  one of tobys reasons for wishing to be by himself that afternoon was that he wanted to think over some plan of escape for he believed that he had nearly money enough to enable him to make a bold stroke for freedom and uncle daniels therefore when the monkey nestled down by his side he was all ready to confide in him that which had been occupying his busy little brain for the past three days  mr stubbs he said to the monkey in a solemn tone were goin to run away in a day or two  mr stubbs did not seem to be moved in the least at this very startling piece of intelligence but winked his bright eyes in unconcern and toby seeming to think that everything which he said had been understood by the monkey continued ive got a good deal of money now an i guess theres enough for us to start out on well get away some night an stay in the woods till they get through hunting for us an then well go back to guilford an tell uncle danl if hell only take us back well never go to sleep in meetin any more an well be just as good as we know how now lets see how much money weve got  toby drew from a pocket which he had been at a great deal of trouble to make in his shirt a small bag of silver and spread it upon the ground where he could count it at his leisure  the glittering coin instantly attracted the monkeys attention and he tried by every means to thrust his little black paw into the pile but toby would allow nothing of that sort and pushed him away quite roughly then he grew excited and danced and scolded around tobys treasure until the boy had hard work to count it  he did succeed however and as he carefully replaced it in the bag he said to the monkey theres seven dollars an thirty cents in that bag an every cent of it is mine that ought to take care of us for a good while mr stubbs an by the time we get home we shall be rich men  the monkey showed his pleasure at this intelligence by putting his hand inside tobys clothes to find the bag of treasure that he had seen secreted there and two or three times to the great delight of both himself and the boy he drew forth the bag which was immediately taken away from him  the shadows were beginning to lengthen in the woods and heeding this warning of the coming night toby took the monkey on his arm and started for home or for the tent which was the only place he could call home  as he walked along he tried to talk to his pet in a serious manner but the monkey remembering where he had seen the bright coins secreted tried so hard to get at them that finally toby lost all patience and gave him quite a hard cuff on the ear which had the effect of keeping him quiet for a time  that night toby took supper with the skeleton and his wife and he enjoyed the meal even though it was made from what had been left of the turkey that served as the noonday feast more than he did the state dinner where he was obliged to pay for what he ate by the torture of making a speech  there were no guests but toby present and mr and mrs treat were not only very kind but so attentive that he was actually afraid he should eat so much as to stand in need of some of the catnip tea which mrs treat had said she gave to her husband when he had been equally foolish the skeleton would pile his plate high with turkey bones from one side and the fat lady would heap it up whenever she could find a chance with all sorts of food from the other until toby pushed back his chair his appetite completely satisfied if it never had been so before  toby had discussed the temper of his employer with his host and hostess and after some considerable conversation confided in them his determination to run away  id hate awfully to have you go said mrs treat reflectively but its a good deal better for you to get away from that job lord if you can it wouldnt do to let him know that you had any idea of goin for hed watch you as a cat watches a mouse an never let you go so long as he saw a chance to keep you i heard him tellin one of the drivers the other day that you sold more goods than any other boy he ever had an he was going to keep you with him all summer  be careful in what you do my boy said the skeleton sagely as he arranged a large cushion in an armchair and proceeded to make ready for his after dinner nap be sure that youre all ready before you start an when you do go get a good ways ahead of him for if he should ever catch you the trouncin youd get would be awful  toby assured his friends that he would use every endeavor to make his escape successful when he did start and mrs treat with an eye to the boys comfort said let me know the night youre goin an ill fix you up something to eat sos you wont be hungry before you come to a place where you can buy something  as these kind hearted people talked with him and were ready thus to aid him in every way that lay in their power toby thought that he had been very fortunate in thus having made so many kind friends in a place where he was having so much trouble  it was not until he heard the sounds of preparation for departure that he left the skeletons tent and then with mr stubbs clasped tightly to his breast he hurried over to the wagon where old ben was nearly ready to start  all right toby said the old driver as the boy came in sight i was afraid you was goin to keep me waitin for the first time jump right up on the box for there haint no time to lose an i guess youll have to carry the monkey in your arms for i dont want to stop to open the cage now  id just as soon carry him an a little rather said toby as he clambered up on the high seat and arranged a comfortable place in his lap for his pet to sit  in another moment the heavy team had started and nearly the entire circus was on the move now tell me what youve been doin since i left you said old ben after they were well clear of the town and he could trust his horses to follow the team ahead i spose youve been to see the skeleton an his mountain of a wife  toby gave a clear account of where he had been and what he had done and when he concluded he told old ben of his determination to run away and asked his advice on the matter  my advice said ben after he had waited some time to give due weight to his words is that you clear out from this show just as soon as you can this haint no fit place for a boy of your age to be in an the sooner you get back where you started from an get to school the better but job lord will do all he can to keep you from goin if he thinks you have any idea of leavin him  toby assured ben as he had assured the skeleton and his wife that he would be very careful in all he did and lay his plans with the utmost secrecy and then he asked whether ben thought the amount of money which he had would be sufficient to carry him home  waal that depends said the driver slowly if you go to spreadin yourself all over creation as boys are very apt to do your money wont go very far but if you look at your money two or three times afore you spend it you ought to get back and have a dollar or two left  the two talked and old ben offered advice until toby could hardly keep his eyes open and almost before the driver concluded his sage remarks the boy had stretched himself on the top of the wagon where he had learned to sleep without being shaken off and was soon in dreamland  the monkey nestled down snug in tobys bosom did not appear to be as sleepy as was his master but popped his head in and out from under the coat as if watching whether the boy was asleep or not  toby was awakened by a scratching on his face as if the monkey was dancing a hornpipe on that portion of his body and by a shrill quick chattering which caused him to assume an upright position instantly  he was frightened although he knew not at what and looked around quickly to discover the cause of the monkeys excitement  old ben was asleep on his box while the horses jogged along behind the other teams and toby failed to see anything whatever which should have caused his pet to become so excited  lie down an behave yourself said toby as sternly as possible and as he spoke he took his pet by the collar to oblige him to obey his command  the moment that he did this he saw the monkey throw something out into the road and the next instant he also saw that he held something tightly clutched in his other paw  it required some little exertion and active movement on tobys part to enable him to get hold of that paw in order to discover what it was which mr stubbs had captured but the instant he did succeed there went up from his heart such a cry of sorrow as caused old ben to start up in alarm and the monkey to cower and whimper like a whipped dog  what is it toby whats the matter asked the old driver as he peered out into the darkness ahead as if he feared some danger threatened them from that quarter i dont see anything what is it  mr stubbs has thrown all my money away cried toby holding up the almost empty bag which a short time previous had been so well filled with silver  stubbsthrownthemoneyaway repeated ben with a pause between each word as if he could not understand that which he himself was saying  yes sobbed toby as he shook out the remaining contents of the bag theres only half a dollar an all the rest is gone  the rest gone again repeated ben but how come the monkey to have the money  he tried to get at it out in the woods an i spose the moment i got asleep he felt for it in my pockets this is all there is left an he threw away some just as i woke up  again toby held the bag up where ben could see it and again his grief broke out anew  ben could say nothing he realized the whole situationthat the monkey had got the moneybag while toby was sleeping that in his play he had thrown it away piece by piece and he knew that that small amount of silver represented liberty in the boys eyes he felt that there was nothing he could say which would assuage tobys grief and he remained silent  dont you spose we could go back an get it asked the boy after the intensity of his grief had somewhat subsided  no toby its gone replied ben sorrowfully you couldnt find it if it was daylight an you dont stand a ghost of a chance now in the dark dont take on so my boy ill see if we cant make it up to you in some way  toby gave no heed to this last remark of bens he hugged the monkey convulsively to his breast as if he would seek consolation from the very one who had wrought the ruin and rocking himself to and fro he said in a voice full of tears and sorrow  oh mr stubbs why did you do itwhy did you do it that money would have got us away from this hateful place an wed have gone back to uncle danls where wed have been so happy you an me an now its all goneall gone what made you mr stubbswhat made you do such a bad cruel thing oh what made you  dont tobydont take on so said ben soothingly there wasnt so very much money there after all an youll soon get as much more  but it wont be for a good while an we could have been in the good old home long before i can get so much again  thats true my boy but you must kinder brace up an not give way so about it perhaps i can fix it so the fellers will make it up to you give stubbs a good poundin an perhaps that ll make you feel better  that wont bring back my money an i dont want to whip him cried toby hugging his pet the closer because of this suggestion i know what it is to get a whippin an i wouldnt whip a dog much less mr stubbs who didnt know any better  then you must try to take it like a man said ben who could think of no other plan by which the boy might soothe his feelings it haint half so bad as it might be an you must try to keep a stiff upper lip even if it does seem hard at first  this keeping a stiff upper lip in the face of all the trouble he was having was all very well to talk about but toby could not reduce it to practice or at least not so soon after he knew of his loss and he continued to rock the monkey back and forth to whisper in his ear now and then and to cry as if his heart was breaking for nearly an hour  ben tried in his rough honest way to comfort him but without success and it was not until the boys grief had spent itself that he would listen to any reasoning  all this time the monkey had remained perfectly quiet submitting to tobys squeezing without making any effort to get away and behaving as if he knew he had done wrong and was trying to atone for it he looked up into the boys face every now and then with such a penitent expression that toby finally assured him of forgiveness and begged him not to feel so badly     xiii toby attempts to resign his situation   at last it was possible for toby to speak of his loss with some degree of calmness and then he immediately began to reckon up what he could have done with the money if he had not lost it  now see here toby said ben earnestly dont go to doin anything of that kind the moneys lost an you cant get it back by talkin so the very best thing for you is to stop thinkin what you could do if you had it an just to look at it as a goner  but persisted toby  i tell you theres no buts about it said ben rather sharply stop talkin about whats gone an just go to thinkin how youll get more do what youve a mind to the monkey but dont keep broodin over what you cant help  toby knew that the advice was good and he struggled manfully to carry it into execution but it was very hard work at all events there was no sleep for his eyes that night and when just about daylight the train halted to wait a more seasonable hour in which to enter the town the thought of what he might have done with his lost money was still in tobys mind  only once did he speak crossly to the monkey and that was when he put him into the cage preparatory to commencing his mornings work then he said  you wouldnt had to go into this place many times more if you hadnt been so wicked for by tomorrow night wed been away from this circus an on the way to home an uncle danl now youve spoiled my chance an your own for a good while to come an i hope before the day is over youll feel as bad about it as i do  it seemed to toby as if the monkey understood just what he said to him for he sneaked over into one corner away from the other monkeys and sat there looking very penitent and very dejected  then with a heavy heart toby began his days work  hard as had been tobys lot previous to losing his money and difficult as it had been to bear the cruelty of mr job lord and his precious partner mr jacobs it was doubly hard now while this sorrow was fresh upon him  previous to this when he had been kicked or cursed by one or the other of the partners toby thought exultantly that the time was not very far distant when he should be beyond the reach of his brutal taskmasters and that thought had given him strength to bear all that had been put upon him  now the time of his deliverance from this bondage seemed very far off and each cruel word or blow caused him the greater sorrow because of the thought that but for the monkeys wickedness he would have been nearly free from that which made his life so very miserable  if he had looked sad and mournful before he looked doubly so now as he went his dreary round of the tent crying heres your cold lemonade or fresh baked peanuts ten cents a quart and each day there were some in the audience who pitied the boy because of the misery which showed so plainly in his face and they gave him a few cents more than his price for what he was selling or gave him money without buying anything at all thereby aiding him to lay up something again toward making his escape  those few belonging to the circus who knew of tobys intention to escape tried their best to console him for the loss of his money and that kind hearted couple the skeleton and his fat wife tried to force him to take a portion of their scanty earnings in the place of that which the monkey had thrown away but this toby positively refused to do and to the arguments which they advanced as reasons why they should help him along he only replied that until he could get the money by his own exertions he would remain with messrs lord and jacobs and get along as best he could  every hour in the day the thought of what might have been if he had not lost his money so haunted his mind that finally he resolved to make one bold stroke and tell mr job lord that he did not want to travel with the circus any longer  as yet he had not received the two dollars which had been promised him for his two weeks work and another one was nearly due if he could get this money it might with what he had saved again suffice to pay his railroad fare to guilford and if it would not he resolved to accept from the skeleton sufficient to make up the amount needed  he naturally shrank from the task but the hope that he might possibly succeed gave him the necessary amount of courage and when he had gotten his work done on the third morning after he had lost his money and mr lord appeared to be in an unusually good temper he resolved to try the plan  it was just before the dinner hour trade had been exceptionally good and mr lord had even spoken in a pleasant tone to toby when he told him to fill up the lemonade pail with water so that the stock might not be disposed of too quickly and with too little profit  toby poured in quite as much water as he thought the already weak mixture could receive and retain any flavor of lemon and then as his employer motioned him to add more he mixed another quart in secretly wondering what it would taste like  when youre mixin lemonade for circus trade said mr lord in such a benign fatherly tone that one would have found it difficult to believe that he ever spoke harshly dont be afraid of water for theres where the profit comes in always have a piece of lemon peel floatin on the top of every glass an it tastes just as good to people as if it cost twice as much  toby could not agree exactly with that opinion neither did he think it wise to disagree more especially since he was going to ask the very great favor of being discharged therefore he nodded his head gravely and began to stir up what it pleased mr lord to call lemonade so that the last addition might be more thoroughly mixed with the others  two or three times he attempted to ask the favor which seemed such a great one and each time the words stuck in his throat until it seemed to him that he should never succeed in getting them out  finally in his despair he stammered out dont you think you could find another boy in this town mr lord  mr lord moved round sideways in order to bring his crooked eye to bear squarely on toby and then there was a long interval of silence during which time the boys color rapidly came and went and his heart beat very fast with suspense and fear  well what if i could he said at length do you think that trade is so good i could afford to keep two boys when there isnt half work enough for one  toby stirred the lemonade with renewed activity as if by this process he was making both it and his courage stronger and said in a low voice which mr lord could scarcely hear  i didnt think that but you see i ought to go home for uncle danl will worry about me an besides i dont like a circus very well  again there was silence on mr lords part and again the crooked eye glowered down on toby  so he saidand toby could see that his anger was rising very fastyou dont like a circus very well an you begin to think that your uncle daniel will worry about you eh well i want you to understand that it dont make any difference to me whether you like a circus or not and i dont care how much your uncle daniel worries you mean that you want to get away from me after ive been to all the trouble and expense of teaching you the business  toby bent his head over the pail and stirred away as if for dear life  if you think youre going to get away from here until youve paid me for all youve eat an all the time ive spent on you youre mistaken thats all youve had an easy time with metoo easy in factand thats what ails you now you just let me hear two words more out of your head about going awayonly two morean ill show you what a whipping is ive only been playing with you before when you thought you were getting a whipping but youll find out what it means if i so much as see a thought in your eyes about goin away an dont you dare to try to give me the slip in the night an run away for if you do ill follow you an have you arrested now you mind your eye in the future  it is impossible to say how much longer mr lord might have continued this tirade had not a member of the companyone of the principal riderscalled him to one side to speak with him  poor toby was so much confused by the angry words which had followed his very natural and certainly very reasonable suggestion that he paid no attention to anything around him until he heard his own name mentioned and then fearing lest some new misfortune was about to befall him he listened intently  im afraid you couldnt do much of anything with him he heard mr lord say hes had enough of this kind of life already so he says an i expect the next thing he does will be to try and run away  ill risk his getting away from you job he heard the other say but of course ive got to take my chances ill take him in hand from eleven to twelve each dayjust your slack time of tradeand ill not only give you half of what he can earn in the next two years but ill pay you for his time if he gives you the slip before the season is out  toby knew that they were speaking of him but what it all meant he could not imagine  what are you going to do with him first job asked  just put him right in the ring and teach him what riding is i tell you job the boys smart enough and before the seasons over ill have him so that he can do some of the bareback acts and perhaps well get some money out of him before we go into winter quarters  toby understood the meaning of their conversation only too well and he knew that his lot which before seemed harder than he could bear was about to be intensified through this mr castle of whom he had frequently heard and who was said to be a rival of mr lords so far as brutality went the two men now walked toward the large tent and toby was left alone with his thoughts and two or three little boy customers who looked at him wonderingly and envied him because he belonged to the circus  during the ride that night he told old ben what he had heard confidently expecting that that friend at least would console him but ben was not the champion which he had expected the old man who had been with a circus man and boy nigh to forty years did not seem to think it any calamity that he was to be taught to ride  that mr castle is a little rough on boys old ben said thoughtfully but itll be a good thing for you toby just so long as you stay with job you wont be nothin more n a candy boy but after you know how to ride it ll be another thing an you can earn a good deal of money an be your own boss  but i dont want to stay with the circus whined toby i dont want to learn to ride an i do want to get back to uncle danl  that may all be true an i dont dispute it said ben but you see you didnt stay with your uncle daniel when you had the chance an you did come with the circus youve told job you wanted to leave an he ll be watchin you all the time to see that you dont give him the slip now whats the consequence why you cant get away for a while anyhow an youd better try to amount to something while you are here perhaps after youve got so you can ride you may want to stay an ill see to it that you get all of your wages except enough to pay castle for learnin of you  i shant want to stay said toby i wouldnt stay if i could ride all the horses at once an was gettin a hundred dollars a day  but you cant ride one horse an you haint gettin but a dollar a week an still i dont see any chance of your gettin away yet awhile said ben in a matter of fact tone as he devoted his attention again to his horses leaving toby to his own sad reflections and the positive conviction that boys who run away from home do not have a good time except in stories  the next forenoon while toby was deep in the excitement of selling to a boy no larger than himself and with just as red hair three cents worth of peanuts and two sticks of candy and while the boy was trying to induce him to throw in a piece of gum because of the quantity purchased job lord called him aside and toby knew that his troubles had begun  i want you to go in an see mr castle hes goin to show you how to ride said mr lord in as kindly a tone as if he were conferring some favor on the boy  if toby had dared to he would have rebelled then and there and refused to go but as he hadnt the courage for such proceeding he walked meekly into the tent and toward the ring     xiv mr castle teaches toby to ride   when toby got within sight of the ring he was astonished at what he saw a horse with a broad wooden saddle was being led slowly around the ring mr castle was standing on one side with a long whip in his hand and on the tent pole which stood in the center of the ring was a long arm from which dangled a leathern belt attached to a long rope that was carried through the end of the arm and run down to the base of the pole  toby knew well enough why the horse the whip and the man were there but the wooden projection from the tent pole which looked so much like a gallows he could not understand at all  come now said mr castle cracking his whip ominously as toby came in sight why werent you here before  mr lord just sent me in said toby not expecting that his excuse would be received for they never had been since he had arrived at the height of his ambition by joining the circus  then ill make mr job understand that i am to have my full hour of your time and if i dont get it there ll be trouble between us  it would have pleased toby very well to have had mr castle go out with his long whip just then and make trouble for mr lord but mr castle had not the time to spare because of the trouble which he was about to make for toby and that he commenced on at once  well get in here and dont waste any more time he said sharply  toby looked around curiously for a moment and not understanding exactly what he was expected to get in and do asked what shall i do  pull off your boots coat and vest  since there was no other course than to learn to ride toby wisely concluded that the best thing he could do would be to obey his new master without question so he began to take off his clothes with as much alacrity as if learning to ride was the one thing upon which he had long set his heart  mr castle was evidently accustomed to prompt obedience for he not only took it as a matter of course but endeavored to hurry toby in the work of undressing  with his desire to please and urged by mr castles words and the ominous shaking of his whip tobys preparations were soon made and he stood before his instructor clad only in his shirt trousers and stockings  the horse was led around to where he stood and when mr castle held out his hand to help him to mount toby jumped up quickly without aid thereby making a good impression at the start as a willing lad  now said the instructor as he pulled down the leathern belt which hung from the rope and fastened it around tobys waist stand up in the saddle and try to keep there you cant fall because the rope will hold you up even if the horse goes out from under you but it isnt hard work to keep on if you mind what you are about and if you dont this whip will help you now stand up  toby did as he was bid and as the horse was led at a walk and as he had the long bridle to aid him in keeping his footing he had no difficulty in standing during the time that the horse went once around the ring but that was all  mr castle seemed to think that this was preparation enough for the boy to be able to understand how to ride and he started the horse into a canter as might have been expected toby lost his balance the horse went on ahead and he was left dangling at the end of the rope very much like a crab that has just been caught by the means of a pole and line  toby kicked waved his hands and floundered about generally but all to no purpose until the horse came round again and then he made frantic efforts to regain his footing which efforts were aidedor perhaps it would be more proper to say retardedby the long lash of mr castles whip that played around his legs with merciless severity  stand up stand up cried his instructor as toby reeled first to one side and then to the other now standing erect in the saddle and now dangling at the end of the rope with the horse almost out from under him  this command seemed needless as it was exactly what toby was trying to do but as it was given he struggled all the harder until it seemed to him that the more he tried the less did he succeed  and this first lesson progressed in about the same way until the hour was over save that now and then mr castle would give him some good advice but oftener he would twist the long lash of the whip around the boys legs with such force that toby believed the skin had been taken entirely off  it may have been a relief to mr castle when this first lesson was concluded and it certainly was to toby for he had had all the teaching in horsemanship that he wanted and he thought with deepest sorrow that this would be of daily occurrence during all the time that he remained with the circus  as he went out of the tent he stopped to speak with his friend the old monkey and his troubles seemed to have increased when he stood in front of the cage calling mr stubbs mr stubbs and the old fellow would not even come down from off the lofty perch where he was engaged in monkey gymnastics with several younger companions it seemed to him as he afterward told ben as if mr stubbs had gone back on him because he knew that he was in trouble  when he went toward the booth mr lord looked at him around the corner of the canvasfor it seemed to toby that his employer could look around a square corner with much greater ease than he could straight aheadwith a disagreeable leer in his eye as though he enjoyed the misery which he knew his little clerk had just undergone  can you ride yet he asked mockingly as toby stepped behind the counter to attend to his regular line of business  toby made no reply for he knew that the question was only asked sarcastically and not through any desire for information in a few moments mr lord left him to attend to the booth alone and went into the tent where toby rightly conjectured he had gone to question mr castle upon the result of the lesson just given  that night old ben asked him how he had got on while under the teaching of mr castle and toby knowing that the question was asked because of the real interest which ben had in his welfare replied  if i was tryin to learn how to swing round the ring strapped to a rope i should say that i got along first rate but i dont know much about the horse for i was only on his back a little while at a time  youll get over that soon said old ben patronizingly as he patted him on the back you remember my words now i say that youve got it in you an if youve a mind to take hold an try to learn youll come out on the top of the heap yet an be one of the smartest riders theyve got in this show  i dont want to be a rider said toby sadly i only want to get back home once more an then youll see how much it ll take to get me away again  well said ben quietly be that as it may while youre here the best thing you can do is to take hold an get ahead just as fast as you can it ll make it a mighty sight easier for you while youre with the show an it wont spoil any of your chances for runnin away whenever the time comes  toby fully appreciated the truth of this remark and he assured ben that he should do all in his power to profit by the instruction given and to please this new master who had been placed over him  and with this promise he lay back on the seat and went to sleep not to awaken until the preparations were being made for the entree into the next town and mr lords harsh voice had cried out his name with no gentle tone several times  tobys first lesson with mr castle was the most pleasant one he had for after the boy had once been into the ring his master seemed to expect that he could do everything which he was told to do and when he failed in any little particular the long lash of the whip would go curling around his legs or arms until the little fellows body and limbs were nearly covered with the blue and black stripes  for three lessons only was the wooden upright used to keep him from falling after that he was forced to ride standing erect on the broad wooden saddle or pad as it is properly called and whenever he lost his balance and fell there was no question asked as to whether or not he had hurt himself but he was mercilessly cut with the whip  messrs lord and jacobs gained very much by comparison with mr castle in tobys mind he had thought that his lot could not be harder than it was with them but when he had experienced the pains of two or three of mr castles lessons in horsemanship he thought that he would stay with the candy venders all the season cheerfully rather than take six more lessons of mr castle  night after night he fell asleep from the sheer exhaustion of crying as he had been pouring out his woes in the old monkeys ears and laying his plans to run away now more than ever was he anxious to get away and yet each day was taking him farther from home and consequently necessitating a larger amount of money with which to start as old ben did not give him as much sympathy as toby thought he ought to givefor the old man while he would not allow mr job lord to strike the boy if he was near thought it a necessary portion of the education for mr castle to lash him all he had a mind tohe poured out all his troubles in the old monkeys ears and kept him with him from the time he ceased work at night until he was obliged to commence again in the morning  the skeleton and his wife thought tobys lot a hard one and tried by every means in their power to cheer the poor boy neither one of them could say to mr castle what they had said to mr lord for the rider was a far different sort of a person and one whom they would not be allowed to interfere with in any way therefore poor toby was obliged to bear his troubles and his whippings as best he might with only the thought to cheer him of the time when he could leave them all by running away  but despite all his troubles toby learned to ride faster than his teacher had expected he would and in three weeks he found little or no difficulty in standing erect while his horse went around the ring at his fastest gait after that had been accomplished his progress was more rapid and he gave promise of becoming a very good ridera fact which pleased both mr castle and mr lord very much as they fancied that in another year toby would be the source of a very good income to them  the proprietor of the circus took considerable interest in tobys instruction and promised mr castle that mademoiselle jeannette and toby should do an act together in the performance just as soon as the latter was sufficiently advanced the boys costume had been changed after he could ride without falling off and now while he was in the ring he wore the same as that used by the regular performers  the little girl had after it was announced that she and toby were to perform together been an attentive observer during the hour that toby was under mr castles direction and she gave him many suggestions that were far more valuable and quicker to be acted upon than those given by the teacher himself  tomorrow you two will go through the exercise together said mr castle to toby and ella at the close of one of tobys lessons after he had become so skillful that he could stand with ease on the pad and even advanced so far that he could jump through a hoop without falling more than twice out of three times  the little girl appeared highly delighted by this information and expressed her joy  it will be real nice she said to toby after mr castle had left them alone i can help you lots and it wont be very long before we can do an act all by ourselves in the performance and then wont the people clap their hands when we come in  it ll be better for you tomorrow than it will for me said toby rubbing his legs sorrowfully still feeling the sting of the whip you see mr castle wont dare to whip you an he ll make it all count on me cause he knows mr lord likes to have him whip me  but i shant make any mistake said ella confidently and so you wont have to be whipped on my account and while i am on the horse you cant be whipped for he couldnt do it without whipping me so you see you wont get only half as much  toby brightened up a little under the influence of this argument but his countenance fell again as he thought that his chances for getting away from the circus were growing less each day  you see i want to get back to uncle danl an guilford he said confidentially i dont want to stay here a single minute  ella opened her eyes in wide astonishment as she cried dont want to stay here why dont you go home then  cause job lord wont let me said toby wondering if it was possible that his little companion did not know exactly what sort of a man his master was  then he told herafter making her give him all kinds of promises including the ceremony of crossing her throat that she would never tell a single soulthat he had had many thoughts and had formed all kinds of plans for running away he told her about losing his money about his friendship for the skeleton and the fat lady and at last he confided in her that he was intending to take the old monkey with him when he should make the attempt  she listened with the closest attention and when he told her that his little hoard had now reached the sum of seven dollars and ten centsalmost as much as he had beforeshe said eagerly ive got three little gold dollars in my trunk an you shall have them all theyre my very own for mamma gave them to me to do just what i wanted to with them but i dont see how you can take mr stubbs with you for that would be stealing  no it wouldnt neither said toby stoutly wasnt he give to me to do just as i wanted to with an didnt the boss say he was all mine  oh id forgotten that said ella thoughtfully i suppose you can take him but hell be awfully in the way wont he  no said toby anxious to say a good word for his pet he always does just what i want him to an when i tell him what im tryin to do hell be as good as anything but i cant take your dollars  why not  cause that wouldnt be right for a boy to let a girl littler than himself help him ill wait till i get money enough of my own an then ill go  but i want you to take my money too i want you to have it  no i cant take it said toby shaking his head resolutely as he put the golden temptation from him and then as a happy thought occurred to him he said quickly i tell you what to do with your dollars you keep them till you grow up to be a woman an when im a man ill come an then well buy a circus of our own i think perhaps id like to be with a circus if i owned one myself well have lots of money then an can do just what we want to  this idea seemed to please the little girl and the two began to lay all sorts of plans for that time when they should be man and woman have lots of money and be able to do just what they wanted to  they had been sitting on the edge of the newly made ring while they were talking and before they had half finished making plans for the future one of the attendants came in to put things to order and they were obliged to leave their seats she going to the hotel to get ready for the afternoons performance and toby to try to do such work as mr job had laid out for him  just ten weeks from the time toby had first joined the circus mr castle informed him and ella that they were to appear in public on the following day they had been practicing daily and toby had become so skillful that both mr castle and mr lord saw that the time had come when he could be made to earn some money for them     xv tobys friends present him with a costume   during this time tobys funds had accumulated rather slower than on the first few days he was in the business but he had saved eleven dollars and mr lord had paid him five dollars of his salary so that he had the to him enormous sum of sixteen dollars and he had about made up his mind to make one effort for liberty when the news came that he was to ride in public  he had in fact been ready to run away any time within the past week but as if they had divined his intentions both mr castle and mr lord had kept a very strict watch over him one or the other keeping him in sight from the time he got through with his labors at night until they saw him on the cart with old ben  i was just gettin ready to run away said toby to ella on the day mr castle gave his decision as to their taking part in the performance and while they were walking out of the tent an i shouldnt wonder now if i got away tonight  oh toby exclaimed the girl as she looked reproachfully at him after all the work weve had to get ready you wont go off and leave me before weve had a chance to see what the folks will say when they see us together  it was impossible for toby to feel any delight at the idea of riding in public and he would have been willing to have taken one of mr lords most severe whippings if he could have escaped from it but he and ella had become such firm friends and he had conceived such a boyish admiration for her that he felt as if he were willing to bear almost anything for the sake of giving her pleasure therefore he said after a few moments reflection well i wont go tonight anyway even if i have the best chance that ever was ill stay one day more anyhow an perhaps ill have to stay a good many  thats a nice boy said ella positively as toby thus gave his decision and ill kiss you for it  before toby fully realized what she was about almost before he had understood what she said she had put her arms around his neck and given him a good sound kiss right on his freckled face  toby was surprised astonished and just a little bit ashamed he had never been kissed by a girl beforevery seldom by anyone save the fat ladyand he hardly knew what to do or say he blushed until his face was almost as red as his hair and this color had the effect of making his freckles stand out with startling distinctness then he looked carefully around to see if anyone had seen them  i never had a girl kiss me before said toby hesitatingly an you see it made me feel kinder queer to have you do it out here where everybody could see  well i kissed you because i like you very much and because you are going to stay and ride with me tomorrow she said positively and then she added slyly i may kiss you again if you dont get a chance to run away very soon  i wish it wasnt for uncle danl an the rest of the folks at home an there wasnt any such men as mr lord an mr castle an then i dont know but i might want to stay with the circus cause i like you awful much  and as he spoke tobys heart grew very tender toward the only girl friend he had ever known  by this time they had reached the door of the tent and as they stepped outside one of the drivers told them that mr treat and his wife were very anxious to see both of them in their tent  i dont believe i can go said toby doubtfully as he glanced toward the booth where mr lord was busy in attending to customers and evidently waiting for toby to relieve him so that he could go to his dinner i dont believe mr lord will let me  go and ask him said ella eagerly we wont be gone but a minute  toby approached his employer with fear and trembling he had never before asked leave to be away from his work even for a moment and he had no doubt but that his request would be refused with blows  mr treat wants me to come in his tent for a minute can i go he asked in a timid voice and in such a low tone as to render it almost inaudible  mr lord looked at him for an instant and toby was sure that he was making up his mind whether to kick him or catch him by the collar and use the rubber cane on him but he had no such intention evidently for he said in a voice unusually mild yes an you neednt come to work again until its time to go into the tent  toby was almost alarmed at this unusual kindness and it puzzled him so much that he would have forgotten he had permission to go away if ella had not pulled him gently by the coat  if he had heard a conversation between mr lord and mr castle that very morning he would have understood why it was that mr lord had so suddenly become kind mr castle had told job that the boy had really shown himself to be a good rider and that in order to make him more contented with his lot and to keep him from running away he must be used more kindly and perhaps be taken from the candy business altogether which latter advice mr lord did not look upon with favor because of the large sales which the boy made  when they reached the skeletons tent they found to their surprise that no exhibition was being given at that hour and ella said with some concern how queer it is that the doors are not open i do hope that they are not sick  toby felt a strange sinking at his heart as the possibility suggested itself that one or both of his kind friends might be ill for they had both been so kind and attentive to him that he had learned to love them very dearly  but the fears of both the children were dispelled when they tried to get in at the door and were met with the smiling skeleton himself who said as he threw the canvas aside as far as if he were admitting his own enormous lilly  come in my friends come in i have had the exhibition closed for one hour in order that i might show my appreciation of my friend mr tyler  toby looked around in some alarm fearing that mr treats friendship was about to be displayed in one of his state dinners which he had learned to fear rather than enjoy but as he saw no preparations for dinner he breathed more freely and wondered what all this ceremony could possibly mean  neither he nor ella was long left in doubt for as soon as they had entered mrs treat waddled from behind the screen which served them as a dressing room with a bundle in her arms which she handed to her husband  he took it and quickly mounting the platform leaving ella and toby below he commenced to speak with very many flourishes of his thin arms  my friends he began as he looked down upon his audience of three who were listening in the following attitudes ella and toby were standing upon the ground at the foot of the platform looking up with wide open staring eyes and his fleshy wife was seated on a bench which had evidently been placed in such a position below the speakers stand that she could hear and see all that was going on without the fatigue of standing up which for one of her size was really very hard workmy friends repeated the skeleton as he held his bundle in front of him with one hand and gesticulated with the other we all of us know that tomorrow our esteemed and worthy friend mr toby tyler makes his first appearance in any ring and we all of us believe that he will soon become a bright and shining light in the profession which he is so soon to enter  the speaker was here interrupted by loud applause from his wife and he profited by the opportunity to wipe a stray drop of perspiration from his fleshless face then as the fat lady ceased the exertion of clapping her hands he continued  knowing that our friend mr tyler was being instructed preparatory to dazzling the public with his talents my wife and i began to prepare for him some slight testimonial of our esteem and being informed by mr castle some days ago of the day on which he was to make his first appearance before the public we were enabled to complete our little gift in time for the great and important event  here the skeleton paused to take a breath and toby began to grow more uncomfortably red in the face such praise made him feel very awkward  i hold in this bundle continued mr treat as he waved the package on high a costume for our bold and worthy equestrian and a sash to match for his beautiful and accomplished companion in presenting these little tokens my wife who has embroidered every inch of the velvet herself and i feel proud to know that when the great and auspicious occasion occurs tomorrow the worthy mr tyler will step into the ring in a costume which we have prepared expressly for him and thus when he does himself honor by his performance and earns the applause of the multitude he will be doing honor and doing applause for the work of our handsmy wife lilly and myself take them my boy and when you array yourself in them tomorrow you will remember that the only living skeleton and the wonder of the nineteenth century in the shape of the mammoth lady are present in their works if not in their persons  as he finished speaking mr treat handed the bundle to toby and then joined in the applause which was being given by mrs treat and ella  toby unrolled the package and found that it contained a circus riders costume of pink tights and blue velvet trunks collar and cuffs embroidered in white and plentifully spangled with silver in addition was a wide blue sash for ella embroidered to correspond with tobys costume  the little fellow was both delighted with the gift and at a loss to know what to say in response he looked at the costume over and over again and the tears of gratitude that these friends should have been so good to him came into his eyes he saw however that they were expecting him to say something in reply and laying the gift on the platform he said to the skeleton and his wife  youve been so good to me ever since ive been with the circus that i wish i was big enough to say somethin more than that im much obliged but i cant one of these days when im a man ill show you how much i like you an then you wont be sorry that you was good to such a poor little runaway boy as i am  here the skeleton broke in with such loud applause and so many cries of hear hear that toby grew still more confused and forgot entirely what he was intending to say next  i want you to know how much obliged i am he said after much hesitation an when i wear em ill ride just the best i know how even if i dont want to an you shant be sorry that you gave them to me  as toby concluded he made a funny little awkward bow and then seemed to be trying to hide himself behind a chair from the applause which was given so generously  bless your dear little heart said the fat lady after the confusion had somewhat subsided i know you will do your best anyway and im glad to know that youre going to make your first appearance in something that samuel and i made for you  ella was quite as well pleased with her sash as toby was with his costume and thanked mr and mrs treat in a pretty little way that made toby wish he could say anything half so nicely  the hour which the skeleton had devoted for the purpose of the presentation and accompanying speeches having elapsed it was necessary that ella and toby should go and that the doors of the exhibition be opened at once in order to give any of the public an opportunity of seeing what the placards announced as two of the greatest curiosities on the face of the globe  that day while toby performed his arduous labors his heart was very light for the evidences which the skeleton and his wife had given of their regard for him were very gratifying he determined that he would do his very best to please so long as he was with the circus and then when he got a chance to run away he would do so but not until he had said goodby to mr and mrs treat and thanked them again for their interest in him  when he had finished his work in the tent that night mr lord said to him as he patted him on the back in the most fatherly fashion and as if he had never spoken a harsh word to him you cant come in here to sell candy now that you are one of the performers my boy an if i can find another boy tomorrow you wont have to work in the booth any longer an your salary of a dollar a week will go on just the same even if you dont have anything to do but to ride  this was a bit of news that was as welcome to toby as it was unexpected and he felt more happy then than he had for the ten weeks that he had been traveling under mr lords cruel mastership  but there was one thing that night that rather damped his joy and that was that he noticed that mr lord was unusually careful to watch him not even allowing him to go outside the tent without following he saw at once that if he was to have a more easy time his chances for running away were greatly diminished and no number of beautiful costumes would have made him content to stay with the circus one moment longer than was absolutely necessary  that night he told old ben the events of the day and expressed the hope that he might acquit himself creditably when he made his first appearance on the following day  ben sat thoughtfully for some time and then making all the preparations which toby knew so well signified a long bit of advice he said toby my boy ive been with a circus man an boy nigh to forty years an ive seen lots of youngsters start in just as you re goin to start in tomorrow but the most of them petered out because they got to knowin more n them that learned em did now you remember what i say an youll find it good advice whatever business you get into dont think you know all about it before youve begun remember that you can always learn somethin no matter how old you are an keep your eyes an ears open an your tongue between your teeth an youll amount to somethin or my name haint ben     xvi tobys first appearance in the ring   when the circus entered the town which had been selected as the place where toby was to make his debut as a circus rider the boy noticed a new poster among the many glaring and gaudy bills which set forth the varied and numerous attractions that were to be found under one canvas for a trifling admission fee and he noticed it with some degree of interest not thinking for a moment that it had any reference to him  it was printed very much as follows  mademoiselle jeannette and monsieur ajax  two of the youngest equestrians in the world will perform their graceful dashing and daring act entitled  the triumph of the innocents  this is the first appearance of these daring young riders together since their separation in europe last season and their performance in this town will have a new and novel interest  see mademoiselle jeannette and monsieur ajax  look there said toby to ben as he pointed out the poster which was printed in very large letters with gorgeous coloring and surmounted by a picture of two very small people performing all kinds of impossible feats on horseback theyve got someone else to ride with ella today i wonder who it can be  ben looked at toby for a moment as if to assure himself that the boy was in earnest in asking the question and then he relapsed into the worst fit of silent laughing that toby had ever seen after he had quite recovered he asked dont you know who monsieur ajax is haint you never seen him  no replied toby at a loss to understand what there was so very funny in his very natural question i thought that i was goin to ride with ella  why thats you almost screamed ben in delight monsieur ajax means youdidnt you know it you dont suppose they would go to put toby tyler on the bills do you how it would lookmademoiselle jeannette an monsieur toby tyler  ben was off in one of his laughing spells again and toby sat there stiff and straight hardly knowing whether to join in the mirth or to get angry at the sport which had been made of his name  i dont care he said at length im sure i think toby tyler sounds just as well as monsieur ajax an im sure it fits me a good deal better  that may be said ben soothingly but you see it wouldnt go down so well with the public they want furrin riders an they must have em even if it does spoil your name  despite the fact that he did not like the new name that had been given him toby could not but feel pleased at the glowing terms in which his performance was set off but he did not at all relish the lie that was told about his having been with ella in europe and he would have been very much better pleased if that portion of it had been left off  during the forenoon he did not go near mr lord nor his candy stand for mr castle kept him and ella busily engaged in practicing the feat which they were to perform in the afternoon and it was almost time for the performance to begin before they were allowed even to go to their dinner  ella who had performed several years was very much more excited over the coming debut than toby was and the reason why he did not show more interest was probably because of his great desire to leave the circus as soon as possible and during that forenoon he thought very much more of how he should get back to guilford and uncle daniel than he did of how he should get along when he stood before the audience  mr castle assisted his pupil to dress and when that was done to his entire satisfaction he said in a stern voice now you can do this act all right and if you slip up on it and dont do it as you ought to ill give you such a whipping when you come out of the ring that youll think job was only fooling with you when he tried to whip you  toby had been feeling reasonably cheerful before this but these words dispelled all his cheerful thoughts and he was looking more disconsolate when old ben came into the dressing tent  all ready are you my boy said the old man in his cheeriest voice well thats good an you look as nice as possible now remember what i told you last night toby an go in there to do your level best an make a name for yourself come out here with me and wait for the young lady  these cheering words of bens did toby as much good as mr castles had the reverse and as he stepped out of the dressing room to the place where the horses were being saddled toby resolved that he would do his very best that afternoon if for no other reason than to please his old friend  toby was not naturally what might be called a pretty boy for his short red hair and his freckled face prevented any great display of beauty but he was a good honest looking boy and in his tasteful costume looked very nice indeedso nice that could mrs treat have seen him just then she would have been very proud of her handiwork and hugged him harder than ever  he had been waiting but a few moments when ella came from her dressing room and toby was much pleased when he saw by the expression of her face that she was perfectly satisfied with his appearance  well both do just as well as we can she whispered to him and i know the people will like us and make us come back after we get through and if they do mamma says shell give each one of us a gold dollar  she had taken hold of tobys hand as she spoke and her manner was so earnest and anxious that toby was more excited than he ever had been about his debut and had he gone into the ring just at that moment the chances are that he would have surprised even his teacher by his riding  ill do just as well as i can said toby in reply to his little companion an if we earn the dollars ill have a hole bored in mine an you shall wear it around your neck to remember me by  ill remember you without that she whispered and ill give you mine so that you shall have so much the more when you go to your home  there was no time for further conversation for mr castle entered just then to tell them that they must go in in another moment the horses were all readya black one for toby and a white one for ellaand they stood champing their bits and pawing the earth in their impatience until the silver bells with which they were decorated rang out quick nervous little chimes that accorded very well with tobys feelings  ella squeezed tobys hand as they stood waiting for the curtain to be raised that they might enter and he had just time to return it when the signal was given and almost before he was aware of it they were standing in the ring kissing their hands to the crowds that packed the enormous tent to its utmost capacity  thanks to the false announcement about the separation of the children in europe and their reunion in this particular town the applause was long and loud and before it had died away toby had time to recover a little from the queer feeling which this sea of heads gave him  he had never seen such a crowd before except as he had seen them as he walked around at the foot of the seats and then they had simply looked like so many human beings but as he saw them now from the ring they appeared like strange rows of heads without bodies and he had hard work to keep from running back behind the curtain whence he had come  mr castle acted as the ringmaster this time and after he had introduced themvery much after the fashion of the postersand the clown had repeated some funny joke the horses were led in and they were assisted to mount  dont mind the people at all said mr castle in a low voice but ride just as if you were alone here with me  the music struck up the horses cantered around the ring and toby had really started as a circus rider  remember said ella to him in a low tone just as the horses started you told me that you would ride just as well as you could and we must earn the dollars mamma promised  it seemed to toby at first as if he could not stand up but by the time they had ridden around the ring once and ella had again cautioned him against making any mistake for the sake of the money which they were going to earn he was calm and collected enough to carry out his part of the act as well as if he had been simply taking a lesson  the act consisted in their riding side by side jumping over banners and through hoops covered with paper and then the most difficult portion began  the saddles were taken off the horses and they were to ride first on one horse and then on the other until they concluded their performance by riding twice around the ring side by side standing on their horses each one with a hand on the others shoulder  all this was successfully accomplished without a single error and when they rode out of the ring the applause was so great as to leave no doubt but that they would be recalled and thus earn the promised money  in fact they had hardly got inside the curtain when one of the attendants called to them and before they had time even to speak to each other they were in the ring again repeating the last portion of their act  when they came out of the ring for the second time they found old ben the skeleton the fat lady and mr job lord waiting to welcome them but before anyone could say a word ella had stood on tiptoe again and given toby just such another kiss as she did when he told her that he would surely stay long enough to appear in the ring with her once  thats because you rode so well and helped me so much she said as she saw tobys cheeks growing a fiery red and then she turned to those who were waiting to greet her  mrs treat took her in her enormous arms and having kissed her put her down quickly and clasped toby as if he had been a very small walnut and her arms a very large pair of nutcrackers  bless the boy she exclaimed as she kissed him again and again with an energy and force that made her kisses sound like the crack of the whip and caused the horses to stamp in affright i knew hed amount to something one of these days an samuel an i had to come out when business was dull just to see how he got along  it was some time before she would unloose him from her motherly embrace and when she did the skeleton grasped him by the hand and said in the most pompous and affected manner  mr tyler were proud of you and when we saw that costume of yours that my lilly embroidered with her own hands we was both proud of it and what it contained youre a great rider my boy a great rider and you ll stand at the head of the profession some day if you only stick to it  thank you sir was all toby had time to say before old ben had him by the hand and the skeleton was pouring out his congratulations in little miss ellas ear  toby my boy you did well an now youll amount to something if you only remember what i told you last night said ben as he looked upon the boy whom he had come to think of as his protege with pride i never seen anybody of your age do any better an now instead of bein only a candy peddler youre one of the stars of the show  thank you ben was all that toby could say for he knew that his old friend meant every word that he said and it pleased him so much that he could say no more than thank you in reply  i feel as if your triumph was mine said mr lord looking benignly at toby from out his crooked eye and assuming the most fatherly tone at his command i have learned to look upon you almost as my own son and your success is very gratifying to me  toby was not at all flattered by this last praise if he had never seen mr lord before he might and probably would have been deceived by his words but he had seen him too often and under too many painful circumstances to be at all swindled by his words  toby was very much pleased with his success and by the praise he received from all and when the proprietor of the circus came along patted him on the head and told him that he rode very nicely he was quite happy until he chanced to see the greedy twinkle in mr lords eye and then he knew that all this success and all this praise were only binding him faster to the show which he was so anxious to escape from his pleasure vanished very quickly and in its stead came a bitter homesick feeling which no amount of praise could banish  it was old ben who helped him to undress after the skeleton and the fat lady had gone to their tent and ella had gone to dress for her appearance with her mother for now she was obliged to ride twice at each performance when toby was in ordinary clothes again ben said  now that youre one of the performers toby you wont have to sell candy any more an youll have the most of your time to yourself so lets you an i go out an see the town  dont you spose mr lord expects me to go to work for him again today  an sposin he does said ben with a chuckle you dont spose the boss would let any one that rides in the ring stand behind job lords counter do you you can do just as you have a mind to my boy an i say to you lets go out an see the town what do you say to it  id like to go first rate if i dared to replied toby thinking of the many whippings he had received for far less than that which ben now proposed he should do  oh ill take care that job dont bother you so come along and ben started out of the tent and toby followed feeling considerably frightened at this first act of disobedience against his old master      xvii off for home   during this walk toby learned many things that were of importance to him so far as his plan for running away was concerned in the first place he gleaned from the railway posters that were stuck up in the hotel to which they went that he could buy a ticket for guilford for seven dollars and also that by going back to the town from which they had come he could go to guilford by steamer for five dollars  by returning to this last townand toby calculated that the fare on the stage back there could not be more than a dollarhe would have ten dollars left and that surely ought to be sufficient to buy food enough for two days for the most hungry boy that ever lived  when they returned to the circus grounds the performance was over and mr lord in the midst of the brisk trade which he usually had after the afternoon performance and yet so far from scolding toby for going away he actually smiled and bowed at him as he saw him go by with ben  see there toby said the old driver to the boy as he gave him a vigorous poke in the ribs and then went off into one of his dreadful laughing spellssee what it is to be a performer an not workin for such an old fossil as job is hell be so sweet to you now that sugar wont melt in his mouth an theres no chance of his ever attemptin to whip you again  toby made no reply for he was too busily engaged thinking of something which had just come into his mind to know that his friend had spoken  but as old ben hardly knew whether the boy had answered him or not owing to his being obliged to struggle with his breath lest he should lose it in the second laughing spell that attacked him the boys thoughtfulness was not particularly noticed  toby walked around the show grounds for a little while with his old friend and then the two went to supper where toby performed quite as great wonders in the way of eating as he had in the afternoon by riding  as soon as the supper was over he quietly slipped away from old ben and at once paid a visit to mr and mrs treat whom he found cozily engaged in their supper behind the screen  they welcomed toby most cordially and despite his assertions that he had just finished a very hearty meal the fat lady made him sit down to the box which served as table and insisted on his trying some of her doughnuts  under all these pressing attentions it was some time before toby found a chance to say that which he had come to say and when he did he was almost at a loss how to proceed but at last he commenced by starting abruptly on his subject with the words ive made up my mind to leave tonight  leave tonight repeated the skeleton inquiringly not for a moment believing that toby could think of running away after the brilliant success he had just made what do you mean toby  why you know that ive been wantin to get away from the circus said toby a little impatient that his friend should be so wonderfully stupid an i think that ill have as good a chance now as ever i shall so im goin to try it  bless us exclaimed the fat lady in a gasping way you dont mean to say that youre goin off just when youve started in the business so well i thought youd want to stay after youd been so well received this afternoon  no said tobyand one quick little sob popped right up from his heart and out before he was aware of iti learned to ride because i had to but i never give up runnin away i must see uncle danl an tell him how sorry i am for what i did an if he wont have anything to say to me ill come back but if hell let me ill stay there an ill be so good that by n by hell forget that i run off an left him without sayin a word  there was such a touch of sorrow in his tones so much pathos in his way of speaking that good mrs treats heart was touched at once and putting her arms around the little fellow as if to shield him from some harm she said tenderly and so you shall go toby my boy but if you ever want a home or anybody to love you come right here to us and youll never be sorry so long as sam keeps thin and i fat enough to draw the public you never need say that youre homeless for nothing would please us better than to have you come to live with us  for reply toby raised his head and kissed her on the cheek a proceeding which caused her to squeeze him harder than ever  during this conversation the skeleton had remained very thoughtful after a moment or two he got up from his seat went outside the tent and presently returned with a quantity of silver ten cent pieces in his hand  here toby he saidand it was to be seen that he was really too much affected even to attempt one of his speechesits right that you should go for ive known what it is to feel just as you do what lilly said about your having a home with us i say an heres five dollars that i want you to take to help you along  at first toby stoutly refused to take the money but they both insisted to such a degree that he was actually forced to and then he stood up to go  im goin to try to slip off after job packs up the outside booth if i can he said an it was to say goodby that i come around here  again mrs treat took the boy in her arms as if it were one of her own children who was leaving her and as she stroked his hair back from his forehead she said dont forget us toby even if you never do see us again try an remember how much we cared for you an how much comfort youre taking away from us when you go for it was a comfort to see you around even if you wasnt with us very much dont forget us toby an if you ever get the chance come an see us goodby toby goodby and the kind hearted woman kissed him again and again and then turned her back resolutely upon him lest it should be bad luck to him if she again saw him after saying goodby  the skeletons parting was not quite so demonstrative he clasped tobys hand with one set of his fleshless fingers while with the other he wiped one or two suspicious looking drops of moisture from his eyes as he said i hope youll get along all right my boy and i believe you will you will get home to uncle daniel and be happier than ever for now you know what it is to be entirely without a home be a good boy mind your uncle go to school and one of these days youll make a good man goodby my boy  the tears were now streaming down tobys face very rapidly he had not known in his anxiety to get home how very much he cared for this strangely assorted couple and now it made him feel very miserable and wretched that he was going to leave them he tried to say something more but the tears choked his utterance and he left the tent quickly to prevent himself from breaking down entirely  in order that his grief might not be noticed and the cause of it suspected toby went out behind the tent and sitting there on a stone he gave way to the tears which he could no longer control  while he was thus engaged heeding nothing which passed around him he was startled by a cheery voice which cried halloo down in the dumps again what is the matter now my bold equestrian  looking up he saw ben standing before him and he wiped his eyes hastily for here was another from whom he must part and to whom a goodby must be spoken  looking around to make sure that no one was within hearing he went up very close to the old driver and said in almost a whisper i was feelin bad cause i just come from mr and mrs treat an ive been sayin goodby to them im goin to run away tonight  ben looked at him for a moment as if he doubted whether the boy knew exactly what he was talking about and then said so you still want to go home do you  oh yes ben so much was the reply in a tone which expressed how dear to him was the thought of being in his old home once more  all right my boy i wont say one word agin it though it do seem too bad after youve turned out to be such a good rider said the old man thoughtfully its better for you i know for a circus haint no place for a boy even if he wants to stay an i cant say but im glad youre still determined to go  toby felt relieved at the tone of this leave taking he had feared that old ben who thought a circus rider was almost on the topmost round of fortunes ladder would have urged him to stay since he had made his debut in the ring and he was almost afraid that he might take some steps to prevent his going  i wanted to say goodby now said toby in a choking voice cause perhaps i shant see you again  goodby my boy said ben as he took the boys hand in his dont forget this experience youve had in runnin away an if ever the time comes that you feel as if you wanted to know that you had a friend think of old ben an remember that his heart beats just as warm for you as if he was your father goodby my boy goodby an may the good god bless you  goodby ben said toby and then as the old driver turned and walked away wiping something from his eye with the cuff of his sleeve toby gave full vent to his tears and wondered why it was that he was such a miserable little wretch  there was one more goodby to be said and that toby dreaded more than all the others it was to ella he knew that she would feel badly to have him go because she liked to ride the act with him that gave them such applause and he felt certain that she would urge him to stay  just then the thought of another of his friendsone who had not yet been warned of what very important matter was to occurcame to his mind and he hastened toward the old monkeys cage his pet was busily engaged in playing with some of the younger members of his family and for some moments could not be induced to come to the bars of the cage  at last however toby did succeed in coaxing him forward and then taking him by the paw and drawing him as near as possible toby whispered were goin to run away tonight mr stubbs an i want you to be all ready to go the minute i come for you  the old monkey winked both eyes violently and then showed his teeth to such an extent that toby thought he was laughing at the prospect and he said a little severely if you had as many friends as i have got in the circus you wouldnt laugh when you was goin to leave them of course ive got to go an i want to go but it makes me feel bad to leave the skeleton an the fat woman an old ben an little ella but i mustnt stand here you be ready when i come for you an by mornin well be so far off that mr lord nor mr castle cant catch us  the old monkey went toward his companions as if he were in high glee at the trip before him and toby went into the dressing tent to prepare for the evenings performancewhich was about to commence  it appeared to the boy as if everyone was unusually kind to him that night and feeling sad at leaving those in the circus who had befriended him toby was unusually attentive to everyone around him he ran on some trifling errand for one helped another in his dressing and in a dozen kind ways seemed as if trying to atone for leaving them secretly  when the time came for him to go into the ring and he met ella bright and happy at the thought of riding with him and repeating her triumphs of the afternoon nothing save the thought of how wicked he had been to run away from good old uncle daniel and a desire to right that wrong in some way prevented him from giving up his plan of going back  the little girl observed his sadness and she whispered has anyone been whipping you toby  toby shook his head he had thought that he would tell her what he was about to do just before they went into the ring but her kind words seemed to make that impossible and he had said nothing when the blare of the trumpets the noisy demonstrations of the audience and the announcement of the clown that the wonderful children riders were now about to appear ushered them into the ring  if toby had performed well in the afternoon he accomplished wonders on this evening and they were called back into the ring not once but twice and when finally they were allowed to retire everyone behind the curtain overwhelmed them with praise  ella was so profuse with her kind words her admiration for what toby had done and so delighted at the idea that they were to ride together that even then the boy could not tell her what he was going to do but went into his dressing room resolving that he would tell her all when they both had finished dressing  toby made as small a parcel as possible of the costume which mr and mrs treat had given himfor he determined that he would take it with himand putting it under his coat went out to wait for ella as she did not come out as soon as he expected he asked someone to tell her that he wanted to see her and he thought to himself that when she did come she would be in a hurry and could not stop long enough to make any very lengthy objections to his leaving  but she did not come at allher mother sent out word that toby could not see her until after the performance was over owing to the fact that it was now nearly time for her to go into the ring and she was not dressed yet  toby was terribly disappointed he knew that it would not be safe for him to wait until the close of the performance if he were intending to run away that night and he felt that he could not go until he had said a few last words to her  he was in a great perplexity until the thought came to him that he could write a goodby to her and by this means any unpleasant discussion would be avoided  after some little difficulty he procured a small piece of not very clean paper and a very short bit of lead pencil and using the top of one of the wagons as he sat on the seat for a desk he indited the following epistle  dear ella i am goin to run away two night  i want two say good by to yu  your mother i am small  unkle danil says i dont mount two much but i am old enuf two know that you have bin good two me  when i am a man i will buy you a whole cirkus and we will ride together dont forgit me  i wont yu in haste  toby tyler  toby had no envelope in which to seal this precious letter but he felt that it would not be seen by prying eyes and would safely reach its destination if he intrusted it to old ben  it did not take him many moments to find the old driver and he said as he handed him the letter i didnt see ella to tell her i was goin so i wrote this letter an i want to know if you will give it to her  of course i will but see here tobyand ben caught him by the sleeve and led him aside where he would not be overheardhave you got enough money to take you home for if you havent i can let you have some and ben plunged his hand into his capacious pocket as if he was about to withdraw from there the entire united states treasury  toby assured him that he had sufficient for all his wants but the old man would not be satisfied until he had seen for himself and then taking tobys hand again he said now my boy it wont do for you to stay around here any longer buy something to eat before you start an go into the woods for a day or two before you take the train or steamboat  youre too big a prize for job or castle to let you go without a word an theyll try their level best to find you be careful now for if they should catch you goodby any more chances to get away thereand here ben suddenly lifted him high from the ground and kissed himnow get away as fast as you can  toby pressed the old mans hand affectionately and then without trusting himself to speak walked swiftly out toward the entrance  he resolved to take bens advice and go into the woods for a short time and therefore he must buy some provisions before he started  as he passed the monkeys cage he saw his pet sitting near the bars and he stopped long enough to whisper ill be back in ten minutes mr stubbs an you be all ready then  then he went on and just as he got near the entrance one of the men told him that mrs treat wished to see him  toby could hardly afford to spare the time just then but he would probably have obeyed the summons if he had known that by so doing he would be caught and he ran as fast as his little legs would carry him toward the skeletons tent  the exhibition was open and both the skeleton and his wife were on the platform when toby entered but he crept around at the back and up behind mrs treats chair telling her as he did so that he had just received her message and that he must hurry right back for every moment was important then to him  i put up a nice lunch for you she said as she kissed him and youll find it on the top of the biggest trunk now go and if my wishes are of any good to you you will get to your uncle daniels house without any trouble goodby again little one  toby did not dare to trust himself any longer where everyone was so kind to him he slipped down from the platform as quickly as possible found the bundleand a good sized one it was toowithout any difficulty and went back to the monkeys cage  as orders had been given by the proprietor of the circus that the boy should do as he had a mind to with the monkey he called mr stubbs and as he was in the custom of taking him with him at night no one thought that it was anything strange that he should take him from the cage now  mr lord or mr castle might possibly have thought it queer had either of them seen the two bundles which toby carried but fortunately for the boys scheme they both believed that he was in the dressing tent and consequently thought that he was perfectly safe  tobys hand shook so that he could hardly undo the fastening of the cage and when he attempted to call the monkey to him his voice sounded so strange and husky that it startled him  the old monkey seemed to prefer sleeping with toby rather than with those of his kind in the cage and as the boy took him with him almost every night he came on this particular occasion as soon as toby called regardless of the strange sound of his masters voice  with his bundles under his arm and the monkey on his shoulder with both paws tightly clasped around his neck toby made his way out of the tent with beating heart and bated breath  neither mr lord castle nor jacobs were in sight and everything seemed favorable for his flight during the afternoon he had carefully noted the direction of the woods and he started swiftly toward them now stopping only long enough as he was well clear of the tents to say in a whisper  goodby mr treat an mrs treat an ella an ben sometime when im a man ill come back an bring you lots of nice things an ill never forget younever when i have a chance to be good to some little boy that felt as bad as i did ill do it an tell him that it was you did it goodby  then turning around he ran toward the woods as swiftly as if his escape had been discovered and the entire company were in pursuit     xviii a day of freedom   toby ran at the top of his speed over the rough road and the monkey jolted from one side to the other clutched his paws more tightly around the boys neck looking around into his face as if to ask what was the meaning of this very singular proceeding  when he was so very nearly breathless as to be able to run no more but was forced to walk toby looked behind him and there he could see the bright lights of the circus and hear the strains of the music as he had heard them on the night when he was getting ready to run away from uncle daniel and those very sounds which reminded him forcibly of how ungrateful he had been to the old man who had cared for him when there was no one else in the world who would do so made it more easy for him to leave those behind who had been so kind to him when he stood so much in need of kindness  we are goin home mr stubbs he said exultantly to the monkeyhome to uncle danl an the boys an wont you have a good time when we get there you can run all over the barn an up in the trees an do just what you want to an therell be plenty of fellows to play with you you dont know half how good a place guilford is mr stubbs  the monkey chattered away as if he were anticipating lots of fun on his arrival at tobys home and the boy chattered back his spirits rising at every step which took him farther away from the collection of tents where he had spent so many wretched hours  a brisk walk of half an hour sufficed to take toby to the woods and after some little search he found a thick clump of bushes in which he concluded he could sleep without the risk of being seen by anyone who might pass that way before he should be awake in the morning  he had not much choice in the way of a bed for it was so dark in the woods that it was impossible to collect moss or leaves to make a soft resting place and the few leaves and pine boughs which he did gather made his place for sleeping but very little softer  but during the ten weeks that toby had been with the circus his bed had seldom been anything softer than the seat of the wagon and it troubled him very little that he was to sleep with nothing but a few leaves between himself and the earth  using the bundle in which was his riding costume for a pillow and placing the lunch mrs treat had given him near by where the monkey could not get at it conveniently he cuddled mr stubbs up to his bosom and lay down to sleep  mr lord wont wake us up in the mornin an swear at us for not washin the tumblers said toby in a tone of satisfaction to the monkey an we wont have to go into the tent tomorrow an sell sick lemonade an poor peanuts butand here his tone changed to one of sorrowtherell be some there that ll be sorry not to see us in the mornin mr stubbs though theyll be glad to know that we got away all right but wont mr lord swear an wont mr castle crack his whip when they come to look round for us in the mornin an find that we haint there  the reply which the monkey made to this was to nestle his head closer under tobys coat and to show in the most decided manner that he was ready to go to sleep  and toby was quite as ready to go to sleep as he was he had worked hard that day but the excitement of escaping had prevented him from realizing his fatigue until after he had lain down and almost before he had got through congratulating himself upon the ease with which he had gotten free both he and the monkey were as sound asleep as if they had been tucked up in the softest bed that was ever made  tobys very weariness was a friend to him that night for it prevented him from waking which if he had done so might have been unpleasant when he fully realized that he was all alone in the forest and the sounds that are always heard in the woods might have frightened him just the least bit  the sun was shining directly in his face when toby awoke on the following morning and the old monkey was still snugly nestled under his coat he sat up rather dazed at first and then as he fully realized that he was actually free from all that had made his life such a sad and hard one for so many weeks he shouted aloud reveling in his freedom  the monkey awakened by tobys cries started from his sleep in affright and jumped into the nearest tree only to chatter jump and swing from the boughs when he saw that there was nothing very unusual going on save that he and toby were out in the woods again where they could have no end of a good time and do just as they liked  after a few moments spent in a short jubilee at their escape toby took the monkey on his shoulder and the bundles under his arm again and went cautiously out to the edge of the thicket where he could form some idea as to whether or no they were pursued  he had entered the woods at the brow of a small hill when he had fled so hastily on the previous evening and looking down he could see the spot whereon the tents of the circus had been pitched but not a sign of them was now visible he could see a number of people walking around and he fancied that they looked up every now and then to where he stood concealed by the foliage  this gave him no little uneasiness for he feared that mr lord or mr castle might be among the number and he believed that they would begin a search for him at once and that the spot where their attention would first be drawn was exactly where he was then standing  this wont do mr stubbs he said as he pushed the monkey higher up on his shoulder and started into the thickest part of the woods we must get out of this place an go farther down where we can hide till tomorrow mornin besides we must find some water where we can wash our faces  the old monkey would hardly have been troubled if they had not got their faces washed for the next month to come but he grinned and talked as toby trudged along attempting to catch hold of the leaves as they were passed and in various other ways impeding his masters progress until toby was obliged to give him a most severe scolding in order to make him behave himself in anything like a decent manner  at last after fully half an hours rapid walking toby found just the place he wanted in which to pass the time he concluded it would be necessary to spend before he dare venture out to start for home  it was a little valley entirely filled by trees which grew so thickly save in one little spot as to make it almost impossible to walk through the one clear spot was not more than ten feet square but it was just at the edge of a swiftly running brook and a more beautiful or convenient place for a boy and a monkey to stop who had no tent nor means to build one could not well be imagined  tobys first act was to wash his face and he tried to make the monkey do the same but mr stubbs had no idea of doing any such foolish thing he would come down close to the edge of the water and look in but the moment that toby tried to make him go in he would rush back among the trees climb out on some slender bough and then swing himself down by the tail and chatter away as if making sport of his young master for thinking that he would be so foolish as to soil his face with water  after toby had made his toilet he unfastened the bundle which the fat lady had given him for the purpose of having breakfast as much of an eater as toby was he could not but be surprised at the quantity of food which mrs treat called a lunch there were two whole pies and half of another as many as two dozen doughnuts several large pieces of cheese six sandwiches with a plentiful amount of meat half a dozen biscuits nicely buttered and a large piece of cake  the monkey had come down from the tree as soon as he saw toby untying the bundle and there was quite as much pleasure depicted on his face when he saw the good things that were spread out before him as there was on tobys and he showed his thankfulness at mrs treats foresight by suddenly snatching one of the doughnuts and running with it up the tree where he knew toby could not follow  now look here mr stubbs said toby sternly you can have all you want to eat but you must take it in a decent way an not go to cuttin up any such shines as that  and after giving this commandwhich by the way was obeyed just about as well as it was understoodtoby devoted his time to his breakfast and he reduced the amount of eatables very considerably before he had finished  toby cleared off his table by gathering the food together and putting it back into the paper as well as possible and then he sat down to think over the situation and to decide what he had better do  he felt rather nervous about venturing out when it was possible for mr lord or mr castle to get hold of him again and as the weather was yet warm during the night his camping place everything that could be desired and the stock of food likely to hold out he concluded that he had better remain there for two days at least and then he would be reasonably sure that if either of the men whom he so dreaded to see had remained behind for the purpose of catching him he would have got tired out and gone on  this point decided upon the next was to try to fix up something soft for a bed he had his pocketknife with him and in his little valley were pine and hemlock trees in abundance from the tips of their branches he knew that he could make a bed as soft and fragrant as any that could be thought of and he set to work at once while mr stubbs continued his antics above his head  after about two hours steady work he had cut enough of the tender branches to make himself a bed into which he and the monkey could burrow and sleep as comfortably as if they were in the softest bed in uncle daniels house  when toby first began to cut the boughs he had an idea that he might possibly make some sort of a hut but the two hours work had blistered his hands and he was perfectly ready to sit down and rest without the slightest desire for any other kind of a hut than that formed by the trees themselves  toby imagined that in that beautiful place he could with the monkey stay contented for any number of days but after he had rested a time played with his pet a little and eaten just a trifle more of the lunch the time passed so slowly that he soon made up his mind to run the risk of meeting mr lord or mr castle again by going out of the woods the first thing the next morning  very many times before the sun set that day was toby tempted to run the risk that night for the sake of the change if no more but as he thought the matter over he saw how dangerous such a course would be and he forced himself to wait  that night he did not sleep as soundly as on the previous one for the very good reason that he was not as tired he awoke several times and the noise of the night birds alarmed him to such an extent that he was obliged to awaken the old monkey for company  but the night passed despite his fears as all nights will whether a boy is out in the woods alone or tucked up in his own little bed at home in the morning toby made all possible haste to get away for each moment that he stayed now made him more impatient to be moving toward home  he washed himself as quickly as possible ate his breakfast with the most unseemly haste and taking up his bundles and the monkey once more started as he supposed in the direction from which he had entered the woods  toby walked briskly along in the best possible spirits for his running away was now an accomplished fact and he was going toward uncle daniel and home just as fast as possible he sang old hundred through five or six times by way of showing his happiness it is quite likely that he would have sung something a little more lively had he known anything else but old hundred was the extent of his musical education and he kept repeating that which was quite as satisfactory as if he had been able to go through with every opera that was ever written  the monkey would jump from his shoulder into the branches above run along on the trees for a short distance and then wait until toby came along when he would drop down on his shoulder suddenly and in every other way of displaying monkey delight he showed that he was just as happy as it was possible  toby trudged on in this contented way for nearly an hour and every moment expected to step out to the edge of the woods where he could see houses and men once more but instead of doing so the forest seemed to grow more dense and nothing betokened his approach to the village there was a great fear came into tobys heart just then and for a moment he halted in helpless perplexity his lips began to quiver his face grew white and his hand trembled so that the old monkey took hold of one of his fingers and looked at it wonderingly     xix mr stubbss mischief and his sad fate   toby had begun to realize that he was lost in the woods and the thought was sufficient to cause alarm in the mind of one much older than the boy he said to himself that he would keep on in the direction he was then traveling for fifteen minutes and as he had no means of computing the time he sat down on a log took out the bit of pencil with which he had written the letter to ella and multiplied sixty by fifteen he knew that there were sixty seconds to the minute and that he could ordinarily count one to each second therefore when he learned that there were nine hundred seconds in fifteen minutes he resolved to walk as nearly straight ahead as possible until he should have counted that number  he walked on counting as regularly as he could and thought to himself that he never before realized how long fifteen minutes were  it really seemed to him that an hour had passed before he finished counting and then when he stopped there were no more signs that he was near a clearing than there had been before he started  ah mr stubbs were lost were lost he cried as he laid his cheek on the monkeys head and gave way to the lonesome grief that came over him what shall we do perhaps we wont ever find our way out but will die here an then uncle danl wont ever know how sorry i was that i ran away  then toby lay right down on the ground and cried so hard that the monkey acted as if it were frightened and tried to turn the boys face over and finally leaned down and licked tobys ear  this little act which seemed so much like a kiss caused toby to feel no small amount of comfort and he sat up again took the monkey in his arms and began seriously to discuss some definite plan of action  it wont do to keep on the way weve been goin mr stubbs said toby as he looked full in his pets faceand the old monkey sat as still and looked as grave as it was possible for him to look and sitfor we must be going into the woods deeper lets start off this wayand toby pointed at right angles with the course they had been pursuingan keep right on that way till we come to something or till we drop right down an die  it is fair to presume that the old monkey agreed to tobys plan for although he said nothing in favor of it he certainly made no objections to it which to toby was the same as if his companion had assented to it in the plainest english  both the bundles and the monkey were rather a heavy load for a small boy like toby to carry but he clung manfully to them walked resolutely on without looking to the right or to the left glad when the old monkey would take a run among the trees for then he would be relieved of his weight and glad when he returned for then he had his company and that repaid him for any labor which he might have to perform  toby was in a hard plight as it was but without the old monkey for a companion he would have thought his condition was a hundred times worse and would hardly have had the courage to go on as he was going  on and on he walked until it seemed to him that he could really go no farther and yet he could see no signs which indicated the end of the woods and at last he sank upon the ground too tired to walk another step saying to the monkeywho was looking as if he would like to know the reason of this pause its no use mr stubbs ive got to sit down here an rest awhile anyhow besides im awfully hungry  then toby commenced to eat his dinner and to give the monkey his until the thought came to him that he neither had any water nor did he know where to find it and then of course he immediately became so thirsty that it was impossible for him to eat any more  we cant stand this moaned toby to the monkey weve got to have something to drink or else we cant eat all these sweet things an im so tired that i cant go any farther dont lets eat dinner now but lets stay here an rest an then we can keep on an look for water  tobys resting spell was a long one for as soon as he stretched himself out on the ground he was asleep from actual exhaustion and did not awaken until the sun was just setting and then he saw that hard as his troubles had been before they were about to become or in fact had become worse  he had paid no attention to his bundles when he lay down and when he awoke he was puzzled to make out what it was that was strewn around the ground so thickly  he had looked at it but a very short time when he saw that it was what had been the lunch he had carried so far after having had the sad experience of losing his money he understood very readily that the old monkey had taken the lunch while he slept and had amused himself by picking it apart into the smallest particles possible and then strewn them around on the ground where he now saw them  toby looked at them in almost speechless surprise and then he turned to where the old monkey lay apparently asleep but as the boy watched him intently he could see that the cunning animal was really watching him out of one half closed eye  now you have killed us mr stubbs wailed toby we never can find our way out of here an now we haint got anything to eat and by tomorrow we shall be starved to death oh dear wasnt you bad enough when you threw all the money away so you had to go an do this just when we was in awful trouble  mr stubbs now looked up as if he had just been awakened by tobys grief looked around him leisurely as if to see what could be the matter and then apparently seeing for the first time the crumbs that were lying around on the ground took up some and examined them intently  now dont go to makin believe that you dont know how they come there said toby showing anger toward his pet for the first time you know it was you who did it for there wasnt anyone else here an you cant fool me by lookin so surprised  it seemed as if the monkey had come to the conclusion that his little plan of ignorance wasnt the most perfect success for he walked meekly toward his young master climbed up on his shoulder and sat there kissing his ear or looking down into his eyes until the boy could resist the mute appeal no longer and took him into his arms and hugged him closely as he said  it cant be helped now i spose an we shall have to get along the best way we can but it was awful wicked of you mr stubbs an i dont know what were goin to do for something to eat  while the destructive fit was on him the old monkey had not spared the smallest bit of food but had picked everything into such minute shreds that none of it could be gathered up and everything was surely wasted  while toby sat bemoaning his fate and trying to make out what was to be done for food the darkness which had just begun to gather when he first awoke now commenced to settle around and he was obliged to seek for some convenient place in which to spend the night before it became so dark as to make the search impossible  owing to the fact that he had slept nearly the entire afternoon and also rendered wakeful by the loss he had just sustained toby lay awake on the hard ground with the monkey on his arm hour after hour until all kinds of fancies came to him and in every sound feared he heard someone from the circus coming to capture him or some wild beast intent on picking his bones  the cold sweat of fear stood out on his brow and he hardly dared to breathe much more to speak lest the sound of his voice should betray his whereabouts and thus bring his enemies down upon him the minutes seemed like hours and the hours like days as he lay there listening fearfully to every one of the night sounds of the forest and it seemed to him that he had been there very many hours when at last he fell asleep and was thus freed from his fears  bright and early on the following morning toby was awake and as he came to a realizing sense of all the dangers and trouble that surrounded him he was disposed to give way again to his sorrow but he said resolutely to himself it might be a good deal worse than it is an mr stubbs an i can get along one day without anything to eat an perhaps by night we shall be out of the woods an then what we get will taste good to us  he began his walkwhich possibly might not end that daymanfully and his courage was rewarded by soon reaching a number of bushes that were literally loaded down with blackberries from these he made a hearty meal and the old monkey fairly reveled in them for he ate all he possibly could and then stowed enough in his cheeks to make a good sized luncheon when he should be hungry again  refreshed very much by his breakfast of fruit toby again started on his journey with renewed vigor and the world began to look very bright to him he had not thought that he might find berries when the thoughts of starvation came into his mind and now that his hunger was satisfied he began to believe that he might possibly be able to live perhaps for weeks in the woods solely upon what he might find growing there  shortly after he had breakfast he came upon a brook which he thought was the same upon whose banks he had encamped the first night he spent in the woods and pulling off his clothes he waded into the deepest part and had a most refreshing bath although the water was rather cold  not having any towels with which to dry himself he was obliged to sit in the sun until the moisture had been dried from his skin and he could put his clothes on once more then he started out on his walk again feeling that sooner or later he would come out all right  all this time he had been traveling without any guide to tell him whether he was going straight ahead or around in a circle and he now concluded to follow the course of the brook believing that that would lead him out of the forest some time  during the afternoon he walked steadily but not so fast that he would get exhausted quickly and when by the position of the sun he judged that it was noon he lay down on a mossy bank to rest  he was beginning to feel sad again he had found no more berries and the elation which had been caused by his breakfast and his bath was quickly passing away the old monkey was in a tree almost directly above his head stretched out on one of the limbs in the most contented manner possible and as toby watched him and thought of all the trouble he had caused by wasting the food thoughts of starvation again came into his mind and he believed that he should not live to see uncle daniel again  just as he was feeling the most sad and lonely and where thoughts of death from starvation were most vivid in his mind he heard the barking of a dog which sounded close at hand  his first thought was that at last he was saved and he was just starting to his feet to shout for help when he heard the sharp report of a gun and an agonizing cry from the branches above and the old monkey fell to the ground with a thud that told he had received his death wound  all this had taken place so quickly that toby did not at first comprehend the extent of the misfortune which had overtaken him but a groan from the poor monkey as he placed one little brown paw to his breast from which the blood was flowing freely and looked up into his masters face with a most piteous expression showed the poor little boy what a great trouble it was which had now come  poor toby uttered a loud cry of agony which could not have been more full of anguish had he received the ball in his own breast and flinging himself by the side of the dying monkey he gathered him close to his breast regardless of the blood that poured over him and stroking tenderly the little head that had nestled so often in his bosom said over and over again as the monkey uttered short moans of agony who could have been so cruel who could have been so cruel  tobys tears ran like rain down his face and he kissed his dying pet again and again as if he would take all the pain to himself  oh if you could only speak to me he cried as he took one of the poor monkeys paws in his hand and finding that it was growing cold with the chill of death put it on his neck to warm it how i love you mr stubbs an now youre goin to die an leave me oh if i hadnt spoken cross to you yesterday an if i hadnt amost choked you the day that we went to the skeletons to dinner forgive me for ever bein bad to you wont you mr stubbs  as the monkeys groans increased in number but diminished in force toby ran to the brook filled his hands with water and held it to the poor animals mouth  he lapped the water quickly and looked up with a human look of gratitude in his eyes as if thanking his master for that much relief then toby tried to wash the blood from his breast but it flowed quite as fast as he could wash it away and he ceased his efforts in that direction and paid every attention to making his friend and pet more comfortable he took off his jacket and laid it on the ground for the monkey to lie upon picked a quantity of large green leaves as a cooling rest for his head and then sat by his side holding his paws and talking to him with the most tender words his lipsquivering with sorrow as they werecould fashion     xx home and uncle daniel   meanwhile the author of all this misery had come upon the scene he was a young man whose rifle and well filled game bag showed that he had been hunting and his face expressed the liveliest sorrow for what he had so unwittingly done  i didnt know i was firing at your pet he said to toby as he laid his hand on his shoulder and endeavored to make him look up i only saw a little patch of fur through the trees and thinking it was some wild animal i fired forgive me wont you and let me put the poor brute out of his misery  toby looked up fiercely at the murderer of his pet and asked savagely why dont you go away dont you see that you have killed mr stubbs an youll be hung for murder  i wouldnt have done it under any circumstances said the young man pitying tobys grief most sincerely come away and let me put the poor thing out of its agony  how can you do it asked toby bitterly hes dying already  i know it and it will be a kindness to put a bullet through his head  if toby had been big enough perhaps there might really have been a murder committed for he looked up at the man who so coolly proposed to kill the poor monkey after he had already received his death wound that the young man stepped back quickly as if really afraid that in his desperation the boy might do him some injury  go way off said toby passionately an dont ever come here again youve killed all i ever had in this world of my own to love me an i hate youi hate you  then turning again to the monkey he put his hands on each side of his head and leaning down kissed the little brown lips as tenderly as a mother would kiss her child  the monkey was growing more and more feeble and when toby had shown this act of affection he reached up his tiny paws grasped tobys finger half raised himself from the ground and then with a convulsive struggle fell back dead while the tiny fingers slowly relaxed their hold of the boys hand  toby feared that it was death and yet hoped that he was mistaken he looked into the half open fast glazing eyes put his hand over his heart to learn if it were still beating and getting no responsive look from the dead eyes feeling no heart throbs from under that gory breast he knew that his pet was really dead and flung himself by his side in all the childish abandonment of grief  he called the monkey by name implored him to look at him and finally bewailed that he had ever left the circus where at least his pets life was safe even if his own back received its daily flogging  the young man who stood a silent spectator of this painful scene understood everything from tobys mourning he knew that a boy had run away from the circus for messrs lord and castle had stayed behind one day in the hope of capturing the fugitive and they had told their own version of tobys flight  for nearly an hour toby lay by the dead monkeys side crying as if his heart would break and the young man waited until his grief should have somewhat exhausted itself and then approached the boy again  wont you believe that i didnt mean to do this cruel thing he asked in a kindly voice and wont you believe that i would do anything in my power to bring your pet back to life  toby looked at him a moment earnestly and then said slowly yes ill try to  now will you come with me and let me talk to you for i know who you are and why you are here  how do you know that  two men stayed behind after the circus had left and they hunted everywhere for you  i wish they had caught me moaned toby i wish they had caught me for then mr stubbs wouldnt be here dead  and tobys grief broke out afresh as he again looked at the poor little stiff form that had been a source of so much comfort and joy to him  try not to think of that now but think of yourself and of what you will do said the man soothingly anxious to divert tobys mind from the monkeys death as much as possible  i dont want to think of myself and i dont care what ill do sobbed the boy passionately  but you must you cant stay here always and i will try to help you to get home or wherever it is you want to go if you will tell me all about it  it was some time before toby could be persuaded to speak or think of anything but the death of his pet but the young man finally succeeded in drawing his story from him and then tried to induce him to leave that place and accompany him to town  i cant leave mr stubbs said the boy firmly he never left me the night i got thrown out of the wagon an he thought i was hurt  then came another struggle to induce him to bury his pet and finally toby after realizing the fact that he could not carry a dead monkey with him agreed to it but he would not allow the young man to help him in any way or even to touch the monkeys body  he dug a grave under a little fir tree near by and lined it with wild flowers and leaves and even then hesitated to cover the body with the earth at last he bethought himself of the fanciful costume which the skeleton and his wife had given him and in this he carefully wrapped his dead pet he had not one regret at leaving the bespangled suit for it was the best he could command and surely nothing could be too good for mr stubbs  tenderly he laid him in the little grave and covering the body with flowers said pausing a moment before he covered it over with earth and while his voice was choked with emotion goodby mr stubbs goodby i wish it had been me instead of you that died for im an awful sorry little boy now that youre dead  even after the grave had been filled and a little mound made over it the young man had the greatest difficulty to persuade toby to go with him and when the boy did consent to go at last he walked very slowly away and kept turning his head to look back just so long as the little grave could be seen  then when the trees shut it completely out from sight the tears commenced again to roll down tobys cheeks and he sobbed out i wish i hadnt left him oh why didnt i make him lie down by me an then hed be alive now an how glad hed be to know that we was getting out of the woods at last  but the man who had caused toby this sorrow talked to him about other matters thus taking his mind from the monkeys death as much as possible and by the time the boy reached the village he had told his story exactly as it was without casting any reproaches on mr lord and giving himself the full share of censure for leaving his home as he did  mr lord and mr castle had remained in the town but one day for they were told that a boy had taken the night train that passed through the town about two hours after toby had escaped and they had set off at once to act on that information  therefore toby need have no fears of meeting either of them just then and he could start on his homeward journey in peace  the young man who had caused the monkeys death tried first to persuade toby to remain a day or two with him and failing in that he did all he could toward getting the boy home as quickly and safely as possible he insisted on paying for his ticket on the steamboat although toby did all he could to prevent him and he even accompanied toby to the next town where he was to take the steamer  he had not only paid for tobys ticket but he had paid for a stateroom for him and when the boy said that he could sleep anywhere and that there was no need of such expense the man replied those men who were hunting for you have gone down the river and will be very likely to search the boat when they discover that they started on the wrong scent they will never suspect that you have got a stateroom and if you are careful to remain in it during the trip you will get through safely  then when the time came for the steamer to start the young man said to toby now my boy you wont feel hard at me for shooting the monkey will you i would have done anything to bring him back to life but as i could not do that helping you to get home was the next best thing i could do  i know you didnt mean to shoot mr stubbs said toby with moistening eyes as he spoke of his pet an im sorry i said what i did to you in the woods  before there was time to say any more the warning whistle was sounded the plank pulled in the great wheels commenced to revolve and toby was really on his way to uncle daniel and guilford  it was then but five oclock in the afternoon and he could not expect to reach home until two or three oclock in the afternoon of the next day but he was in a tremor of excitement as he thought that he should walk through the streets of guilford once more see all the boys and go home to uncle daniel  and yet whenever he thought of that home of meeting those boys of going once more to all those old familiar places the memory of all that he had planned when he should take the monkey with him would come into his mind and damp even his joy great as it was  that night he had considerable difficulty in falling asleep but did finally succeed in doing so and when he awoke the steamer was going up the river whose waters seemed like an old friend because they had flowed right down past guilford on their way to the sea  at each town where a landing was made toby looked eagerly out on the pier thinking that by chance someone from his home might be there and he would see a familiar face again but all this time he heeded the advice given him and remained in his room where he could see and not be seen and it was well for him that he did so for at one of the landings he saw both mr lord and mr castle come on board the boat  tobys heart beat fast and furious and he expected every moment to hear them at the door demanding admittance for it seemed to him that they must know exactly where he was secreted  but no such misfortune occurred the men had evidently only boarded the boat to search for the boy for they landed again before the steamer started and toby had the satisfaction of seeing their backs as they walked away from the pier it was some time before he recovered from the fright which the sight of them gave him but when he did his thoughts and hopes far outstripped the steamer which it seemed was going so slowly and he longed to see guilford with an impatience that could hardly be restrained  at last he could see the spire of the little church on the hill and when the steamer rounded the point affording a full view of the town and sounded her whistle as a signal for those on the shore to come to the pier toby could hardly restrain himself from jumping up and down and shouting in his delight  he was at the gangplank ready to land fully five minutes before the steamer was anywhere near the wharf and when he recognized the first face on the pier what a happy boy he was  he was at home the dream of the past ten weeks was at length realized and neither mr lord nor mr castle had any terrors for him now  he ran down the gangplank before it was ready and clasped every boy he saw there round the neck and would have kissed them if they had shown an inclination to let him do so  of course he was overwhelmed with questions but before he would answer any he asked for uncle daniel and the others at home  some of the boys ventured to predict that toby would get a jolly good whipping for running away and the only reply which the happy toby made to that was  i hope i will an then ill feel as if i had kinder paid for runnin away if uncle danl will only let me stay with him again he may whip me every mornin an i wont open my mouth to holler  the boys were impatient to hear the story of tobys travels but he refused to tell it them saying  ill go home an if uncle danl forgives me for bein so wicked ill sit down this afternoon an tell you all you want to know about the circus  then far more rapidly than he had run away from it toby ran toward the home which he had called his ever since he could remember and his heart was full almost to bursting as he thought that perhaps he would be told that he had forfeited all claim to it and that he could never more call it home again  when he entered the old familiar sitting room uncle daniel was seated near the window alone looking out wistfullyas toby thoughtacross the fields of yellow waving grain  toby crept softly in and going up to the old man knelt down and said very humbly and with his whole soul in the words oh uncle danl if youll only forgive me for bein wicked an runnin away an let me stay here againfor its all the home i ever hadill do everything you tell me to an never whisper in meetin or do anything bad  and then he waited for the words which would seal his fate they were not long in coming  my poor boy said uncle daniel softly as he stroked tobys refractory red hair my love for you was greater than i knew and when you left me i cried aloud to the lord as if it had been my own flesh and blood that had gone afar from me stay here toby my son and help to support this poor old body as it goes down into the dark valley of the shadow of death and then in the bright light of that glorious future uncle daniel will wait to go with you into the presence of him who is ever a father to the fatherless  and in uncle daniels kindly care we may safely leave toby tyler  the end
