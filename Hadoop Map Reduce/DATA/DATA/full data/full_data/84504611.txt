84504611	christian science  by mark twain     preface  book i of this volume occupies a quarter or a third of the volume and consists of matter written about four years ago but not hitherto published in book form it contained errors of judgment and of fact i have now corrected these to the best of my ability and later knowledge   book ii was written at the beginning of 1903 and has not until now appeared in any form in it my purpose has been to present a characterportrait of mrs eddy drawn from her own acts and words solely not from hearsay and rumor and to explain the nature and scope of her monarchy as revealed in the laws by which she governs it and which she wrote herself  mark twain  new york january 1907      book i christian science       it is the first time since the dawndays of creation that      a voice has gone crashing through space with such      placid and complacent confidence and command    chapter i  vienna 1899  this last summer when i was on my way back to vienna from the appetitecure in the mountains i fell over a cliff in the twilight and broke some arms and legs and one thing or another and by good luck was found by some peasants who had lost an ass and they carried me to the nearest habitation which was one of those large low thatchroofed farmhouses with apartments in the garret for the family and a cunning little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored flowers and cats on the ground floor a large and light sittingroom separated from the milchcattle apartment by a partition and in the front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house the manurepile that sentence is germanic and shows that i am acquiring that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars  there was a village a mile away and a horse doctor lived there but there was no surgeon it seemed a bad outlook mine was distinctly a surgery case then it was remembered that a lady from boston was summering in that village and she was a christian science doctor and could cure anything so she was sent for it was night by this time and she could not conveniently come but sent word that it was no matter there was no hurry she would give me absent treatment now and come in the morning meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and comfortable and remember that there was nothing the matter with me i thought there must be some mistake  did you tell her i walked off a cliff seventyfive feet high  yes  and struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced  yes  and struck another one and bounced again  yes  and struck another one and bounced yet again  yes  and broke the boulders  yes  that accounts for it she is thinking of the boulders why didnt you tell her i got hurt too  i did i told her what you told me to tell her that you were now but an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your scalplock to your heels and that the comminuted projections caused you to look like a hatrack  and it was after this that she wished me to remember that there was nothing the matter with me  those were her words  i do not understand it i believe she has not diagnosed the case with sufficient care did she look like a person who was theorizing or did she look like one who has fallen off precipices herself and brings to the aid of abstract science the confirmations of personal experience  bitte  it was too large a contract for the stubenmadchens vocabulary she couldnt call the hand i allowed the subject to rest there and asked for something to eat and smoke and something hot to drink and a basket to pile my legs in but i could not have any of these things  why  she said you would need nothing at all  but i am hungry and thirsty and in desperate pain  she said you would have these delusions but must pay no attention to them she wants you to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain  she does does she  it is what she said  does she seem to be in full and functionable possession of her intellectual plant such as it is  bitte  do they let her run at large or do they tie her up  tie her up  there goodnight run along you are a good girl but your mental geschirr is not arranged for light and airy conversation leave me to my delusions     chapter ii  it was a night of anguish of courseat least i supposed it was for it had all the symptoms of itbut it passed at last and the christian scientist came and i was glad she was middleaged and large and bony and erect and had an austere face and a resolute jaw and a roman beak and was a widow in the third degree and her name was fuller i was eager to get to business and find relief but she was distressingly deliberate she unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand and hung the articles up peeled off her gloves and disposed of them got a book out of her handbag then drew a chair to the bedside descended into it without hurry and i hung out my tongue she said with pity but without passion  return it to its receptacle we deal with the mind only not with its dumb servants  i could not offer my pulse because the connection was broken but she detected the apology before i could word it and indicated by a negative tilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no use for then i thought i would tell her my symptoms and how i felt so that she would understand the case but that was another inconsequence she did not need to know those things moreover my remark about how i felt was an abuse of language a misapplication of terms  one does not feel she explained there is no such thing as feeling therefore to speak of a nonexistent thing as existent is a contradiction matter has no existence nothing exists but mind the mind cannot feel pain it can only imagine it  but if it hurts just the same  it doesnt a thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of reality pain is unreal hence pain cannot hurt  in making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion of pain out of the mind she raked her hand on a pin in her dress said ouch and went tranquilly on with her talk you should never allow yourself to speak of how you feel nor permit others to ask you how you are feeling you should never concede that you are ill nor permit others to talk about disease or pain or death or similar nonexistences in your presence such talk only encourages the mind to continue its empty imaginings just at that point the stubenmadchen trod on the cats tail and the cat let fly a frenzy of catprofanity i asked with caution  is a cats opinion about pain valuable  a cat has no opinion opinions proceed from mind only the lower animals being eternally perishable have not been granted mind without mind opinion is impossible  she merely imagined she felt a painthe cat  she cannot imagine a pain for imagining is an effect of mind without mind there is no imagination a cat has no imagination  then she had a real pain  i have already told you there is no such thing as real pain  it is strange and interesting i do wonder what was the matter with the cat because there being no such thing as a real pain and she not being able to imagine an imaginary one it would seem that god in his pity has compensated the cat with some kind of a mysterious emotion usable when her tail is trodden on which for the moment joins cat and christian in one common brotherhood of  she broke in with an irritated  peace the cat feels nothing the christian feels nothing your empty and foolish imaginings are profanation and blasphemy and can do you an injury it is wiser and better and holier to recognize and confess that there is no such thing as disease or pain or death  i am full of imaginary tortures i said but i do not think i could be any more uncomfortable if they were real ones what must i do to get rid of them  there is no occasion to get rid of them since they do not exist they are illusions propagated by matter and matter has no existence there is no such thing as matter  it sounds right and clear but yet it seems in a degree elusive it seems to slip through just when you think you are getting a grip on it  explain  well for instance if there is no such thing as matter how can matter propagate things  in her compassion she almost smiled she would have smiled if there were any such thing as a smile  it is quite simple she said the fundamental propositions of christian science explain it and they are summarized in the four following selfevident propositions 1 god is all in all 2 god is good good is mind 3 god spirit being all nothing is matter 4 life god omnipotent good deny death evil sin disease  therenow you see  it seemed nebulous it did not seem to say anything about the difficulty in handhow nonexistent matter can propagate illusions i said with some hesitancy  doesdoes it explain  doesnt it even if read backward it will do it  with a budding hope i asked her to do it backwards  very well disease sin evil death deny good omnipotent god life matter is nothing all being spirit god mind is good good is god all in all is god there do you understand now  ititwell it is plainer than it was before still  well  could you try it some more ways  as many as you like it always means the same interchanged in any way you please it cannot be made to mean anything different from what it means when put in any other way because it is perfect you can jumble it all up and it makes no difference it always comes out the way it was before it was a marvelous mind that produced it as a mental tour de force it is without a mate it defies alike the simple the concrete and the occult  it seems to be a corker  i blushed for the word but it was out before i could stop it  a what  awonderful structurecombination so to speak of profound thoughtsunthinkable onesum  it is true read backward or forward or perpendicularly or at any given angle these four propositions will always be found to agree in statement and proof  ahproof now we are coming at it the statements agree they agree withwithanyway they agree i noticed that but what is it they prove i mean in particular  why nothing could be clearer they prove  1 godprinciple life truth love soul spirit mind do you get that  iwell i seem to go on please  2 mangods universal idea individual perfect eternal is it clear  iti think so continue  3 ideaan image in mind the immediate object of understanding there it isthe whole sublime arcana of christian science in a nutshell do you find a weak place in it anywhere  wellno it seems strong  very well there is more those three constitute the scientific definition of immortal mind next we have the scientific definition of mortal mind thus first degree depravity i physicalpassions and appetites fear depraved will pride envy deceit hatred revenge sin disease death  phantasms madamunrealities as i understand it  every one second degree evil disappearing i moralhonesty affection compassion hope faith meekness temperance is it clear  crystal  third degree spiritual salvation i spiritualfaith wisdom power purity understanding health love you see how searchingly and coordinately interdependent and anthropomorphous it all is in this third degree as we know by the revelations of christian science mortal mind disappears  not earlier  no not until the teaching and preparation for the third degree are completed  it is not until then that one is enabled to take hold of christian science effectively and with the right sense of sympathy and kinship as i understand you that is to say it could not succeed during the processes of the second degree because there would still be remains of mind left and thereforebut i interrupted you you were about to further explain the good results proceeding from the erosions and disintegrations effected by the third degree it is very interesting go on please  yes as i was saying in this third degree mortal mind disappears science so reverses the evidence before the corporeal human senses as to make this scriptural testimony true in our hearts the last shall be first and the first shall be last that god and his idea may be to uswhat divinity really is and must of necessity be allinclusive  it is beautiful and with what exhaustive exactness your choice and arrangement of words confirm and establish what you have claimed for the powers and functions of the third degree the second could probably produce only temporary absence of mind it is reserved to the third to make it permanent a sentence framed under the auspices of the second could have a kind of meaninga sort of deceptive semblance of itwhereas it is only under the magic of the third that that defect would disappear also without doubt it is the third degree that contributes another remarkable specialty to christian scienceviz ease and flow and lavishness of words and rhythm and swing and smoothness there must be a special reason for this  yesgodall allgod good god nonmatter matteration spirit bones truth  that explains it  there is nothing in christian science that is not explicable for god is one time is one individuality is one and may be one of a series one of many as an individual man individual horse whereas god is one not one of a series but one alone and without an equal  these are noble thoughts they make one burn to know more how does christian science explain the spiritual relation of systematic duality to incidental deflection  christian science reverses the seeming relation of soul and bodyas astronomy reverses the human perception of the movement of the solar systemand makes body tributary to the mind as it is the earth which is in motion while the sun is at rest though in viewing the sun rise one finds it impossible to believe the sun not to be really rising so the body is but the humble servant of the restful mind though it seems otherwise to finite sense but we shall never understand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in matter and that man is included in nonintelligence soul is god unchangeable and eternal and man coexists with and reflects soul for the allinall is the altogether and the altogether embraces the allone soulmind mindsoul love spirit bones liver one of a series alone and without an equal  what is the origin of christian science is it a gift of god or did it just happen  in a sense it is a gift of god that is to say its powers are from him but the credit of the discovery of the powers and what they are for is due to an american lady  indeed when did this occur  in 1866 that is the immortal date when pain and disease and death disappeared from the earth to return no more forever that is the fancies for which those terms stand disappeared the things themselves had never existed therefore as soon as it was perceived that there were no such things they were easily banished the history and nature of the great discovery are set down in the book here and  did the lady write the book  yes she wrote it all herself the title is science and health with key to the scripturesfor she explains the scriptures they were not understood before not even by the twelve disciples she begins thusi will read it to you  but she had forgotten to bring her glasses  well it is no matter she said i remember the wordsindeed all christian scientists know the book by heart it is necessary in our practice we should otherwise make mistakes and do harm she begins thus in the year 1866 i discovered the science of metaphysical healing and named it christian science and she says quite beautifully i thinkthrough christian science religion and medicine are inspired with a diviner nature and essence fresh pinions are given to faith and understanding and thoughts acquaint themselves intelligently with god her very words  it is elegant and it is a fine thought toomarrying religion to medicine instead of medicine to the undertaker in the old way for religion and medicine properly belong together they being the basis of all spiritual and physical health what kind of medicine do you give for the ordinary diseases such as  we never give medicine in any circumstances whatever we  but madam it says  i dont care what it says and i dont wish to talk about it  i am sorry if i have offended but you see the mention seemed in some way inconsistent and  there are no inconsistencies in christian science the thing is impossible for the science is absolute it cannot be otherwise since it proceeds directly from the allinall and the everythinginwhich also soul bones truth one of a series alone and without equal it is mathematics purified from material dross and made spiritual  i can see that but  it rests upon the immovable basis of an apodictical principle  the word flattened itself against my mind in trying to get in and disordered me a little and before i could inquire into its pertinency she was already throwing the needed light  this apodictical principle is the absolute principle of scientific mindhealing the sovereign omnipotence which delivers the children of men from pain disease decay and every ill that flesh is heir to  surely not every ill every decay  every one there are no exceptions there is no such thing as decayit is an unreality it has no existence  but without your glasses your failing eyesight does not permit you to  my eyesight cannot fail nothing can fail the mind is master and the mind permits no retrogression  she was under the inspiration of the third degree therefore there could be no profit in continuing this part of the subject i shifted to other ground and inquired further concerning the discoverer of the science  did the discovery come suddenly like klondike or after long study and calculation like america  the comparisons are not respectful since they refer to trivialitiesbut let it pass i will answer in the discoverers own words god had been graciously fitting me during many years for the reception of a final revelation of the absolute principle of scientific mindhealing  many years how many  eighteen centuries  allgod godgood goodgod truth bones liver one of a series alone and without equalit is amazing  you may well say it sir yet it is but the truth this american lady our revered and sacred founder is distinctly referred to and her coming prophesied in the twelfth chapter of the apocalypse she could not have been more plainly indicated by st john without actually mentioning her name  how strange how wonderful  i will quote her own words from her key to the scriptures the twelfth chapter of the apocalypse has a special suggestiveness in connection with this nineteenth century theredo you note that thinknote it well   butwhat does it mean  listen and you will know i quote her inspired words again in the opening of the sixth seal typical of six thousand years since adam there is one distinctive feature which has special reference to the present age thus  revelation xii i and there appeared a great wonder in heavena woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars  that is our head our chief our discoverer of christian sciencenothing can be plainer nothing surer and note this  revelation xii 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of god  that is boston i recognize it madam these are sublime things and impressive i never understood these passages before please go on with thewith theproofs  very well listen  and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he held in his hand a little book  a little book merely a little bookcould words be modester yet how stupendous its importance do you know what book that was  was it  i hold it in my handchristian science  love livers lights bones truth kidneys one of a series alone and without equalit is beyond imagination for wonder  hear our founders eloquent words then will a voice from harmony cry go and take the little book take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey mortal obey the heavenly evangel take up divine science read it from beginning to end study it ponder it it will be indeed sweet at its first taste when it heals you but murmur not over truth if you find its digestion bitter you now know the history of our dear and holy science sir and that its origin is not of this earth but only its discovery i will leave the book with you and will go now but give yourself no uneasinessi will give you absent treatment from now till i go to bed     chapter iii  under the powerful influence of the near treatment and the absent treatment together my bones were gradually retreating inward and disappearing from view the good work took a brisk start now and went on swiftly my body was diligently straining and stretching this way and that to accommodate the processes of restoration and every minute or two i heard a dull click inside and knew that the two ends of a fracture had been successfully joined this muffled clicking and gritting and grinding and rasping continued during the next three hours and then stoppedthe connections had all been made all except dislocations there were only seven of these hips shoulders knees neck so that was soon over one after another they slipped into their sockets with a sound like pulling a distant cork and i jumped up as good as new as to framework and sent for the horsedoctor  i was obliged to do this because i had a stomachache and a cold in the head and i was not willing to trust these things any longer in the hands of a woman whom i did not know and whose ability to successfully treat mere disease i had lost all confidence my position was justified by the fact that the cold and the ache had been in her charge from the first along with the fractures but had experienced not a shade of relief and indeed the ache was even growing worse and worse and more and more bitter now probably on account of the protracted abstention from food and drink  the horsedoctor came a pleasant man and full of hope and professional interest in the case in the matter of smell he was pretty aromaticin fact quite horsyand i tried to arrange with him for absent treatment but it was not in his line so out of delicacy i did not press it he looked at my teeth and examined my hock and said my age and general condition were favorable to energetic measures therefore he would give me something to turn the stomachache into the botts and the cold in the head into the blind staggers then he should be on his own beat and would know what to do he made up a bucket of branmash and said a dipperful of it every two hours alternated with a drench with turpentine and axlegrease in it would either knock my ailments out of me in twentyfour hours or so interest me in other ways as to make me forget they were on the premises he administered my first dose himself then took his leave saying i was free to eat and drink anything i pleased and in any quantity i liked but i was not hungry any more and did not care for food  i took up the christian science book and read half of it then took a dipperful of drench and read the other half the resulting experiences were full of interest and adventure all through the rumblings and grindings and quakings and effervescings accompanying the evolution of the ache into the botts and the cold into the blind staggers i could note the generous struggle for mastery going on between the mash and the drench and the literature and often i could tell which was ahead and could easily distinguish the literature from the others when the others were separate though not when they were mixed for when a branmash and an eclectic drench are mixed together they look just like the apodictical principle out on a lark and no one can tell it from that the finish was reached at last the evolutions were complete and a fine success but i think that this result could have been achieved with fewer materials i believe the mash was necessary to the conversion of the stomachache into the botts but i think one could develop the blind staggers out of the literature by itself also that blind staggers produced in this way would be of a better quality and more lasting than any produced by the artificial processes of the horsedoctor  for of all the strange and frantic and incomprehensible and uninterpretable books which the imagination of man has created surely this one is the prize sample it is written with a limitless confidence and complacency and with a dash and stir and earnestness which often compel the effects of eloquence even when the words do not seem to have any traceable meaning there are plenty of people who imagine they understand the book i know this for i have talked with them but in all cases they were people who also imagined that there were no such things as pain sickness and death and no realities in the world nothing actually existent but mind it seems to me to modify the value of their testimony when these people talk about christian science they do as mrs fuller did they do not use their own language but the books they pour out the books showy incoherences and leave you to find out later that they were not originating but merely quoting they seem to know the volume by heart and to revere it as they would a bibleanother bible perhaps i ought to say plainly the book was written under the mental desolations of the third degree and i feel sure that none but the membership of that degree can discover meanings in it when you read it you seem to be listening to a lively and aggressive and oracular speech delivered in an unknown tongue a speech whose spirit you get but not the particulars or to change the figure you seem to be listening to a vigorous instrument which is making a noise which it thinks is a tune but which to persons not members of the band is only the martial tooting of a trombone and merrily stirs the soul through the noise but does not convey a meaning  the books serenities of selfsatisfaction do almost seem to smack of a heavenly originthey have no bloodkin in the earth it is more than human to be so placidly certain about things and so finely superior and so airily content with ones performance without ever presenting anything which may rightfully be called by the strong name of evidence and sometimes without even mentioning a reason for a deduction at all it thunders out the startling words i have proved so and so it takes the pope and all the great guns of his church in battery assembled to authoritatively settle and establish the meaning of a sole and single unclarified passage of scripture and this at vast cost of time and study and reflection but the author of this work is superior to all that she finds the whole bible in an unclarified audition and at small expense of time and no expense of mental effort she clarifies it from lid to lid reorganizes and improves the meanings then authoritatively settles and establishes them with formulas which you cannot tell from let there be light and here you have it it is the first time since the dawndays of creation that a voice has gone crashing through space with such placid and complacent confidence and command  january 1903 the first reading of any book whose terminology is new and strange is nearly sure to leave the reader in a bewildered and sarcastic state of mind but now that during the past two months i have by diligence gained a fair acquaintanceship with science and health technicalities i no longer find the bulk of that work hard to understandm t  ps the wisdom harvested from the foregoing thoughts has already done me a service and saved me a sorrow nearly a month ago there came to me from one of the universities a tract by dr edward anthony spitzka on the encephalic anatomy of the races i judged that my opinion was desired by the university and i was greatly pleased with this attention and wrote and said i would furnish it as soon as i could that night i put my plodding and disheartening christian science mining aside and took hold of the matter i wrote an eager chapter and was expecting to finish my opinion the next day but was called away for a week and my mind was soon charged with other interests it was not until today after the lapse of nearly a month that i happened upon my encephalic chapter again meantime the new wisdom had come to me and i read it with shame i recognized that i had entered upon that work in far from the right temperfar from the respectful and judicial spirit which was its due of reverence i had begun upon it with the following paragraph for fuel  fissures of the parietal and occipital lobes lateral surfacethe postcentral fissural complexin this hemicerebrum the postcentral and subcentral are combined to form a continuous fissure attaining a length of 85 cm dorsally the fissure bifurcates embracing the gyre indented by the caudal limb of the paracentral the caudal limb of the postcentral is joined by a transparietal piece in all five additional rami spring from the combined fissure a vadum separates it from the parietal another from the central  it humiliates me now to see how angry i got over that and how scornful i said that the style was disgraceful that it was labored and tumultuous and in places violent that the treatment was involved and erratic and almost as a rule bewildering that to lack of simplicity was added a lack of vocabulary that there was quite too much feeling shown that if i had a dog that would get so excited and incoherent over a tranquil subject like encephalic anatomy i would not pay his tax and at that point i got excited myself and spoke bitterly of these mongrel insanities and said a person might as well try to understand science and health  i know now where the trouble was and am glad of the interruption that saved me from sending my verdict to the university it makes me cold to think what those people might have thought of mem t     chapter iv  no one doubtscertainly not ithat the mind exercises a powerful influence over the body from the beginning of time the sorcerer the interpreter of dreams the fortuneteller the charlatan the quack the wild medicineman the educated physician the mesmerist and the hypnotist have made use of the clients imagination to help them in their work they have all recognized the potency and availability of that force physicians cure many patients with a bread pill they know that where the disease is only a fancy the patients confidence in the doctor will make the bread pill effective  faith in the doctor perhaps that is the entire thing it seems to look like it in old times the king cured the kings evil by the touch of the royal hand he frequently made extraordinary cures could his footman have done it nonot in his own clothes disguised as the king could he have done it i think we may not doubt it i think we may feel sure that it was not the kings touch that made the cure in any instance but the patients faith in the efficacy of a kings touch genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a saint is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient when i was a boy a farmers wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as a faithdoctorthat was what she called herself sufferers came to her from all around and she laid her hand upon them and said have faithit is all that is necessary and they went away well of their ailments she was not a religious woman and pretended to no occult powers she said that the patients faith in her did the work several times i saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches my mother was the patient in austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry and has both the high and the low for patients he gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high in bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire from his profession of stagecarpentering in order to meet the demand of his constantly increasing body of customers he goes on from year to year doing his miracles and has become very rich he pretends to no religious helps no supernatural aids but thinks there is something in his makeup which inspires the confidence of his patients and that it is this confidence which does the work and not some mysterious power issuing from himself  within the last quarter of a century in america several sects of curers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in the way of healing ailments without the use of medicines there are the mind cure the faith cure the prayer cure the mental science cure and the christianscience cure and apparently they all do their miracles with the same old powerful instrumentthe patients imagination differing names but no difference in the process but they do not give that instrument the credit each sect claims that its way differs from the ways of the others  they all achieve some cures there is no question about it and the faith cure and the prayer cure probably do no harm when they do no good since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to but the others bar medicines and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental forces alone there would seem to be an element of danger here it has the look of claiming too much i think public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed  the christian scientist was not able to cure my stomachache and my cold but the horsedoctor did it this convinces me that christian science claims too much in my opinion it ought to let diseases alone and confine itself to surgery there it would have everything its own way  the horsedoctor charged me thirty kreutzers and i paid him in fact i doubled it and gave him a shilling mrs fuller brought in an itemized bill for a crate of broken bones mended in two hundred and thirtyfour placesone dollar per fracture  nothing exists but mind  nothing she answered all else is substanceless all else is imaginary  i gave her an imaginary check and now she is suing me for substantial dollars it looks inconsistent     chapter v  let us consider that we are all partially insane it will explain us to each other it will unriddle many riddles it will make clear and simple many things which are involved in haunting and harassing difficulties and obscurities now  those of us who are not in the asylum and not demonstrably due there are nevertheless no doubt insane in one or two particulars i think we must admit this but i think that we are otherwise healthyminded i think that when we all see one thing alike it is evidence that as regards that one thing our minds are perfectly sound now there are really several things which we do all see alike things which we all accept and about which we do not dispute for instance we who are outside of the asylum all agree that water seeks its level that the sun gives light and heat that fire consumes that fog is damp that six times six are thirtysix that two from ten leaves eight that eight and seven are fifteen these are perhaps the only things we are agreed about but although they are so few they are of inestimable value because they make an infallible standard of sanity whosoever accepts them him we know to be substantially sane sufficiently sane in the working essentials sane whoever disputes a single one of them him we know to be wholly insane and qualified for the asylum  very well the man who disputes none of them we concede to be entitled to go at large but that is concession enough we cannot go any further than that for we know that in all matters of mere opinion that same man is insanejust as insane as we are just as insane as shakespeare was we know exactly where to put our finger upon his insanity it is where his opinion differs from ours  that is a simple rule and easy to remember when i a thoughtful and unblessed presbyterian examine the koran i know that beyond any question every mohammedan is insane not in all things but in religious matters when a thoughtful and unblessed mohammedan examines the westminster catechism he knows that beyond any question i am spiritually insane i cannot prove to him that he is insane because you never can prove anything to a lunaticfor that is a part of his insanity and the evidence of it he cannot prove to me that i am insane for my mind has the same defect that afflicts his all democrats are insane but not one of them knows it none but the republicans and mugwumps know it all the republicans are insane but only the democrats and mugwumps can perceive it the rule is perfect in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane when i look around me i am often troubled to see how many people are mad to mention only a few  the atheist the theosophists the infidel the swedenborgians the agnostic the shakers the baptist the millerites the methodist the mormons the christian scientist the laurence oliphant harrisites the catholic and the 115 christian sects the presbyterian excepted the grand lamas people the monarchists the imperialists the 72 mohammedan sects the democrats the republicans but not the mugwumps the buddhist the blavatskybuddhist the mindcurists the faithcurists the nationalist the mental scientists the confucian the spiritualist the allopaths the 2000 east indian sects the homeopaths the electropaths the peculiar people the  but theres no end to the list there are millions of them and all insane each in his own way insane as to his pet fad or opinion but otherwise sane and rational this should move us to be charitable towards one anothers lunacies i recognize that in his special belief the christian scientist is insane because he does not believe as i do but i hail him as my mate and fellow because i am as insane as he insane from his point of view and his point of view is as authoritative as mine and worth as much that is to say worth a brass farthing upon a great religious or political question the opinion of the dullest head in the world is worth the same as the opinion of the brightest head in the worlda brass farthing how do we arrive at this it is simple the affirmative opinion of a stupid man is neutralized by the negative opinion of his stupid neighbor no decision is reached the affirmative opinion of the intellectual giant gladstone is neutralized by the negative opinion of the intellectual giant newmanno decision is reached opinions that prove nothing are of course without value any but a dead person knows that much this obliges us to admit the truth of the unpalatable proposition just mentioned abovethat in disputed matters political and religious one mans opinion is worth no more than his peers and hence it followers that no mans opinion possesses any real value it is a humbling thought but there is no way to get around it all opinions upon these great subjects are brassfarthing opinions  it is a mere plain simple factas clear and as certain as that eight and seven make fifteen and by it we recognize that we are all insane as concerns those matters if we were sane we should all see a political or religious doctrine alike there would be no dispute it would be a case of eight and sevenjust as it is in heaven where all are sane and none insane there there is but one religion one belief the harmony is perfect there is never a discordant note  under protection of these preliminaries i suppose i may now repeat without offence that the christian scientist is insane i mean him no discourtesy and i am not chargingnor even imaginingthat he is insaner than the rest of the human race i think he is more picturesquely insane than some of us at the same time i am quite sure that in one important and splendid particular he is much saner than is the vast bulk of the race  why is he insane i told you before it is because his opinions are not ours i know of no other reason and i do not need any other it is the only way we have of discovering insanity when it is not violent it is merely the picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it more interesting than my kind or yours for instance consider his little book the little book exposed in the sky eighteen centuries ago by the flaming angel of the apocalypse and handed down in our day to mrs mary baker g eddy of new hampshire and translated by her word for word into english with help of a polisher and now published and distributed in hundreds of editions by her at a clear profit per volume above cost of seven hundred per centa profit which distinctly belongs to the angel of the apocalypse and let him collect it if he can a little book which the cs very frequently calls by just that name and always enclosed in quotationmarks to keep its high origin exultantly in mind a little book which explains and reconstructs and newpaints and decorates the bible and puts a mansard roof on it and a lightningrod and all the other modern improvements a little book which for the present affects to travel in yoke with the bible and be friendly to it and within half a century will hitch the bible in the rear and thenceforth travel tandem itself in the lead in the coming great march of christian scientism through the protestant dominions of the planet     chapter vi  hungry ones throng to hear the bible read in connection with the textbook of christian science science and health with key to the scriptures by mary baker g eddy these are our only preachers they are the word of god christian science journal october 1898  is that picturesque a lady has told me that in a chapel of the mosque in boston there is a picture or image of mrs eddy and that before it burns a neverextinguished light is that picturesque how long do you think it will be before the christian scientist will be worshipping that picture or image and praying to it how long do you think it will be before it is claimed that mrs eddy is a redeemer a christ and christs equal already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as our mother  how long will it be before they place her on the steps of the throne beside the virginand later a step higher first mary the virgin and mary the matron later with a change of precedence mary the matron and mary the virgin let the artist get ready with his canvas and his brushes the new renaissance is on its way and there will be money in altarcanvasesa thousand times as much as the popes and their church ever spent on the old masters for their riches were poverty as compared with what is going to pour into the treasurechest of the christianscientist papacy byandby let us not doubt it we will examine the financial outlook presently and see what it promises a favorite subject of the new old master will be the first verse of the twelfth chapter of revelationa verse which mrs eddy says in her annex to the scriptures has one distinctive feature which has special reference to the present ageand to her as is rather pointedly indicated  and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet etc  the woman clothed with the sun will be a portrait of mrs eddy  is it insanity to believe that christianscientism is destined to make the most formidable show that any new religion has made in the world since the birth and spread of mohammedanism and that within a century from now it may stand second to rome only in numbers and power in christendom  if this is a wild dream it will not be easy to prove it so just yet i think there seems argument that it may come true the christianscience boom proper is not yet five years old yet already it has two hundred and fifty churches  it has its start you see and it is a phenomenally good one moreover it is latterly spreading with a constantly accelerating swiftness it has a better chance to grow and prosper and achieve permanency than any other existing ism for it has more to offer than any other the past teaches us that in order to succeed a movement like this must not be a mere philosophy it must be a religion also that it must not claim entire originality but content itself with passing for an improvement on an existing religion and show its hand later when strong and prosperouslike mohammedanism  next there must be moneyand plenty of it  next the power and authority and capital must be concentrated in the grip of a small and irresponsible clique with nobody outside privileged to ask questions or find fault  next as before remarked it must bait its hook with some new and attractive advantages over the baits offered by its competitors a new movement equipped with some of these endowmentslike spiritualism for instance may count upon a considerable success a new movement equipped with the bulk of themlike mohammedanism for instancemay count upon a widely extended conquest mormonism had all the requisites but one it had nothing new and nothing valuable to bait with spiritualism lacked the important detail of concentration of money and authority in the hands of an irresponsible clique  the above equipment is excellent admirable powerful but not perfect there is yet another detail which is worth the whole of it put together and more a detail which has never been joined in the beginning of a religious movement to a supremely good working equipment since the world began until now a new personage to worship christianity had the saviour but at first and for generations it lacked money and concentrated power in mrs eddy christian science possesses the new personage for worship and in additionhere in the very beginninga working equipment that has not a flaw in it in the beginning mohammedanism had no money and it has never had anything to offer its client but heavennothing here below that was valuable in addition to heaven hereafter christian science has present health and a cheerful spirit to offer and in comparison with this bribe all other thisworld bribes are poor and cheap you recognize that this estimate is admissible do you not  to whom does bellamys nationalism appeal necessarily to the few people who read and dream and are compassionate and troubled for the poor and the harddriven to whom does spiritualism appeal necessarily to the few its boom has lasted for half a century and i believe it claims short of four millions of adherents in america who are attracted by swedenborgianism and some of the other fine and delicate isms the few again educated people sensitively organized with superior mental endowments who seek lofty planes of thought and find their contentment there and who are attracted by christian science there is no limit its field is horizonless its appeal is as universal as is the appeal of christianity itself it appeals to the rich the poor the high the low the cultured the ignorant the gifted the stupid the modest the vain the wise the silly the soldier the civilian the hero the coward the idler the worker the godly the godless the freeman the slave the adult the child they who are ailing in body or mind they who have friends that are ailing in body or mind to mass it in a phrase its clientage is the human race will it march i think so  remember its principal great offer to rid the race of pain and disease can it do so in large measure yes how much of the pain and disease in the world is created by the imaginations of the sufferers and then kept alive by those same imaginations fourfifths not anything short of that i should think can christian science banish that fourfifths i think so can any other organized force do it none that i know of would this be a new world when that was accomplished and a pleasanter onefor us well people as well as for those fussy and fretting sick ones would it seem as if there was not as much gloomy weather as there used to be i think so  in the mean time would the scientist kill off a good many patients i think so more than get killed off now by the legalized methods i will take up that question presently  at present i wish to ask you to examine some of the scientists performances as registered in his magazine the christian science journaloctober number 1898 first a baptist clergyman gives us this true picture of the average orthodox christianand he could have added that it is a true picture of the average civilized human being  he is a worried and fretted and fearful man afraid of himself and his propensities afraid of colds and fevers afraid of treading on serpents or drinking deadly things  then he gives us this contrast  the average christian scientist has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet he does have a victory over fear and care that is not achieved by the average orthodox christian  he has put all anxiety and fretting under his feet what proportion of your earnings or income would you be willing to pay for that frame of mind year in year out it really outvalues any price that can be put upon it where can you purchase it at any outlay of any sort in any church or out of it except the scientists  well it is the anxiety and fretting about colds and fevers and draughts and getting our feet wet and about forbidden food eaten in terror of indigestion that brings on the cold and the fever and the indigestion and the most of our other ailments and so if the science can banish that anxiety from the world i think it can reduce the worlds disease and pain about fourfifths  in this october number many of the redeemed testify and give thanks and not coldly but with passionate gratitude as a rule they seem drunk with health and with the surprise of it the wonder of it the unspeakable glory and splendor of it after a long sober spell spent in inventing imaginary diseases and concreting them with doctorstuff the first witness testifies that when this most beautiful truth first dawned on him he had nearly all the ills that flesh is heir to that those he did not have he thought he hadand this made the tale about complete what was the natural result why he was a dumppit for all the doctors druggists and patent medicines of the country christian science came to his help and the old sick conditions passed away and along with them the dismal forebodings which he had been accustomed to employ in conjuring up ailments and so he was a healthy and cheerful man now and astonished  but i am not astonished for from other sources i know what must have been his method of applying christian science if i am in the right he watchfully and diligently diverted his mind from unhealthy channels and compelled it to travel in healthy ones nothing contrivable by human invention could be more formidably effective than that in banishing imaginary ailments and in closing the entrances against subsequent applicants of their breed i think his method was to keep saying i am well i am soundsound and well well and sound perfectly sound perfectly well i have no pain theres no such thing as pain i have no disease theres no such thing as disease nothing is real but mind all is mind allgood goodgood life soul liver bones one of a series ante and pass the buck  i do not mean that that was exactly the formula used but that it doubtless contains the spirit of it the scientist would attach value to the exact formula no doubt and to the religious spirit in which it was used i should think that any formula that would divert the mind from unwholesome channels and force it into healthy ones would answer every purpose with some people though not with all i think it most likely that a very religious man would find the addition of the religious spirit a powerful reinforcement in his case  the second witness testifies that the science banished an old organic trouble which the doctor and the surgeon had been nursing with drugs and the knife for seven years  he calls it his claim a surfaceminer would think it was not his claim at all but the property of the doctor and his pal the surgeonfor he would be misled by that word which is christianscience slang for ailment the christian scientist has no ailment to him there is no such thing and he will not use the hateful word all that happens to him is that upon his attention an imaginary disturbance sometimes obtrudes itself which claims to be an ailment but isnt  this witness offers testimony for a clergyman seventy years old who had preached forty years in a christian church and has now gone over to the new sect he was almost blind and deaf he was treated by the c s method and when he heard the voice of truth he saw spiritually saw spiritually it is a little indefinite they had better treat him again indefinite testimonies might properly be wastebasketed since there is evidently no lack of definite ones procurable but this c s magazine is poorly edited and so mistakes of this kind must be expected  the next witness is a soldier of the civil war when christian science found him he had in stock the following claims  indigestion rheumatism catarrh chalky deposits in shoulderjoints armjoints handjoints insomnia atrophy of the muscles of arms shoulders stiffness of all those joints excruciating pains most of the time  these claims have a very substantial sound they came of exposure in the campaigns the doctors did all they could but it was little prayers were tried but i never realized any physical relief from that source after thirty years of torture he went to a christian scientist and took an hours treatment and went home painless two days later he began to eat like a well man then the claims vanishedsome at once others more gradually finally they have almost entirely disappeared anda thing which is of still greater valuehe is now contented and happy that is a detail which as earlier remarked is a scientist church specialty and indeed one may go further and assert with little or no exaggeration that it is a christianscience monopoly with thirtyone years effort the methodist church had not succeeded in furnishing it to this harassed soldier  and so the tale goes on witness after witness bulletins his claims declares their prompt abolishment and gives mrs eddys discovery the praise milkleg is cured nervous prostration is cured consumption is cured and st vituss dance is made a pastime even without a fiddle and now and then an interesting new addition to the science slang appears on the page we have demonstrations over chilblains and such things it seems to be a curtailed way of saying demonstrations of the power of christianscience truth over the fiction which masquerades under the name of chilblains the children as well as the adults share in the blessings of the science through the study of the little book they are learning how to be healthful peaceful and wise sometimes they are cured of their little claims by the professional healer and sometimes more advanced children say over the formula and cure themselves  a little farwestern girl of nine equipped with an adult vocabulary states her age and says i thought i would write a demonstration to you she had a claim derived from getting flung over a ponys head and landed on a rockpile she saved herself from disaster by remembering to say god is all while she was in the air i couldnt have done it i shouldnt even have thought of it i should have been too excited nothing but christian science could have enabled that child to do that calm and thoughtful and judicious thing in those circumstances she came down on her head and by all the rules she should have broken it but the intervention of the formula prevented that so the only claim resulting was a blackened eye monday morning it was still swollen and shut at school it hurt pretty badlythat is it seemed to so i was excused and went down to the basement and said now i am depending on mamma instead of god and i will depend on god instead of mamma no doubt this would have answered but to make sure she added mrs eddy to the team and recited the scientific statement of being which is one of the principal incantations i judge then i felt my eye opening why dear it would have opened an oyster i think it is one of the touchingest things in childhistory that pious little rat down cellar pumping away at the scientific statement of being  there is a page about another good childlittle gordon little gordon came into the world without the assistance of surgery or anaesthetics he was a demonstration a painless one therefore his coming evoked joy and thankfulness to god and the discoverer of christian science it is a noticeable feature of this literaturethe so frequent linking together of the two beings in an equal bond also of their two bibles when little gordon was two years old he was playing horse on the bed where i had left my little book i noticed him stop in his play take the book carefully in his little hands kiss it softly then look about for the highest place of safety his arms could reach and put it there this pious act filled the mother with such a train of thought as i had never experienced before i thought of the sweet mother of long ago who kept things in her heart etc it is a bold comparison however unconscious profanations are about as common in the mouths of the lay member ship of the new church as are frank and open ones in the mouths of its consecrated chiefs  some days later the family librarychristianscience bookswas lying in a deepseated window this was another chance for the holy child to show off he left his play and went there and pushed all the books to one side except the annex it he took in both hands slowly raised it to his lips then removed it carefully and seated himself in the window it had seemed to the mother too wonderful to be true that first time but now she was convinced that neither imagination nor accident had anything to do with it later little gordon let the author of his being see him do it after that he did it frequently probably every time anybody was looking i would rather have that child than a chromo if this tale has any object it is to intimate that the inspired book was supernaturally able to convey a sense of its sacred and awful character to this innocent little creature without the intervention of outside aids the magazine is not edited with highpriced discretion the editor has a claim and he ought to get it treated  among other witnesses there is one who had a jumping toothache which several times tempted her to believe that there was sensation in matter but each time it was overcome by the power of truth she would not allow the dentist to use cocaine but sat there and let him punch and drill and split and crush the tooth and tear and slash its ulcerations and pull out the nerve and dig out fragments of bone and she wouldnt once confess that it hurt and to this day she thinks it didnt and i have not a doubt that she is ninetenths right and that her christian science faith did her better service than she could have gotten out of cocaine  there is an account of a boy who got broken all up into small bits by an accident but said over the scientific statement of being or some of the other incantations and got well and sound without having suffered any real pain and without the intrusion of a surgeon  also there is an account of the restoration to perfect health in a single night of a fatally injured horse by the application of christian science i can stand a good deal but i recognize that the ice is getting thin here that horse had as many as fifty claims how could he demonstrate over them could he do the allgood goodgood goodgracious liver bones truth all down but nine set them up on the other alley could he intone the scientific statement of being now could he wouldnt it give him a relapse let us draw the line at horses horses and furniture  there is plenty of other testimonies in the magazine but these quoted samples will answer they show the kind of trade the science is driving now we come back to the question does the science kill a patient here and there and now and then we must concede it does it compensate for this i am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction for instance when it lays its hand upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind what is the actual sum of that achievement this i think that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten deaths a year for thirty years and each of them a long and painful one but for its interference that man in the three years which have since elapsed would have essentially died thirty times more there are thousands of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a lifelong death similar to that mans every time the science captures one of these and secures to him lifelong immunity from imaginationmanufactured disease it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved three hundred lives meantime it will kill a man every now and then but no matter it will still be ahead on the credit side  notei have received several letters two from educated and ostensibly intelligent persons which contained in substance this protest i dont object to men and women chancing their lives with these people but it is a burning shame that the law should allow them to trust their helpless little children in their deadly hands isnt it touching isnt it deep isnt it modest it is as if the person said i know that to a parent his child is the core of his heart the apple of his eye a possession so dear so precious that he will trust its life in no hands but those which he believes with all his soul to be the very best and the very safest but it is a burning shame that the law does not require him to come to me to ask what kind of healer i will allow him to call the public is merely a multiplied memt     chapter vii  we consciously declare that science and health with key to the scriptures was foretold as well as its author mary baker eddy in revelation x she is the mighty angel or gods highest thought to this age verse 1 giving us the spiritual interpretation of the bible in the little book open verse 2 thus we prove that christian science is the second coming of christtruthspiritlecture by dr george tomkins dd cs  there you have it in plain speech she is the mighty angel she is the divinely and officially sent bearer of gods highest thought for the present she brings the second advent we must expect that before she has been in her grave fifty years she will be regarded by her following as having been herself the second advent she is already worshiped and we must expect this feeling to spread territorially and also to deepen in intensity  particularly after her death for then as any one can foresee eddyworship will be taught in the sundayschools and pulpits of the cult already whatever she puts her trademark on though it be only a memorialspoon is holy and is eagerly and gratefully bought by the disciple and becomes a fetish in his house i say bought for the boston christianscience trust gives nothing away everything it has is for sale and the terms are cash and not only cash but cash in advance its god is mrs eddy first then the dollar not a spiritual dollar but a real one from end to end of the christian science literature not a single material thing in the world is conceded to be real except the dollar but all through and through its advertisements that reality is eagerly and persistently recognized  the dollar is hunted down in all sorts of ways the christianscience motherchurch and bargaincounter in boston peddles all kinds of spiritual wares to the faithful and always on the one conditioncash cash in advance the angel of the apocalypse could

elsewhere  one hundred dollars for it and i have a case among my statistics where the student had a three weeks course and paid three hundred for it  the trust does love the dollar when it isnt a spiritual one  in order to force the sale of mrs eddys bibleannex no healer metaphysicalcollegebred or other is allowed to practice the game unless he possesses a copy of that book that means a large and constantly augmenting income for the trust no cs family would consider itself loyal or pious or painproof without an annex or two in the house that means an income for the trust in the near future of millions not thousandsmillions a year  no member young or old of a branch christianscientist church can acquire and retain membership in the motherchurch unless he pay capitation tax of not less than a dollar say the bylaws to the boston trust every year that means an income for the trust in the near future oflet us venture to saymillions more per year  it is a reasonably safe guess that in america in 1920 there will be ten million christian scientists and three millions in great britain that these figures will be trebled in 1930 that in america in 1920 the christian scientists will be a political force in 1930 politically formidable and in 1940 the governing power in the republicto remain that permanently and i think it a reasonable guess that the trust which is already in our day pretty brusque in its ways will then be the most insolent and unscrupulous and tyrannical politicoreligious master that has dominated a people since the palmy days of the inquisition and a stronger master than the strongest of bygone times because this one will have a financial strength not dreamed of by any predecessor as effective a concentration of irresponsible power as any predecessor has had in the railway the telegraph and the subsidized newspaper better facilities for watching and managing his empire than any predecessor has had and after a generation or two he will probably divide christendom with the catholic church  the roman church has a perfect organization and it has an effective centralization of powerbut not of its cash its multitude of bishops are rich but their riches remain in large measure in their own hands they collect from two hundred millions of people but they keep the bulk of the result at home the boston pope of byandby will draw his dollarahead capitationtax from three hundred millions of the human race and the annex and the rest of his bookshop stock will fetch in as much more and his metaphysical colleges the annual pilgrimage to mrs eddys tomb from all over the worldadmission the christianscience dollar payable in advancepurchases of consecrated glass beads candles memorial spoons aureoled chromeportraits and bogus autographs of mrs eddy cash offerings at her shrine no crutches of cured cripples received and no imitations of miraculously restored broken legs and necks allowed to be hung up except when made out of the holy metal and proved by fireassay cash for miracles worked at the tomb these moneysources with a thousand to be yet invented and ambushed upon the devotee will bring the annual increment well up above a billion and nobody but the trust will have the handling of it in that day the trust will monopolize the manufacture and sale of the old and new testaments as well as the annex and raise their price to annex rates and compel the devotee to buy for even today a healer has to have the annex and the scriptures or he is not allowed to work the game and that will bring several hundred million dollars more in those days the trust will have an income approaching five million dollars a day and no expenses to be taken out of it no taxes to pay and no charities to support that last detail should not be lightly passed over by the reader it is well entitled to attention  no charities to support no nor even to contribute to one searches in vain the trusts advertisements and the utterances of its organs for any suggestion that it spends a penny on orphans widows discharged prisoners hospitals ragged schools night missions city missions libraries old peoples homes or any other object that appeals to a human beings purse through his heart  i have hunted hunted and hunted by correspondence and otherwise and have not yet got upon the track of a farthing that the trust has spent upon any worthy object nothing makes a scientist so uncomfortable as to ask him if he knows of a case where christian science has spent money on a benevolence either among its own adherents or elsewhere he is obliged to say no and then one discovers that the person questioned has been asked the question many times before and that it is getting to be a sore subject with him why a sore subject because he has written his chiefs and asked with high confidence for an answer that will confound these questionersand the chiefs did not reply he has written again and then againnot with confidence but humbly nowand has begged for defensive ammunition in the voice of supplication a reply does at last come to this effect we must have faith in our mother and rest content in the conviction that whatever she does with the money it is in accordance with orders from heaven for she does no act of any kind without first demonstrating over it  that settles itas far as the disciple is concerned his mind is satisfied with that answer he gets down his annex and does an incantation or two and that mesmerizes his spirit and puts that to sleepbrings it peace peace and comfort and joy until some inquirer punctures the old sore again  through friends in america i asked some questions and in some cases got definite and informing answers in other cases the answers were not definite and not valuable to the question does any of the money go to charities the answer from an authoritative source was no not in the sense usually conveyed by this word the italics are mine that answer is cautious but definite i thinkutterly and unassailably definitealthough quite christianscientifically foggy in its phrasing christianscience testimony is generally foggy generally diffuse generally garrulous the writer was aware that the first word in his phrase answered the question which i was asking but he could not help adding nine dark words meaningless ones unless explained by him it is quite likely as intimated by him that christian science has invented a new class of objects to apply the word charity to but without an explanation we cannot know what they are we quite easily and naturally and confidently guess that they are in all cases objects which will return five hundred per cent on the trusts investment in them but guessing is not knowledge it is merely in this case a sort of ninetenths certainty deducible from what we think we know of the trusts trade principles and its sly and furtive and shifty ways  sly deep judicious the trust understands its business the trust does not give itself away it defeats all the attempts of us impertinents to get at its trade secrets to this day after all our diligence we have not been able to get it to confess what it does with the money it does not even let its own disciples find out all it says is that the matter has been demonstrated over now and then a lay scientist says with a grateful exultation that mrs eddy is enormously rich but he stops there as to whether any of the money goes to other charities or not he is obliged to admit that he does not know however the trust is composed of human beings and this justifies the conjecture that if it had a charity on its list which it was proud of we should soon hear of it  without money and without price those used to be the terms mrs eddys annex cancels them the motto of christian science is the laborer is worthy of his hire and now that it has been demonstrated over we find its spiritual meaning to be do anything and everything your hand may find to do and charge cash for it and collect the money in advance the scientist has on his tongues end a cutanddried bostonsupplied set of rather lean arguments whose function is to show that it is a heavencommanded duty to do this and that the croupiers of the game have no choice but to obey  the trust seems to be a reincarnation exodus xxxii 4  i have no reverence for the trust but i am not lacking in reverence for the sincerities of the lay membership of the new church there is every evidence that the lay members are entirely sincere in their faith and i think sincerity is always entitled to honor and respect let the inspiration of the sincerity be what it may zeal and sincerity can carry a new religion further than any other missionary except fire and sword and i believe that the new religion will conquer the half of christendom in a hundred years i am not intending this as a compliment to the human race i am merely stating an opinion and yet i think that perhaps it is a compliment to the race i keep in mind that saying of an orthodox preacherquoted further back he conceded that this new christianity frees its possessors life from frets fears vexations bitterness and all sorts of imaginationpropagated maladies and pains and fills his world with sunshine and his heart with gladness if christian science with this stupendous equipmentand final salvation addedcannot win half the christian globe i must be badly mistaken in the makeup of the human race  i think the trust will be handed down like the other papacy and will always know how to handle its limitless cash it will press the button the zeal the energy the sincerity the enthusiasm of its countless vassals will do the rest     chapter viii  the power which a mans imagination has over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force which none of us is born without the first man had it the last one will possess it if left to himself a man is most likely to use only the mischievous half of the forcethe half which invents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates them and if he is one of thesevery wise people he is quite likely to scoff at the beneficent half of the force and deny its existence and so to heal or help that man two imaginations are required his own and some outsiders the outsider b must imagine that his incantations are the healingpower that is curing a and a must imagine that this is so i think it is not so at all but no matter the cure is effected and that is the main thing the outsiders work is unquestionably valuable so valuable that it may fairly be likened to the essential work performed by the engineer when he handles the throttle and turns on the steam the actual power is lodged exclusively in the engine but if the engine were left alone it would never start of itself whether the engineer be named jim or bob or tom it is all onehis services are necessary and he is entitled to such wage as he can get you to pay whether he be named christian scientist or mental scientist or mind curist or kingsevil expert or hypnotist it is all one he is merely the engineer he simply turns on the same old steam and the engine does the whole work  the christianscientist engineer drives exactly the same trade as the other engineers yet he outprospers the whole of them put together  is it because he has captured the takingest name i think that that is only a small part of it i think that the secret of his high prosperity lies elsewhere  the christian scientist has organized the business now that was certainly a gigantic idea electricity in limitless volume has existed in the air and the rocks and the earth and everywhere since time beganand was going to waste all the while in our time we have organized that scattered and wandering force and set it to work and backed the business with capital and concentrated it in few and competent hands and the results are as we see  the christian scientist has taken a force which has been lying idle in every member of the human race since time began and has organized it and backed the business with capital and concentrated it at boston headquarters in the hands of a small and very competent trust and there are results  therein lies the promise that this monopoly is going to extend its commerce wide in the earth i think that if the business were conducted in the loose and disconnected fashion customary with such things it would achieve but little more than the modest prosperity usually secured by unorganized great moral and commercial ventures but i believe that so long as this one remains compactly organized and closely concentrated in a trust the spread of its dominion will continue     chapter ix  four years ago i wrote the preceding chapters i was assured by the wise that christian science was a fleeting craze and would soon perish this prompt and allcompetent stripe of prophet is always to be had in the market at groundfloor rates he does not stop to load or consider or take aim but lets fly just as he stands facts are nothing to him he has no use for such things he works wholly by inspiration and so when he is asked why he considers a new movement a passing fad and quickly perishable he finds himself unprepared with a reason and is more or less embarrassed for a moment only for a moment then he waylays the first spectre of a reason that goes flitting through the desert places of his mind and is at once serene again and ready for conflict serene and confident yet he should not be so since he has had no chance to examine his catch and cannot know whether it is going to help his contention or damage it  the impromptu reason furnished by the early prophets of whom i have spoken was this  there is nothing to christian science there is nothing about it that appeals to the intellect its market will be restricted to the unintelligent the mentally inferior the people who do not think  they called that a reason why the cult would not flourish and endure it seems the equivalent of saying  there is no money in tinware there is nothing about it that appeals to the rich its market will be restricted to the poor  it is like bringing forward the best reason in the world why christian science should flourish and live and then blandly offering it as a reason why it should sicken and die  that reason was furnished me by the complacent and unfrightened prophets four years ago and it has been furnished me again today if conversions to new religions or to old ones were in any considerable degree achieved through the intellect the aforesaid reason would be sound and sufficient no doubt the inquirer into christian science might go away unconvinced and unconverted but we all know that conversions are seldom made in that way that such a thing as a serious and painstaking and fairly competent inquiry into the claims of a religion or of a political dogma is a rare occurrence and that the vast mass of men and women are far from being capable of making such an examination they are not capable for the reason that their minds howsoever good they may be are not trained for such examinations the mind not trained for that work is no more competent to do it than are lawyers and farmers competent to make successful clothes without learning the tailors trade there are seventyfive million men and women among us who do not know how to cut out and make a dresssuit and they would not think of trying yet they all think they can competently think out a political or religious scheme without any apprenticeship to the business and many of them believe they have actually worked that miracle but indeed the truth is almost all the men and women of our nation or of any other get their religion and their politics where they get their astronomyentirely at second hand being untrained they are no more able to intelligently examine a dogma or a policy than they are to calculate an eclipse  men are usually competent thinkers along the lines of their specialized training only within these limits alone are their opinions and judgments valuable outside of these limits they grope and are lostusually without knowing it in a church assemblage of five hundred persons there will be a man or two whose trained minds can seize upon each detail of a great manufacturing scheme and recognize its value or its lack of value promptly and can pass the details in intelligent review section by section and finally as a whole and then deliver a verdict upon the scheme which cannot be flippantly set aside nor easily answered and there will be one or two other men there who can do the same thing with a great and complicated educational project and one or two others who can do the like with a large scheme for applying electricity in a new and unheardof way and one or two others who can do it with a showy scheme for revolutionizing the scientific worlds accepted notions regarding geology and so on and so on but the manufacturing experts will not be competent to examine the educational scheme intelligently and their opinion about it would not be valuable neither of these two groups will be able to understand and pass upon the electrical scheme none of these three batches of experts will be able to understand and pass upon the geological revolution and probably not one man in the entire lot will be competent to examine capably the intricacies of a political or religious scheme new or old and deliver a judgment upon it which any one need regard as precious  there you have the top crust there will be four hundred and seventyfive men and women present who can draw upon their training and deliver incontrovertible judgments concerning cheese and leather and cattle and hardware and soap and tar and candles and patent medicines and dreams and apparitions and garden trucks and cats and baby food and warts and hymns and timetables and freightrates and summer resorts and whiskey and law and surgery and dentistry and blacksmithing and shoemaking and dancing and huylers candy and mathematics and dog fights and obstetrics and music and sausages and dry goods and molasses and railroad stocks and horses and literature and labor unions and vegetables and morals and lambs fries and etiquette and agriculture and not ten among the five hundredlet their minds be ever so good and brightwill be competent by grace of the requisite specialized mental training to take hold of a complex abstraction of any kind and make head or tail of it  the whole five hundred are thinkers and they are all capable thinkersbut only within the narrow limits of their specialized trainings four hundred and ninety of them cannot competently examine either a religious plan or a political one a scattering few of them do examine boththat is they think they do with results as precious as when i examine the nebular theory and explain it to myself  if the four hundred and ninety got their religion through their minds and by weighed and measured detail christian science would not be a scary apparition but they dont they get a little of it through their minds more of it through their feelings and the overwhelming bulk of it through their environment  environment is the chief thing to be considered when one is proposing to predict the future of christian science it is not the ability to reason that makes the presbyterian or the baptist or the methodist or the catholic or the mohammedan or the buddhist or the mormon it is environment if religions were got by reasoning we should have the extraordinary spectacle of an american family with a presbyterian in it and a baptist a methodist a catholic a mohammedan a buddhist and a mormon a presbyterian family does not produce catholic families or other religious brands it produces its own kind and not by intellectual processes but by association and so also with mohammedanism the cult which in our day is spreading with the sweep of a worldconflagration through the orient that native home of profound thought and of subtle intellectual fence that fertile womb whence has sprung every great religion that exists including our own for with all our brains we cannot invent a religion and market it  the language of my quoted prophets recurs to us now and we wonder to think how small a space in the world the mighty mohammedan church would be occupying now if a successful trade in its line of goods had been conditioned upon an exhibit that would appeal to the intellect instead of to the unintelligent the mentally inferior the people who do not think  the christian science church like the mohammedan church makes no embarrassing appeal to the intellect has no occasion to do it and can get along quite well without it  provided provided what that it can secure that thing which is worth two or three hundred thousand times more than an appeal to the intellectan environment can it get that will it be a menace to regular christianity if it gets that is it time for regular christianity to get alarmed or shall regular christianity smile a smile and turn over and take another nap wont it be wise and proper for regular christianity to do the old way me customary way the historical waylock the stabledoor after the horse is gone just as protestantism has smiled and nodded this long time while the alert and diligent catholic was slipping in and capturing the public schools and is now beginning to hunt around for the key when it is too late  will christian science get a chance to show its wares it has already secured that chance will it flourish and spread and prosper if it shall create for itself the one thing essential to those conditionsan environment it has already created an environment there are families of christian scientists in every community in america and each family is a factory each family turns out a christian science product at the customary intervals and contributes it to the cause in the only way in which contributions of recruits to churches are ever made on a large scaleby the puissant forces of personal contact and association each family is an agency for the cause and makes converts among the neighbors and starts some more factories  four years ago there were six christian scientists in a certain town that i am acquainted with a year ago there were two hundred and fifty there they have built a church and its membership now numbers four hundred this has all been quietly done done without frenzied revivals without uniforms brass bands street parades corner oratory or any of the other customary persuasions to a godly life christian science like mohammedanism is restricted to the unintelligent the people who do not think there lies the danger it makes christian science formidable it is restricted to ninetynine onehundredths of the human race and must be reckoned with by regular christianity and will be as soon as it is too late       book ii  there were remarkable things about the stranger called the manmysterythings so very extraordinary that they monopolized attention and made all of him seem extraordinary but this was not so the most of his qualities being of the common everyday size and like anybody elses it was curious he was of the ordinary stature and had the ordinary aspects yet in him were hidden such strange contradictions and disproportions he was majestically fearless and heroic he had the strength of thirty men and the daring of thirty thousand handling armies organizing states administering governmentsthese were pastimes to him he publicly and ostentatiously accepted the human race at its own valuationas demigodsand privately and successfully dealt with it at quite another and juster valuationas children and slaves his ambitions were stupendous and his dreams had no commerce with the humble plain but moved with the cloudrack among the snowsummits these features of him were indeed extraordinary but the rest of him was ordinary and usual he was so meanminded in the matter of jealousy that it was thought he was descended from a god he was vain in little ways and had a pride in trivialities he doted on ballads about moonshine and bruised hearts in education he was deficient he was indifferent to literature and knew nothing of art he was dumb upon all subjects but one indifferent to all except that onethe nebular theory upon that one his flow of words was full and free he was a geyser the official astronomers disputed his facts and deeded his views and said that he had invented both they not being findable in any of the books but many of the laity who wanted their nebulosities fresh admired his doctrine and adopted it and it attained to great prosperity in spite of the hostility of the expertsthe legend of the manmystery ch i     chapter i  january 1903 when we do not know a public man personally we guess him out by the facts of his career when it is washington we all arrive at about one and the same result we agree that his words and his acts clearly interpret his character to us and that they never leave us in doubt as to the motives whence the words and acts proceeded it is the same with joan of arc it is the same with two or three or five or six others among the immortals but in the matter of motives and of a few details of character we agree to disagree upon napoleon cromwell and all the rest and to this list we must add mrs eddy i think we can peacefully agree as to two or three extraordinary features of her makeup but not upon the other features of it we cannot peacefully agree as to her motives therefore her character must remain crooked to some of us and straight to the others  no matter she is interesting enough without an amicable agreement in several ways she is the most interesting woman that ever lived and the most extraordinary the same may be said of her career and the same may be said of its chief result she started from nothing her enemies charge that she surreptitiously took from quimby a peculiar system of healing which was mindcure with a biblical basis she and her friends deny that she took anything from him this is a matter which we can discuss byandby whether she took it or invented it it wasmateriallya sawdust mine when she got it and she has turned it into a klondike its spiritual dock had next to no custom if any at all from it she has launched a worldreligion which has now six hundred and sixtythree churches and she charters a new one every four days when we do not know a personand also when we dowe have to judge his size by the size and nature of his achievements as compared with the achievements of others in his special line of businessthere is no other way measured by this standard it is thirteen hundred years since the world has produced any one who could reach up to mrs eddys waistbelt  figuratively speaking mrs eddy is already as tall as the eiffel tower she is adding surprisingly to her stature every day it is quite within the probabilities that a century hence she will be the most imposing figure that has cast its shadow across the globe since the inauguration of our era i grant that after saying these strong things it is necessary that i offer some details calculated to satisfactorily demonstrate the proportions which i have claimed for her i will do that presently but before exhibiting the matured sequoia gigantea i believe it will be best to exhibit the sprout from which it sprang it may save the reader from making miscalculations the person who imagines that a big tree sprout is bigger than other kinds of sprouts is quite mistaken it is the ordinary thing it makes no show it compels no notice it hasnt a detectible quality in it that entitles it to attention or suggests the future giant its sap is suckling that is the kind of sprout mrs eddy was  from her childhood days up to where she was running a halfcentury a close race and gaining on it she was most humanly commonplace  she is the witness i am drawing this from she has revealed it in her autobiography not intentionally of coursei am not claiming that an autobiography is the most treacherous thing there is it lets out every secret its author is trying to keep it lets the truth shine unobstructed through every harmless little deception he tries to play it pitilessly exposes him as a tin hero worshipping himself as big metal every time he tries to do the modestunconsciousness act before the reader this is not guessing i am speaking from autobiographical personal experience i was never able to refrain from mentioning with a studied casualness that could deceive none but the most incautious reader that an ancestor of mine was sent ambassador to spain by charles i nor that in a remote branch of my family there exists a claimant to an earldom nor that an uncle of mine used to own a dog that was descended from the dog that was in the ark and at the same time i was never able to persuade myself to call a gibbet by its right name when accounting for other ancestors of mine but always spoke of it as the platformpuerilely intimating that they were out lecturing when it happened  it is mrs eddy over again as regards her minor half she is as commonplace as the rest of us vain of trivial things all the first half of her life and still vain of them at seventy and recording them with naive satisfactioneven rescuing some early rhymes of hers of the sort that we all scribble in the innocent days of our youthrescuing them and printing them without pity or apology just as the weakest and commonest of us do in our gray age moreshe still frankly admires them and in her introduction of them profanely confers upon them the holy name of poetry sample       and laud the land whose talents rock      the cradle of her power      and wreaths are twined round plymouth rock      from eruditions bower       minervas silver sandals still      are loosed and not effete  you note it is not a shade above the thing which all human beings churn out in their youth  you would not think that in a little wee primerfor that is what the autobiography isa person with a tumultuous career of seventy years behind her could find room for two or three pages of padding of this kind but such is the case she evidently puts narrative together with difficulty and is not at home in it and is glad to have something readymade to fill in with another sample       here famehonored hickory rears his bold form      and bears a brave breast to the lightning and storm      while palm bay and laurel in classical glee      chase tulip magnolia and fragrant fringetree  vivid you can fairly see those trees galloping around that she could still treasure up and print and manifestly admire those poems indicates that the most daring and masculine and masterful woman that has appeared in the earth in centuries has the same soft girlygirly places in her that the rest of us have  when it comes to selecting her ancestors she is still human natural vain commonplaceas commonplace as i am myself when i am sorting ancestors for my autobiography she combs out some creditable scots and labels them and sets them aside for use not overlooking the one to whom sir william wallace gave a heavy sword encased in a brass scabbard and naively explaining which sir william wallace it was lest we get the wrong one by the hassock this is the one from whose patriotism and bravery comes that heartstirring air scots wha hae wi wallace bled hannah more was related to her ancestors she explains who hannah more was  whenever a person informs us who sir william wallace was or who wrote hamlet or where the declaration of independence was fought it fills us with a suspicion wellnigh amounting to conviction that that person would not suspect us of being so empty of knowledge if he wasnt suffering from the same claim himself then we turn to page 20 of the autobiography and happen upon this passage and that hasty suspicion stands rebuked  i gained bookknowledge with far less labor than is usually requisite at ten years of age i was as familiar with lindley murrays grammar as with the westminster catechism and the latter i had to repeat every sunday my favorite studies were natural philosophy logic and moral science from my brother albert i received lessons in the ancient tongues hebrew greek and latin  you catch your breath in astonishment and feel again and still again the pang of that rebuke but then your eye falls upon the next sentence but one and the pain passes away and you set up the suspicion again with evil satisfaction  after my discovery of christian science most of the knowledge i had gleaned from schoolbooks vanished like a dream  that disappearance accounts for much in her miscellaneous writings as i was saying she handles her ancestral shadows as she calls them just as i do mine it is remarkable when she runs across a relative of my grandfather baker general henry knox of revolutionary fame she sets him down when she finds another good one the late sir john macneill in the line of my grandfather bakers family she sets him down and remembers that he was prominent in british politics and at one time held the position of ambassador to persia when she discovers that her grandparents were likewise connected with captain john lovewell whose gallant leadership and death in the indian troubles of 172225 caused that prolonged contest to be known historically as lovewells war she sets the captain down when it turns out that a cousin of her grandmother was john macneill the new hampshire general who fought at lundys lane and won distinction in 1814 at the battle of chippewa she catalogues the general and tells where chippewa was and then she skips all her platform people never mentions one of them it shows that she is just as human as any of us  yet after all there is something very touching in her pride in these worthy smallfry and something large and fine in her modesty in not caring to remember that their kinship to her can confer no distinction upon her whereas her mere mention of their names has conferred upon them a faceless earthly immortality     chapter ii  when she wrote this little biography her great lifework had already been achieved she was become renowned to multitudes of reverent disciples she was a sacred personage a familiar of god and his inspired channel of communication with the human race also to them these following things were facts and not doubted  she had written a bible in middle age and had published it she had recast it enlarged it and published it again she had not stopped there but had enlarged it further polished its phrasing improved its form and published it yet again it was at last become a compact grammatical dignified and workmanlike body of literature this was good training persistent training and in all arts it is training that brings the art to perfection we are now confronted with one of the most teasing and baffling riddles of mrs eddys historya riddle which may be formulated thus  how is it that a primitive literary gun which began as a hundredyard flintlock smoothbore muzzleloader and in the course of forty years has acquired one notable improvement after anotherpercussion cap fixed cartridge rifled barrel efficiency at half a mile how is it that such a gun sufficiently good on an elephant hunt christian science from the beginning and growing better and better all the time during forty years has always collapsed back to its original flintlock estate the moment the huntress trained it on any other creature than an elephant  something more than a generation ago mrs eddy went out with her flintlock on the rabbit range and this was a part of the result  after his decease and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful physicians we discovered that the principle of all healing and the law that governs it is god a divine principle and a spiritual not material law and regained healthpreface to science and health first revision 1883  nb not from the book itself from the preface  you will notice the awkwardness of that english if you should carry that paragraph up to the supreme court of the united states in order to find out for good and all whether the fatal casualty happened to the dead manas the paragraph almost assertsor to some person or persons not even hinted at in the paragraph the supreme court would be obliged to say that the evidence established nothing with certainty except that there had been a casualtyvictim not known  the context thinks it explains who the victim was but it does nothing of the kind it furnishes some guessingmaterial of a sort which enables you to infer that it was we that suffered the mentioned injury but if you should carry the language to a court you would not be able to prove that it necessarily meant that we are mrs eddy a funny little affectation she replaced it later with the more dignified third person  the quoted paragraph is from mrs eddys preface to the first revision of science and health 1883 sixtyfour pages further alongin the body of the book the elephantrange she went out with that same flintlock and got this following result its english is very nearly as straight and clean and competent as is the english of the latest revision of science and health after the gun has been improved from smoothbore musket up to globesighted long distance rifle  man controlled by his maker has no physical suffering his body is harmonious his days are multiplying instead of diminishing he is journeying towards life instead of death and bringing out the new man and crucifying the old affections cutting them off in every material direction until he learns the utter supremacy of spirit and yields obedience thereto  in the latest revision of science and health 1902 the perfected gun furnishes the following the english is clean compact dignified almost perfect but it is observable that it is not prominently better than it is in the above paragraph which was a product of the primitive flintlock  how unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing out life and hastening to death and at the same time we are communing with immortality if the departed are in rapport with mortality or matter they are not spiritual but must still be mortal sinful suffering and dying then wherefore look to themeven were communication possiblefor proofs of immortality and accept them as oracles edition of 1902 page 78  with the above paragraphs compare these that follow it is mrs eddy writingafter a good long twenty years of penpractice compare also with the alleged poems already quoted the prominent characteristic of the poems is affectation artificiality their makeup is a complacent and pretentious outpour of false figures and fine writing in the sophomoric style the same qualities and the same style will be found unchanged unbettered in these following paragraphsafter a lapse of more than fifty years and afteras aforesaidlong literary training the italics are mine  1 what plague spot or bacilli were sic gnawing sic at the heart of this metropolis and bringing it the heart on bended knee why

cleancut paragraph beginning with how unreasonable is the belief should in the very same lustrum discharge upon the world such a verbal chaos as the utterance concerning that plaguespot or bacilli which were gnawing at the insides of the metropolis and bringing its heart on bended knee thus exposing to the eye the rest of the skeleton breathing slowly through a barren breast  the immense contrast between the legitimate english of science and health and the bastard english of mrs eddys miscellaneous work and between the maturity of the one diction and the juvenility of the other suggestscompelsthe question are there two guns it would seem so is there a poor foolish old scattering flintlock for rabbit and a longrange centredriving uptodate mausermagazine for elephant it looks like it for it is observable that in science and health the elephantground the practice was good at the start and has remained so and that the practice in the miscellaneous outside smallgame field was very bad at the start and was never less bad at any later time  i wish to say that of mrs eddy i am not requiring perfect english but only good english no one can write perfect english and keep it up through a stretch of ten chapters it has never been done it was approached in the well of english undefiled it has been approached in mrs eddys annex to that book it has been approached in several english grammars i have even approached it myself but none of us has made port  now the english of science and health is good in passages to be found in mrs eddys autobiography on pages 53 57 101 and 113 and on page 6 of her squalid preface to science and health first revision she seems to me to claim the whole and sole authorship of the book that she wrote the autobiography and that preface and the poems and the plaguespotbacilli we are not permitted to doubt indeed we know she wrote them but the very certainty that she wrote these things compels a doubt that she wrote science and health she is guilty of little awkwardnesses of expression in the autobiography which a practiced pen would hardly allow to go uncorrected in even a hasty private letter and could not dream of passing by uncorrected in passages intended for print but she passes them placidly by as placidly as if she did not suspect that they were offenses against thirdclass english i think that that placidity was born of that very unawareness so to speak i will cite a few instances from the autobiography the italics are mine  i remember reading in my childhood certain manuscripts containing scriptural sonnets besides other verses and enigmas etc page 7  on page 27 many pale cripples went into the church leaning on crutches who came out carrying them on their shoulders  it is awkward because at the first glance it seems to say that the cripples went in leaning on crutches which went out carrying the cripples on their shoulders it would have cost her no trouble to put her who after her cripples i blame her a little i think her proofreader should have been shot we may let her capital c pass but it is another awkwardness for she is talking about a building not about a religious society  marriage and parentage chapterheading page 30 you imagine that she is going to begin a talk about her marriage and finish with some account of her father and mother and so you will be deceived marriage was right but parentage was not the best word for the rest of the record it refers to the birth of her own child after a certain period of time my babe was born marriage and motherhoodmarriage and maternitymarriage and productmarriage and dividendeither of these would have fitted the facts and made the matter clear  without my knowledge he was appointed a guardian page 32  she is speaking of her child she means that a guardian for her child was appointed but that isnt what she says  if spiritual conclusions are separated from their premises the nexus is lost and the argument with its rightful conclusions becomes correspondingly obscure page 34  we shall never know why she put the word correspondingly in there any fine large word would have answered just as well psychosuperintangiblyelectroincandescentlyoligarcheologically sanchrosynchrostereopticallyany of these would have answered any of these would have filled the void  his spiritual noumenon and phenomenon silenced portraiture page 34  yet she says she forgot everything she knew when she discovered christian science i realize that noumenon is a daisy and i will not deny that i shall use it whenever i am in a company which i think i can embarrass with it but at the same time i think it is out of place among friends in an autobiography there i think a person ought not to have anything up his sleeve it undermines confidence but my dissatisfaction with the quoted passage is not on account of noumenon it is on account of the misuse of the word silenced you cannot silence portraiture with a noumenon if portraiture should make a noise a way could be found to silence it but even then it could not be done with a noumenon not even with a brick some authorities think  it may be that the mortal lifebattle still wages etc page 35  that is clumsy battles do not wage battles are waged mrs eddy has one very curious and interesting peculiarity whenever she notices that she is chortling along without saying anything she pulls up with a sudden god is over us all or some other sounding irrelevancy and for the moment it seems to light up the whole district then before you can recover from the shock she goes flitting pleasantly and meaninglessly along again and you hurry hopefully after her thinking you are going to get something this time but as soon as she has led you far enough away from her turkey lot she takes to a tree whenever she discovers that she is getting pretty disconnected she couplesup with an ostentatious but which has nothing to do with anything that went before or is to come after then she hitches some empties to the trainunrelated verses from the bible usuallyand steams out of sight and leaves you wondering how she did that clever thing for striking instances see bottom paragraph on page 34 and the paragraph on page 35 of her autobiography she has a purposea deep and dark and artful purposein what she is saying in the first paragraph and you guess what it is but that is due to your own talent not hers she has made it as obscure as language could do it the other paragraph has no meaning and no discoverable intention it is merely one of her godoveralls i cannot spare room for it in this place  i beheld with ineffable awe our great masters marvelous skill in demanding neither obedience to hygienic laws nor etc page 41  the word is loosely chosenskill she probably meant judgment intuition penetration or wisdom  naturally my first jottings were but efforts to express in feeble diction truths ultimate page 42  one understands what she means but she should have been able to say what she meantat any time before she discovered christian science and forgot everything she knewand after it too if she had put feeble in front of efforts and then left out in and diction she would have scored   its written expression increases in perfection under the guidance of the great master page 43  it is an error not even in those advantageous circumstances can increase be added to perfection  evil is not mastered by evil it can only be overcome with good this brings out the nothingness of evil and the eternal somethingness vindicates the divine principle and improves the race of adam page 76  this is too extraneous for me that is the trouble with mrs eddy when she sets out to explain an overlarge exhibit the minute you think the light is bursting upon you the candle goes out and your mind begins to wander  no one else can drain the cup which i have drunk to the dregs as the discoverer and teacher of christian science page 47  that is saying we cannot empty an empty cup we knew it before and we know she meant to tell us that that particular cup is going to remain empty that is we think that that was the idea but we cannot be sure she has a perfectly astonishing talent for putting words together in such a way as to make successful inquiry into their intention impossible  she generally makes us uneasy when she begins to tune up on her finewriting timbrel it carries me back to her plaguespot and poetry days and i just dread those  into mortal minds material obliquity i gazed and stood abashed blanched was the cheek of pride my heart bent low before the omnipotence of spirit and a tint of humility soft as the heart of a moonbeam mantled the earth bethlehem and bethany gethsemane and calvary spoke to my chastened sense as by the tearful lips of a babe page 48  the heart of a moonbeam is a pretty enough friendshipsalbum expressionlet it pass though i do think the figure a little strained but humility has no tint humility has no complexion and if it had it could not mantle the earth a moonbeam mighti do not knowbut she did not say it was the moonbeam but let it go i cannot decide it she mixes me up so a babe hasnt tearful lips its its eyes you find none of mrs eddys kind of english in science and healthnot a line of it     chapter iii  setting aside titlepage index etc the little autobiography begins on page 7 and ends on page 130 my quotations are from the first forty pages they seem to me to prove the presence of the prentice hand the style of the forty pages is loose and feeble and prenticelike the movement of the narrative is not orderly and sequential but rambles around and skips forward and back and here and there and yonder prenticefashion many a journeyman has broken up his narrative and skipped about and rambled around but he did it for a purpose for an advantage there was art in it and points to be scored by it the observant reader perceived the game and enjoyed it and respected it if it was well played but mrs eddys performance was without intention and destitute of art she could score no points by it on those terms and almost any reader can see that her work was the uncalculated puttering of a novice  in the above paragraph i have described the first third of the booklet that third being completed mrs eddy leaves the rabbitrange crosses the frontier and steps out upon her farspreading biggame territorychristian science and there is an instant change the style smartly improves and the clumsy little technical offenses disappear in these twothirds of the booklet i find only one such offence and it has the look of being a printers error  i leave the riddle with the reader perhaps he can explain how it is that a persontrained or untrainedwho on the one day can write nothing better than plaguespotbacilli and feeble and stumbling and wandering personal history littered with false figures and obscurities and technical blunders can on the next day sit down and write fluently smoothly compactly capably and confidently on a great big thundering subject and do it as easily and comfortably as a whale paddles around the globe  as for me i have scribbled so much in fifty years that i have become saturated with convictions of one sort and another concerning a scribblers limitations and these are so strong that when i am familiar with a literary persons work i feel perfectly sure that i know enough about his limitations to know what he can not do if mr howells should pretend to me that he wrote the plaguespot bacilli rhapsody i should receive the statement courteously but i should know it for awell for a perversion if the late josh billings should rise up and tell me that he wrote herbert spencers philosophies i should answer and say that the spelling casts a doubt upon his claim if the late jonathan edwards should rise up and tell me he wrote mr dooleys books i should answer and say that the marked difference between his style and dooleys is argument against the soundness of his statement you see how much i think of circumstantial evidence in literary mattersin my beliefit is often better than any persons word better than any shady characters oath it is difficult for me to believe that the same hand that wrote the plaguespotbacilli and the first third of the little eddy biography wrote also science and health indeed it is more than difficult it is impossible  largely speaking i have read acres of what purported to be mrs eddys writings in the past two months i cannot know but i am convinced that the circumstantial evidence shows that her actual share in the work of composing and phrasing these things was so slight as to be inconsequential where she puts her literary foot down her trail across her paid polishers page is as plain as the elephants in a sundayschool procession her verbal output when left undoctored by her clerks is quite unmistakable it always exhibits the strongly distinctive features observable in the virgin passages from her pen already quoted by me  desert vacancy as regards thought selfcomplacency puerility sentimentality affectations of scholarly learning lust after eloquent and flowery expression repetition of pet poetic picturesquenesses confused and wandering statement metaphor gone insane meaningless words used because they are pretty or showy or unusual sorrowful attempts at the epigrammatic destitution of originality  the fat volume called miscellaneous writings of mrs eddy contains several hundred pages of the five hundred and fiftyfour pages of prose in it i find ten lines on page 319 to be mrs eddys also about a page of the preface or prospectus also about fifteen pages scattered along through the book if she wrote any of the rest of the prose it was rewritten after her by another hand here i will insert twothirds of her page of the prospectus it is evident that whenever under the inspiration of the deity she turns out a book she is always allowed to do some of the preface i wonder why that is it always mars the work i think it is done in humorous malice i think the clerks like to see her give herself away they know she will her stock of usable materials being limited and her procedure in employing them always the same substantially they know that when the initiated come upon her first erudite allusion or upon any one of her other stageproperties they can shut their eyes and tell what will follow she usually throws off an easy remark all sodden with greek or hebrew or latin learning she usually has a person watching for a starshe can seldom get away from that poetic ideasometimes it is a chaldee sometimes a walking delegate sometimes an entire stranger but be he what he may he is generally there when the train is ready to move and has his pass in his hatband she generally has a being with a dome on him or some other cover that is unusual and out of the fashion she likes to fire off a scriptureverse where it will make the handsomest noise and come nearest to breaking the connection she often throws out a forefelt or a foresplendor or a foreslander where it will have a fine nautical foretogallant sound and make the sentence sing after which she is nearly sure to throw discretion away and take to her deadly passion intoxicated metaphor at such a time the mrs eddy that does not hesitate is lost  the ancient greek looked longingly for the olympiad the chaldee watched the appearing of a star to him no higher destiny dawned on the dome of being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heavens the meek nazarene the scoffed of all scoffers said ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the timesfor he forefelt and foresaw the ordeal of a perfect christianity hated by sinners  to kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude the new idea that comes welling up from infinite truth needs to be understood the seer of this age should be a sage  humility is the steppingstone to a higher recognition of deity the mounting sense gathers fresh forms and strange fire from the ashes of dissolving self and drops the world meekness heightens immortal attributes only by removing the dust that dims them goodness reveals another scene and another self seemingly rolled up in shades but brought to light by the evolutions of advancing thought whereby we discern the power of truth and love to heal the sick  pride is ignorance those assume most who have the least wisdom or experience and they steal from their neighbor because they have so little of their ownmiscellaneous writings page 1 and six lines at top of page 2  it is not believable that the hand that wrote those clumsy and affected sentences wrote the smooth english of science and health     chapter iv  it is often said in print that mrs eddy claims that god was the author of science and health mr peabody states in his pamphlet that she says not she but god was the author i cannot find that in her autobiography she makes this transference of the authorship but i think that in it she definitely claims that she did her work under his inspirationdefinitely for her for as a rule she is not a very definite person even when she seems to be trying her best to be clear and positive speaking of the early days when her science was beginning to unfold itself and gather form in her mind she says autobiography page 43  the divine hand led me into a new world of light and life a fresh universeold to god but new to his little one  she being his little one as i understand it  the divine hand led her it seems to mean god inspired me but when a person uses metaphors instead of statisticsand that is mrs eddys common fashionone cannot always feel sure about the intention  page 56 even the scripture gave no direct interpretation of the scientific basis for demonstrating the spiritual principle of healing until our heavenly father saw fit through the key to the scriptures in science and health to unlock this mystery of godliness  another baffling metaphor if she had used plain forecastle english and said god wrote the key and i put it in my book or if she had said god furnished me the solution of the mystery and i put it on paper or if she had said god did it all then we should understand but her phrase is open to any and all of those translations and is a key which unlocks nothingfor us however it seems to at least mean god inspired me if nothing more  there was personal and intimate communion at any rate we get that much out of the riddles the connection extended to business after the establishment of the teaching and healing industry  page 71 when god impelled me to set a price on my instruction etc further down god has since shown me in multitudinous ways the wisdom of this decision  she was not able to think of a financial equivalentmeaning a pecuniary equivalentfor her instruction in christian science mindhealing in this emergency she was led to charge three hundred dollars for a term of twelve halfdays she does not say who led her she only says that the amount greatly troubled her i think it means that the price was suggested from above led being a theological term identical with our commercial phrase personally conducted she shrank from asking it but was finally led by a strange providence to accept this fee providence is another theological term two leds and a providence taken together make a pretty strong argument for inspiration i think that these statistics make it clear that the price was arranged above this view is constructively supported by the fact already quoted that god afterwards approved in multitudinous ways her wisdom in accepting the mentioned fee multitudinous waysmultitudinous encoringsuggests enthusiasm business enthusiasm and it suggests nearness gods nearness to his little one nearness and a watchful personal interest a warm palpitating standardoil interest so to speak all this indicates inspiration we may assume then two inspirations one for the book the other for the business  the evidence for inspiration is further augmented by the testimony of rev george tomkins dd already quoted that mrs eddy and her book were foretold in revelation and that mrs eddy is gods brightest thought to this age giving us the spiritual interpretation of the bible in the little book of the angel  i am aware that it is not mr tomkins that is speaking but mrs eddy the commissioned lecturers of the christian science church have to be members of the board of lectureship bylaws sec 2 p 70 the board of lectureship is selected by the board of directors of the church bylaws sec 3 p 70 the board of directors of the church is the property of mrs eddy bylaws p 22 mr tomkins did not make that statement without authorization from headquarters he necessarily got it from the board of directors the board of directors from mrs eddy mrs eddy from the deity mr tomkins would have been turned down by that procession if his remarks had been unsatisfactory to it  it may be that there is evidence somewhereas has been claimedthat mrs eddy has charged upon the deity the verbal authorship of science and health but if she ever made the charge she has withdrawn it as it seems to me and in the most formal and unqualified of all ways see autobiography page 57  when the demand for this book increased the copyright was infringed i entered a suit at law and my copyright was protected  thus it is plain that she did not plead that the deity was the verbal author for if she had done that she would have lost her caseand with rude promptness it was in the old days before the berne convention and before the passage of our amended law of 1891 and the court would have quoted the following stern clause from the existing statute and frowned her out of the place  no foreigner can acquire copyright in the united states  to sum up the evidence before me indicates three things  1 that mrs eddy claims the verbal author ship for herself 2 that she denies it to the deity 3 thatin her beliefshe wrote the book under the inspiration of the deity but furnished the language herself  in one place in the autobiography she claims both the language and the ideas but when this witness is testifying one must draw the line somewhere or she will prove both sides of her casenine sides if desired  it is too true much too true many many times too true she is a most trying witnessthe most trying witness that ever kissed the book i am sure there is no keeping up with her erratic testimony as soon as you have got her share of the authorship nailed where you half hope and half believe it will stay and cannot be joggled loose any more she joggles it loose againor seems to you cannot be sure for her habit of dealing in meaningless metaphors instead of in plain straightforward statistics makes it nearly always impossible to tell just what it is she is trying to say she was definite when she claimed both the language and the ideas of the book that seemed to settle the matter it seemed to distribute the percentages of credit with precision between the collaborators ninetytwo per cent to mrs eddy who did all the work and eight per cent to the deity who furnished the inspiration not enough of it to damage the copyright in a country closed against foreigners and yet plenty to advertise the book and market it at famine rates then mrs eddy does not keep still but fetches around and comes forward and testifies again it is most injudicious for she resorts to metaphor this time and it makes trouble for she seems to reverse the percentages and claim only the eight per cent for her self i quote from mr peabodys book eddyism or christian science boston 15 court square price twentyfive cents  speaking of this book mrs eddy in january last 1901 said i should blush to write of science and health with key to the scriptures as i have were it of human origin and i apart from god its author but as i was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of heaven in divine metaphysics i cannot be supermodest of the christian science textbook  mr peabodys comment  nothing could be plainer than that here is a distinct avowal that the book entitled science and health was the work of almighty god  it does seem to amount to that she was only a scribe confound the word it is just a confusion it has no determinable meaning there it leaves us in the air a scribe is merely a person who writes he may be a copyist he may be an amanuensis he may be a writer of originals and furnish both the language and the ideas as usual with mrs eddy the connection affords no helpechoing throws no light upon scribe a rock can reflect an echo a wall can do it a mountain can do it many things can do it but a scribe cant a scribe that could reflect an echo could get over thirty dollars a week in a sideshow many impresarios would rather have him than a cow with four tails if we allow that this present scribe was setting down the harmonies of heavenand certainly that seems to have been the case then there was only one way to do it that i can think of listen to the music and put down the notes one after another as they fell in that case mrs eddy did not invent the tune she only entered it on paper therefore dropping the metaphorshe was merely an amanuensis and furnished neither the language of science and health nor the ideas it reduces her to eight per cent and the dividends on that and the rest  is that it we shall never know for mrs eddy is liable to testify again at any time but until she does it i think we must conclude that the deity was author of the whole book and mrs eddy merely his telephone and stenographer granting this her claim as the voice of god standsfor the presentjustified and established     postscript  i overlooked something it appears that there was more of that utterance than mr peabody has quoted in the above paragraph it will be found in mrs eddys organ the christian science journal january 1901 and reads as follows  it was not myself which dictated science and health with key to the scriptures  that is certainly clear enough the words which i have removed from that important sentence explain who it was that did the dictating it was done by  the divine power of truth and love infinitely above me  certainly that is definite at last through her personal testimony we have a sure grip upon the following vital facts and they settle the authorship of science and health beyond peradventure  1 mrs eddy furnished the ideas and the language 2 god furnished the ideas and the language  it is a great comfort to have the matter authoritatively settled     chapter v  it is hard to locate her she shifts about so much she is a shining drop of quicksilver which you put your finger on and it isnt there there is a paragraph in the autobiography page 96 which places in seemingly darkly significant procession three personages  1 the virgin mary 2 jesus of nazareth 3 mrs eddy  this is the paragraph referred to  no person can take the individual place of the virgin mary no person can compass or fulfil the individual mission of jesus of nazareth no person can take the place of the author of science and health the discoverer and founder of christian science each individual must fill his own niche in time and eternity  i have read it many times but i still cannot be sure that i rightly understand it if the saviours name had been placed first and the virgin marys second and mrs eddys third i should draw the inference that a descending scale from first importance to second importance and then to small importance was indicated but to place the virgin first the saviour second and mrs eddy third seems to turn the scale the other way and make it an ascending scale of importances with mrs eddy ranking the other two and holding first place  i think that that was perhaps the intention but none but a seasoned christian scientist can examine a literary animal of mrs eddys creation and tell which end of it the tail is on she is easily the most baffling and bewildering writer in the literary trade  eddy is a commonplace name and would have an unimpressive aspect in the list of the reformed holy family she has thought of that in the book of bylaws written by herimpelled by a power not ones ownthere is a paragraph which explains how and when her disciples came to confer a title upon her and this explanation is followed by a warning as to what will happen to any female scientist who shall desecrate it  the title of mother therefore if a student of christian science shall apply this title either to herself or to others except as the term for kinship according to the flesh it shall be regarded by the church as an indication of disrespect for their pastor emeritus and unfitness to be a member of the motherchurch  she is the pastor emeritus  while the quoted paragraph about the procession seems to indicate that mrs eddy is expecting to occupy the first place in it that expectation is not definitely avowed in an earlier utterance of hers she is clearerclearer and does not claim the first place all to herself but only the half of it i quote from mr peabodys book again  in the christian science journal for april 1889 when it was her property and published by her it was claimed for her and with her sanction that she was equal with jesus and elaborate effort was made to establish the claim  mrs eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf that she herself was the chosen successor to and equal of jesus  in her miscellaneous writings using her once favorite we for i she says that while we entertain decided views and shall express them as duty demands we shall claim no especial gift from our divine origin etc  our divine origin it suggests equal again it is inferable then that in the near byandby the new church will officially rank the holy family in the following order  1 jesus of nazareth1 our mother 2 the virgin mary     summary  i am not playing with christian science and its founder i am examining them and i am doing it because of the interest i feel in the inquiry my results may seem inadequate to the reader but they have for me clarified a muddle and brought a sort of order out of a chaos and so i value them  my readings of mrs eddys uninspired miscellaneous literary efforts have convinced me of several things  1 that she did not write science and health 2 that the deity did or did not write it 3 that she thinks she wrote it 4 that she believes she wrote it under the deitys inspiration 5 that she believes she is a member of the holy family 6 that she believes she is the equal of the head of it  finally i think she is now entitled to the capital son her own evidence     chapter vi  thus far we have a part of mrs eddys portrait not made of fictions surmises reports rumors innuendoes dropped by her enemies no she has furnished all of the materials herself and laid them on the canvas under my general superintendence and direction as far as she has gone with it it is the presentation of a complacent commonplace illiterate new england woman who forgot everything she knew when she discovered her discovery then wrote a bible in good english under the inspiration of god and climbed up it to the supremest summit of earthly grandeur attainable by manwhere she sits serene today beloved and worshiped by a multitude of human beings of as good average intelligence as is possessed by those that march under the banner of any competing cult this is not intended to flatter the competing cults it is merely a statement of cold fact  that a commonplace person should go climbing aloft and become a god or a halfgod or a quartergod and be worshiped by men and women of average intelligence is nothing it has happened a million times it will happen a hundred million more it has been millions of years since the first of these supernaturals appeared and by the time the last one in that inconceivably remote future shall have performed his solemn little highjinks on the stage and closed the business there will be enough of them accumulated in the museum on the other side to start a heaven of their ownand jam it  each in his turn those little supernaturals of our bygone ages and aeons joined the monster procession of his predecessors and marched horizonward disappeared and was forgotten they changed nothing they built nothing they left nothing behind them to remember them by nothing to hold their disciples together nothing to solidify their work and enable it to defy the assaults of time and the weather they passed and left a vacancy they made one fatal mistake they all made it each in his turn they failed to organize their forces they failed to centralize their strength they failed to provide a fresh bible and a sure and perpetual cash income for business and often they failed to provide a new and accepted divine personage to worship  mrs eddy is not of that small fry the materials that go to the making of the rest of her portrait will prove it she will furnish them herself  she published her book she copyrighted it she copyrights everything if she should say goodmorning how do you do she would copyright it for she is a careful person and knows the value of small things  she began to teach her science she began to heal she began to gather converts to her new religionfervent sincere devoted grateful people a year or two later she organized her first christian science association with six of her disciples on the roster  she continued to teach and heal she was charging nothing she says although she was very poor she taught and healed gratis four years altogether she says  then in 187981 she was become strong enough and well enough established to venture a couple of impressively important moves the first of these moves was to aggrandize the association to a church brave it is the right name for it i think the former name suggests nothing invited no remark no criticism no inquiry no hostility the new name invited them all she must have made this intrepid venture on her own motion she could have had no important advisers at that early day if we accept it as her own idea and her own actand i think we mustwe have one key to her character and it will explain subsequent acts of hers that would merely stun us and stupefy us without it shall we call it courage or shall we call it recklessness courage observes reflects calculates surveys the whole situation counts the cost estimates the odds makes up its mind then goes at the enterprise resolute to win or perish recklessness does not reflect it plunges fearlessly in with a hurrah and takes the risks whatever they may be regardless of expense recklessness often fails mrs eddy has never failedfrom the point of view of her followers the point of view of other people is naturally not a matter of weighty importance to her  the new church was not born loosejointed and featureless but had a defined plan a definite character definite aims and a name which was a challenge and defied all comers it was a mindhealing church it was without a creed its name the church of christ scientist  mrs eddy could not copyright her church but she chartered it which was the same thing and relieved the pain it had twentysix charter members mrs eddy was at once installed as its pastor  the other venture above referred to was mrs eddys massachusetts metaphysical college in which was taught the pathology of spiritual power she could not copyright it but she got it chartered for faculty it had herself her husband of the period dr eddy and her adopted son dr fostereddy the college term was barely three weeks she says again she was bold brave rash recklesschoose for yourselffor she not only began to charge the student but charged him a hundred dollars a week for the enlightenments and got it some may ask easily pupils flocked from far and near they came by the hundred presently the term was cut down nearly half but the price remained as before to be exact the termcut was to seven lessonsprice three hundred dollars the college yielded a large income this is believable in seven years mrs eddy taught as she avers over four thousand students in it preface to 1902 edition of science and health three hundred times four thousand isbut perhaps you can cipher it yourself i could do it ordinarily but i fell down yesterday and hurt my leg cipher it you will see that it is a grand sum for a woman to earn in seven years yet that was not all she got out of her college in the seven  at the time that she was charging the primary student three hundred dollars for twelve lessons she was not content with this tidy assessment but had other ways of plundering him by advertisement she offered him privileges whereby he could add eighteen lessons to his store for five hundred dollars more that is to say he could get a total of thirty lessons in her college for eight hundred dollars  four thousand times eight hundred isbut it is a difficult sum for a cripple who has not been demonstrated over to cipher let it go she taught over four thousand students in seven years over is not definite but it probably represents a nonpaying surplus of learners over and above the paying four thousand charity students doubtless i think that as interesting an advertisement as has been printed since the romantic old days of the other buccaneers is this one from the christian science journal for september 1886   massachusetts metaphysical college  rev mary baker g eddy president  571 columbus avenue boston  the collegiate course in christian science metaphysical healing includes twelve lessons tuition three hundred dollars  course in metaphysical obstetrics includes six daily lectures and is open only to students from this college tuition one hundred dollars  class in theology open like the above to graduates receives six additional lectures on the scriptures and summary of the principle and practice of christian science two hundred dollars  normal class is open to those who have taken the first course at this college six daily lectures complete the normal course tuition two hundred dollars  no invalids and only persons of good moral character are accepted as students all students are subject to examination and rejection and they are liable to leave the class if found unfit to remain in it  a limited number of clergymen received free of charge  largest discount to indigent students one hundred dollars on the first course  no deduction on the others  husband and wife entered together three hundred dollars  tuition for all strictly in advance  there it isthe horseleechs daughter alive again after a threecentury vacation fifty or sixty hours lecturing for eight hundred dollars  i was in error as to one matter there are no charity students gratistaught clergymen must not be placed under that head they are merely an advertisement pauper students can get into the infant class on a twothird rate cash in advance but not even an archangel can get into the rest of the game at anything short of par cash down for it is in the spirit of christs charity as one who is joyful to hear healing to the sick that mrs eddy is working the game she sends the healing to them outside she cannot bear it to them inside the college for the reason that she does not allow a sick candidate to get in it is true that this smells of inconsistency but that is nothing mrs eddy would not be mrs eddy if she should ever chance to be consistent about anything two days running  except in the matter of the dollar the dollar and appetite for power and notoriety english must also be added she is always consistent she is always mrs eddy in her english it is always and consistently confused and crippled and poor she wrote the advertisement her literary trademarks are there when she says all students are subject to examination she does not mean students she means candidates for that lofty place when she says students are liable to leave the class if found unfit to remain in it she does not mean that if they find themselves unfit or be found unfit by others they will be likely to ask permission to leave the class she means that if she finds them unfit she will be liable to fire them out when she nobly offers tuition for all strictly in advance she does not mean instruction for all in advancepayment for it later no that is only what she says it is not what she means if she had written science and health the oldest man in the world would not be able to tell with certainty what any passage in it was intended to mean  her church was on its legs  she was its pastor it was prospering  she was appointed one of a committee to draught bylaws for its government it may be observed without overplus of irreverence that this was larks for her she did all of the draughting herself from the very beginning she was always in the front seat when there was business to be done in the front seat with both eyes open and looking sharply out for number one in the front seat working mortal mind with fine effectiveness and giving immortal mind a rest for sunday when her church was reorganized byandby the bylaws were retained she saw to that in these laws for the government of her church her empire her despotism mrs eddys character is embalmed for good and all i think a particularized examination of these churchlaws will be found interesting and not the less so if we keep in mind that they were impelled by a power not ones own as she saysanglicethe inspiration of god  it is a church without a creed still it has one mrs eddy draughted itand copyrighted it in her own name you cannot become a member of the motherchurch nor of any christian science church without signing it it forms the first chapter of the bylaws and is called tenets tenets of the mother church the first church of christ scientist it has no hell in itit throws it overboard     the pastor emeritus  about the time of the reorganization mrs eddy retired from her position of pastor of her church abolished the office of pastor in all branch churches and appointed her book science and health to be pastoruniversal mrs eddy did not disconnect herself from the office entirely when she retired but appointed herself pastor emeritus it is a misleading title and belongs to the family of that phrase without a creed it advertises her as being a merely honorary official with nothing to do and no authority the czar of russia is emperor emeritus on the same terms mrs eddy was autocrat of the church before with limitless authority and she kept her grip on that limitless authority when she took that fictitious title  it is curious and interesting to note with what an unerring instinct the pastor emeritus has thought out and forecast all possible encroachments upon her planned autocracy and barred the way against them in the bylaws which she framed and copyrightedunder the guidance of the supreme being     the board of directors  for instance when article i speaks of a president and board of directors you think you have discovered a formidable check upon the powers and ambitions of the honorary pastor the ornamental pastor the functionless pastor the pastor emeritus but it is a mistake these great officials are of the phrasefamily of the churchwithoutacreed and the pastorwithnothingtodo that is to say of the family of largenameswhichmeannothing the board is of so little consequence that the bylaws do not state how it is chosen nor who does it but they do state most definitely that the board cannot fill a vacancy in its number except the candidate is approved by the pastor emeritus  the candidate the board cannot even proceed to an election until the pastor emeritus has examined the list and squelched such candidates as are not satisfactory to her  whether the original first board began as the personal property of mrs eddy or not it is foreseeable that in time under this bylaw she would own it such a first board might chafe under such a rule as that and try to legislate it out of existence some day but mrs eddy was awake she foresaw that danger and added this ingenious and effective clause  this bylaw can neither be amended nor annulled except by consent of mrs eddy the pastor emeritus     the president  the board of directors or serfs or ciphers elects the president  on these clearly worded terms subject to the approval of the pastor emeritus  therefore she elects him  a long term can invest a high official with influence and power and make him dangerous mrs eddy reflected upon that so she limits the presidents term to a year she has a capable commercial head an organizing head a head for government     treasurer and clerk  there are a treasurer and a clerk they are elected by the board of directors that is to say by mrs eddy  their terms of office expire on the first tuesday in june of each year or upon the election of their successors they must be watchfully obedient and satisfactory to her or she will elect and install their successors with a suddenness that can be unpleasant to them it goes without saying that the treasurer manages the treasury to suit mrs eddy and is in fact merely temporary deputy treasurer  apparently the clerk has but two duties to perform to read messages from mrs eddy to first members assembled in solemn council and provide lists of candidates for church membership the select body entitled first members are the aristocracy of the motherchurch the charter members the aborigines a sort of stylish but unsalaried little college of cardinals good for show but not indispensable nobody is indispensable in mrs eddys empire she sees to that  when the pastor emeritus sends a letter or message to that little sanhedrin it is the clerks imperative duty to read it at the place and time specified otherwise the world might come to an end these are fine large frills and remind us of the ways of emperors and such such do not use the pennypost they send a gilded and painted special messenger and he strides into the parliament and business comes to a sudden and solemn and awful stop and in the impressive hush that follows the chief clerk reads the document it is his imperative duty if he should neglect it his official life would end it is the same with this motherchurch clerk if he fail to perform this important function of his office certain majestic and unshirkable solemnities must follow a special meeting shall be called a member of the church shall make formal complaint then the clerk shall be removed from office complaint is sufficient no trial is necessary  there is something very sweet and juvenile and innocent and pretty about these little tinsel vanities these grave apings of monarchical fuss and feathers and ceremony here on our ostentatiously democratic soil she is the same lady that we found in the autobiography who was so naively vain of all that little ancestral military riffraff that she had dug up and annexed a persons nature never changes what it is in childhood it remains under pressure or a change of interest it can partially or wholly disappear from sight and for considerable stretches of time but nothing can ever permanently modify it nothing can ever remove it     board of trustees  there isnt anynow but with power and money piling up higher and higher every day and the churchs dominion spreading daily wider and farther a time could come when the envious and ambitious could start the idea that it would be wise and well to put a watch upon these assetsa watch equipped with properly large authority by custom a board of trustees mrs eddy has foreseen that probabilityfor she is a woman with a long long look ahead the longest look ahead that ever a woman hadand she has provided for that emergency in art i sec 5 she has decreed that no board of trustees shall ever exist in the motherchurch except it be constituted by the pastor emeritus  the magnificence of it the daring of it thus far she is  the massachusetts metaphysical college pastor emeritus president board of directors treasurer clerk and future board of trustees  and is still moving onward ever onward when i contemplate her from a commercial point of view there are no words that can convey my admiration of her     readers  these are a feature of first importance in the churchmachinery of christian science for they occupy the pulpit they hold the place that the preacher holds in the other christian churches they hold that place but they do not preach two of them are on duty at a timea man and a woman one reads a passage from the bible the other reads the explanation of it from science and healthand so they go on alternating this constitutes the servicethis with choirmusic they utter no word of their own art iv sec 6 closes their mouths with this uncompromising gag  they shall make no remarks explanatory of the lessonsermon at any time during the service  it seems a simple little thing one is not startled by it at a first reading of it nor at the second nor the third one may have to read it a dozen times before the whole magnitude of it rises before the mind it far and away oversizes and outclasses the best businessidea yet invented for the safeguarding and perpetuating of a religion if it had been thought of and put in force eighteen hundred and seventy years ago there would be but one christian sect in the world now instead of ten dozens of them  there are many varieties of men in the world consequently there are many varieties of minds in its pulpits this insures many differing interpretations of important scripture texts and this in turn insures the splitting up of a religion into many sects it is what has happened it was sure to happen  mrs eddy has noted this disastrous result of preaching and has put up the bars she will have no preaching in her church she has explained all essential scriptures and set the explanations down in her book in her belief her underlings cannot improve upon those explanations and in that stern sentence they shall make no explanatory remarks she has barred them for all time from trying she will be obeyed there is no question about that  in arranging her government she has borrowed ideas from various sourcesnot poor ones but the best in the governmental marketbut this one is new this one came out of no ordinary businesshead this one must have come out of her own there has been no other commercial skull in a thousand centuries that was equal to it she has borrowed freely and wisely but i am sure that this idea is many times larger than all her borrowings bulked together one must respect the businessbrain that produced itthe splendid pluck and impudence that ventured to promulgate it anyway     election of readers  readers are not taken at haphazard any more than preachers are taken at haphazard for the pulpits of other sects no readers are elected by the board of directors but  section 3 the board shall inform the pas for emeritus of the names of candidates for readers before they are elected and if she objects to the nomination said candidates shall not be chosen  is that an electionby the board thus far i have not been able to find out what that board of spectres is for it certainly has no real function no duty which the hired girl could not perform no office beyond the mere recording of the autocrats decrees  there are no dangerously long officeterms in mrs eddys government the readers are elected for but one year this insures their subserviency to their proprietor  readers are not allowed to copy out passages and read them from the manuscript in the pulpit they must read from mrs eddys book itself she is right slight changes could be slyly made repeated and in time get acceptance with congregations branch sects could grow out of these practices mrs eddy knows the human race and how far to trust it her limit is not over a quarter of an inch it is all that a wise person will risk  mrs eddys inborn disposition to copyright everything charter everything secure the rightful and proper credit to herself for everything she does and everything she thinks she does and everything she thinks and everything she thinks she thinks or has thought or intends to think is illustrated in sec 5 of art iv defining the duties of official readersin church  naming book and author the reader of science and health with key to the scriptures before commencing to read from this book shall distinctly announce its full title and give the authors name  otherwise the congregation might get the habit of forgetting who ostensibly wrote the book     the aristocracy  this consists of first members and their apostolic succession it is a close corporation and its membership limit is one hundred forty will answer but if the number fall below that there must be an election to fill the grand quorum  this sanhedrin cant do anything of the slightest importance but it can talk it can discuss that is it can discuss important questions relative to church members evidently persons who are already church members this affords it amusement and does no harm  it can fix the salaries of the readers  twice a year it votes on admitting candidates that is for church membership but its work is cut out for it beforehand by art ix  every recommendation for membership in the church shall be countersigned by a loyal student of mrs eddys by a director of this church or by a first member  all these three classes of beings are the personal property of mrs eddy she has absolute control of the elections  also it must transact any church business that may properly come before it  properly is a thoughtful word no important business can come before it the by laws have attended to that no important business goes before any one for the final word except mrs eddy she has looked to that  the sanhedrin votes on candidates for admission to its own body but is its vote worth any more than mine would be no it isnt sec 4 of art velection of first membersmakes this quite plain  before being elected the candidates for first members shall be approved by the pastor emeritus over her own signature  thus the sanhedrin is the personal property of mrs eddy she owns it it has no functions no authority no real existence it is another board of shadows mrs eddy is the sanhedrin herself  but it is time to foot up again and see where we are at thus far mrs eddy is  the massachusetts metaphysical college pastor emeritus president board of directors treasurer clerk future board of trustees proprietor of the priesthood dictator of the services proprietor of the sanhedrin she has come far and is still on her way     church membership  in this article there is another exhibition of a couple of the large features of mrs eddys remarkable makeup her businesstalent and her knowledge of human nature  she does not beseech and implore people to join her church she knows the human race better than that she gravely goes through the motions of reluctantly granting admission to the applicant as a favor to him the idea is worth untold shekels she does not stand at the gate of the fold with welcoming arms spread and receive the lost sheep with glad emotion and set up the fatted calf and invite the neighbor and have a time no she looks upon him coldly she snubs him she says  who are you who is your sponsor who asked you to come here go away and dont come again until you are invited  it is calculated to strikingly impress a person accustomed to moody and sankey and sam jones revivals accustomed to brainturning appeals to the unknown and unendorsed sinner to come forward and enter into the joy etcjust as he is accustomed to seeing him do it accustomed to seeing him pass up the aisle through sobbing seas of welcome and love and congratulation and arrive at the mourners bench and be received like a longlost government bond  no there is nothing of that kind in mrs eddys system she knows that if you wish to confer upon a human being something which he is not sure he wants the best way is to make it apparently difficult for him to get itthen he is no son of adam if that apple does not assume an interest in his eyes which it lacked before in time this interest can grow into desire mrs eddy knows that when you cannot get a man to tryfree of costa new and effective remedy for a disease he is afflicted with you can generally sell it to him if you will put a price upon it which he cannot afford when in the beginning she taught christian science gratis for good reasons pupils were few and reluctant and required persuasion it was when she raised the limit to three hundred dollars for a dollars worth that she could not find standing room for the invasion of pupils that followed  with fine astuteness she goes through the motions of making it difficult to get membership in her church there is a twofold value in this system it gives membership a high value in the eyes of the applicant and at the same time the requirements exacted enable mrs eddy to keep him out if she has doubts about his value to her a word further as to applications for membership  applications of students of the metaphysical college must be signed by the board of directors  that is safe mrs eddy is proprietor of that board  children of twelve may be admitted if invited by one of mrs eddys loyal students or by a first member or by a director  these sponsors are the property of mrs eddy therefore her church is safeguarded from the intrusion of undesirable children  other students applicants who have not studied with mrs eddy can get in only by invitation and recommendation from students of mrs eddy or from members of the motherchurch  other paragraphs explain how two or three other varieties of applicants are to be challenged and obstructed and tell us who is authorized to invite them recommend them endorse them and all that  the safeguards are definite and would seem to be sufficiently strenuousto mr sam jones at any rate not for mrs eddy she adds this clincher  the candidates be elected by a majority vote of the first members present  that is the aristocracy the aborigines the sanhedrin it is mrs eddys property she herself is the sanhedrin no one can get into the church if she wishes to keep him out  this veto power could some time or other have a large value for her therefore she was wise to reserve it  it is likely that it is not frequently used it is also probable that the difficulties attendant upon getting admission to membership have been instituted more to invite than to deter more to enhance the value of membership and make people long for it than to make it really difficult to get i think so because the mother church has many thousands of members more than its building can accommodate     and some english required  mrs eddy is very particular as regards one detail curiously so for her all things considered the church readers must be good english scholars they must be thorough english scholars  she is thus sensitive about the english of her subordinates for cause possibly in her chapter defining the duties of the clerk there is an indication that she harbors resentful memories of an occasion when the hazy quality of her own english made unforeseen and mortifying trouble  understanding communications sec 2 if the clerk of this church shall receive a communication from the pastor emeritus which he does not fully understand he shall inform her of this fact before presenting it to the church and obtain a clear understanding of the matterthen act in accordance therewith  she should have waited to calm down then but instead she added this which lacks sugar  failing to adhere to this bylaw the clerk must resign  i wish i could see that communication that broke the camels back it was probably the one beginning what plague spot or bacilli were gnawing at the heart of this metropolis and bringing it on bended knee and i think it likely that the kindly disposed clerk tried to translate it into english and lost his mind and had to go to the hospital that bylaw was not the offspring of a forecast an intuition it was certainly born of a sorrowful experience its temper gives the fact away  the little book of bylaws has manifestly been tinkered by one of mrs eddys thorough english scholars for in the majority of cases its meanings are clear the book is not even marred by mrs eddys peculiar specialtylumbering clumsinesses of speech i believe the salaried polisher has weeded them all out but one in one place after referring to science and health mrs eddy goes on to say the bible and the abovenamed book with other works by the same author etc  it is an unfortunate sentence for it could mislead a hasty or careless reader for a moment mrs eddy framed itit is her very ownit bears her trademark the bible and science and health with other works by the same author could have come from no literary vacuum but the one which produced the remark in the autobiography i remember reading in my childhood certain manuscripts containing scriptural sonnets besides other verses and enigmas  we know what she means in both instances but a lowpriced clerk would not necessarily know and on a salary like his he could quite excusably aver that the pastor emeritus had commanded him to come and make proclamation that she was author of the bible and that she was thinking of discharging some scriptural sonnets and other enigmas upon the congregation it could lose him his place but it would not be fair if it happened before the edict about understanding communications was promulgated     readers again  the bylaw book makes a showy pretence of orderliness and system but it is only a pretence i will not go so far as to say it is a harumscarum jumble for it is not that but i think it fair to say it is at least jumbulacious in places for instance articles iii and iv set forth in much detail the qualifications and duties of readers she then skips some thirty pages and takes up the subject again it looks like slovenliness but it may be only art the belated bylaw has a sufficiently quiet look but it has a ton of dynamite in it it makes all the christian science church readers on the globe the personal chattels of mrs eddy whenever she chooses she can stretch her long arm around the worlds fat belly and flirt a reader out of his pulpit though he be tucked away in seeming safety and obscurity in a lost village in the middle of china  in any church sec 2 the pastor emeritus of the motherchurch shall have the right through a letter addressed to the individual and church of which he is the reader to remove a reader from this office in any church of christ scientist both in america and in foreign nations or to appoint the reader to fill any office belonging to the christian science denomination  she does not have to prefer charges against him she does not have to find him lazy careless incompetent untidy illmannered unholy dishonest she does not have to discover a fault of any kind in him she does not have to tell him nor his congregation why she dismisses and disgraces him and insults his meek flock she does not have to explain to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them outofdoors homeless and ashamed in a strange land she does not have to do anything but send a letter and say packand ask no questions  has the pope this powerthe other popethe one in rome has he anything approaching it can he turn a priest out of his pulpit and strip him of his office and his livelihood just upon a whim a caprice and meanwhile furnishing no reasons to the parish not in america and not elsewhere we may believe  it is odd and strange to see intelligent and educated people among us worshipping this selfseeking and remorseless tyrant as a god this worship is deniedby persons who are themselves worshippers of mrs eddy i feel quite sure that it is a worship which will continue during ages  that mrs eddy wrote that amazing bylaw with her own hand we have much better evidence than her word we have her english it is there it cannot be imitated she ought never to go to the expense of copyrighting her verbal discharges when any one tries to claim them she should call me i can always tell them from any other literary apprentices at a glance it was like her to call america a nation she would call a sandbar a nation if it should fall into a sentence in which she was speaking of peoples for she would not know how to untangle it and get it out and classify it by itself and the closing arrangement of that bylaw is in true eddysonian form too in it she reserves authority to make a reader fill any office connected with a science churchsexton gravedigger advertisingagent annexpolisher leader of the choir president director treasurer clerk etc she did not mean that she already possessed that authority she meant to clothe herself with power despotic and unchallengeable to appoint all science readers to their offices both at home and abroad the phrase or to appoint is another miscarriage of intention she did not mean or she meant and   that bylaw puts into mrs eddys hands absolute command over the most formidable force and influence existent in the christian science kingdom outside of herself and it does this unconditionally and by auxiliary force of laws already quoted irrevocably still she is not quite satisfied something might happen she doesnt know what therefore she drives in one more nail to make sure and drives it deep  this bylaw can neither be amended nor annulled except by consent of the pastor emeritus  let some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can imagine her furnishing that consent     monopoly of spiritual bread  very properly the first qualification for membership in the motherchurch is belief in the doctrines of christian science  but these doctrines must not be gathered from secondary sources there is but one recognized source the candidate must be a believer in the doctrines of christian science according to the platform and teaching contained in the christian science textbook science and health with key to the scriptures by rev mary baker g eddy  that is definite and is final there are to be no commentaries no labored volumes of exposition and explanation by anybody except mrs eddy because such things could sow error create warring opinions split the religion into sects and disastrously cripple its power mrs eddy will do the whole of the explaining herselfhas done it in fact she has written several books they are to be had for cash in advance they are all sacred additions to them can never be needed and will never be permitted they tell the candidate how to instruct himself how to teach others how to do all things comprised in the businessand they close the door against all wouldbe competitors and monopolize the trade  the bible and the abovenamed book science and health with other works by the same author must be his only textbooks for the commercehe cannot forage outside  mrs eddys words are to be the sole elucidators of the bible and science and healthforever throughout the ages whenever there is doubt as to the meaning of a passage in either of these books the inquirer will not dream of trying to explain it to himself he would shudder at the thought of such temerity such profanity he would be haled to the inquisition and thence to the public square and the stake if he should be caught studying into textmeanings on his own hook he will be prudent and seek the meanings at the only permitted source mrs eddys commentaries  value of this straitjacket one must not underrate the magnificence of this longheaded idea one must not underestimate its giant possibilities in the matter of trooping the church solidly together and keeping it so it squelches independent inquiry and makes such a thing impossible profane criminal it authoritatively settles every dispute that can arise it starts with finalitya point which the roman church has travelled towards fifteen or sixteen centuries stage by stage and has not yet reached the matter of the immaculate conception of the virgin mary was not authoritatively settled until the days of pius ixyesterday so to speak  as already noticed the protestants are broken up into a long array of sects a result of disputes about the meanings of texts disputes made unavoidable by the absence of an infallible authority to submit doubtful passages to a week or two ago i am writing in the middle of january 1903 the clergy and others hereabouts had a warm dispute in the papers over this question did jesus anywhere claim to be god it seemed an easy question but it turned out to be a hard one it was ably and elaborately discussed by learned men of several denominations but in the end it remained unsettled  a week ago another discussion broke out it was over this text  sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor  one verdict was worded as follows  when christ answered the rich young man and said for him to give to the poor all he possessed or he could not gain everlasting life he did not mean it in the literal sense my interpretation of his words is that we should part with what comes between us and christ  there is no doubt that jesus believed that the rich young man thought more of his wealth than he did of his soul and such being the case it was his duty to give up the wealth  every one of us knows that there is something we should give up for christ those who are true believers and followers know what they have given up and those who are not yet followers know down in their hearts what they must give up  ten clergymen of various denominations were interviewed and nine of them agreed with that verdict that did not settle the matter because the tenth said the language of jesus was so strait and definite that it explained itself sell all not a percentage  there is a most unusual feature about that dispute the nine persons who decided alike quoted not a single authority in support of their position i do not know when i have seen trained disputants do the like of that before the nine merely furnished their own opinions founded uponnothing at all in the other dispute did jesus anywhere claim to be god the same kind of mentrained and learned clergymenbacked up their arguments with chapter and verse on both sides plenty of verses were no reinforcing verses to be found in the present case it looks that way  the opinion of the nine seems strange to me for it is unsupported by authority while there was at least constructive authority for the opposite view  it is hairsplitting differences of opinion over disputed textmeanings that have divided into many sects a once united church one may infer from some of the names in the following list that some of the differences are very slightso slight as to be not distinctly important perhapsyet they have moved groups to withdraw from communions to which they belonged and set up a sect of

under 5 flags the literary digest february 14th is pleased with mr lindhs optimistic article and also with the signs of the times and perceives that the idea of church unity is in the air  now then is not mrs eddy profoundly wise in forbidding for all time all explanations of her religion except such as she shall let on to be her own  i think so i think there can be no doubt of it in a way they will be her own for no matter which member of her clerical staff shall furnish the explanations not a line of them will she ever allow to be printed until she shall have approved it accepted it copyrighted it cabbaged it we may depend on that with a fourace confidence     chapter vii     the new infallibility  all in proper time mrs eddys factory will take hold of that commandment and explain it for good and all it may be that one member of the shift will vote that the word all means all it may be that ten members of the shift will vote that all means only a percentage but it is mrs eddy not the eleven who will do the deciding and if she says it is percentage then percentage it is forevermoreand that is what i am expecting for she doesnt sell all herself nor any considerable part of it and as regards the poor she doesnt declare any dividend but if she says all means all then all it is to the end of time and no follower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct that text or shrink it or inflate it or meddle with it in any way at all even todayright here in the beginningshe is the sole person who in the matter of christian science exegesis is privileged to exploit the spiral twist the christian world has two infallibles now  of equal power for the present only when leo xiii passes to his rest another infallible will ascend his throne others and yet others and still others will follow him and be as infallible as he and decide questions of doctrine as long as they may come up all down the far future but mary baker g eddy is the only infallible that will ever occupy the science throne many a science pope will succeed her but she has closed their mouths they will repeat and reverently praise and adore her infallibilities but venture none themselves in her grave she will still outrank all other popes be they of what church they may she will hold the supremest of earthly titles the infalliblewith a capital t many in the worlds history have had a hunger for such nuggets and slices of power as they might reasonably hope to grab out of an empires or a religions assets but mrs eddy is the only person alive or dead who has ever struck for the whole of them for small things she has the eye of a microscope for large ones the eye of a telescope and whatever she sees she wants wants it all     the sacred poems  when mrs eddys sacred revelations that is the language of the bylaws are read in public their authorship must be named the bylaws twice command this therefore we mention it twice to be fair  but it is also commanded that when a member publicly quotes from the poems of our pastor emeritus the authorship shall be named for these are sacred too there are kindly people who may suspect a hidden generosity in that bylaw they may think it is there to protect the official reader from the suspicion of having written the poems himself such do not know mrs eddy she does an inordinate deal of protecting but in no distinctly named and specified case in her history has number two been the object of it instances have been claimed but they have failed of proof and even of plausibility  members shall also instruct their students to look out and advertise the authorship when they read those poems and things not on mrs eddys account but for the good of our cause     the church edifice  1 mrs eddy gave the land it was not of much value at the time but it is very valuable now 2 her people built the motherchurch edifice on it at a cost of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars 3 then they gave the whole property to her 4 then she gave it to the board of directors she is the board of directors she took it out of one pocket and put it in the other 5 sec 10 of the deed whenever said directors shall determine that it is inexpedient to maintain preaching reading or speaking in said church in accordance with the terms of this deed they are authorized and required to reconvey forthwith said lot of land with the building thereon to mary baker g eddy her heirs and assigns forever by a proper deed of conveyance  she is never careless never slipshod about a matter of business owning the property through her board of waxworks was safe enough still it was sound business to set another grip on it to cover accidents and she did it her barkers what a curious name i wonder if it is copyrighted her barkers persistently advertise to the public her generosity in giving away a piece of land which cost her a trifle and a twohundredandfiftythousanddollar church which cost her nothing and they can hardly speak of the unselfishness of it without breaking down and crying yet they know she gave nothing away and never intended to however such is the human race often it does seem such a pity that noah and his party did not miss the boat  some of the hostiles think that mrs eddys idea in protecting this property in the interest of her heirs and in accumulating a great money fortune is that she may leave her natural heirs well provided for when she goes i think it is a mistake i think she is of late years giving herself large concern about only one interesther power and glory and the perpetuation and worship of her namewith a capital n her church is her pet heir and i think it will get her wealth it is the torch which is to light the world and the ages with her glory  i think she once prized money for the ease and comfort it could bring the showy vanities it could furnish and the social promotion it could command for we have seen that she was born into the world with little ways and instincts and aspirations and affectations that are duplicates of our own i do not think her moneypassion has ever diminished in ferocity i do not think that she has ever allowed a dollar that had no friends to get by her alive but i think her reason for wanting it has changed i think she wants it now to increase and establish and perpetuate her power and glory with not to add to her comforts and luxuries not to furnish paint and fuss and feathers for vain display i think her ambitions have soared away above the fussandfeather stage she still likes the little shows and vanitiesa fact which she exposed in a public utterance two or three days ago when she was not noticingbut i think she does not place a large value upon them now she could build a mighty and farshining brassmounted palace if she wanted to but she does not do it she would have had that kind of an ambition in the early scrabbling times she could go to england today and be worshiped by earls and get a comets attention from the million if she cared for such things she would have gone in the early scrabbling days for much less than an earl and been vain of it and glad to show off before the remains of the scotch kin but those things are very small to her nownext to invisible observed through the cloudrack from the dizzy summit where she perches in these great days she does not want that church property for herself it is worth but a quarter of a milliona sum she could call in from her farspread flocks tomorrow with a lift of her hand not a squeeze of it just a lift it would come without a murmur come gratefully come gladly and if her glory stood in more need of the money in boston than it does where her flocks are propagating it she would lift the hand i think  she is still reaching for the dollar she will continue to reach for it but not that she may spend it upon herself not that she may spend it upon charities not that she may indemnify an early deprivation and clothe herself in a blaze of north adams gauds not that she may have nine breeds of pie for breakfast as only the rich newenglander can not that she may indulge any petty material vanity or appetite that once was hers and prized and nursed but that she may apply that dollar to statelier uses and place it where it may cast the metallic sheen of her glory farthest across the receding expanses of the globe     prayer  a brief and good one is furnished in the book of bylaws the scientist is required to pray it every day     the lords prayeramended  this is not in the bylaws it is in the first chapter of science and health edition of 1902 i do not find it in the edition of 1884 it is probable that it had not at that time been handed down science and healths latest rendering of its spiritual sense is as follows  our fathermother god allharmonious adorable one thy kingdom is within us thou art everpresent enable us to knowas in heaven so on earthgod is supreme give us grace for today feed the famished affections and infinite love is reflected in love and love leadeth us not into temptation but delivereth from sin disease and death for god is now and forever all life truth and love  if i thought my opinion was desired and would be properly revered i should say that in my judgment that is as good a piece of carpentering as any of those eleven commandmentexperts could do with the material after all their practice i notice only one doubtful place lead us not into temptation seems to me to be a very definite request and that the new rendering turns the definite request into a definite assertion i shall be glad to have that turned back to the old way and the marks of the spiral twist removed or varnished over then i shall be satisfied and will do the best i can with what is left at the same time i do feel that the shrinkage in our spiritual assets is getting serious first the commandments now the prayer i never expected to see these steady old reliable securities watered down to this and this is not the whole of it last summer the presbyterians extended the calling and election suffrage to nearly everybody entitled to salvation they did not even stop there but let out all the unbaptized american infants we had been accumulating for two hundred years and more there are some that believe they would have let the scotch ones out too if they could have done it everything is going to ruin in no long time we shall have nothing left but the love of god     the new unpardonable sin  working against the cause sec 2 if a member of this church shall work against the accomplishment of what the discoverer and founder of christian science understands is advantageous to the individual to this church and to the cause of christian scienceout he goes forever  the member may think that what he is doing will advance the cause but he is not invited to do any thinking more than that he is not permitted to do anyas he will clearly gather from this bylaw when a person joins mrs eddys church he must leave his thinker at home leave it permanently to make sure that it will not go off some time or other when he is not watching it will be safest for him to spike it if he should forget himself and think just once the bylaw provides that he shall be fired outinstantlyforeverno return  it shall be the duty of this church immediately to call a meeting and drop forever the name of this member from its records  my but it breathes a towering indignation  there are forgivable offenses but this is not one of them there are admonitions probations suspensions in several minor cases mercy is shown the derelict in those cases he is gently used and in time he can get back into the foldeven when he has repeated his offence but let him think just once without getting his thinker set to eddy time and that is enough his head comes off there is no second offence and there is no gate open to that lost sheep ever again  this rule cannot be changed amended or annulled except by unanimous vote of all the first members  the same being mrs eddy it is naively sly and pretty to see her keep putting forward first members and boards of this and that and other broideries and ruffles of her raiment as if they were independent entities instead of a part of her clothes and could do things all by themselves when she was outside of them  mrs eddy did not need to copyright the sentence just quoted its english would protect it none but she would have shovelled that comically superfluous all in there  the former unpardonable sin has gone out of service we may frame the new christian science one thus  whatsoever member shall think and without our mothers permission act upon his think the same shall be cut off from the church forever  it has been said that i make many mistakes about christian science through being ignorant of the spiritual meanings of its terminology i believe it is true i have been misled all this time by that word member because there was no one to tell me that its spiritual meaning was slave     axe and block  there is a bylaw which forbids members to practice hypnotism the penalty is excommunication  1 if a member is found to be a mental practitioner2 complaint is to be entered against him3 by the pastor emeritus and by none else 4 no member is allowed to make complaint to her in the matter 5 upon mrs eddys mere complaintunbacked by evidence or proof and without giving the accused a chance to be heardhis name shall be dropped from this church  mrs eddy has only to say a member is guiltythat is all that ends it it is not a case of he may be cut off from christian science salvation it is a case of he shall be her serfs must see to it and not say a word  does the other pope possess this prodigious and irresponsible power certainly not in our day  some may be curious to know how mrs eddy finds out that a member is practicing hypnotism since no one is allowed to come before her throne and accuse him she has explained this in christian science history first and second editions page 16  i possess a spiritual sense of what the malicious mental practitioner is mentally arguing which cannot be deceived i can discern in the human mind thoughts motives and purposes and neither mental arguments nor psychic power can affect this spiritual insight  a marvelous woman with a hunger for power such as has never been seen in the world before no thing little or big that contains any seed or suggestion of power escapes her avaricious eye and when once she gets that eye on it her remorseless grip follows there isnt a christian scientist who isnt ecclesiastically as much her property as if she had bought him and paid for him and copyrighted him and got a charter she cannot be satisfied when she has handcuffed a member and put a legchain and ball on him and plugged his ears and removed his thinker she goes on wrapping needless chains round and round him just as a spider would for she trusts no one believes in no ones honesty judges every one by herself although we have seen that she has absolute and irresponsible command over her spectral boards and over every official and servant of her church at home and abroad over every minute detail of her churchs government present and future and can purge her membership of guilty or suspected persons by various plausible formalities and whenever she will she is still not content but must set her queer mind to work and invent a way by which she can take a memberany memberby neck and crop and fling him out without anything resembling a formality at all  she is sole accuser and sole witness and her testimony is final and carries uncompromising and irremediable doom with it  the solewitness court it should make the council of ten and the council of three turn in their graves for shame to see how little they knew about satanic concentrations of irresponsible power here we have one accuser one witness one judge one headsmanand all four bunched together in mrs eddy the inspired of god his latest thought to his people new member of the holy family the equal of jesus  when a member is not satisfactory to mrs eddy and yet is blameless in his life and faultless in his membership and in his christian science walk and conversation shall he hold up his head and tilt his hat over one ear and imagine himself safe because of these perfections why in that very moment mrs eddy will cast that spiritual xray of hers through his dungarees and say  i see his hypnotism working among his insidesremove him to the block  what shall it profit him to know it isnt so nothing his testimony is of no value no one wants it no one will ask for it he is not present to offer it he does not know he has been accused and if he were there to offer it it would not be listened to  it was out of powers approaching mrs eddysthough not equalling themthat the inquisition and the devastations of the interdict grew she will transmit hers the man born two centuries from now will think he has arrived in hell and all in good time he will think he knows it vast concentrations of irresponsible power have never in any age been used mercifully and there is nothing to suggest that the christian science papacy is going to spend money on novelties  several christian scientists have asked me to refrain from prophecy there is no prophecy in our day but history but history is a trustworthy prophet history is always repeating itself because conditions are always repeating themselves out of duplicated conditions history always gets a duplicate product     reading letters at meetings  i wonder if there is anything a member can do that will not raise mrs eddys jealousy the bylaws seem to hunt him from pillar to post all the time and turn all his thoughts and acts and words into sins against the meek and lowly new deity of his worship apparently her jealousy never sleeps apparently any trifle can offend it and but one penalty appease itexcommunication the bylaws might properly and reasonably be entitled laws for the coddling and comforting of our mothers petty jealousies the bylaw named at the head of this paragraph reads its transgressor out of the church if he shall carry a letter from mrs eddy to the congregation and forget to read it or fail to read the whole of it     honesty requisite  dishonest members are to be admonished if they continue in dishonest practices excommunication follows considering who it is that draughted this law there is a certain amount of humor in it     further applications of the axe  here follow the titles of some more bylaws whose infringement is punishable by excommunication   silence enjoined misteaching departure from tenets violation of christian fellowship moral offences illegal adoption broken bylaws violation of bylaws what is the difference formulas forbidden official advice forbids tom dick and harrys clack unworthy of membership final excommunication organizing churches  this looks as if mrs eddy had devoted a large share of her time and talent to inventing ways to get rid of her church members yet in another place she seems to invite membership not in any urgent way it is true still she throws out a bait to such as like notice and distinction in other words the human race page 82  it is important that these seemingly strict conditions be complied with as the names of the members of the motherchurch will be recorded in the history of the church and become a part thereof  we all want to be historical     more selfprotections  the hymnal there is a christian science hymnal entrance to it was closed in 1898 christian science students who make hymns nowadays may possibly get them sung in the motherchurch but not unless approved by the pastor emeritus art xxvii sec 2  solo singers mrs eddy has contributed the words of three of the hymns in the hymnal two of them appear in it six times altogether each of them being set to three original forms of musical anguish mrs eddy always thoughtful has promulgated a bylaw requiring the singing of one of her three hymns in the mother church as often as once each month it is a good idea a congregation could get tired of even mrs eddys muse in the course of time without the cordializing incentive of compulsion we all know how wearisome the sweetest and touchingest things can become through repreprepetition and still repreprepetition and more repreprepetitionlike the sweet byandby in the sweet byandby for instance and tahrahrah boomdeaye and surely it is not likely that mrs eddys machine has turned out goods that could outwear those great heartstirrers without the assistance of the lash oer waiting harpstrings of the mind is pretty good quite fair to middlingthe whole seven of the stanzasbut repetition would be certain to take the excitement out of it in the course of time even if there were fourteen and then it would sound like the multiplication table and would cease to save the congregation would be perfectly sure to get tired in fact did get tiredhence the compulsory bylaw it is a measure born of experience not foresight  the bylaws say that if a solo singer shall neglect or refuse to sing alone one of those three hymns as often as once a month and oftener if so directed by the board of directorswhich is mrs eddythe singers salary shall be stopped it is circumstantial evidence that some soloists neglected this sacrament and others refused it at least that is the charitable view to take of it there is only one other view to take that mrs eddy did really foresee that there would be singers who would some day get tired of doing her hymns and proclaiming the authorship unless persuaded by a bylaw with a penalty attached the idea could of course occur to her wise head for she would know that a sevenstanza break might well be a calamitous strain upon a soloist and that he might therefore avoid it if unwatched he could not curtail it for the whole of anything that mrs eddy does is sacred and cannot be cut     board of education  it consists of four members one of whom is president of it its members are elected annually subject to mrs eddys approval art xxx sec 2  she owns the boardis the board  mrs eddy is president of the metaphysical college if at any time she shall vacate that office the directors of the college that is to say mrs eddy shall elect to the vacancy the president of the board of education which is merely reelecting herself  it is another case of pastor emeritus she gives up the shadow of authority but keeps a good firm hold on the substance     public teachers  applicants for admission to this industry must pass a thorough three days examination before the board of education in science and health chapter on recapitulation the platform of christian science page 403 of christian science practice from line second to the second paragraph of page 405 and page 488 second and third paragraphs     board of lectureship  the lecturers are exceedingly important servants of mrs eddy and she chooses them with great care each of them has an appointed territory in which to perform his dutiesin the north the south the east the west in canada in great britain and so onand each must stick to his own territory and not forage beyond its boundaries i think it goes without sayingfrom what we have seen of mrs eddythat no lecture is delivered until she has examined and approved it and that the lecturer is not allowed to change it afterwards  the members of the board of lectureship are elected annually  subject to the approval of rev mary baker g eddy     missionaries  there are but four they are electedlike the rest of the domesticsannually so far as i can discover not a single servant of the sacred household has a steady job except mrs eddy it is plain that she trusts no human being but herself     the bylaws  the branch churches are strictly forbidden to use them  so far as i can see they could not do it if they wanted to the bylaws are merely the voice of the master issuing commands to the servants there is nothing and nobody for the servants to reutter them to  that useless edict is repeated in the little book a few pages farther on there are several other repetitions of prohibitions in the book that could be sparedthey only take up room for nothing     the creed it is copyrighted i do not know why but i suppose it is to keep adventurers from some day claiming that they invented it and not mrs eddy and that strange providence that has suggested so many clever things to her  no change it is forbidden to change the creed that is important at any rate    copyright  i can understand why mrs eddy copyrighted the early editions and revisions of science and health and why she had a mania for copyrighting every scrap of every sort that came from her pen in those jejune days when to be in print probably seemed a wonderful distinction to her in her provincial obscurity but why she should continue this delirium in these days of her godship and her farspread fame i cannot explain to myself and particularly as regards science and health she knows now that that annex is going to live for many centuries and so what good is a fleeting fortytwoyear copyright going to do it  now a perpetual copyright would be quite another matter i would like to give her a hint let her strike for a perpetual copyright on that book there is precedent for it there is one book in the world which bears the charmed life of perpetual copyright a fact not known to twenty people in the world by a hardy perversion of privilege on the part of the lawmaking power the bible has perpetual copyright in great britain there is no justification for it in fairness and no explanation of it except that the church is strong enough there to have its way right or wrong the recent revised version enjoys perpetual copyright tooa stronger precedent even than the other one  now then what is the annex but a revised version itself which of course it islords prayer and all with that pair of formidable british precedents to proceed upon what congress of ours  but how shortsighted i am mrs eddy has thought of it long ago she thinks of everything she knows she has only to keep her copyright of 1902 alive through its first stage of twentyeight years and perpetuity is assured a christian science congress will reign in the capitol then she probably attaches small value to the first edition 1875 although it was a revelation from on high it was slim lank incomplete padded with bales of refuse rags and puffs from lassoed celebrities to fill it out an uncreditable book a book easily sparable a book not to be mentioned in the same year with the sleek fat concise compact compressed and competent annex of today in its dainty flexible covers giltedges rounded corners twin screw spiral twist compensation balance testamentcounterfeit and all that a book just born to curl up on the hymnbookshelf in church and look just too sweet and holy for anything yes i see now what she was copyrighting that child for     christian science publishing association  it is true in matters of business mrs eddy thinks of everything she thought of an organ to disseminate the truth as it was in mrs eddy straightway she started onethe christian science journal  it is truein matters of business mrs eddy thinks of everything as soon as she had got the christian science journal sufficiently in debt to make its presence on the premises disagreeable to her it occurred to her to make somebody a present of it which she did along with its debts it was in the summer of 1889 the victim selected was her churchcalled in those days the national christian scientist association  she delivered this sorrow to those lambs as a gift in consideration of their loyalty to our great cause  alsostill thinking of everythingshe told them to retain mr bailey in the editorship and make mr nixon publisher we do not know what it was she had against those men neither do we know whether she scored on bailey or not we only know that god protected nixon and for that i am sincerely glad although i do not know nixon and have never even seen him  nixon took the journal and the rest of the publishing societys liabilities and demonstrated over them during three years then brought in his report  on assuming my duties as publisher there was not a dollar in the treasury but on the contrary the society owed unpaid printing and paper bills to the amount of several hundred dollars not to mention a contingent liability of many more hundredsrepresented by advancesubscriptions paid for the journal and the series the which goods mrs eddy had not delivered and couldnt very well perhaps on a metaphysical college income of but a few thousand dollars a day or a week or whatever it was in those magnificently flourishing times the struggling journal had swallowed up those advancepayments but its claim was a severe one and they had failed to cure it but nixon cured it in his diligent three years and joyously reported the news that he had cleared off all the debts and now had a fat six thousand dollars in the bank  it made mrs eddys mouth water  at the time that mrs eddy had unloaded that dismal gift on to her national association she had followed her inveterate custom she had tied a string to its hind leg and kept one end of it hitched to her belt we have seen her do that in the case of the boston mosque when she deeds property she puts in that stringclause it provides that under certain conditions she can pull the string and land the property in the cherished home of its happy youth in the present case she believed that she had made provision that if at any time the national christian science association should dissolve itself by a formal vote she could pull  a year after nixons handsome report she writes the association that she has a unique request to lay before it it has dissolved and she is not quite sure that the christian science journal has already fallen into her hands by that act though it seems to her to have met with that accident so she would like to have the matter decided by a formal vote but whether there is a doubt or not i see the wisdom she says of again owning this christian science waif  i think that that is unassailable evidence that the waif was making money hands down  she pulled her gift in a few years later she donated the publishing society along with its real estate its buildings its plant its publications and its moneythe whole worth twentytwo thousand dollars and free of debttowell to the motherchurch  that is to say to herself there is an act count of it in the christian science journal and of how she had already made some other handsome giftsto her churchand others toto her cause besides an almost countless number of private charities of cloudy amount and otherwise indefinite this landslide of generosities overwhelmed one of her literary domestics while he was in that condition he tried to express what he felt  let us endeavor to lift up our hearts in thankfulness to our mother in israel for these evidences of generosity and selfsacrifice that appeal to our deepest sense of gratitude even while surpassing our comprehension  a year or two later mrs eddy promulgated some bylaws of a selfsacrificing sort which assuaged him perhaps and perhaps enabled his surpassed comprehension to make a sprint and catch up these are to be found in art xii entitled     the christian science publishing society  this article puts the whole publishing business into the hands of a publishing boardspecial mrs eddy appoints to its vacancies  the profits go semiannually to the treasurer of the motherchurch mrs eddy owns the treasurer  editors and publishers of the christian science journal cannot be elected or removed without mrs eddys knowledge and consent  every candidate for employment in a high capacity or a low one on the other periodicals or in the publishing house must first be accepted by mrs eddy as suitable and by the board of directorswhich is surplusage since mrs eddy owns the board  if at any time a weekly shall be started it shall be owned by the first church of christ scientistwhich is mrs eddy     chapter viii  i think that any one who will carefully examine the bylaws i have placed all of the important ones before the reader will arrive at the conclusion that of late years the masterpassion in mrs eddys heart is a hunger for power and glory and that while her hunger for money still remains she wants it now for the expansion and extension it can furnish to that power and glory rather than what it can do for her towards satisfying minor and meaner ambitions  i wish to enlarge a little upon this matter i think it is quite clear that the reason why mrs eddy has concentrated in herself all powers all distinctions all revenues that are within the command of the christian science church universal is that she desires and intends to devote them to the purpose just suggestedthe upbuilding of her personal gloryhers and no one elses that and the continuing of her names glory after she shall have passed away if she has overlooked a single power howsoever minute i cannot discover it if she has found one large or small which she has not seized and made her own there is no record of it no trace of it in her foragings and depredations she usually puts forward the motherchurcha lay figureand hides behind it whereas she is in manifest reality the motherchurch herself it has an impressive array of officials and committees and boards of direction of education of lectureship and so ongeldings every one shadows spectres apparitions waxfigures she is supreme over them all she can abolish them when she will blow them out as she would a candle she is herself the motherchurch now there is one bylaw which says that the motherchurch  shall be officially controlled by no other church  that does not surprise uswe know by the rest of the bylaws that that is a quite irrelevant remark yet we do vaguely and hazily wonder why she takes the trouble to say it why she wastes the words what her object can beseeing that that emergency has been in so many many ways and so effectively and drastically barred off and made impossible then presently the object begins to dawn upon us that is it does after we have read the rest of the bylaw three or four times wondering and admiring to see mrs eddymrs eddymrs eddy of all personsthrowing away powermaking a fair exchangedoing a fair thing for once more an almost generous thing then we look it through yet once more unsatisfied a little suspiciousand find that it is nothing but a sly thin makebelieve and that even the very title of it is a sarcasm and embodies a falsehoodself government  local selfgovernment the first church of christ scientist in boston massachusetts shall assume no official control of other churches of this denomination it shall be officially controlled by no other church  it has a most pious and deceptive giveandtake air of perfect fairness unselfishness magnanimityalmost godliness indeed but it is all art   in the bylaws mrs eddy speaking by the mouth of her other self the motherchurch proclaims that she will assume no official control of other churchesbranch churches we examine the other bylaws and they answer some important questions for us  1 what is a branch church it is a body of christian scientists organized in the one and only permissible wayby a member in good standing of the motherchurch and who is also a pupil of one of mrs eddys accredited students that is to say one of her properties no other can do it there are other indispensable requisites what are they  2 the new church cannot enter upon its functions until its members have individually signed and pledged allegiance to a creed furnished by mrs eddy  3 they are obliged to study her books and order their lives by them and they must read no outside religious works  4 they must sing the hymns and pray the prayers provided by her and use no others in the services except by her permission  5 they cannot have preachers and pastors her law  6 in their church they must have two readersa man and a woman  7 they must read the services framed and appointed by her  8 shenot the branch churchappoints those readers  9 shenot the branch churchdismisses them and fills the vacancies  10 she can do this without consulting the branch church and without explaining  11 the branch church can have a religious lecture from time to time by applying to mrs eddy there is no other way  12 but the branch church cannot select the lecturer mrs eddy does it  13 the branch church pays his fee  14 the harnessing of all christian science weddingteams members of the branch church must be done by duly authorized and consecrated christian science functionaries her factory is the only one that makes and licenses them  15 nothing is said about christenings it is inferable from this that a christian science child is born a christian scientist and requires no tinkering  16 nothing is said about funerals it is inferable then that a branch church is privileged to do in that matter as it may choose  to sum up are any important churchfunctions absent from the list i cannot call any to mind are there any lacking ones whose exercise could make the branch in any noticeable way independent of the mother churcheven in any trifling degree i think of none if the named functions were abolished would there still be a church left would there be even a shadow of a church left would there be anything at all left even the bare name  manifestly not there isnt a single vital and essential churchfunction of any kind that is not named in the list and over every one of them the motherchurch has permanent and unchallengeable control upon every one of them mrs eddy has set her irremovable grip she holds in perpetuity autocratic and indisputable sovereignty and control over every branch church in the earth and yet says in that sugary naive angelbeguiling way of hers that the motherchurch  shall assume no official control of other churches of this denomination  whereas in truth the unmeddledwith liberties of a branch christian science church are but very very few in number and are these  1 it can appoint its own furnacestoker winters 2 it can appoint its own fandistributors summers 3 it can in accordance with its own choice in the matter burn bury or preserve members who are pretending to be deadwhereas there is no such thing as death 4 it can take up a collection  the branch churches have no important liberties none that give them an important voice in their own affairs those are all locked up and mrs eddy has the key local selfgovernment is a large name and sounds well but the branch churches have no more of it than have the privates in the king of dahomeys army     motherchurch unique  mrs eddy with an envious and admiring eye upon the solitary and rivalless and worldshadowing majesty of st peters reveals in her bylaws her purpose to set the motherchurch apart by itself in a stately seclusion and make it duplicate that lone sublimity under the western sky the bylaw headed motherchurch unique says  in its relation to other christian science churches the motherchurch stands alone  it occupies a position that no other church can fill  then for a branch church to assume such position would be disastrous to christian science  therefore  therefore no branch church is allowed to have branches there shall be no christian science st peters in the earth but just onethe motherchurch in boston     no first members  but for the thoughtful bylaw thus entitled every science branch in the earth would imitate the motherchurch and set up an aristocracy every little group of groundfloor smiths and furgusons and shadwells and simpsons that organized a branch would assume that great title of first members along with its vast privileges of discussing the weather and casting blank ballots and soon there would be such a locustplague of them burdening the globe that the title would lose its value and have to be abolished  but where business and glory are concerned mrs eddy thinks of everything and so she did not fail to take care of her aborigines her stately and exclusive one hundred her college of functionless cardinals her sanhedrin of privileged talkers limited after taking away all the liberties of the branch churches and in the same breath disclaiming all official control over their affairs she smites them on the mouth with thisthe very mouth that was watering for those nobby groundfloor honors  no first members branch churches shall not organize with first members that special method of organization being adapted to the motherchurch alone  and so first members being prohibited we pierce through the cloud of mrs eddys english and perceive that they must then necessarily organize with subsequent members there is no other way it will occur to them byandby to found an aristocracy of early subsequent members there is no bylaw against it     the  i uncover to that imperial word and to the mind too that conceived the idea of seizing and monopolizing it as a title i believe it is mrs eddys dazzlingest invention for show and style and grandeur and thunder and lightning and fireworks it outclasses all the previous inventions of man and raises the limit on the pope he can never put his avid hand on that word of wordsit is preempted and copyrighted of course it lifts the motherchurch away up in the sky and fellowships it with the rare and select and exclusive little company of the thes of deathless glorypersons and things whereof history and the ages could furnish only single examples not two the saviour the virgin the milky way the bible the earth the equator the devil the missing linkand now the first church scientist and by clamor of edict and bylaw mrs eddy gives personal notice to all branch scientist churches on this planet to leave that the alone  she has demonstrated over it and made it sacred to the motherchurch  the article the must not be used before the titles of branch churches  nor written on applications for membership in naming such churches  those are the terms there can and will be a million first churches of christ scientist scattered over the world in a million towns and villages and hamlets and cities and each may call itself suppressing the article first church of christ scientistit is permissible and no harm but there is only one the church of christ scientist and there will never be another and whether that great word fall in the middle of a sentence or at the beginning of it it must always have its capital t  i do not suppose that a juvenile passion for fussy little worldly shows and vanities can furnish a match to this anywhere in the history of the nursery mrs eddy does seem to be a shade fonder of little special distinctions and pomps than is usual with human beings  she instituted that immodest the with her own hand she did not wait for somebody else to think of it     a lifeterm monopoly  there is but one human pastor in the whole christian science world she reserves that exalted place to herself     a perpetual one  there is but one other object in the whole christian science world honored with that title and holding that office it is her book the annexpermanent pastor of the first church and of all branch churches  with her own hand she draughted the bylaws which make her the only really absolute sovereign that lives today in christendom  she does not allow any objectionable pictures to be exhibited in the room where her book is sold nor any indulgence in idle gossip there and from the general look of that bylaw i judge that a lightsome and improper person can be as uncomfortable in that place as he could be in heaven     the sanctum sanctorum and sacred chair  in a room in the first church of christ scientist there is a museum of objects which have attained to holiness through contact with mrs eddyamong them an electrically lighted oilpicture of a chair which she used to sit inand disciples from all about the world go softly in there in restricted groups under proper guard and reverently gaze upon those relics it is worship mrs eddy could stop it if she was not fond of it for her sovereignty over that temple is supreme  the fittingup of that place as a shrine is not an accident nor a casual unweighed idea it is imitated from ageold religious custom in treves the pilgrim reverently gazes upon the seamless robe and humbly worships and does the same in that other continental church where they keep a duplicate and does likewise in the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem where memorials of the crucifixion are preserved and now by good fortune we have our holy chair and things and a market for our adorations nearer home  but is there not a detail that is new fresh original yes whatever old thing mrs eddy touches gets something new by the contactsomething not thought of before by any onesomething original all her own and copyrightable the new feature is self worshipexhibited in permitting this shrine to be installed during her lifetime and winking her sacred eye at it  a prominent christian scientist has assured me that the scientists do not worship mrs eddy and i think it likely that there may be five or six of the cult in the world who do not worship her but she herself is certainly not of that company any healthyminded person who will examine mrs eddys little autobiography and the manual of bylaws written by her will be convinced that she worships herself and that she brings to this service a fervor of devotion surpassing even that which she formerly laid at the feet of the dollar and equalling any which rises to the throne of grace from any quarter  i think this is as good a place as any to salve a hurt which i was the means of inflicting upon a christian scientist lately the first third of this book was written in 1899 in vienna until last summer i had supposed that that third had been printed in a book which i published about a year latera hap which had not happened i then sent the chapters composing it to the north american review but failed in one instance to date them and so in an undated chapter i said a lady told me last night so and so there was nothing to indicate to the reader that that last night was several years old therefore the phrase seemed to refer to a night of very recent date what the lady had told me was that in a part of the motherchurch in boston she had seen scientists worshipping a portrait of mrs eddy before which a light was kept constantly burning  a scientist came to me and wished me to retract that untruth he said there was no such portrait and that if i wanted to be sure of it i could go to boston and see for myself i explained that my last night meant a good while ago that i did not doubt his assertion that there was no such portrait there now but that i should continue to believe it had been there at the time of the ladys visit until she should retract her statement herself i was at no time vouching for the truth of the remark nevertheless i considered it worth par  and yet i am sorry the lady told me since a wound which brings me no happiness has resulted i am most willing to apply such salve as i can the best way to set the matter right and make everything pleasant and agreeable all around will be to print in this place a description of the shrine as it appeared to a recent visitor mr frederick w peabody of boston i will copy his newspaper account and the reader will see that mrs eddys portrait is not there now  we lately stood on the threshold of the holy of holies of the motherchurch and with a crowd of worshippers patiently waited for admittance to the hallowed precincts of the mothers room over the doorway was a sign informing us that but four persons at a time would be admitted that they would be permitted to remain but five minutes only and would please retire from the mothers room at the ringing of the bell entering with three of the faithful we looked with profane eyes upon the consecrated furnishings a showwoman in attendance monotonously announced the character of the different appointments set in a recess of the wall and illumined with electric light was an oilpainting the showwoman seriously declared to be a lifelike and realistic picture of the chair in which the mother sat when she composed her inspired work it was a picture of an oldfashioned country hair cloth rockingchair and an exceedingly commonplacelooking table with a pile of manuscript an inkbottle and pen conspicuously upon it on the floor were sheets of manuscript the mantelpiece is of pure onyx continued the showwoman and the beehive upon the windowsill is made from one solid block of onyx the rug is made of a hundred breasts of eiderdown ducks and the toiletroom you see in the corner is of the latest design with goldplated drainpipes the painted windows are from the mothers poem christ and christmas and that case contains complete copies of all the mothers books the chairs upon which the sacred person of the mother had reposed were protected from sacrilegious touch by a broad band of satin ribbon my companions expressed their admiration in subdued and reverent tones and at the tinkling of the bell we reverently tiptoed out of the room to admit another delegation of the patient waiters at the door  now then i hope the wound is healed i am willing to relinquish the portrait and compromise on the chair at the same time if i were going to worship either i should not choose the chair  as a picturesquely and persistently interesting personage there is no mate to mrs eddy the accepted equal of the saviour but some of her tastes are so different from his i find it quite impossible to imagine him in life standing sponsor for that museum there and taking pleasure in its sumptuous shows i believe he would put that chair in the fire and the bell along with it and i think he would make the showwoman go away i think he would break those electric bulbs and the mantelpiece of pure onyx and say reproachful things about the golden drainpipes of the lavatory and give the costly rug of duckbreasts to the poor and sever the satin ribbon and invite the weary to rest and ease their aches in the consecrated chairs what he would do with the painted windows we can better conjecture when we come presently to examine their peculiarities     the christian science pastoruniversal  when mrs eddy turned the pastors out of all the christian science churches and abolished the office for all time as far as human occupancy is concernedshe appointed the holy ghost to fill their place if this language be blasphemous i did not invent the blasphemy i am merely stating a fact i will quote from page 227 of science and health edition 1899 as a first step towards an explanation of this startling mattera passage which sets forth and classifies the christian science trinity  life truth and love constitute the triune god or triply divine principle they represent a trinity in unity three in onethe same in essence though multiform in office god the father christ the type of sonship divine science or the holy comforter  the holy ghost or spirit reveals this triune principle and the holy ghost is expressed in divine science which is the comforter leading into all truth and revealing the divine principle of the universeuniversal and perpetual harmony  i will cite another passage speaking of jesus  his students then received the holy ghost by this is meant that by all they had witnessed and suffered they were roused to an enlarged understanding of divine science even to the spiritual interpretation  of his teachings etc  also page 579 in the chapter called the glossary  holy ghost divine science the developments of life truth and love  the holy ghost reveals the massed spirit of the fused trinity this massed spirit is expressed in divine science and is the comforter divine science conveys to men the spiritual interpretation of the saviours teachings that seems to be the meaning of the quoted passages  divine science is christian science the book science and health is a revelation of the whole spirit of the trinity and is therefore the holy ghost it conveys to men the spiritual interpretation of the bibles teachings and therefore is the comforter  i do not find this analyzing work easy i would rather saw wood and a person can never tell whether he has added up a science and health sum right or not anyway after all his trouble neither can he easily find out whether the texts are still on the market or have been discarded from the book for two hundred and fiftyeight editions of it have been issued and no two editions seem to be alike the annual changesin technical terminology in matter and wording in transpositions of chapters and verses in leaving out old chapters and verses and putting in new onesseem to be next to innumerable and as there is no index there is no way to find a thing one wants without reading the book through if ever i inspire a bibleannex i will not rush at it in a halfdigested helterskelter way and have to put in thirtyeight years trying to get some of it the way i want it i will sit down and think it out and know what it is i want to say before i begin an inspirer cannot inspire for mrs eddy and keep his reputation i have never seen such slipshod work bar the ten that interpreted for the home market the sell all thou hast i have quoted one spiritual rendering of the lords prayer i have seen one other one and am told there are five more yet the inspirer of mrs eddy the new infallible casts a complacent critical stone at the other infallible for being unable to make up its mind about such things science and health edition 1899 page 33  the decisions by vote of church councils as to what should and should not be considered holy writ the manifest mistakes in the ancient versions the thirty thousand different readings in the old testament and the three hundred thousand in the newthese facts show how a mortal and material sense stole into the divine record darkening to some extent the inspired pages with its own hue  to some extent yesspeaking cautiously but it is nothing really nothing mrs eddy is only a little way behind and if her inspirer lives to get her annex to suit him that catholic record will have to go way back and set down as the ballad says listen to the boastful song of mrs eddys organ the christian science journal for march 1902 about that years revamping and halfsoling of science and health whose official name is the holy ghost the comforter and who is now the official pastor and infallible and unerring guide of every christian science church in the two hemispheres hear simple simon that met the pieman brag of the infallibles fallibility  throughout the entire book the verbal changes are so numerous as to indicate the vast amount of time and labor mrs eddy has devoted to this revision the time and labor thus bestowed is relatively as great as that ofthe committee who revised the bible thus we have additional evidence of the herculean efforts our beloved leader has made and is constantly making for the promulgation of truth and the furtherance of her divinely bestowed mission etc  it is a steady job i could help inspire if desired i am not doing much now and would work for halfprice and should not object to the country     price of the pastoruniversal  the price of the pastoruniversal science and health called in science literature the comforterand by that other sacred nameis three dollars in cloth as heretofore six when it is finely bound and shaped to imitate the testament and is broken into verses margin of profit above cost of manufacture from five hundred to seven hundred per cent as already noted in the profane subscriptiontrade it costs the publisher heavily to canvass a threedollar book he must pay the general agent sixty per cent commissionthat is to say one dollar and eightycents mrs eddy escapes this blistering tax because she owns the christian science canvasser and can compel him to work for nothing read the following commandnot requestfulminated by mrs eddy over her signature in the christian science journal for march 1897 and quoted by mr peabody in his book the book referred to is science and health  it shall be the duty of all christian scientists to circulate and to sell as many of these books as they can  that is flung at all the elect everywhere that the sun shines but no penalty is shaken over their heads to scare them the same command was issued to the members numbering today twentyfive thousand of the motherchurch also but with it went a threat of the infliction in case of disobedience of the most dreaded punishment that has a place in the churchs list of penalties for transgressions of mrs eddys edictsexcommunication  if a member of the first church of christ scientist shall fail to obey this injunction it will render him liable to lose his membership in this church mary baker eddy  it is the spirit of the spanish inquisition  none but accepted and well established gods can venture an affront like that and do it with confidence but the human race will take anything from that class mrs eddy knows the human race knows it better than any mere human being has known it in a thousand centuries my confidence in her humanbeingship is getting shaken my confidence in her godship is stiffening     seven hundred per cent  a scientist out west has visited a booksellerwith intent to find fault with meand has brought away the information that the price at which mrs eddy sells science and health is not an unusually high one for the size and make of the book that is true but in the booktradethat profitdevourer unknown to mrs eddys booka threedollar book that is made for thirtyfive or forty cents in large editions is put at three dollars because the publisher has to pay author middleman and advertising and if the price were much below three the profit accruing would not pay him fairly for his time and labor at the same time if he could get ten dollars for the book he would take it and his morals would not fall under criticism  but if he were an inspired person commissioned by the deity to receive and print and spread broadcast among sorrowing and suffering and poor men a precious message of healing and cheer and salvation he would have to do as bible societies dosell the book at a pinched margin above cost to such as could pay and give it free to all that couldnt and his name would be praised but if he sold it at seven hundred per cent profit and put the money in his pocket his name would be mocked and derided just as mrs eddys is and most justifiably as it seems to me  the complete bible contains one million words the new testament by itself contains two hundred and forty thousand words  my 84 edition of science and health contains one hundred and twenty thousand wordsjust half as many as the new testament  science and health has since been so inflated by later inspirations that the 1902 edition contains one hundred and eighty thousand wordsnot counting the thirty thousand at the back devoted by mrs eddy to advertising the books healing abilitiesand the inspiring continues right along  if you have a book whose market is so sure and so great that you can give a printer an everlasting order for thirty or forty or fifty thousand copies a year he will furnish them at a cheap rate because whenever there is a slack time in his pressroom and bindery he can fill the idle intervals on your book and be making something instead of losing that is the kind of contract that can be let on science and health every year i am obliged to doubt that the threedollar science and health costs mrs eddy above fifteen cents or that the six dollar copy costs her above eighty cents i feel quite sure that the average profit to her on these books above cost of manufacture is all of seven hundred per cent  every proper christian scientist has to buy and own and canvass for science and health one hundred and eighty thousand words and he must also own a bible one million words he can buy the one for from three to six dollars and the other for fifteen cents or if three dollars is all the money he has he can get his bible for nothing when the supreme being disseminates a saving message through uninspired agentsthe new testament for instanceit can be done for five cents a copy but when he sends one containing only twothirds as many words through the shop of a divine personage it costs sixty times as much i think that in matters of such importance it is bad economy to employ a wildcat agency  here are some figures which are perfectly authentic and which seem to justify my opinion  these bible societies inspired only by a sense of religious duty are issuing the bible at a price so small that they have made it the cheapest book printed for example the american bible society offers an edition of the whole bible as low as fifteen cents and the new testament at five cents and the british society at sixpence and one penny respectively these low prices made possible by their policy of selling the books at cost or below cost etcnew york sun february 25 1903     chapter ix  we may now make a final footingup of mrs eddy and see what she is in the fulness of her powers she is  the massachusetts metaphysical college pastor emeritus president board of directors board of education board of lectureships future board of trustees proprietor of the publishinghouse and periodicals treasurer clerk proprietor of the teachers proprietor of the lecturers proprietor of the missionaries proprietor of the readers dictator of the services sole voice of the pulpit proprietor of the sanhedrin sole proprietor of the creed copyrighted indisputable autocrat of the branch churches with their life and death in her hands sole thinker for the first church and the others sole and infallible expounder of doctrine in life and in death sole permissible discoverer denouncer judge and executioner of ostensible hypnotists fiftyhanded god of excommunicationwith a thunderbolt in every hand appointer and installer of the pastor of all the churchesthe perpetual pastoruniversal science and health the comforter     chapter x  there she standspainted by herself no witness but herself has been allowed to testify she stands there painted by her acts and decorated by her words when she talks she has only a decorative value as a witness either for or against herself for she deals mainly in unsupported assertion and in the rare cases where she puts forward a verifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to anybody else also when she talks she is unstable she wanders she is incurably inconsistent what she says today she contradicts tomorrow  but her acts are consistent they are always faithful to her they never misinterpret her they are a mirror which always reflects her exactly precisely minutely unerringly and always the same to date with only those progressive little natural changes in stature dress complexion mood and carriage that markexteriorlythe march of the years and record the accumulations of experience whileinteriorlythrough all this steady drift of evolution the one essential detail the commanding detail the master detail of the makeup remains as it was in the beginning suffers no change and can suffer none the basis of the character the temperament the disposition that indestructible iron framework upon which the character is built and whose shape it must take and keep throughout life we call it a persons nature  the man who is born stingy can be taught to give liberallywith his hands but not with his heart the man born kind and compassionate can have that disposition crushed down out of sight by embittering experience but if it were an organ the postmortem would find it still in his corpse the man born ambitious of power and glory may live long without finding it out but when the opportunity comes he will know will strike for the largest thing within the limit of his chances at the timeconstable perhapsand will be glad and proud when he gets it and will write home about it but he will not stop with that start his appetite will come again and byandby again and yet again and when he has climbed to police commissioner it will at last begin to dawn upon him that what his napoleon soul wants and was born for is something away higher uphe does not quite know what but circumstance and opportunity will indicate the direction and he will cut a road through and find out  i think mrs eddy was born with a farseeing businesseye but did not know it and with a great organizing and executive talent and did not know it and with a large appetite for power and distinction and did not know it i think the reason that her make did not show up until middle life was that she had general grants luckcircumstance and opportunity did not come her way when she was younger the qualities that were born in her had to wait for circumstance and opportunitybut they were there they were there to stay whether they ever got a chance to fructify or not if they had come early they would have found her ready and competent and theynot shewould have determined what they would set her at and what they would make of her if they had elected to commission her as secondassistant cook in a bankrupt boardinghouse i know the rest of iti know what would have happened she would have owned the boardinghouse within six months she would have had the late proprietor on salary and humping himself as the worldly say she would have had that boardinghouse spewing money like a mint she would have worked the servants and the late landlord up to the limit she would have squeezed the boarders till they wailed and by some mysterious quality born in her she would have kept the affections of certain of the lot whose love and esteem she valued and flung the others down the back area in two years she would own all the boardinghouses in the town in five all the boardinghouses in the state in twenty all the hotels in america in forty all the hotels on the planet and would sit at home with her finger on a button and govern the whole combination as easily as a benchmanager governs a dogshow  it would be a grand thing to see and i feel a kind of disappointmentbut never mind a religion is better and larger and there is more to it and i have not been steeping myself in christian science all these weeks without finding out that the one sensible thing to do with a disappointment is to put it out of your mind and think of something cheerfuler  we outsiders cannot conceive of mrs eddys christian science religion as being a sudden and miraculous birth but only as a growth from a seed planted by circumstances and developed stage by stage by command and compulsion of the same force what the stages were we cannot know but are privileged to guess she may have gotten the mentalhealing idea from quimbyit had been experimented with for ages and was no ones special property for the present for convenience sake let us proceed upon the hypothesis that that was all she got of him and that she put up the rest of the assets herself this will strain us but let us try it in each and all its forms and under all its many names mental healing had had limits always and they were rather narrow onesmrs eddy let us imagine removed the fence abolished the frontiers not by expanding mentalhealing but by absorbing its small bulk into the vaster bulk of christian sciencedivine science the holy ghost the comforterwhich was a quite different and sublimer force and one which had long lain dormant and unemployed  the christian scientist believes that the spirit of god life and love pervades the universe like an atmosphere that whoso will study science and health can get from it the secret of how to inhale that transforming air that to breathe it is to be made new that from the new man all sorrow all care all miseries of the mind vanish away for that only peace contentment and measureless joy can live in that divine fluid that it purifies the body from disease which is a vicious creation of the gross human mind and cannot continue to exist in the presence of the immortal mind the renewing spirit of god  the scientist finds this reasonable natural and not harder to believe than that the disease germ a creature of darkness perishes when exposed to the light of the great suna new revelation of profane science which no one doubts he reminds us that the actinic ray shining upon lupus cures ita horrible disease which was incurable fifteen years ago and had been incurable for ten million years before that this wonder unbelievable by the physicians at first is believed by them now and so he is tranquilly confident that the time is coming when the world will be educated up to a point where it will comprehend and grant that the light of the spirit of god shining unobstructed upon the soul is an actinic ray which can purge both mind and body from disease and set them free and make them whole  it is apparent then that in christian science it is not one mans mind acting upon another mans mind that heals that it is solely the spirit of god that heals that the healers mind performs no office but to convey that force to the patient that it is merely the wire which carries the electric fluid so to speak and delivers the message therefore if these things be true mentalhealing and sciencehealing are separate and distinct processes and no kinship exists between them  to heal the body of its ills and pains is a mighty benefaction but in our day our physicians and surgeons work a thousand miraclesprodigies which would have ranked as miracles fifty years agoand they have so greatly extended their domination over disease that we feel so well protected that we are able to look with a good deal of composure and absence of hysterics upon the claims of new competitors in that field  but there is a mightier benefaction than the healing of the body and that is the healing of the spiritwhich is christian sciences other claim so far as i know so far as i can find out it makes it good personally i have not known a scientist who did not seem serene contented unharassed i have not found an outsider whose observation of scientists furnished him a view that differed from my own buoyant spirits comfort of mind freedom from care these happinesses we all have at intervals but in the spaces between dear me the black hours they have put a curse upon the life of every human being i have ever known young or old i concede not a single exception unless it might be those scientists just referred to they may have been playing a part with me i hope they were not and i believe they were not  time will test the sciences claim if time shall make it good if time shall prove that the science can heal the persecuted spirit of man and banish its troubles and keep it serene and sunny and contentwhy then mrs eddy will have a monument that will reach above the clouds for if she did not hit upon that imperial idea and evolve it and deliver it its discoverer can never be identified with certainty now i think it is the giant feature it is the sun that rides in the zenith of christian science the auxiliary features are of minor consequence let us still leave the large if aside for the present and proceed as if it had no existence  it is not supposable that mrs eddy realized at first the size of her plunder no findthat is the word she did not realize the size of her find at first it had to grow upon her by degrees in accordance with the inalterable custom of circumstance which works by stages and by stages only and never furnishes any mind with all the materials for a large idea at one time  in the beginning mrs eddy was probably interested merely in the mentalhealing detail and perhaps mainly interested in it pecuniary for she was poor  she would succeed in anything she undertook she would attract pupils and her commerce would grow she would inspire in patient and pupil confidence in her earnestness her history is evidence that she would not fail of that  there probably came a time in due course when her students began to think there was something deeper in her teachings than they had been suspectinga mystery beyond mentalhealing and higher it is conceivable that by consequence their manner towards her changed little by little and from respectful became reverent it is conceivable that this would have an influence upon her that it would incline her to wonder if their secret thoughtthat she was inspiredmight not be a wellgrounded guess it is conceivable that as time went on the thought in their minds and its reflection in hers might solidify into conviction  she would remember then that as a child she had been called more than once by a mysterious voicejust as had happened to little samuel mentioned in her autobiography she would be impressed by that ancient reminiscence now and it could have a prophetic meaning for her  it is conceivable that the persuasive influences around her and within her would give a new and powerful impulse to her philosophizings and that from this in time would result that great birth the healing of body and mind by the inpouring of the spirit of godthe central and dominant idea of christian scienceand that when this idea came she would not doubt that it was an inspiration direct from heaven     chapter xi  i must rest a little now to sit here and painstakingly spin out a scheme which imagines mrs eddy of all people working her mind on a plane above commercialism imagines her thinking philosophizing discovering majestic things and even imagines her dealing in sinceritiesto be frank i find it a large contract but i have begun it and i will go through with it     chapter xii  it is evident that she made disciples fast and that their belief in her and in the authenticity of her heavenly ambassadorship was not of the lukewarm and halfway sort but was profoundly earnest and sincere her book was issued from the press in 1875 it began its work of convertmaking and within six years she had successfully launched a new religion and a new system of healing and was teaching them to crowds of eager students in a college of her own at prices so extraordinary that we are almost compelled to accept her statement no her guarded intimation that the rates were arranged on high since a mere human being unacquainted with commerce and accustomed to think in pennies could hardly put up such a hand as that without supernatural help  from this stage onwardmrs eddy being what she wasthe rest of the developmentstages would follow naturally and inevitably  but if she had been anybody else there would have been a different arrangement of them with different results being the extraordinary person she was she realized her position and its possibilities realized the possibilities and had the daring to use them for all they were worth  we have seen what her methods were after she passed the stage where her divine ambassadorship was granted its executer in the hearts and minds of her followers we have seen how steady and fearless and calculated and orderly was her march thenceforth from conquest to conquest we have seen her strike dead without hesitancy any hostile or questionable force that rose in her path first the horde of pretenders that sprang up and tried to take her science and its market away from hershe crushed them she obliterated them when her own national christian science association became great in numbers and influence and loosely and dangerously garrulous and began to expound the doctrines according to its own uninspired notions she took up her sponge without a tremor of fear and wiped that association out when she perceived that the preachers in her pulpits were becoming afflicted with doctrinetinkering she recognized the danger of it and did not hesitate nor temporize but promptly dismissed the whole of them in a day and abolished their office permanently we have seen that as fast as her power grew she was competent to take the measure of it and that as fast as its expansion suggested to her gradually awakening native ambition a higher step she took it and so by this evolutionary process we have seen the gross moneylust relegated to second place and the lust of empire and glory rise above it a splendid dream and by force of the qualities born in her she is making it come true  these qualitiesand the capacities growing out of them by the nurturing influences of training observation and experience seem to be clearly indicated by the character of her career and its achievements they seem to be  a clear head for business and a phenomenally long one clear understanding of business situations accuracy in estimating the opportunities they offer intelligence in planning a business move firmness in sticking to it after it has been decided upon extraordinary daring indestructible persistency devouring ambition limitless selfishness a knowledge of the weaknesses and poverties and docilities of human nature and how to turn them to account which has never been surpassed if ever equalled  andnecessarilythe foundationstone of mrs eddys character is a neverwavering confidence in herself  it is a granite character andquite naturallya measure of the talc of smallnesses common to human nature is mixed up in it and distributed through it when mrs eddy is not dictating servilities from her throne in the clouds to her official domestics in boston or to her farspread subjects round about the planet but is down on the ground she is kin to us and one of us sentimental as a girl garrulous ungrammatical incomprehensible affected vain of her little human ancestry unstable inconsistent unreliable in statement and naively and everlastingly selfcontradictoryoh trivial and common and commonplace as the commonest of us just a napoleon as madame de remusat saw him a brass god with clay legs     chapter xiii  in drawing mrs eddys portrait it has been my purpose to restrict myself to materials furnished by herself and i believe i have done that if i have misinterpreted any of her acts it was not done intentionally  it will be noticed that in skeletonizing a list of the qualities which have carried her to the dizzy summit which she occupies i have not mentioned the power which was the commanding force employed in achieving that lofty flight it did not belong in that list it was a force that was not a detail of her character but was an outside one it was the power which proceeded from her peoples recognition of her as a supernatural personage conveyer of the latest word and divinely commissioned to deliver it to the world the form which such a recognition takes consciously or unconsciously is worship and worship does not question nor criticize it obeys the object of it does not need to coddle it bribe it beguile it reason with it convince itit commands it that is sufficient the obedience rendered is not reluctant but prompt and wholehearted admiration for a napoleon confidence in him pride in him affection for him can lift him high and carry him far and these are forms of worship and are strong forces but they are worship of a mere human being after all and are infinitely feeble as compared with those that are generated by that other worship the worship of a divine personage mrs eddy has this efficient worship this massed and centralized force this force which is indifferent to opposition untroubled by fear and goes to battle singing like cromwells soldiers and while she has it she can command and it will obey and maintain her on her throne and extend her empire  she will have it until she dies and then we shall see a curious and interesting further development of her revolutionary work begin     chapter xiv  the president and board of directors will succeed her and the government will go on without a hitch the bylaws will bear that interpretation all the motherchurchs vast powers are concentrated in that board mrs eddys unlimited personal reservations make the boards ostensible supremacy during her life a sham and the board itself a shadow but mrs eddy has not made those reservations for any one but herselfthey are distinctly personal they bear her name they are not usable by another individual when she dies her reservations die and the boards shadowpowers become real powers without the change of any important bylaw and the board sits in her place as absolute and irresponsible a sovereign as she was  it consists of but five persons a much more manageable cardinalate than the roman popes i think it will elect its pope from its own body and that it will fill its own vacancies an elective papacy is a safe and wise system and a longliver     chapter xv  we may take that up now  it is not a single if but a severaljointed one not an oyster but a vertebrate  1 did mrs eddy borrow from quimby the great idea or only the little one the oldtimer the ordinary mentalhealinghealing by mortal mind  2 if she borrowed the great idea did she carry it away in her head or in manuscript  3 did she hit upon the great idea herself by the great idea i mean of course the conviction that the force involved was still existent and could be applied now just as it was applied by christs disciples and their converts and as successfully  4 did she philosophize it systematize it and write it down in a book  5 was it she and not another that built a new religion upon the book and organized it  i think no 5 can be answered with a yes and dismissed from the controversy and i think that the great idea great as it was would have enjoyed but a brief activity and would then have gone to sleep again for some more centuries but for the perpetuating impulse it got from that organized and tremendous force  as for nos 1 2 and 4 the hostiles contend that mrs eddy got the great idea from quimby and carried it off in manuscript but their testimony while of consequence lacks the most important detail so far as my information goes the quimby manuscript has not been produced i think we cannot discuss no 1 and no 2 profitably let them go  for me no 3 has a mild interest and no 4 a violent one  as regards no 3 mrs eddy was brought up from the cradle an oldtime boileriron westminstercatechism christian and knew her bible as well as captain kydd knew his when he sailed when he sailed and perhaps as sympathetically the great idea had struck a million biblereaders before her as being possible of resurrection and applicationit must have struck as many as that and been cogitated indolently doubtingly then dropped and forgottenand it could have struck her in due course but how it could interest her how it could appeal to herwith her make this a thing that is difficult to understand  for the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful the power through loving mercifulness and compassion to heal fleshly ills and pains and griefallwith a word with a touch of the hand this power was given by the saviour to the disciples and to all the converted allevery one it was exercised for generations afterwards any christian who was in earnest and not a makebelieve not a policychristian not a christian for revenue only had that healing power and could cure with it any disease or any hurt or damage possible to human flesh and bone these things are true or they are not if they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago it would be difficult to satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in christians now  to wish to exercise it could occur to mrs eddybut would it  grasping sordid penurious famishing for everything she seesmoney power gloryvain untruthful jealous despotic arrogant insolent pitiless where thinkers and hypnotists are concerned illiterate shallow incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines immeasurably selfish  of course the great idea could strike her we have to grant that but why it should interest her is a question which can easily overstrain the imagination and bring on nervous prostration or something like that and is better left alone by the judicious it seems to me  unless we call to our help the alleged other side of mrs eddys make and character the side which her multitude of followers see and sincerely believe in fairness requires that their view be stated here it is the opposite of the one which i have drawn from mrs eddys history and from her bylaws to her followers she is this  patient gentle loving compassionate noble hearted unselfish sinless widely cultured splendidly equipped mentally a profound thinker an able writer a divine personage an inspired messenger whose acts are dictated from the throne and whose every utterance is the voice of god  she has delivered to them a religion which has revolutionized their lives banished the glooms that shadowed them and filled them and flooded them with sunshine and gladness and peace a religion which has no hell a religion whose heaven is not put off to another time with a break and a gulf between but begins here and now and melts into eternity as fancies of the waking day melt into the dreams of sleep  they believe it is a christianity that is in the new testament that it has always been there that in the drift of ages it was lost through disuse and neglect and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men turning the night of life into day its terrors into myths its lamentations into songs of emancipation and rejoicing  there we have mrs eddy as her followers see her she has lifted them out of grief and care and doubt and fear and made their lives beautiful she found them wandering forlorn in a wintry wilderness and has led them to a tropic paradise like that of which the poet sings       o islands there are on the face of the deep      where the leaves never fade and the skies never weep  to ask them to examine with a microscope the character of such a benefactor to ask them to examine it at all to ask them to look at a blemish which another person believes he has found in itwell in their place could you do it would you do it wouldnt you be ashamed to do it if a tramp had rescued your child from fire and death and saved its mothers heart from breaking could you see his rags could you smell his breath mrs eddy has done more than that for these people  they are prejudiced witnesses to the credit of human nature it is not possible that they should be otherwise they sincerely believe that mrs eddys character is pure and perfect and beautiful and her history without stain or blot or blemish but that does not settle it they sincerely believe she did not borrow the great idea from quimby but hit upon it herself it may be so and it could be so let it gothere is no way to settle it they believe she carried away no quimby manuscripts let that go toothere is no way to settle it they believe that she and not another built the religion upon the book and organized it i believe it too  finally they believe that she philosophized christian science explained it systematized it and wrote it all out with her own hand in the book science and health  i am not able to believe that let us draw the line there the known and undisputed products of her pen are a formidable witness against her they do seem to me to prove quite clearly and conclusively that writing upon even simple subjects is a difficult labor for her that she has never been able to write anything above thirdrate english that she is weak in the matter of grammar that she has but a rude and dull sense of the values of words that she so lacks in the matter of literary precision that she can seldom put a thought into words that express it lucidly to the reader and leave no doubts in his mind as to whether he has rightly understood or not that she cannot even draught a preface that a person can fully comprehend nor one which can by any art be translated into a fully understandable form that she can seldom inject into a preface even single sentences whose meaning is uncompromisingly clearyet prefaces are her specialty if she has one  mrs eddys known and undisputed writings are very limited in bulk they exhibit no depth no analytical quality no thought above school composition size and but juvenile ability in handling thoughts of even that modest magnitude she has a fine commercial ability and could govern a vast railway system in great style she could draught a set of rules that satan himself would say could not be improved onfor devilish effectivenessby his staff but we know by our excursions among the motherchurchs bylaws that their english would discredit the deputy baggagesmasher i am quite sure that mrs eddy cannot write well upon any subject even a commercial one  in the very first revision of science and health 1883 mrs eddy wrote a preface which is an unimpeachable witness that the rest of the book was written by somebody else i have put it in the appendix along with a page or two taken from the body of the book and will ask the reader to compare the labored and lumbering and confused gropings of this preface with the easy and flowing and direct english of the other exhibit and see if he can believe that the one hand and brain produced both  and let him take the preface apart sentence by sentence and searchingly examine each sentence word by word and see if he can find half a dozen sentences whose meanings he is so sure of that he can rephrase themin words of his ownand reproduce what he takes to be those meanings money can be lost on this game i know for i am the one that lost it  now let the reader turn to the excerpt which i have made from the chapter on prayer last years edition of science and health and compare that wise and sane and elevated and lucid and compact piece of work with the aforesaid preface and with mrs eddys poetry concerning the gymnastic trees and minervas not yet effete sandals and the wreaths imported from eruditions bower for the decoration of plymouth rock and the plaguespot and bacilli and my other exhibits turn back to my chapters i and ii from the autobiography and finally with the late communication concerning me and see if he thinks anybodys affirmation or anybodys sworn testimony or any other testimony of any imaginable kind would ever be likely to convince him that mrs eddy wrote that chapter on prayer  i do not wish to impose my opinion on any one who will not permit it but such as it is i offer it here for what it is worth i cannot believe and i do not believe that mrs eddy originated any of the thoughts and reasonings out of which the book science and health is constructed and i cannot believe and do not believe that she ever wrote any part of that book  i think that if anything in the world stands proven and well and solidly proven by unimpeachable testimonythe treacherous testimony of her own pen in her known and undisputed literary productionsit is that mrs eddy is not capable of thinking upon high planes nor of reasoning clearly nor writing intelligently upon low ones  inasmuch asin my beliefthe very first editions of the book science and health were far above the reach of mrs eddys mental and literary abilities i think she has from the very beginning been claiming as her own another persons book and wearing as her own property laurels rightfully belonging to that personthe real author of science and health and i think the reasonand the only reasonthat he has not protested is because his work was not exposed to print until after he was safely dead  that with an eye to business and by grace of her business talent she has restored to the world neglected and abandoned features of the christian religion which her thousands of followers find gracious and blessed and contenting i recognize and confess but i am convinced that every single detail of the work except just that onethe delivery of the product to the worldwas conceived and performed by another     appendix a  original first preface to science and health  there seems a christian necessity of learning gods power and purpose to heal both mind and body this thought grew out of our early seeking him in all our ways and a hopeless as singular invalidism that drugs increased instead of diminished and hygiene benefited only for a season by degrees we have drifted into more spiritual latitudes of thought and experimented as we advanced until demonstrating fully the power of mind over the body about the year 1862 having heard of a mesmerist in portland who was treating the sick by manipulation we visited him he helped us for a time then we relapsed somewhat after his decease and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful physicians we discovered that the principle of all healing and the law that governs it is god a divine principle and a spiritual not material law and regained health  it was not an individual or mortal mind acting upon another socalled mind that healed us it was the glorious truths of christian science that we discovered as we neared that verge of socalled material life named death yea it was the great shekinah the spirit of life truth and love illuminating our understanding of the action and might of omnipotence the old gentleman to whom we have referred had some very advanced views on healing but he was not avowedly religious neither scholarly we interchanged thoughts on the subject of healing the sick i restored some patients of his that he failed to heal and left in his possession some manuscripts of mine containing corrections of his desultory pennings which i am informed at his decease passed into the hands of a patient of his now residing in scotland he died in 1865 and left no published works the only manuscript that we ever held of his longer than to correct it was one of perhaps a dozen pages most of which we had composed he manipulated the sick hence his ostensible method of healing was physical instead of mental  we helped him in the esteem of the public by our writings but never knew of his stating orally or in writing that he treated his patients mentally never heard him give any directions to that effect and have it from one of his patients who now asserts that he was the founder of mental healing that he never revealed to anyone his method we refer to these facts simply to refute the calumnies and false claims of our enemies that we are preferring dishonest claims to the discovery and founding at this period of metaphysical healing or christian science  the science and laws of a purely mental healing and their method of application through spiritual power alone else a mental argument against disease are our own discovery at this date true the principle is divine and eternal but the application of it to heal the sick had been lost sight of and required to be again spiritually discerned and its science discovered that man might retain it through the understanding since our discovery in 1866 of the divine science of christian healing we have labored with tongue and pen to found this system in this endeavor every obstacle has been thrown in our path that the envy and revenge of a few disaffected students could devise the superstition and ignorance of even this period have not failed to contribute their mite towards misjudging us while its christian advancement and scientific research have helped sustain our feeble efforts  since our first edition of science and health published in 1875 two of the aforesaid students have plagiarized and pirated our works in the issues of e j a almost exclusively ours were thirteen paragraphs without credit taken verbatim from our books  not one of our printed works was ever copied or abstracted from the published or from the unpublished writings of anyone throughout our publications of metaphysical healing or christian science when writing or dictating them we have given ourselves to contemplation wholly apart from the observation of the material senses to look upon a copy would have distracted our thoughts from the subject before us we were seldom able to copy our own compositions and have employed an amanuensis for the last six years every work that we have had published has been extemporaneously written and out of fifty lectures and sermons that we have delivered the last year fortyfour have been extemporaneous we have distributed many of our unpublished manuscripts loaned to one of our youngest students r ky between three and four hundred pages of which we were sole authorgiving him liberty to copy but not to publish them  leaning on the sustaining infinite with loving trust the trials of today grow brief and tomorrow is big with blessings  the wakeful shepherd tending his flocks beholds from the mountains top the first faint morning beam ere cometh the risen day so from souls loftier summits shines the pale star to prophetshepherd and it traverses night over to where the young child lies in cradled obscurity that shall waken a world over the night of error dawn the morning beams and guiding star of truth and the wise men are led by it to science which repeats the eternal harmony that it reproduced in proof of immortality the time for thinkers has come and the time for revolutions ecclesiastical and civil must come truth independent of doctrines or timehonored systems stands at the threshold of history contentment with the past or the cold conventionality of custom may no longer shut the door on science though empires fall he whose right it is shall reign ignorance of god should no longer be the steppingstone to faith understanding him whom to know aright is life eternal is the only guaranty of obedience  this volume may not open a new thought and make it at once familiar it has the sturdy task of a pioneer to hack away at the tall oaks and cut the rough granite leaving future ages to declare what it has done we made our first discovery of the adaptation of metaphysics to the treatment of disease in the winter of 1866 since then we have tested the principle on ourselves and others and never found it to fail to prove the statements herein made of it we must learn the science of life to reach the perfection of man to understand god as the principle of all being and to live in accordance with this principle is the science of life but to reproduce this harmony of being the error of personal sense must yield to science even as the science of music corrects tones caught from the ear and gives the sweet concord of sound there are many theories of physic and theology and many calls in each of their directions for the right way but we propose to settle the question of what is truth on the ground of proof and let that method of healing the sick and establishing christianity be adopted that is found to give the most health and to make the best christians science will then have a fair field in which case we are assured of its triumph over all opinions and beliefs sickness and sin have ever had their doctors but the question is have they become less because of them the longevity of our antediluvians would say no and the criminal records of today utter their voices little in favor of such a conclusion not that we would deny to caesar the things that are his but that we ask for the things that belong to truth and safely affirm from the demonstrations we have been able to make that the science of man understood would have eradicated sin sickness and death in a less period than six thousand years we find great difficulties in starting this work right some shockingly false claims are already made to a metaphysical practice mesmerism its very antipodes is one of them hitherto we have never in a single instance of our discovery found the slightest resemblance between mesmerism and metaphysics no especial idiosyncrasy is requisite to acquire a knowledge of metaphysical healing spiritual sense is more important to its discernment than the intellect and those who would learn this science without a high moral standard of thought and action will fail to understand it until they go up higher owing to our explanations constantly vibrating between the same points an irksome repetition of words must occur also the use of capital letters genders and technicalities peculiar to the science variety of language or beauty of diction must give place to close analysis and unembellished thought hoping all things enduring all things to do good to our enemies to bless them that curse us and to bear to the sorrowing and the sick consolation and healing we commit these pages to posterity  mary baker g eddy     appendix b  the gospel narratives bear brief testimony even to the life of our great master his spiritual noumenon and phenomenon silenced portraiture writers less wise than the apostles essayed in the apocryphal new testament a legendary and traditional history of the early life of jesus but saint paul summarized the character of jesus as the model of christianity in these words consider him who endured such contradictions of sinners against himself who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god  it may be that the mortal life battle still wages and must continue till its involved errors are vanquished by victorybringing science but this triumph will come god is over all he alone is our origin aim and being the real man is not of the dust nor is he ever created through the flesh for his father and mother are the one spirit and his brethren are all the children of one parent the eternal good  any kind of literary composition was excessively difficult for mrs eddy she found it grinding hard work to dig out anything to say she realized at the above stage in her life that with all her trouble she had not been able to scratch together even material enough for a childs autobiography and also that what she had secured was in the main not valuable not important considering the age and the fame of the person she was writing about and so it occurred to her to attempt in that paragraph to excuse the meagreness and poor quality of the feast she was spreading by letting on that she could do ever so much better if she wanted to but was under constraint of divine etiquette to feed with more than a few indifferent crumbs a plebeian appetite for personal details about personages in her class was not the correct thing and she blandly points out that there is precedent for this reserve when mrs eddy tries to be artfulin literatureit is generally after the manner of the ostrich and with the ostrichs luck please try to find the connection between the two paragraphsm t     appendix c  the following is the spiritual signification of the lords prayer  principle eternal and harmonious nameless and adorable intelligence thou art ever present and supreme and when this supremacy of spirit shall appear the dream of matter will disappear give us the understanding of truth and love and loving we shall learn god and truth will destroy all error and lead us unto the life that is soul and deliver us from the errors of sense sin sickness and death for god is life truth and love for everscience and health edition of 1881  it seems to me that this one is distinctly superior to the one that was inspired for last years edition it is strange but to my mind plain that inspiring is an art which does not improve with practicem t     appendix d  for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them  your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask himchrist jesus  the prayer that reclaims the sinner and heals the sick is an absolute faith that all things are possible to goda spiritual understanding of himan unselfed love regardless of what another may say or think on this subject i speak from experience this prayer combined with selfsacrifice and toil is the means whereby god has enabled me to do what i have done for the religion and health of mankind  thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine mind desire is prayer and no less can occur from trusting god with our desires that they may be moulded and exalted before they take form in audible word and in deeds  what are the motives for prayer do we pray to make ourselves better or to benefit those that hear us to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of men are we benefited by praying yes the desire which goes forth hungering after righteousness is blessed of our father and it does not return unto us void  god is not moved by the breath of praise to do more than he has already done nor can the infinite do less than bestow all good since he is unchanging wisdom and love we can do more for ourselves by humble fervent petitions but the allloving does not grant them simply on the ground of lipservice for he already knows all  prayer cannot change the science of being but it does bring us into harmony with it goodness reaches the demonstration of truth a request that another may work for us never does our work the habit of pleading with the divine mind as one pleads with a human being perpetuates the belief in god as humanly circumscribedan error which impedes spiritual growth  god is love can we ask him to be more god is intelligence can we inform the infinite mind or tell him anything he does not already comprehend do we hope to change perfection shall we plead for more at the open fount which always pours forth more than we receive the unspoken prayer does bring us nearer the source of all existence and blessedness  asking god to be god is a vain repetition god is the same yesterday and today and forever and he who is immutably right will do right without being reminded of his province the wisdom of man is not sufficient to warrant him in advising god  who would stand before a blackboard and pray the principle of mathematics to work out the problem the rule is already established and it is our task to work out the solution shall we ask the divine principle of all goodness to do his own work his work is done and we have only to avail ourselves of gods rule in order to receive the blessing thereof  the divine being must be reflected by manelse man is not the image and likeness of the patient tender and true the one altogether lovely but to understand god is the work of eternity and demands absolute concentration of thought and energy  how empty are our conceptions of deity we admit theoretically that god is good omnipotent omnipresent infinite and then we try to give information to this infinite mind and plead for unmerited pardon and a liberal outpouring of benefactions are we really grateful for the good already received then we shall avail ourselves of the blessings we have and thus be fitted to receive more gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of thanks action expresses more gratitude than speech  if we are ungrateful for life truth and love and yet return thanks to god for all blessings we are insincere and incur the sharp censure our master pronounces on hypocrites in such a case the only acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and remember our blessings while the heart is far from divine truth and love we cannot conceal the ingratitude of barren lives for god knoweth all things  what we most need is the prayer of fervent desire for growth in grace expressed in patience meekness love and good deeds to keep the commandments of our master and follow his example is our proper debt to him and the only worthy evidence of our gratitude for all he has done outward worship is not of itself sufficient to express loyal and heartfelt gratitude since he has said if ye love me keep my commandments  the habitual struggle to be always good is unceasing prayer its motives are made manifest in the blessings they bringwhich if not acknowledged in audible words attest our worthiness to be made partakers of love  simply asking that we may love god will never make us love him but the longing to be better and holierexpressed in daily watchfulness and in striving to assimilate more of the divine characterthis will mould and fashion us anew until we awake in his likeness we reach the science of christianity through demonstration of the divine nature but in this wicked world goodness will be evil spoken of and patience must work experience  audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual understanding which regenerates but silent prayer watchfulness and devout obedience enable us to follow jesus example long prayers ecclesiasticism and creeds have clipped the divine pinions of love and clad religion in human robes they materialize worship hinder the spirit and keep man from demonstrating his power over error  sorrow for wrongdoing is but one step towards reform and the very easiest step the next and great step required by wisdom is the test of our sinceritynamely reformation to this end we are placed under the stress of circumstances temptation bids us repeat the offence and woe comes in return for what is done so it will ever be till we learn that there is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay the uttermost farthing the measure ye mete shall be measured to you again and it will be full and running over  saints and sinners get their full award but not always in this world the followers of christ drank his cup ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim but god pours the riches of his love into the understanding and affections giving us strength according to our day sinners flourish like a green baytree but looking farther the psalmist could see their endnamely the destruction of sin through suffering  prayer is sometimes used as a confessional to cancel sin this error impedes true religion sin is forgiven only as it is destroyed by christtruth and life if prayer nourishes the belief that sin is cancelled and that man is made better by merely praying it is an evil he grows worse who continues in sin because he thinks himself forgiven  an apostle says that the son of god christ came to destroy the works of the devil we should follow our divine exemplar and seek the destruction of all evil works error and disease included we cannot escape the penalty due for sin the scriptures say that if we deny christ he also will deny us  the divine love corrects and governs man men may pardon but this divine principle alone reforms the sinner god is not separate from the wisdom he bestows the talents he gives we must improve calling on him to forgive our work badly done or left undone implies the vain supposition that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon and that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence  to cause suffering as the result of sin is the means of destroying sin every supposed pleasure in sin will furnish more than its equivalent of pain until belief in material life and sin is destroyed to reach heaven the harmony of being we must understand the divine principle of being  god is love more than this we cannot ask higher we cannot look farther we cannot go to suppose that god forgives or punishes sin according as his mercy is sought or unsought is to misunderstand love and make prayer the safetyvalve for wrongdoing  jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it out of a sick woman he said that satan had bound her and to peter he said thou art an offense unto me he came teaching and showing men how to destroy sin sickness and death he said of the fruitless tree it is hewn down  it is believed by many that a certain magistrate who lived in the time of jesus left this record his rebuke is fearful the strong language of our master confirms this description  the only civil sentence which he had for error was get thee behind me satan still stronger evidence that jesus reproof was pointed and pungent is in his own wordsshowing the necessity for such forcible utterance when he cast out devils and healed the sick and sinful the relinquishment of error deprives material sense of its false claims  audible prayer is impressive it gives momentary solemnity and elevation to thought but does it produce any lasting benefit looking deeply into these things we find that a zeal not according to knowledge gives occasion for reaction unfavorable to spiritual growth sober resolve and wholesome perception of gods requirements the motives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of applause to induce or encourage christian sentiment  physical sensation not soul produces material ecstasy and emotions if spiritual sense always guided men at such times there would grow out of those ecstatic moments a higher experience and a better life with more devout selfabnegation and purity a selfsatisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes a christian god is not influenced by man the divine ear is not an auditorial nerve it is the allhearing and allknowing mind to whom each want of man is always known and by whom it will be supplied  the danger from audible prayer is that it may lead us into temptation by it we may become involuntary hypocrites uttering desires which are not real and consoling ourselves in the midst of sin with the recollection that we have prayed over itor mean to ask forgiveness at some later day hypocrisy is fatal to religion  a wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of selfjustification though it makes the sinner a hypocrite we never need despair of an honest heart but there is little hope for those who only come spasmodically face to face with their wickedness and then seek to hide it their prayers are indexes which do not correspond with their character they hold secret fellowship with sin and such externals are spoken of by jesus as like unto whited sepulchres full of all uncleanness  if a man though apparently fervent and prayerful is impure and therefore insincere what must be the comment upon him if he had reached the loftiness of his prayer there would be no occasion for such comment if we feel the aspiration humility gratitude and love which our words expressthis god accepts and it is wise not to try to deceive ourselves or others for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed professions and audible prayers are like charity in one respectthey cover a multitude of sins praying for humility with whatever fervency of expression does not always mean a desire for it if we turn away from the poor we are not ready to receive the reward of him who blesses the poor we confess to having a very wicked heart and ask that it may be laid bare before us but do we not already know more of this heart than we are willing to have our neighbor see  we ought to examine ourselves and learn what is the affection and purpose of the heart for this alone can show us what we honestly are if a friend informs us of a fault do we listen to the rebuke patiently and credit what is said do we not rather give thanks that we are not as other men during many years the author has been most grateful for merited rebuke the sting lies in unmerited censurein the falsehood which does no one any good  the test of all prayer lies in the answer to these questions do we love our neighbor better because of this asking do we pursue the old selfishness satisfied with having prayed for something better though we give no evidence of the sincerity of our requests by living consistently with our prayer if selfishness has given place to kindness we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly and bless them that curse us but we shall never meet this great duty by simply asking that it may be done there is a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition of our hope and faith  dost thou love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this command includes mucheven the surrender of all merely material sensation affection and worship this is the el dorado of christianity it involves the science of life and recognizes only the divine control of spirit wherein soul is our master and material sense and human will have no place  are you willing to leave all for christ for truth and so be counted among sinners no do you really desire to attain this point no then why make long prayers about it and ask to be christians since you care not to tread in the footsteps of our dear master if unwilling to follow his example wherefore pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his nature consistent prayer is the desire to do right prayer means that we desire to and will walk in the light so far as we receive it even though with bleeding footsteps and waiting patiently on the lord will leave our real desires to be rewarded by him  the world must grow to the spiritual understanding of prayer if good enough to profit by jesus cup of earthly sorrows god will sustain us under these sorrows until we are thus divinely qualified and willing to drink his cup millions of vain repetitions will never pour into prayer the unction of spirit in demonstration of power and with signs following christian science reveals a necessity for overcoming the world the flesh and evil and thus destroying all error  seeking is not sufficient it is striving which enables us to enter spiritual attainments open the door to a higher understanding of the divine life  one of the forms of worship in thibet is to carry a prayingmachine through the streets and stop at the doors to earn a penny by grinding out a prayer whereas civilization pays for clerical prayers in lofty edifices is the difference very great after all  experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask for in prayer  there is some misapprehension of the source and means of all goodness and blessedness or we should certainly receive what we ask for the scriptures say ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts what we desire and ask for it is not always best for us to receive in this case infinite love will not grant the request do you ask wisdom to be merciful and not punish sin then ye ask amiss without punishment sin would multiply jesus prayer forgive us our debts specified also the terms of forgiveness when forgiving the adulterous woman he said go and sin no more  a magistrate sometimes remits the penalty but this may be no moral benefit to the criminal and at best it only saves him from one form of punishment the moral law which has the right to acquit or condemn always demands restitution before mortals can go up higher broken law brings penalty in order to compel this progress  mere legal pardon and there is no other for divine principle never pardons our sins or mistakes till they are corrected leaves the offender free to repeat the offense if indeed he has not already suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it with loathing truth bestows no pardon upon error but wipes it out in the most effectual manner jesus suffered for our sins not to annul the divine sentence against an individuals sin but to show that sin must bring inevitable suffering  petitions only bring to mortals the results of their own faith we know that a desire for holiness is requisite in order to gain it but if we desire holiness above all else we shall sacrifice everything for it we must be willing to do this that we may walk securely in the only practical road to holiness prayer alone cannot change the unalterable truth or give us an understanding of it but prayer coupled with a fervent habitual desire to know and do the will of god will bring us into all truth such a desire has little need of audible expression it is best expressed in thought and life     appendix e  reverend heber newton on christian science  to begin then at the beginning christian science accepts the work of healing sickness as an integral part of the discipleship of jesus christ in christ it finds what the church has always recognized theoretically though it has practically ignored the factthe great physician that christ healed the sick we none of us question it stands plainly upon the record this ministry of healing was too large a part of his work to be left out from any picture of that life such service was not an incident of his careerit was an essential element of that career it was an integral factor in his mission the evangelists leave us no possibility of confusion on this point coequal with his work of instruction and inspiration was his work of healing  the records make it equally clear that the master laid his charge upon his disciples to do as he had done when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease in sending them forth he commanded them saying as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out demons  that the twelve disciples undertook to do the masters work of healing and that they in their measure succeeded seems beyond question they found in themselves the same power that the master found in himself and they used it as he had used his power the record of the acts of the apostles if at all trustworthy history shows that they too healed the sick  beyond the circle of the original twelve it is equally clear that the early disciples believed themselves charged with the same mission and that they sought to fulfil it the records of the early church make it indisputable that powers of healing were recognized as among the gifts of the spirit st pauls letters render it certain that these gifts were not a privilege of the original twelve merely but that they were the heritage into which all the disciples entered  beyond the era of the primitive church through several generations the early christians felt themselves called to the same ministry of healing and enabled with the same secret of power through wellnigh three centuries the gifts of healing appear to have been more or less recognized and exercised in the church through those generations however there was a gradual disuse of this power following upon a failing recognition of its possession that which was originally the rule became the exception by degrees the sense of authority and power to heal passed out from the consciousness of the church it ceased to be a sign of the indwelling spirit for fifteen centuries the recognition of this authority and power has been altogether exceptional here and there through the history of these centuries there have been those who have entered into this belief of their own privilege and duty and have used the gift which they recognized the church has never been left without a line of witnesses to this aspect of the discipleship of christ but she has come to accept it as the normal order of things that what was once the rule in the christian church should be now only the exception orthodoxy has framed a theory of the words of jesus to account for this strange departure of his church from them it teaches us to believe that his example was not meant to be followed in this respect by all his disciples the power of healing which was in him was a purely exceptional power it was used as an evidence of his divine mission it was a miraculous gift the gift of working miracles was not bestowed upon his church at large his original disciples the twelve apostles received this gift as a necessity of the critical epoch of christianitythe founding of the church traces of the power lingered on in weakening activity until they gradually ceased and the normal condition of the church was entered upon in which miracles are no longer possible   we accept this unconsciously as the true state of things in christianity but it is a conception which will not bear a moments examination there is not the slightest suggestion upon record that christ set any limit to this charge which he gave his disciples on the contrary there are not lacking hints that he looked for the possession and exercise of this power wherever his spirit breathed in men  even if the concluding paragraph of st marks gospel were a later appendix it may none the less have been a faithful echo of words of the master as it certainly is a trustworthy record of the belief of the early christians as to the thought of jesus concerning his followers in that interesting passage jesus after his death appeared to the eleven and formally commissioned them again to take up his work in the world bidding them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and these signs he tells them shall follow them that believenot the apostles only but them that believe without limit of time in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the concluding discourse to the disciples recorded in the gospel according to st john affirms the same expectation on the part of jesus emphasizing it in his solemn way verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do     appendix f  few will deny that an intelligence apart from man formed and governs the spiritual universe and man and this intelligence is the eternal mind and neither matter nor man created this intelligence and divine principle nor can this principle produce aught unlike itself all that we term sin sickness and death is comprised in the belief of matter the realm of the real is spiritual the opposite of spirit is matter and the opposite of the real is unreal or material matter is an error of statement for there is no matter this error of premises leads to error of conclusion in every statement of matter as a basis nothing we can say or believe regarding matter is true except that matter is unreal simply a belief that has its beginning and ending  the conservative firm called matter and mind god never formed the unerring and eternal mind destroys this imaginary copartnership formed only to be dissolved in a manner and at a period unknown this copartnership is obsolete placed under the microscope of metaphysics matter disappears only by understanding there are not two matter and mind is a logical and correct conclusion obtained by either one science gathers not grapes of thorns or figs of thistles intelligence never produced nonintelligence such as matter the immortal never produced mortality good never resulted in evil the science of mind shows conclusively that matter is a myth metaphysics are above physics and drag not matter or what is termed that into one of its premises or conclusions metaphysics resolves things into thoughts and exchanges the objects of sense for the ideas of soul these ideas are perfectly tangible and real to consciousness and they have this advantagethey are eternal mind and its thoughts comprise the whole of god the universe and of man reason and revelation coincide with this statement and support its proof every hour for nothing is harmonious or eternal that is not spiritual the realization of this will bring out objects from a higher source of thought hence more beautiful and immortal  the fact of spiritualization produces results in striking contrast to the farce of materialization the one produces the results of chastity and purity the other the downward tendencies and earthward gravitation of sensualism and impurity  the exalting and healing effects of metaphysics show their fountain nothing in pathology has exceeded the application of metaphysics through mind alone we have prevented disease and preserved health in cases of chronic and acute diseases in their severest forms we have changed the secretions renewed structure and restored health have elongated shortened limbs relaxed rigid muscles made cicatrized joints supple restored carious bones to healthy conditions renewed that which is termed the lost substance of the lungs and restored healthy organizations where disease was organic instead of functional     mrs eddy in error  i feel almost sure that mrs eddys inspirationworks are getting out of repair i think so because they made some errors in a statement which she uttered through the press on the 17th of january not large ones perhaps still it is a friends duty to straighten such things out and get them right when he can therefore i will put my other duties aside for a moment and undertake this helpful service she said as follows  in view of the circulation of certain criticisms from the pen of mark twain i submit the following statement  it is a fact well understood that i begged the students who first gave me the endearing appellative mother not to name me thus but without my consent that word spread like wildfire i still must think the name is not applicable to me i stand in relation to this century as a christian discoverer founder and leader i regard selfdeification as blasphemous i may be more loved but i am less lauded pampered provided for and cheered than others before meand wherefore because christian science is not yet popular and i refuse adulation  my visit to the motherchurch after it was built and dedicated pleased me and the situation was satisfactory the dear members wanted to greet me with escort and the ringing of bells but i declined and went alone in my carriage to the church entered it and knelt in thanks upon the steps of its altar there the foresplendor of the beginnings of truth fell mysteriously upon my spirit i believe in one christ teach one christ know of but one christ i believe in but one incarnation one mother mary and know i am not that one and never claimed to be it suffices me to learn the science of the scriptures relative to this subject  christian scientists have no quarrel with protestants catholics or any other sect they need to be understood as following the divine principle god love and not imagined to be unscientific worshippers of a human being  in the aforesaid article of which i have seen only extracts mark twains wit was not wasted in certain directions christian science eschews divine rights in human beings if the individual governed human consciousness my statement of christian science would be disproved but to understand the spiritual idea is essential to demonstrate science and its pure monotheismone god one christ no idolatry no human propaganda jesus taught and proved that what feeds a few feeds all his lifework subordinated the material to the spiritual and he left this legacy of truth to mankind his metaphysics is not the sport of philosophy religion or science rather it is the pith and finale of them all  i have not the inspiration or aspiration to be a first or second virginmotherher duplicate antecedent or subsequent what i am remains to be proved by the good i do we need much humility wisdom and love to perform the functions of foreshadowing and foretasting heaven within us this glory is molten in the furnace of affliction  she still thinks the name of our mother not applicable to her and she is also able to remember that it distressed her when it was conferred upon her and that she begged to have it suppressed her memory is at fault here if she will take her bylaws and refer to section 1 of article xxii written with her own handshe will find that she has reserved that title to herself and is so pleased with it and somay we say jealousabout it that she threatens with excommunication any sister scientist who shall call herself by it this is that section 1  the title of mother in the year 1895 loyal christian scientists had given to the author of their textbook the founder of christian science the individual endearing term of mother therefore if a student of christian science shall apply this title either to herself or to others except as the term for kinship according to the flesh it shall be regarded by the church as an indication of disrespect for their pastor emeritus and unfitness to be a member of the motherchurch  mrs eddy is herself the motherchurchits powers and authorities are in her possession solelyand she can abolish that title whenever it may please her to do so she has only to command her people wherever they may be in the earth to use it no more and it will never be uttered again she is aware of this  it may be that she refuses adulation when she is not awake but when she is awake she encourages it and propagates it in that museum called our mothers room in her church in boston she could abolish that institution with a word if she wanted to she is aware of that i will say a further word about the museum presently  further down the column her memory is unfaithful again  i believe in but one mother mary and know i am not that one and never claimed to be  at a session of the national christian science association held in the city of new york on the 27th of may 1890 the secretary was instructed to send to our mother greetings and words of affection from her assembled children  her telegraphic response was read to the association at next days meeting  all hail he hath filled the hungry with good things and the sick hath he not sent empty awaymother mary  which mother mary is this one are there two if so she is both of them for when she signed this telegram in this satisfied and unprotesting way the mothertitle which she was going to so strenuously object to and put from her with humility and seize with both hands and reserve as her sole property and protect her monopoly of it with a stern bylaw while recognizing with diffidence that it was not applicable to her then and todaythat mothertitle was not yet born and would not be offered to her until five years later the date of the above mother mary is 1890 the individual endearing title of mother was given her in 1895according to her own testimony see her bylaw quoted above  in his opening address to that convention of 1890 the president recognized this maryour maryand abolished all previous ones he said  there is but one moses one jesus and there is but one mary  the confusions being now dispersed we have this clarified result  were had been a moses at one time and only one there had been a jesus at one time and only one there is a mary and only one she is not a has been she is an isthe author of science and health and we cannot ignore her  1 in 1890 there was but one mother mary the president said so 2 mrs eddy was that one she said so in signing the telegram 3 mrs eddy was not that one for she says so in her associated press utterance of january 17th 4 and has never claimed to be that oneunless the signature to the telegram is a claim  thus it stands proven and established that she is that mary and isnt and thought she was and knows she wasnt that much is clear  she is also the mother by the election of 1895 and did not want the title and thinks it is not applicable to her end will excommunicate any one that tries to take it away from her so that is clear  i think that the only really troublesome confusion connected with these particular matters has arisen from the name mary much vexation much misunderstanding could have been avoided if mrs eddy had used some of her other names in place of that one mother mary was certain to stir up discussion it would have been much better if she had signed the telegram mother baker then there would have been no biblical competition and of course that is a thing to avoid but it is not too late yet  i wish to break in here with a parenthesis and then take up this examination of mrs eddys claim of january 17th again  the history of her mother mary telegramas told to me by one who ought to be a very good authorityis curious and interesting the telegram ostensibly quotes verse 53 from the magnificat but really makes some pretty formidable changes in it this is st lukes version  he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away  this is mother marys telegraphed version  he hath filled the hungry with good things and the sick hath he not sent empty away  to judge by the official report the bursting of this bombshell in that massed convention of trained christians created no astonishment since it caused no remark and the business of the convention went tranquilly on thereafter as if nothing had happened  did those people detect those changes we cannot know i think they must have noticed them the wording of st lukes verse being as familiar to all christians as is the wording of the beatitudes and i think that the reason the new version provoked no surprise and no comment was that the assemblage took it for a keya spiritualized explanation of verse 53 newly sent down from heaven through mrs eddy for all scientists study their bibles diligently and they know their magnificat i believe that their confidence in the authenticity of mrs eddys inspirations is so limitless and so firmly established that no change however violent which she might make in a bible text could disturb their composure or provoke from them a protest  her improved rendition of verse 53 went into the conventions report and appeared in a new york paper the next day the at that time scientist whom i mentioned a minute ago and who had not been present at the convention saw it and marvelled marvelled and was indignantindignant with the printer or the telegrapher for making so careless and so dreadful an error and greatly distressed too for of course the newspaper people would fall foul of it and be sarcastic and make fun of it and have a blithe time over it and be properly thankful for the chance it shows how innocent he was it shows that he did not know the limitations of newspaper men in the matter of biblical knowledge the new verse 53 raised no insurrection in the press in fact it was not even remarked upon i could have told him the boys would not know there was anything the matter with it i have been a newspaper man myself and in those days i had my limitations like the others  the scientist hastened to concord and told mrs eddy what a disastrous mistake had been made but he found to his bewilderment that she was tranquil about it and was not proposing to correct it he was not able to get her to promise to make a correction he asked her secretary if he had heard aright when the telegram was dictated to him the secretary said he had and took the filed copy of it and verified its authenticity by comparing it with the stenographic notes  mrs eddy did make the correction two months later in her official organ it attracted no attention among the scientists and naturally none elsewhere for that periodicals circulation was practically confined to disciples of the cult  that is the tale as it was told to me by an exscientist verse 53renovated and spiritualizedhad a narrow escape from a tremendous celebrity the newspaper men would have made it as famous as the assassination of caesar but for their limitations  to return to the claim i find myself greatly embarrassed by mrs eddys remark i regard selfdeification as blasphemous if she is right about that i have written a halfream of manuscript this past week which i must not print either in the book which i am writing or elsewhere for it goes into that very matter with extensive elaboration citing in detail words and acts of mrs eddys which seem to me to prove that she is a faithful and untiring worshipper of herself and has carried selfdeification to a length which has not been before ventured in ages if ever there is not room enough in this chapter for that survey but i can epitomize a portion of it here  with her own untaught and untrained mind and without outside help she has erected upon a firm and lasting foundation the most minutely perfect and wonderful and smoothly and exactly working and best safeguarded system of government that has yet been devised in the world as i believe and as i am sure i could prove if i had room for my documentary evidences here  it is a despotism on this democratic soil a sovereignty more absolute than the roman papacy more absolute than the russian czarship it has not a single power not a shred of authority legislative or executive which is not lodged solely in the sovereign all its dreams its functions its energies have a single object a single reason for existing and only the oneto build to the sky the glory of the sovereign and keep it bright to the end of time  mrs eddy is the sovereign she devised that great place for herself she occupies that throne  in 1895 she wrote a little primer a little body of autocratic laws called the manual of the first church of christ scientist and put those laws in force in permanence her government is all there all in that deceptively innocentlooking little book that cunning little devilish book that slumbering little brown volcano with hell in its bowels in that book she has planned out her system and classified and defined its purposes and powers     main parts of the machine  a supreme church at boston branch churches all over the world one pastor for the whole of them to wit her book science and health term of the books officeforever  in every cs pulpit two readers a man and a woman no talkers no preachers in any churchreaders only readers of the bible and her booksno others no commentators allowed to write or print  a church service she has framed itfor all the cs churchesselected its readings its prayers and the hymns to be used and has appointed the order of procedure no changes permitted  a creed she wrote it all cs churches must subscribe to it no other permitted  a treasury at boston she carries the key  a cs bookpublishing house for books approved by her no others permitted  journals and magazines these are organs of hers and are controlled by her  a college for teaching cs     distribution of the machines powers and dignities  supreme church pastor emeritusmrs eddy board of directors board of education board of finance college faculty various committees treasurer clerk first members of the supreme church members of the supreme church  it looks fair it looks real but it is all a fiction  even the little pastor emeritus is a fiction instead of being merely an honorary and ornamental official mrs eddy is the only official in the entire body that has the slightest power in her manual she has provided a prodigality of ways and forms whereby she can rid herself of any functionary in the government whenever she wants to the officials are all shadows save herself she is the only reality she allows no one to hold office more than a yearno one gets a chance to become overpopular or overuseful and dangerous excommunication is the favorite penaltyit is threatened at every turn it is evidently the pet dread and terror of the churchs membership  the member who thinks without getting his thought from mrs eddy before uttering it is banished permanently one or two kinds of sinners can plead their way back into the fold but this one never to thinkin the supreme churchis the new unpardonable sin  to nearly every severe and fierce rule mrs eddy adds this rivet this bylaw shall not be changed without the consent of the pastor emeritus  mrs eddy is the entire supreme church in her own person in the matter of powers and authorities  although she has provided so many ways of getting rid of unsatisfactory members and officials she was still afraid she might have left a lifepreserver lying around somewhere therefore she devised a rule to cover that defect by applying it she can excommunicate and this is perpetual again every functionary connected with the supreme church and every one of the twentyfive thousand members of that church at an hours noticeand do it all by herself without anybodys help  by authority of this astonishing bylaw she has only to say a person connected with that church is secretly practicing hypnotism or mesmerism whereupon immediate excommunication without a hearing is his portion she does not have to order a trial and produce evidenceher accusation is all that is necessary  where is the pope and where the czar as the ballad says       ask of the winds that far away      with fragments strewed the sea  the branch churchs pulpit is occupied by two readers without them the branch church is as dead as if its throat had been cut to have control then of the readers is to have control of the branch churches mrs eddy has that controla control wholly without limit a control shared with no one  1 no reader can be appointed to any church in the christian science world without her express approval  2 she can summarily expel from his or her place any reader at home or abroad by a mere letter of dismissal over her signature and without furnishing any reason for it to either the congregation or the reader  thus she has as absolute control over all branch churches as she has over the supreme church this power exceeds the popes  in simple truth she is the only absolute sovereign in all christendom the authority of the other sovereigns has limits hers has none none whatever and her yoke does not fret does not offend many of the subjects of the other monarchs feel their yoke and are restive under it their loyalty is insincere it is not so with this ones human property their loyalty is genuine earnest sincere enthusiastic the sentiment which they feel for her is one which goes out in sheer perfection to no other occupant of a throne for it is love pure from doubt envy exaction faultseeking a love whose sun has no spotthat form of love strong great uplifting limitless whose vast proportions are compassable by no word but one the prodigious word worship and it is not as a human being that her subjects worship her but as a supernatural one a divine one one who has comradeship with god and speaks by his voice  mrs eddy has herself created all these personal grandeurs and autocracieswith others which i have not in this article mentioned they place her upon an alpine solitude and supremacy of power and spectacular show not hitherto attained by any other selfseeking enslaver disguised in the christian name and they persuade me that although she may regard selfdeification as blasphemous she is as fond of it as i am of pie  she knows about our mothers room in the supreme church in bostonabove referred tofor she has been in it in a recently published north american review article i quoted a lady as saying mrs eddys portrait could be seen there in a shrine lit by alwaysburning lights and that cs disciples came and worshiped it that remark hurt the feelings of more than one scientist they said it was not true and asked me to correct it i comply with pleasure whether the portrait was there four years ago or not it is not there now for i have inquired the only object in the shrine now and lit by electricsand worshipedis an oilportrait of the horsehair chair mrs eddy used to sit in when she was writing science and health it seems to me that adulation has struck bottom here  mrs eddy knows about that she has been there she has seen it she has seen the worshippers she could abolish that sarcasm with a word she withholds the word once more i seem to recognize in her exactly the same appetite for selfdeification that i have for pie we seem to be curiously alike for the love of selfdeification is really only the spiritual form of the material appetite for pie and nothing could be more strikingly christianscientifically harmonious  i note this phrase  christian science eschews divine rights in human beings  rights is vague i do not know what it means there mrs eddy is not well acquainted with the english language and she is seldom able to say in it what she is trying to say she has no ear for the exact word and does not often get it rights does it mean honors attributes  eschews this is another umbrella where there should be a torch it does not illumine the sentence it only deepens the shadows does she mean denies refuses forbids or something in that line does she mean  christian science denies divine honors to human beings or  christian science refuses to recognize divine attributes in human beings or  christian science forbids the worship of human beings  the bulk of the succeeding sentence is to me a tunnel but when i emerge at this end of it i seem to come into daylight then i seem to understand both sentenceswith this result  christian science recognizes but one god forbids the worship of human beings and refuses to recognize the possession of divine attributes by any member of the race  i am subject to correction but i think that that is about what mrs eddy was intending to convey has her englishwhich is always difficult to mebeguiled me into misunderstanding the following remark which she makes calling herself we after an old regal fashion of hers in her preface to her miscellaneous writings  while we entertain decided views as to the best method for elevating the race physically morally and spiritually and shall express these views as duty demands we shall claim no especial gift from our divine organ no supernatural power  was she meaning to say  although i am of divine origin and gifted with supernatural power i shall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of elevating the race  if she had left out the word our she might then seem to say  i claim no especial or unusual degree of divine origin  which is awkwardmost awkward for one either has a divine origin or hasnt shares in it degrees of it are surely impossible the idea of crossed breeds in cattle is a thing we can entertain for we are used to it and it is possible but the idea of a divine mongrel is unthinkable  well then what does she mean i am sure i do not know for certain it is the word our that makes all the trouble with the our in she is plainly saying my divine origin the word from seems to be intended to mean on account of it has to mean that or nothing if our is allowed to stay the clause then says  i shall claim no especial gift on account of my divine origin  and i think that the full sentence was intended to mean what i have already suggested  although i am of divine origin and gifted with supernatural power i shall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of elevating the race  when mrs eddy copyrighted that preface seven years ago she had long been used to regarding herself as a divine personage i quote from mr f w peabodys book  in the christian science journal for april 1889 when it was her property and published by her it was claimed for her and with her sanction that she was equal with jesus and elaborate effort was made to establish the claim  mrs eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf that she herself was the chosen successor to and equal of jesus  the following remark in that april number quoted by mr peabody indicates that her claim had been previously made and had excited horror among some good people  now a word about the horror many good people have of our making the author of science and health equal with jesus  surely if it had excited horror in mrs eddy also she would have published a disclaimer she owned the paper she could say what she pleased in its columns instead of rebuking her editor she lets him rebuke those good people for objecting to the claim  these things seem to throw light upon those words our my divine origin  it may be that christian science eschews divine rights in human beings and forbids worship of any but one god one christ but if that is the case it looks as if mrs eddy is a very unsound christian scientist and needs disciplining i believe she has a serious maladyselfdeification and that it will be well to have one of the experts demonstrate over it  meantime let her go on livingfor my sake closely examined painstakingly studied she is easily the most interesting person on the planet and in several ways as easily the most extraordinary woman that was ever born upon it   pssince i wrote the foregoing mr mccrackans article appeared in the march number of the north american review before his article appearedthat is to say during december january and februaryi had written a new book a characterportrait of mrs eddy drawn from her own acts and words and it was thentogether with the three brief articles previously published in the north american reviewready to be delivered to the printer for issue in book form in that book by accident and good luck i have answered the objections made by mr mccrackan to my views and therefore do not need to add an answer here also in it i have corrected certain misstatements of mine which he has noticed and several others which he has not referred to there are one or two important matters of opinion upon which he and i are not in disagreement but there are others upon which we must continue to disagree i suppose indeed i know we must for instance he believes mrs eddy wrote science and health whereas i am quite sure i can convince a person unhampered by predilections that she did not  as concerns one considerable matter i hope to convert him he believes mrs eddys word in his article he cites her as a witness and takes her testimony at par but if he will make an excursion through my book when it comes out and will dispassionately examine her testimonies as there accumulated i think he will in candor concede that she is by a large percentage the most erratic and contradictory and untrustworthy witness that has occupied the stand since the days of the lamented ananias     conclusion  broadly speaking the hostiles reject and repudiate all the pretensions of christian science christianity they affirm that it has added nothing new to christianity that it can do nothing that christianity could not do and was not doing before christian science was born  in that case is there no field for the new christianity no opportunity for usefulness precious usefulness great and distinguished usefulness i think there is i am far from being confident that it can fill it but i will indicate that unoccupied fieldwithout chargeand if it can conquer it it will deserve the praise and gratitude of the christian world and will get it i am sure  the present christianity makes an excellent private christian but its endeavors to make an excellent public one go for nothing substantially  this is an honest nationin private life the american christian is a straight and clean and honest man and in his private commerce with his fellows can be trusted to stand faithfully by the principles of honor and honesty imposed upon him by his religion but the moment he comes forward to exercise a public trust he can be confidently counted upon to betray that trust in nine cases out of ten if party loyalty shall require it  if there are two tickets in the field in his city one composed of honest men and the other of notorious blatherskites and criminals he will not hesitate to lay his private christian honor aside and vote for the blatherskites if his party honor shall exact it his christianity is of no use to him and has no influence upon him when he is acting in a public capacity he has sound and sturdy private morals but he has no public ones in the last great municipal election in new york almost a complete onehalf of the votes representing 3500000 christians were cast for a ticket that had hardly a man on it whose earned and proper place was outside of a jail but that vote was present at church next sunday the same as ever and as unconscious of its perfidy as if nothing had happened  our congresses consist of christians in their private life they are true to every obligation of honor yet in every session they violate them all and do it without shame because honor to party is above honor to themselves it is an accepted law of public life that in it a man may soil his honor in the interest of party expediencymust do it when party expediency requires it in private life those men would bitterly resentand justlyany insinuation that it would not be safe to leave unwatched money within their reach yet you could not wound their feelings by reminding them that every time they vote ten dollars to the pension appropriation nine of it is stolen money and they the marauders they have filched the money to take care of the party they believe it was right to do it they do not see how their private honor is affected therefore their consciences are clear and at rest by vote they do wrongful things every day in the party interest which they could not be persuaded to do in private life in the interest of party expediency they give solemn pledges they make solemn compacts in the interest of party expediency they repudiate them without a blush they would not dream of committing these strange crimes in private life  now then can christian science introduce the congressional blush there are christian private morals but there are no christian public morals at the polls or in congress or anywhere elseexcept here and there and scattered around like lost comets in the solar system can christian science persuade the nation and congress to throw away their public morals and use none but their private ones henceforth in all their activities both public and private  i do not think so but no matter about me there is the fielda grand one a splendid one a sublime one and absolutely unoccupied has christian science confidence enough in itself to undertake to enter in and try to possess it  make the effort christian science it is a most noble cause and it might succeed it could succeed then we should have a new literature with romances entitled how to be an honest congressman though a christian how to be a creditable citizen though a christian
