88154773	the days work  by rudyard kipling     contents       the bridgebuilders      a walking delegate      the ship that found herself      the tomb of his ancestors      the devil and the deep sea      william the conqueror      007      the maltese cat      bread upon the waters      an error in the fourth dimension      my sunday at home      the brushwood boy     the bridgebuilders   the least that findlayson of the public works department expected was a c i e he dreamed of a c s i indeed his friends told him that he deserved more for three years he had endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and disease with responsibility almost too heavy for one pair of shoulders and day by day through that time the great kashi bridge over the ganges had grown under his charge now in less than three months if all went well his excellency the viceroy would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and there would be speeches  findlayson c e sat in his trolley on a construction line that ran along one of the main revetmentsthe huge stonefaced banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the riverand permitted himself to think of the end with its approaches his work was one mile and threequarters fin length a latticegirder bridge trussed with the findlayson truss standing on sevenandtwenty brick pies each one of those piers was twentyfour feet in diameter capped with red agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the ganges bed above them was a railwayline fifteen feet broad above that again a cartroad of eighteen feet flanked with footpaths at either end rose towers of red brick loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches the raw earthends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrowpit below with sackfuls of stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and rolldown of the dirt the river was very low and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railwaysleepers filled within and daubed without with mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up in the little deep water left by the drought an overheadcrane travelled to and fro along its spilepier jerking sections of iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timberyard riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice sidework and the iron roof of the railwayline hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the overhang of the footpathstanchions their firepots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammerstroke showing no more than pale yellow in the suns glare east and west and north and south the constructiontrains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the sideboards were unpinned and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out to hold the river in place  findlayson c e turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around looked back on the humming village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers lessening in the haze overhead to the guardtowersand only he knew how strong those wereand with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good there stood his bridge before him in the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of the three middle piershis bridge raw and ugly as original sin but pukkapermanentto endure when all memory of the builder yea even of the splendid findlayson truss had perished practically the thing was done  hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little switchtailed kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted securely over a trestle and nodded to his chief  all but said he with a smile  ive been thinking about it the senior answered not half a bad job for two men is it  oneand a half gad what a coopers hill cub i was when i came on the works hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past three years that had taught him power and responsibility   you were rather a colt said findlayson i wonder how youll like going back to officework when this jobs over  i shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye followed findlaysons and he muttered isnt it damned good  i think well go up the service together findlayson said to himself youre too good a youngster to waste on another man cub thou wart assistant thou art personal assistant and at simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the business  indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs there were labour contractors by the halfhundredfitters and riveters european borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps twenty white and halfcaste subordinates to direct under direction the bevies of workmenbut none knew better than these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not to be trusted they had been tried many times in sudden crisesby slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes and the wrath of the riverbut no stress had brought to light any man among men whom findlayson and hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of officework destroyed at a blow when the government of india at the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculationsand hitchcock new to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the heartbreaking delays over the filling of the contracts in england the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one only one rather doubtful consignment were passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young hitchcock putting one months leave to another month and borrowing ten days from findlayson spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to london and there as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of god into a man so great that he feared only parliament and said so till hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinnertable andhe feared the kashi bridge and all who spoke in its name then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge works and after the cholera smote the smallpox the fever they had always with them hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the better government of the community and findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what to look after it was a long long reverie and it covered storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the guncase behind everything rose the black frame of the kashi bridgeplate by plate girder by girder span by spanand each pier of it recalled hitchcock the allround man who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last  so the bridge was two mens workunless one counted peroo as peroo certainly counted himself he was a lascar a kharva from bulsar familiar with every port between rockhampton and london who had risen to the rank of sarang on the british india boats but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure of employment for his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy weights peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of the overhead men and peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid and as an exserang he knew how to hold authority no piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that peroo could not devise a tackle to lift ita looseended sagging arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but perfectly equal to the work in hand it was peroo who had saved the girder of number seven pier from destruction when the new wire rope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways then the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and hitchcocks right arm was broken by a falling tplate and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed for four hours till peroo from the top of the crane reported alls well and the plate swung home there was no one like peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the donkeyengines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrowpit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the scouring of mother gunga or to adventure upstream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the embankmentfacings he would interrupt the fieldcouncils of findlayson and hitchcock without fear till his wonderful english or his still more wonderful lingua franca half portuguese and half malay ran out and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend he controlled his own gang of tacklemenmysterious relatives from kutch mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost no consideration of family or kin allowed peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the payroll my honour is the honour of this bridge he would say to the abouttobedismissed what do i care for your honour go and work on a steamer that is all you are fit for  the little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the tattered dwelling of a seapriestone who had never set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations of searovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along thames bank the priest of the lascara had nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all he ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and slept again for said peroo who had haled him a thousand miles inland he is a very holy man he never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on land we worship shiva we kharvas but at sea on the kumpanis boats we attend strictly to the orders of the burra malum the first mate and on this bridge we observe what finlinson sahib says  finlinson sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from the guardtower on the right bank and peroo with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster  from his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serangs silver pipe and the creak and clatter of the pulleys peroo was standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service and as findlayson motioned to him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped the last pole and shading his eyes shipfashion answered with the longdrawn wail of the focsle lookout ham dekhta hai i am looking out findlayson laughed and then sighed it was years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home as his trolley passed under the tower peroo descended by a rope apefashion and cried it looks well now sahib our bridge is all but done what think you mother gunga will say when the rail runs over  she has said little so far it was never mother gunga that delayed us  there is always time for her and none the less there has been delay has the sahib forgotten last autumns flood when the stoneboats were sunk without warningor only a halfdays warning  yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now the spurs are holding well on the west bank  mother gunga eats great allowances there is always room for more stone on the revetments i tell this to the chota sahibhe meant hitchcock and he laughs  no matter peroo another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in thine own fashion  the lascar grinned then it will not be in this waywith stonework sunk under water as the quetta was sunk i like sussuspensheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one big step like a gangplank then no water can hurt when does the lord sahib come to open the bridge  in three months when the weather is cooler  ho ho he is like the burra malum he sleeps below while the work is being done then he comes upon the quarterdeck and touches with his finger and says this is not clean dam jibboonwallah  but the lord sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah peroo  no sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished even the burra malum of the nerbudda said once at tuticorin  bah go i am busy  i also said peroo with an unshaken countenance may i take the light dinghy now and row along the spurs  to hold them with thy hands they are i think sufficiently heavy  nay sahib it is thus at sea on the black water we have room to be blown up and down without care here we have no room at all look you we have put the river into a dock and run her between stone sills  findlayson smiled at the we  we have bitted and bridled her she is not like the sea that can beat against a soft beach she is mother gungain irons his voice fell a little  peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than i speak true talk now how much dolt thou in thy heart believe of mother gunga  all that our priest says london is london sahib sydney is sydney and port darwin is port darwin also mother gunga is mother gunga and when i come back to her banks i know this and worship in london i did poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the god within     yes i will not take the cushions in the dinghy  findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he shared with his assistant the place had become home to him in the last three years he had grilled in the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof the limewash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulae and the sentrypath trodden in the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone there is no eighthour limit to an engineers work and the evening meal with hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the riverbed and the lights began to twinkle  peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy hes taken a couple of nephews with him and hes lolling in the stern like a commodore said hitchcock  thats all right hes got something on his mind youd think that ten years in the british india boats would have knocked most of his religion out of him  so it has said hitchcock chuckling i overheard him the other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and see if he could stop a monsoon  all the same if you carried off his gurus hed leave us like a shot he was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of st pauls when he was in london  he told me that the first time he went into the engineroom of a steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the lowpressure cylinder  not half a bad thing to pray to either hes propitiating his own gods now and he wants to know what mother gunga will think of a bridge being run across her whos there a shadow darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into hitchcocks hand  she ought to be pretty well used to it by this time only a tar it ought to be rallis answer about the new rivets    great heavens hitchcock jumped to his feet  what is it said the senior and took the form thats what mother gunga thinks is it he said reading keep cool youngun weve got all our work cut out for us lets see muir wired half an hour ago floods on the ramgunga look out well that gives usone twonine and a half for the flood to reach melipur ghaut and sevens sixteen and a half to lataolisay fifteen hours before it comes down to us  curse that hillfed sewer of a ramgunga findlayson this is two months before anything could have been expected and the left bank is littered up with stuff still two full months before the time  thats why it comes ive only known indian rivers for fiveandtwenty years and i dont pretend to understand here comes another tar findlayson opened the telegram cockran this time from the ganges canal heavy rains here bad he might have saved the last word well we dont want to know any more weve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the riverbed youll take the east bank and work out to meet me in the middle get every thing that floats below the bridge we shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow without letting the stoneboats ram the piers what have you got on the east bank that needs looking after  pontoonone big pontoon with the overhead crane on it tother overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cartroad rivets from twenty to twentythree pierstwo construction lines and a turningspur the pilework must take its chance said hitchcock  all right roll up everything you can lay hands on well give the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub  close to the verandah stood a big nightgong never used except for flood or fire in the village hitchcock had called for a fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when findlayson took the clothbound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal  long before the last rumble ceased every nightgong in the village had taken up the warning to these were added the hoarse screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of drums and tomtoms and from the european quarters where the riveters lived mccartneys bugle a weapon of offence on sundays and festivals brayed desperately calling to stables engine after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her days work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth the order in all cases was to stand by the days work and wait instructions the gangs poured by in the dusk men stopping to knot a loincloth or fasten a sandal gangforemen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the toolissue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives creeping down their tracks wheeldeep in the crowd till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the riverbed raced over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the cranes and stood still each man in his place  then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the flarelamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a nights work racing against the flood that was to come the girders of the three centre piersthose that stood on the cribswere all but in position they needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked at the ends a hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers it was heaved up in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond floodlevel by the groaning locomotives the toolsheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with them went the stacked ranks of government stores ironbound boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the rivetingmachines spare pumps and chains the big crane would be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge the concrete blocks on the fleet of stoneboats were dropped overside where there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge downstream it was here that peroos pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed and peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the honour and credit which are better than life  i knew she would speak he cried i knew but the telegraph gives us good warning o sons of unthinkable begettingchildren of unspeakable shameare we here for the look of the thing it was two feet of wirerope frayed at the ends and it did wonders as peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the language of the sea  findlayson was more troubled for the stoneboats than anything else mccartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channel  get them behind the swell of the guardtower he shouted down to peroo it will be deadwater there get them below the bridge  accha very good i know we are mooring them with wirerope was the answer heh i listen to the chota sahib he is working hard  from across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives backed by the rumble of stone hitchcock at the last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments  the bridge challenges mother gunga said peroo with a laugh but when she talks i know whose voice will be the loudest  for hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the lights it was a hot moonless night the end of it was darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made findlayson very grave  she moves said peroo just before the dawn mother gunga is awake hear he dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled on it a little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap  six hours before her time said findlayson mopping his forehead savagely now we cant depend on anything wed better clear all hands out of the riverbed  again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools ceased in the silence men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand  foreman after foreman shouted to findlayson who had posted himself by the guardtower that his section of the riverbed had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped findlayson hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plankwalk over the three centre piers and there he met hitchcock  all clear your side said findlayson the whisper rang in the box of latticework  yes and the east channels filling now were utterly out of our reckoning when is this thing down on us  theres no saying shes filling as fast as she can look findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper and fizz  what orders said hitchcock  call the rollcount storessit on your hunkersand pray for the bridge thats all i can think of good night dont risk your life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream  oh ill be as prudent as you are night heavens how shes filling heres the rain in earnest findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of mccartneys riveters before him the gangs had spread themselves along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn and there they waited for the flood only peroo kept his men together behind the swell of the guardtower where the stoneboats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wirerope and chains  a shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to bank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out in spouts of foam mother gunga had come bankhigh in haste and a wall of chocolatecoloured water was her messenger there was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies the stoneboats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim skyline  before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do now she is thus cramped god only knows what she will do said peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guardtower ohe fight then fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears herself out  but mother gunga would not fight as peroo desired after the first downstream plunge there came no more walls of water but the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and banking up behind the piers till even findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work  when day came the village gasped only last night men said turning to each other it was as a town in the riverbed look now  and they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing water that licked the throat of the piers the farther bank was veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the spurs upstream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings and downstream the pent river once freed of her guidelines had spread like a sea to the horizon then hurried by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a pier  big flood said peroo and findlayson nodded it was as big a flood as he had any wish to watch his bridge would stand what was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the embankments mother gunga would carry his honour to the sea with the other raffle worst of all there was nothing to do except to sit still and findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were overankle in mire he took no count of time for the river was marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining of the stoneboats the hollow thunder under the piers and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood once a dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river and then he smiled the bridges failure would hurt his assistant not a little but hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do for himself the crash meant everythingeverything that made a hard life worth the living they would say the men of his own profession   he remembered the half pitying things that he himself had said when lockharts new waterworks burst and broke down in brickheaps and sludge and lockharts spirit broke in him and he died he remembered what he himself had said when the sumao bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor hartopps face three weeks later when the shame had marked it his bridge was twice the size of hartopps and it carried the findlayson truss as well as the new piershoethe findlayson bolted shoe there were no excuses in his service government might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his bridge as that stood or fell he went over it in his head plate by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart his side of the sum was beyond question but what man knew mother gungas arithmetic even as he was making all sure by the multiplicationtable the river might be scooping a pothole to the very bottom of any one of those eightyfoot piers that carried his reputation again a servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain and the river was still rising peroo in a mat sheltercoat crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of the river but saying nothing  at last the lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats  presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the priest of his creeda fat old man with a grey beard that whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder never was seen so lamentable a guru  what good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain shouted peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do thou hast dealt long with the gods when they were contented and wellwishing now they are angry speak to them  what is a man against the wrath of gods whined the priest cowering as the wind took him let me go to the temple and i will pray there  son of a pig pray here is there no return for salt fish and curry powder and dried onions call aloud tell mother gunga we have had enough bid her be still for the night i cannot pray but i have been serving in the kumpanis boats and when men did not obey my orders i a flourish of the wirerope colt rounded the sentence and the priest breaking free from his disciple fled to the village  fat pig said peroo after all that we have done for him when the flood is down i will see to it that we get a new guru finlinson sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday nothing has been eaten be wise sahib no man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty belly lie down sahib the river will do what the river will do  the bridge is mine i cannot leave it  wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said peroo laughing i was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came now we are in the hands of the gods the sahib will not eat and lie down take these then they are meat and good toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever that follows the rain i have eaten nothing else today at all  he took a small tin tobaccobox from his sodden waistbelt and thrust it into findlaysons hand saying nay do not be afraid it is no more than opiumclean malwa opium  findlayson shook two or three of the darkbrown pellets into his hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them the stuff was at least a good guard against feverthe fever that was creeping upon him out of the wet mudand he had seen what peroo could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box  peroo nodded with bright eyes in a littlein a little the sahib will find that he thinks well again i too will he dived into his treasurebox resettled the raincoat over his head and squatted down to watch the boats it was too dark now to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given the river new strength findlayson stood with his chin on his chest thinking there was one point about one of the piersthe sevenththat he had not fully settled in his mind the figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at enormous intervals of time there was a sound rich and mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a doublebassan entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it seemed then peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stoneboats were loose findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a longdrawn shriek of wire straining across gunnels  a tree hit them they will all go cried peroo the main hawser has parted what does the sahib do  an immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into findlaysons mind he saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angleseach rope a line of white fire but there was one rope which was the master rope he could see that rope if he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guardtower but why he wondered was peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank it was necessary to put the lascar aside gently and slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult and thenbut it was of no conceivable importancea wirerope raced through his hand burning it the high bank disappeared and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem he was sitting in the rainy darknesssitting in a boat that spun like a top and peroo was standing over him  i had forgotten said the lascar slowly that to those fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine those who die in gunga go to the gods still i have no desire to present myself before such great ones can the sahib swim  what need he can flyfly as swiftly as the wind was the thick answer  he is mad muttered peroo under his breath and he threw me aside like a bundle of dungcakes well he will not know his death the boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing it is not good to look at death with a clear eye  he refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through the mist at the nothing that was there a warm drowsiness crept over findlayson the chief engineer whose duty was with his bridge the heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids he thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart to keep his balancethis was the most important pointwould be borne with great and easy speed to the shore but yet a better plan came to him it needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it kitefashion to the bank thereafterthe boat spun dizzilysuppose the high wind got under the freed body would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the faraway sands or would it duck about beyond control through all eternity findlayson gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans opium has more effect on the white man than the black peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents she cannot live he grunted her seams open already if she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with holes is no good finlinson sahib she fills  accha i am going away come thou also  in his mind findlayson had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot his bodyhe was really sorry for its gross helplessnesslay in the stern the water rushing about its knees  how very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyriethat is findlaysonchief of the kashi bridge the poor beast is going to be drowned too drowned when its close to shore imim onshore already why doesnt it come along  to his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again and that body spluttering and choking in deep water the pain of the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight for the body he was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet earth  not this night said peroo in his ear the gods have protected us the lascar moved his feet cautiously and they rustled among dried stumps this is some island of last years indigocrop he went on we shall find no men here but have great care sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been flooded out here comes the lightning on the heels of the wind now we shall be able to look but walk carefully  findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed any merely human emotion he saw after he had rubbed the water from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed to himself with worldencompassing strides somewhere in the night of time he had built a bridgea bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas but the deluge had swept it away leaving this one island under heaven for findlayson and his companion sole survivors of the breed of man  an incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there was to be seen on the little patch in the flooda clump of thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a tattered red flag the holy man whose summer restingplace it was had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the reddaubed image of his god the two men stumbled heavy limbed and heavyeyed over the ashes of a brickset cookingplace and dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain and river roared together  the stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of cattle as a huge and dripping brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree the flashes revealed the trident mark of shiva on his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous staglike eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground there was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing  here be more beside ourselves said findlayson his head against the treepole looking through halfshut eyes wholly at ease  truly said peroo thickly and no small ones  what are they then i do not see clearly  the gods who else look  ah true the gods surelythe gods findlayson smiled as his head fell forward on his chest peroo was eminently right after the flood who should be alive in the land except the gods that made itthe gods to whom his village prayed nightlythe gods who were in all mens mouths and about all mens ways he could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that held him and peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning  the bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp earth a green parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of beasts there was a black buck at the bulls heelssuch a buck as findlayson in his faraway life upon earth might have seen in dreamsa buck with a royal head ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns beside him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass paced a tigress fullbellied and deepjowled  the bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness a monstrous grey ape who seated himself manwise in the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and shoulders  other shadows came and went behind the circle among them a drunken man flourishing staff and drinkingbottle then a hoarse bellow broke out from near the ground the flood lessens even now it cried hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands  my bridge said findlayson to himself that must be very old work now what have the gods to do with my bridge  his eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar a muggerthe bluntnosed fordhaunting mugger of the gangesdraggled herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left with her tail  they have made it too strong for me in all this night i have only torn away a handful of planks the walls stand the towers stand they have chained my flood and the river is not free any more heavenly ones take this yoke away give me clear water between bank and bank it is i mother gunga that speak the justice of the gods deal me the justice of the gods  what said i whispered peroo this is in truth a punchayet of the gods now we know that all the world is dead save you and i sahib  the parrot screamed and fluttered again and the tigress her ears flat to her head snarled wickedly  somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl  we be here said a deep voice the great ones one only and very many shiv my father is here with indra kali has spoken already hanuman listens also  kashi is without her kotwal tonight shouted the man with the drinkingbottle flinging his staff to the ground while the island rang to the baying of hounds give her the justice of the gods  ye were still when they polluted my waters the great crocodile bellowed ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls i had no help save my own strength and that failedthe strength of mother gunga failedbefore their guardtowers what could i do i have done everything finish now heavenly ones  i brought the death i rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease a noseslitten hideworn ass lame scissorlegged and galled limped forward i cast the death at them out of my nostrils but they would not cease  peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him  bah he said spitting here is sitala herself matathe smallpox has the sahib a handkerchief to put over his face  little help they fed me the corpses for a month and i flung them out on my sandbars but their work went forward demons they are and sons of demons and ye left mother gunga alone for their firecarriage to make a mock of the justice of the gods on the bridgebuilders  the bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly if the justice of the gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many dark altars in the land mother  but this goes beyond a mock said the tigress darting forward a griping paw thou knowest shiv and ye too heavenly ones ye know that they have defiled gunga surely they must come to the destroyer let indra judge  the buck made no movement as he answered how long has this evil been  three years as men count years said the mugger close pressed to the earth  does mother gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious to see vengeance now the deep sea was where she runs but yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the gods count that which men call time can any say that this their bridge endures till tomorrow said the buck  there was along hush and in the clearing of the storm the full moon stood up above the dripping trees  judge ye then said the river sullenly i have spoken my shame the flood falls still i can do no more  for my own partit was the voice of the great ape seated within the shrineit pleases me well to watch these men remembering that i also builded no small bridge in the worlds youth  they say too snarled the tiger that these men came of the wreck of thy armies hanuman and therefore thou hast aided  they toil as my armies toiled in lanka and they believe that their toil endures indra is too high but shiv thou knowest how the land is threaded with their firecarriages  yea i know said the bull their gods instructed them in the matter  a laugh ran round the circle  their gods what should their gods know they were born yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said the mugger tomorrow their gods will die  ho said peroo mother gunga talks good talk i told that to the padresahib who preached on the mombassa and he asked the burra malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness  surely they make these things to please their gods said the bull again  not altogether the elephant rolled forth it is for the profit of my mahajuns fat moneylenders that worship me at each new year when they draw my image at the head of the accountbooks i looking over their shoulders by lamplight see that the names in the books are those of men in far placesfor all the towns are drawn together by the firecarriage and the money comes and goes swiftly and the accountbooks grow as fat as myself and i who am ganesh of good luck i bless my peoples  they have changed the face of the landwhich is my land they have killed and made new towns on my banks said the mugger  it is but the shifting of a little dirt let the dirt dig in the dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the elephant  but afterwards said the tiger afterwards they will see that mother gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her first and later from us all one by one in the end ganesh we are left with naked altars  the drunken man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently  kali lies my sister lies also this my stick is the kotwal of kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims when the time comes to worship bhaironand it is always timethe firecarriages move one by one and each hears a thousand pilgrims they do not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour is increased  gunga i have seen thy bed at pryag black with the pilgrims said the ape leaning forward and but for the firecarriage they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers remember  they come to me always bhairon went on thickly by day and night they pray to me all the common people in the fields and the roads who is like bhairon today what talk is this of changing faiths is my staff kotwal of kashi for nothing he keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as today and the fire carriage serves them well bhairon am ibhairon of the common people and the chiefest of tithe heavenly ones today also my staff says  peace thou lowed the bull the worship of the schools is mine and they talk very wisely asking whether i be one or many as is the delight of my people and ye know what i am kali my wife thou knowest also  yea i know said the tigress with lowered head  greater am i than gunga also for ye know who moved the minds of men that they should count gunga holy among the rivers who die in that waterye know how men saycome to us without punishment and gunga knows that the firecarriage has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that are fed by the firecarriage who smote at pooree under the image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the sickness to the wheels of the firecarriages so that it ran from one end of the land to the other who but kali before the firecarriage came it was a heavy toil the firecarriages have served thee well mother of death but i speak for mine own altars who am not bhairon of the common folk but shiv men go to and fro making words and telling talk of strange gods and i listen faith follows faith among my people in the schools and i have no anger for when all words are said and the new talk is ended to shiv men return at the last  true it is true murmured hanuman to shiv and to the others mother they return i creep from temple to temple in the north where they worship one god and his prophet and presently my image is alone within their shrines  small thanks said the buck turning his head slowly i am that one and his prophet also  even so father said hanuman and to the south i go who am the oldest of the gods as men know the gods and presently i touch the shrines of the new faith and the woman whom we know is hewn twelvearmed and still they call her mary  small thanks brother said the tigress i am that woman  even so sister and i go west among the firecarriages and stand before the bridgebuilders in many shapes and because of me they change their faiths and are very wise ho ho i am the builder of bridges indeedbridges between this and that and each bridge leads surely to us in the end be content gunga  neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all  am i alone then heavenly ones shall i smooth out my flood lest unhappily i bear away their walls will indra dry my springs in the hills and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs shall i bury me in the sand ere i offend  and all for the sake of a little iron bar with the firecarriage atop truly mother gunga is always young said ganesh the elephant a child had not spoken more foolishly let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt i know only that my people grow rich and praise me shiv has said that the men of the schools do not forget bhairon is content for his crowd of the common people and hanuman laughs  surely i laugh said the ape my altars are few beside those of ganesh or bhairon but the firecarriages bring me new worshippers from beyond the black waterthe men who believe that their god is toil i run before them beckoning and they follow hanuman  give them the toil that they desire then said the river make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge once thou wast strong in lanka hanuman stoop and lift my bed  who gives life can take life the ape scratched in the mud with a long forefinger and yet who would profit by the killing very many would die  there came up from the water a snatch of a lovesong such as the boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring the parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their children are bornkrishna the wellbeloved he stooped to knot up his long wet hair and the parrot fluttered to his shoulder  fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped bhairon those make thee late for the council brother  and then said krishna with a laugh throwing back his head ye can do little without me or karma here he fondled the parrots plumage and laughed again what is this sitting and talking together i heard mother gunga roaring in the dark and so came quickly from a but where i lay warm and what have ye done to karma that he is so wet and silent and what does mother gunga here are the heavens full that ye must come paddling in the mud beastwise karma what do they do  gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and kali is with her now she bids hanuman whelm the bridge that her honour may be made great cried the parrot i waited here knowing that thou wouldst come o my master  and the heavenly ones said nothing did gunga and the mother of sorrows outtalk them did none speak for my people  nay said ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot i said it was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat  i was content to let them toilwell content said hanuman  what had i to do with gungas anger said the bull  i am bhairon of the common folk and this my staff is kotwal of all kashi i spoke for the common people  thou the young gods eyes sparkled  am i not the first of the gods in their mouths today returned bhairon unabashed for the sake of the common people i said very many wise things which i have now forgotten but this my staff  krishna turned impatiently saw the mugger at his feet and kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck mother he said gently get thee to thy flood again this matter is not for thee what harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt thou hast given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood they are made strong they come all to thee at the last what need to slay them now have pity mother for a little and it is only for a little  if it be only for a little the slow beast began  are they gods then krishna returned with a laugh his eyes looking into the dull eyes of the river be certain that it is only for a little the heavenly ones have heard thee and presently justice will be done go now mother to the flood again men and cattle are thick on the watersthe banks fallthe villages melt because of thee  but the bridgethe bridge stands the mugger turned grunting into the undergrowth as krishna rose  it is ended said the tigress viciously there is no more justice from the heavenly ones ye have made shame and sport of gunga who asked no more than a few score lives  of my peoplewho lie under the leafroofs of the village yonderof the young girls and the young men who sing to them in the dark of the child that will be born next mornof that which was begotten tonight said krishna and when all is done what profit tomorrow sees them at work ay if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew hear me bhairon is drunk always hanuman mocks his people with new riddles  nay but they are very old ones the ape said laughing  shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but ii live with these my people asking for no gifts and so receiving them hourly  and very tender art thou of thy people said the tigress  they are my own the old women dream of me turning in their sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the river i walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk and i call over my shoulder to the whitebeards ye know heavenly ones that i alone of us all walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two voices at twilight in the standing crops wise are ye but ye live far off forgetting whence ye came so do i not forget and the firecarriage feeds your shrines ye say and the firecarriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in the old years true that is true today  but tomorrow they are dead brother said ganesh  peace said the bull as hanuman leaned forward again and tomorrow belovedwhat of tomorrow  this only a new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the common folka word that neither man nor god can lay hold ofan evil worda little lazy word among the common folk saying and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye heavenly ones  the gods laughed together softly and then beloved they said  and to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee shiv and to thee ganesh at first greater offerings and a louder noise of worship but the word has gone abroad and after they will pay fewer dues to our fat brahmins next they will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began  i knewi knew i spoke this also but they would not hear said the tigress we should have slainwe should have slain  it is too late now ye should have slain at the beginning when the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing now my people see their work and go away thinking they do not think of the heavenly ones altogether they think of the firecarriage and the other things that the bridgebuilders have done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms they give a little unwillingly that is the beginning among one or two or five or tenfor i moving among my people know what is in their hearts  and the end jester of the gods what shall the end be said ganesh  the end shall be as it was in the beginning o slothful son of shiv the flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye become little gods againgods of the junglenames that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the cavesraggods pot godlings of the tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning that is the end ganesh for thee and for bhaironbhairon of the common people  it is very far away grunted bhairon also it is a lie  many women have kissed krishna they told him this to cheer their own hearts when the grey hairs came and he has told us the tale said the bull below his breath  their gods came and we changed them i took the woman and made her twelvearmed so shall we twist all their gods said hanuman  their gods this is no question of their godsone or threeman or woman the matter is with the people they move and not the gods of the bridgebuilders said krishna  so be it i have made a man worship the firecarriage as it stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped me said hanuman the ape they will only change a little the names of their gods i shall lead the builders of the bridges as of old shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows ganesh shall have his mahajuns and bhairon the donkeydrivers the pilgrims and the sellers of toys beloved they will do no more than change the names and that we have seen a thousand times  surely they will do no more than change the names echoed ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the gods  they will change more than the names me alone they cannot kill so long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring follows the winter rains heavenly ones not for nothing have i walked upon the earth my people know not now what they know but i who live with them i read their hearts great kings the beginning of the end is born already the firecarriages shout the names of new gods that are not the old under new names drink now and eat greatly bathe your faces in the smoke of the altars before they grow cold take dues and listen to the cymbals and the drums heavenly ones while yet there are flowers and songs as men count time the end is far off but as we who know reckon it is today i have spoken  the young god ceased and his brethren looked at each other long in silence  this i have not heard before peroo whispered in his companions ear and yet sometimes when i oiled the brasses in the engineroom of the goorkha i have wondered if our priests were so wiseso wise the day is coming sahib they will be gone by the morning  a yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river changed as the darkness withdrew  suddenly the elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded him  let indra judge father of all speak thou what of the things we have heard has krishna lied indeed or  ye know said the buck rising to his feet ye know the riddle of the gods when brahm ceases to dream the heavens and the hells and earth disappear be content brahm dreams still the dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but still brahm dreams krishna has walked too long upon earth and yet i love him the more for the tale he has told the gods change belovedall save one  ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said krishna knotting his girdle it is but a little time to wait and ye shall know if i lie  truly it is but a little time as thou sayest and we shall know get thee to thy huts again beloved and make sport for the young things for still brahm dreams go my children brahm dreamsand till he wakes the gods die not  whither went they said the lascar awestruck shivering a little with the cold  god knows said findlayson the river and the island lay in full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth under the peepul only a parrot screamed in the branches bringing down showers of waterdrops as he fluttered his wings  up we are cramped with cold has the opium died out canst thou move sahib  findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself his head swam and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he sluiced his forehead in a pool the chief engineer of the kashi bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island what chances the day offered of return and above all how his work stood  peroo i have forgotten much i was under the guardtower watching the river and then    did the flood sweep us away  no the boats broke loose sahib and if the sahib had forgotten about the opium decidedly peroo would not remind him in striving to retie them so it seemed to mebut it was darka rope caught the sahib and threw him upon a boat considering that we two with hitchcock sahib built as it were that bridge i came also upon the boat which came riding on horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so splitting cast us ashore i made a great cry when the boat left the wharf and without doubt hitchcock sahib will come for us as for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot fall  a fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was no room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark findlayson stared upstream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes ached there was no sign of any bank to the ganges much less of a bridgeline  we came down far he said it was wonderful that we were not drowned a hundred times  that was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his time i have seen sydney i have seen london and twenty great ports butperoo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under the peopulnever man has seen that we saw here  what  has the sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the gods  there was a fever upon me findlayson was still looking uneasily across the water it seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking but i do not remember a boat could live in this water now i think  oho then it is true when brahm ceases to dream the gods die now i know indeed what he meant once too the guru said as much to me but then i did not understand now i am wise  what said findlayson over his shoulder  peroo went on as if he were talking to himself sixseventen monsoons since i was watch on the focsle of the ehwahthe kumpanis big boatand there was a big tufan green and black water beating and i held fast to the lifelines choking under the waters then i thought of the godsof those whom we saw tonighthe stared curiously at findlaysons back but the white man was looking across the flood yes i say of those whom we saw this night past and i called upon them to protect me and while i prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black bowanchor and the rewah rose high and high leaning towards the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her nose and i lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking down into those great deeps then i thought even in the face of death if i lose hold i die and for me neither the rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor bombay nor calcutta nor even london will be any more for me how shall i be sure i said that the gods to whom i pray will abide at all this i thought and the rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the focsle and over the break of the focsle and i very badly bruised my shin against the donkeyengine but i did not die and i have seen the gods they are good for live men but for the dead   they have spoken themselves therefore when i come to the village i will beat the guru for talking riddles which are no riddles when brahm ceases to dream the gods go  look upstream the light blinds is there smoke yonder  peroo shaded his eyes with his hands he is a wise man and quick hitchcock sahib would not trust a rowboat he has borrowed the rao sahibs steam launch and comes to look for us i have always said that there should have been a steamlaunch on the bridge works for us  the territory of the rao of baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge and findlayson and hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck with the young man he had been bearled by an english tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the indian government his steamlaunch with its silverplated rails striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which findlayson had found horribly in the way when the rao came to look at the bridge works  its great luck murmured findlayson but he was none the less afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge  the gaudy blue and white funnel came downstream swiftly they could see hitchcock in the bows with a pair of operaglasses and his face was unusually white then peroo hailed and the launch made for the tail of the island the rao sahib in tweed shootingsuit and a sevenhued turban waved his royal hand and hitchcock shouted but he need have asked no questions for findlaysons first demand was for his bridge  all serene gad i never expected to see you again findlayson youre seven koss downstream yes theres not a stone shifted anywhere but how are you i borrowed the rao sahibs launch and he was good enough to come along jump in  ah finlinson you are very well eh that was most unprecedented calamity last night eh my royal palace too it leaks like the devil and the crops will also be short all about my country now you shall back her out hitchcock ii do not understand steam engines you are wet you are cold finlinson i have some things to eat here and you will take a good drink  im immensely grateful rao sahib i believe youve saved my life how did hitchcock  oho his hair was upon end he rode to me in the middle of the night and woke me up in the arms of morpheus i was most truly concerned finlinson so i came too my headpriest he is very angry just now we will go quick mister hitchcock i am due to attend at twelve fortyfive in the state temple where we sanctify some new idol if not so i would have asked you to spend the day with me they are dambore these religious ceremonies finlinson eh  peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the inlaid wheel and was taking the launch craftily upstream but while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of partially untwisted wirerope and the back upon which he beat was the back of his guru     a walking delegate   according to the custom of vermont sunday afternoon is saltingtime on the farm and unless something very important happens we attend to the salting ourselves dave and pete the red oxen are treated first they stay in the home meadow ready for work on monday then come the cows with pan the calf who should have been turned into veal long ago but survived on account of his manners and lastly the horses scattered through the seventy acres of the back pasture  you must go down by the brook that feeds the clicking bubbling waterram up through the sugarbush where the young maple undergrowth closes round you like a shallow sea next follow the faint line of an old countyroad running past two green hollows fringed with wild rose that mark the cellars of two ruined houses then by lost orchard where nobody ever comes except in cidertime then across another brook and so into the back pasture half of it is pine and hemlock and spruce with sumach and little juniper bushes and the other half is grey rock and boulder and moss with green streaks of brake and swamp but the horses like it well enoughour own and the others that are turned down there to feed at fifty cents a week most people walk to the back pasture and find it very rough work but one can get there in a buggy if the horse knows what is expected of him the safest conveyance is our coupe this began life as a buckboard and we bought it for five dollars from a sorrowful man who had no other sort of possessions and the seat came off one night when we were turning a corner in a hurry after that alteration it made a beautiful saltingmachine if you held tight because there was nothing to catch your feet when you fell out and the slats rattled tunes  one sunday afternoon we went out with the salt as usual it was a broiling hot day and we could not find the horses anywhere till we let tedda gabler the bobtailed mare who throws up the dirt with her big hooves exactly as a tedder throws hay have her head clever as she is she tipped the coupe over in a hidden brook before she came out on a ledge of rock where all the horses had gathered and were switching flies the deacon was the first to call to her he is a very dark irongrey fouryearold son of grandee he has been handled since he was two was driven in a light cart before he was three and now ranks as an absolutely steady ladys horseproof against steamrollers gradecrossings and street processions  salt said the deacon joyfully youre dreffle late tedda  anyany place to cramp the coupe tedda panted it weighs turrble this weather id a come sooner but they didnt know what they wantedner haow fell out twice both of em i dont understand sech foolishness  you look considerble het up guess youd better cramp her under them pines an cool off a piece  tedda scrambled on the ledge and cramped the coupe in the shade of a tiny little wood of pines while my companion and i lay down among the brown silky needles and gasped all the home horses were gathered round us enjoying their sunday leisure  there were rod and rick the seniors on the farm they were the regular roadpair bay with black points full brothers aged sons of a hambletonian sire and a morgan dam there were nip and tuck sealbrowns rising six brother and sister black hawks by birth perfectly matched just finishing their education and as handsome a pair as man could wish to find in a fortymile drive there was muldoon our excarhorse bought at a venture and any colour you choose that is not white and tweezy who comes from kentucky with an affliction of his left hip which makes him a little uncertain how his hind legs are moving he and muldoon had been hauling gravel all the week for our new road the deacon you know already last of all and eating something was our faithful marcus aurelius antoninus the black buggyhorse who had seen us through every state of weather and road the horse who was always standing in harness before some door or othera philosopher with the appetite of a shark and the manners of an archbishop tedda gabler was a new trade with a reputation for vice which was really the result of bad driving she had one working gait which she could hold till further notice a roman nose a large prominent eye a shavingbrush of a tail and an irritable temper she took her salt through her bridle but the others trotted up nuzzling and wickering for theirs till we emptied it on the clean rocks they were all standing at ease on three legs for the most part talking the ordinary gossip of the back pastureabout the scarcity of water and gaps in the fence and how the early windfalls tasted that seasonwhen little rick blew the last few grains of his allowance into a crevice and said  hurry boys might ha knowed that livery plug would be around  we heard a clatter of hooves and there climbed up from the ravine below a fiftycenter transienta walleyed yellow framehouse of a horse sent up to board from a liverystable in town where they called him the lamb and never let him out except at night and to strangers my companion who knew and had broken most of the horses looked at the ragged hammerhead as it rose and said quietly  niice beast maneater if he gets the chancesee his eye kicker toosee his hocks western horse  the animal lumbered up snuffling and grunting his feet showed that he had not worked for weeks and weeks and our creatures drew together significantly  as usual he said with an underhung sneerbowin your heads before the oppressor that comes to spend his leisure gloatin over you  mines done said the deacon he licked up the remnant of his salt dropped his nose in his masters hand and sang a little grace all to himself the deacon has the most enchanting manners of any one i know  an fawnin on them for what is your inalienable right its humiliatin said the yellow horse sniffing to see if he could find a few spare grains  go daown hill then boney the deacon replied guess youll find somethin to eat still if yer haint hogged it all youve ett moren any three of us todayan day fore thatan the last two monthssence youve been here  i am not addressin myself to the young an immature i am speakin to those whose opinion an experience commands respect  i saw rod raise his head as though he were about to make a remark then he dropped it again and stood threecornered like a ploughhorse rod can cover his mile in a shade under three minutes on an ordinary road to an ordinary buggy he is tremendously powerful behind but like most hambletonians he grows a trifle sullen as he gets older no one can love rod very much but no one can help respecting him  i wish to wake those the yellow horse went on to an abidin sense o their wrongs an their injuries an their outrages  haows that said marcus aurelius antoninus dreamily he thought boney was talking of some kind of feed  an when i say outrages and injuriesboney waved his tail furiously i mean em too great oats thats just what i do mean plain an straight  the gentleman talks quite earnest said tuck the mare to nip her brother theres no doubt thinkin broadens the horizons o the mind his language is quite lofty  hesh sis nip answered  he haint widened nothin cep the circle hes ett in pasture they feed words fer beddin where he comes from  its elegant talkin though tuck returned with an unconvinced toss of her pretty lean little head  the yellow horse heard her and struck an attitude which he meant to be extremely impressive it made him look as though he had been badly stuffed  now i ask you i ask you without prejudice an without favourwhat has man the oppressor ever done for youare you not inalienably entitled to the free air o heaven blowin acrost this boundless prairie  hev ye ever wintered here said the deacon merrily while the others snickered its kinder cool  not yet said boney i come from the boundless confines o kansas where the noblest of our kind have their abidin place among the sunflowers on the threshold o the settin sun in his glory  an they sent you ahead as a sample said rick with an amused quiver of his long beautifully groomed tail as thick and as fine and as wavy as a quadroons back hair  kansas sir needs no advertisement her native sons rely on themselves an their native sires yes sir  then tweezy lifted up his wise and polite old head his affliction makes him bashful as a rule but he is ever the most courteous of horses  excuse me suh he said slowly but unless i have been misinfohmed most of your prominent siahs suh are impoted from kentucky an im from paduky  there was the least little touch of pride in the last words  any horse dat knows beans said muldoon suddenly he had been standing with his hairy chin on tweezys broad quarters gits outer kansas fore dey crip his shoes i blew in dere from ioway in de days o me youth an innocence an i wuz grateful when dey boxed me fer n york you cant tell me anything about kansas i dont wanter fergit de belt line stables aint no hoffman house but deyre vanderbilts longside o kansas  what the horses o kansas think today the horses of america will think tomorrow an i tell you that when the horses of america rise in their might the day o the oppressor is ended  there was a pause till rick said with a little grunt  ef you put it that way every one of us has riz in his might cep marcus mebbe marky j ever rise in yer might  nope said marcus aurelius antoninus thoughtfully quidding over a mouthful of grass i seen a heap o fools try though  you admit that you riz said the kansas horse excitedly then whywhy in kansas did you ever go under again  horse cant walk on his hind legs all the time said the deacon  not when hes jerked over on his back fore he knows what fetched him weve all done it boney said rick nip an tuck they tried it spite o what the deacon told em an the deacon he tried it spite o what me an rod told him an me an rod tried it spite o what grandee told us an i guess grandee he tried it spite o what his dam told him its the same old circus from generation to generation colt cant see why hes called on to back same old rearm on endstraight up same old feelin that youve bested em this time same old little yank at your mouth when youre up good an tall same old pegasusact wonderin where youll light same old wop when you hit the dirt with your head where your tail should be and your inards shook up like a branmash same old voice in your ear waal ye little fool an what did you reckon to make by that were through with risin in our might on this farm we go to pole er single accordin ez were hitched  an man the oppressor sets an gloats over you same as hes settin now haint that been your experience madam  this last remark was addressed to tedda and any one could see with half an eye that poor old anxious fidgety tedda stamping at the flies must have left a wild and tumultuous youth behind her  pends on the man she answered shifting from one foot to the other and addressing herself to the home horses they abused me dreffle when i was young i guess i was sperrity an nervous some but they didnt allow for that twas in monroe county noo york an sence then till i come here ive run away with more men than ud fill a boardinhouse why the man that sold me here he says to the boss s he mind now ive warned you twont be none of my fault if she sheds you daown the road dont you drive her in a topbuggy ner thout winkers s he ner thought this bit ef you look to come home behind her n the fust thing the boss did was to git the topbuggy  cant say as i like topbuggies said rick they dont balance good  suit me to a haar said marcus aurelius antoninus topbuggy means the babys in behind an i kin stop while she gathers the pretty flowersyes an pick a maouthful too the womenfolk all say i hev to be humoured an i dont kerry things to the sweatinpoint  course ive no prejudice against a topbuggy s longs i can see it tedda went on quickly its hafseein the pesky thing bobbin an balancn behind the winkers gits on my nerves then the boss looked at the bit theyd sold with me an s he jiminy christmas this ud make a clotheshorse stan n end then he gave me a plain bar bit an fitted its if there was some feelin to my maouth  haint ye got any miss tedda said tuck who has a mouth like velvet and knows it  might a had miss tuck but ive forgot then he give me an open bridlemy styles an open bridleani dunno as i ought to tell this by rightshegivemea kiss  my said tuck i cant tell fer the shoes o me what makes some men so fresh  pshaw sis said nip whats the sense in actin so you git a kiss reglars hitchinup time  well you neednt tell smarty said tuck with a squeal and a kick  id heard o kisses o course tedda went on but they hadnt come my way specially i dont mind tellin i was that took aback at that mans doins he might ha lit firecrackers on my saddle then we went out jests if a kiss was nothin an i wasnt three strides into my gait fore i felt the boss knoo his business an was trustin me so i studied to please him an he never took the whip from the dasha whip drives me plumb distractedan the upshot was thatwaal ive come up the back pasture today an the coupes tipped clear over twice an ive waited till twuz fixed each time you kin judge for yourselves i dont set up to be no better than my neighboursspecially with my tail snipped off the way tisbut i want you all to know teddas quit fightin in harness or out of it cep when theres a born fool in the pasture stuffin his stummick with board that aint rightly hisn cause he haint earned it  meanin me madam said the yellow horse  ef the shoe fits clinch it said tedda snorting i named no names though to be sure some folks are mean enough an greedy enough to do thout em  theres a deal to be forgiven to ignorance said the yellow horse with an ugly look in his blue eye  seeminly yes or some folks ud ha been kicked raound the pasture bout onct a minute sence they cameboard er no board  but what you do not understand if you will excuse me madam is that the whole principle o servitood which includes keep an feed starts from a radically false basis an i am proud to say that me an the majority o the horses o kansas think the entire concern should be relegated to the limbo of exploded superstitions i say were too progressive for that i say were too enlightened for that twas good enoughs longs we didnt think but naowbut naowa new loominary has arisen on the horizon  meanin you said the deacon  the horses o kansas are behind me with their multitoodinous thunderin hooves an we say simply but grandly that we take our stand with all four feet on the inalienable rights of the horse pure and simplethe hightoned child o nature fed by the same wavin grass cooled by the same ripplin brookyes an warmed by the same genrous sun as falls impartially on the outside an the inside of the pampered machine o the trottintrack or the bloated coupehorses o these yere eastern cities are we not the same flesh an blood  not by a bushel an a half said the deacon under his breath grandee never was in kansas  my aint that elegant though abaout the wavin grass an the ripplin brooks tuck whispered in nips ear the gentlemans real convincin i think  i say we are the same flesh an blood are we to be separated horse from horse by the artificial barriers of a trottinrecord or are we to look down upon each other on the strength o the gifts o naturean extry inch below the knee or slightly more powerful quarters whats the use o them advantages to you man the oppressor comes along an sees youre likely an goodlookin an grinds you to the face o the earth what for for his own pleasure for his own convenience young an old black an bay white an grey theres no distinctions made between us were ground up together under the remorseless teeth o the engines of oppression  guess his breechin must ha broke goin daownhill said the deacon slippery road maybe an the buggy come onter him an he didnt know nough to hold back that dont feel like teeth though maybe he busted a shaft an it pricked him  an i come to you from kansas wavin the tail o friendship to all an sundry an in the name of the uncounted millions o pureminded hightoned horses now strugglin towards the light o freedom i say to you rub noses with us in our sacred an holy cause the power is yourn without you i say man the oppressor cannot move himself from place to place without you he cannot reap he cannot sow he cannot plough  mighty odd place kansas said marcus aurelius antoninus seeminly they reap in the spring an plough in the fall guess its right fer them but twould make me kinder giddy  the producs of your untirin industry would rot on the ground if you did not weakly consent to help him let em rot i say let him call you to the stables in vain an nevermore let him shake his ensnarin oats under your nose in vain let the brahmas roost in the buggy an the rats run riot round the reaper let him walk on his two hind feet till they blame well drop off win no more souldestroyn races for his pleasure then an not till then will man the oppressor know where hes at quit workin fellowsufferers an slaves kick rear plunge lie down on the shafts an woller smash an destroy the conflict will be but short an the victory is certain after that we can press our inalienable rights to eight quarts o oats a day two good blankets an a flynet an the best o stablin  the yellow horse shut his yellow teeth with a triumphant snap and tuck said with a sigh seemss if somethin ought to be done dont seem right somehowoppressin us an allto my way o thinkin  said muldoon in a faraway and sleepy voice  who in vermonts goin to haul de inalienable oats dey weigh like sam hill an sixty bushel at dat allowance aint goin to last tree weeks here an deres de winter hay for five monts  we can settle those minor details when the great cause is won said the yellow horse let us return simply but grandly to our inalienable rightsthe right o freedom on these yere verdant hills an no invijjus distinctions o track an pedigree  what in stables jer call an invijjus distinction said the deacon stiffly  fer one thing bein a bloated pampered trotter jest because you happen to be raised that way an couldnt no more help trottin than eatin  do ye know anythin about trotters said the deacon  ive seen em trot that was enough for me i dont want to know any more trottins immoral  waal ill tell you this much they dont bloat an they dont pampmuch i dont hold out to be no trotter myself though i am free to say i had hopes that wayonct but i do say fer ive seen em trained that a trotter dont trot with his feet he trots with his head an he does more workef you know what that isin a week than you er your sire ever done in all your lives hes everlastingly at it a trotter is an when he isnt hes studyin haow you seen em trot much you hev you was hitched to a rail back o the stand in a buckboard with a soapbox nailed on the slats

horse  not till theyre dead muldoon answered quietly an den it depends on de gross total o buttons an mucilage dey gits outer youse at barren island  they tell me youre a prominent philosopher the yellow horse turned to marcus can you deny a basic and pivotal statement such as this  i dont deny anythin said marcus aurelius antoninus cautiously but ef you ast me i should say twuz more different

his labours let him work intelligently an not as a machine  there aint no horse that works like a machine marcus began  theres no way o workin that doesnt mean goin to pole er singlethey never put me in the powermachineer under saddle said rick  oh shucks were talkin same ez we graze said nip raound an raound in circles rod we haint heard from you yet an youve more knowhow than any span here  rod the offhorse of the pair had been standing with one hip lifted like a tired cow and you could only tell by the quick flutter of the haw across his eye from time to time that he was paying any attention to the argument he thrust his jaw out sidewise as his habit is when he pulls and changed his leg his voice was hard and heavy and his ears were close to his big plain hambletonian head  how old are you he said to the yellow horse  nigh thirteen i guess  mean age ugly age im gettin that way myself how long hev ye been pawin this firefanged stablelitter  if you mean my principles ive held em sence i was three  mean age ugly age teeth give heaps o trouble then set a colt to actin crazy fer a while youve kep it up seeminly dye talk much to your neighbours fer a steady thing  i uphold the principles o the cause wherever i am pastured  done a heap o good i guess  i am proud to say i have taught a few of my companions the principles o freedom an liberty  meanin they ran away er kicked when they got the chanst  i was talkin in the abstrac an not in the concrete my teachins educated them  what a horse specially a young horse hears in the abstrac hes liable to do in the concord you was handled late i presoom  four risin five  thats where the trouble began driv by a woman like ez noteh  not fer long said the yellow horse with a snap of his teeth  spilled her  i heerd she never

suit emselves about livin when im through with em  shouldnt wonder ef they did said rod the yellow horse had hidden himself very cleverly behind the others as they stood in a group and was swaying his head close to the ground with a curious scythelike motion looking sidewise out of his wicked eyes you can never mistake a maneater getting ready to knock a man down we had had one to pasture the year before  see that said my companion turning over on the pineneedles nice for a woman walking cross lots wouldnt it be  bring em out said the yellow horse hunching his sharp back theres no chance among them tall trees bring out theoh ouch  it was a rightandleft kick from muldoon i had no idea that the old carhorse could lift so quickly both blows caught the yellow horse full and fair in the ribs and knocked the breath out of him  whats that for he said angrily when he recovered himself but i noticed he did not draw any nearer to muldoon than was necessary  muldoon never answered but discoursed to himself in the whining grunt that he uses when he is going downhill in front of a heavy load we call it singing but i think its something much worse really the yellow horse blustered and squealed a little and at last said that if it was a horsefly that had stung muldoon he would accept an apology  youll get it said muldoon in de sweet byandbyeall de apology youve any use for excuse me interruptin you mr rod but im like tweezyive a southern drawback in me hind legs  naow i want you all here to take notice an youll learn something rod went on this yallerbacked skate comes to our

rick is a sunnytempered child who never bears malice and i dont think he quite understood he gets his temper from his mother as a horse should  ive been there too rod said tedda open confessions good

one kick hes beneath our contempt  let him talk said marcus its always interestin to know what another horse thinks it dont tech us  an he talks so too said tuck ive never heard anythin so smart for a

hope an trust my friendsll take a ticket fer me  bet your natchul said muldoon cheerfully and the horses scattered before us trotting into the ravine  next morning we sent back to the liverystable what was left of the yellow horse it seemed tired but anxious to go      the ship that found herself   it was her first voyage and though she was but a cargosteamer of twentyfive hundred tons she was the very best of her kind the outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in framework and machinery and her designers and owner thought as much of her as though she had been the lucania any one can make a floating hotel that will pay expenses if he puts enough money into the saloon and charges for private baths suites of rooms and such like but in these days of competition and low freights every square inch of a cargoboat must be built for cheapness great holdcapacity and a certain steady speed this boat was perhaps two hundred and forty feet long and thirtytwo feet wide with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds her ownersthey were a very well known scotch firmcame round with her from the north where she had been launched and christened and fitted to liverpool where she was to take cargo for new york and the owners daughter miss frazier went to and fro on the clean decks admiring the new paint and the brass work and the patent winches and particularly the strong straight bow over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne when she named the steamer the dimbula it was a beautiful september afternoon and the boat in all her newnessshe was painted leadcolour with a red funnellooked very fine indeed her houseflag was flying and her whistle from time to time acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats who saw that she was new to the high and narrow seas and wished to make her welcome  and now said miss frazier delightedly to the captain shes a real ship isnt she it seems only the other day father gave the order for her and nowand nowisnt she a beauty the girl was proud of the firm and talked as though she were the controlling partner  oh shes no so bad the skipper replied cautiously but im sayin that it takes more than christenin to mak a ship in the nature o things miss frazier if ye follow me shes just irons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship she has to find herself yet  i thought father said she was exceptionally well found  so she is said the skipper with a laugh but its this way wi ships miss frazier shes all here but the parrts of her have not learned to work together yet theyve had no chance  the engines are working beautifully i can hear them  yes indeed but theres more than engines to a ship every inch of her yell understand has to be livened up and made to work wi its neighboursweetenin her we call it technically  and how will you do it the girl asked  we can no more than drive and steer her and so forth but if we have rough weather this tripits likelyshell learn the rest by heart for a ship yell obsairve miss frazier is in no sense a reegid body closed at both ends shes a highly complex structure o various an conflictin strains wi tissues that must give an tak accordin to her personal modulus of elasteecity mr buchanan the chief engineer was coming towards them im sayin to miss frazier here that our little dimbula has to be sweetened yet and nothin but a gale will do it hows all wi your engines buck  well enoughtrue by plumb an rule o course but theres no spontaneeity yet he turned to the girl take my word miss frazier and maybe yell comprehend later even after a pretty girls christened a ship it does not follow that theres such a thing as a ship under the men that work her  i was sayin the very same mr buchanan the skipper interrupted  thats more metaphysical than i can follow said miss frazier laughing  why so yere good scotch ani knew your mothers father he was fra dumfriesyeve a vested right in metapheesics miss frazier just as ye have in the dimbula the engineer said  eh well we must go down to the deep watters an earn miss frazier her deevidends will you not come to my cabin for tea said the skipper well be in dock the night and when youre goin back to glasgie ye can think of us loadin her down an drivin her forthall for your sake  in the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons deadweight into the dimbula and took her out from liverpool as soon as she met the lift of the open water she naturally began to talk if you lay your ear to the side of the cabin the next time you are in a steamer you will hear hundreds of little voices in every direction thrilling and buzzing and whispering and popping and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking exactly like a telephone in a thunderstorm wooden ships shriek and growl and grunt but iron vessels throb and quiver through all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets the dimbula was very strongly built and every piece of her had a letter or a number or both to describe it and every piece had been hammered or forged or rolled or punched by man and had lived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months therefore every piece had its own separate voice in exact proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it castiron as a rule says very little but mild steel plates and wroughtiron and ribs and beams that have been much bent and welded and riveted talk continuously their conversation of course is not half as wise as our human talk because they are all though they do not know it bound down one to the other in a black darkness where they cannot tell what is happening near them nor what will overtake them next  as soon as she had cleared the irish coast a sullen greyheaded old wave of the atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight bows and sat down on the steamcapstan used for hauling up the anchor now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and green besides which nobody likes being ducked  dont you do that again the capstan sputtered through the teeth of his cogs hi wheres the fellow gone  the wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle but plenty more where he came from said a brotherwave and went through and over the capstan who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron deckbeams below  cant you keep still up there said the deckbeams whats the matter with you one minute you weigh twice as much as you ought to and the next you dont  it isnt my fault said the capstan theres a green brute outside that comes and hits me on the head  tell that to the shipwrights youve been in position for months and youve never wriggled like this before if you arent careful youll strain us  talking of strain said a low rasping unpleasant voice are any of you fellowsyou deckbeams we meanaware that those exceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our structureours  who might you be the deckbeams inquired  oh nobody in particular was the answer were only the port and starboard upperdeck stringers and if you persist in heaving and hiking like this we shall be reluctantly compelled to take steps  now the stringers of the ship are long iron girders so to speak that run lengthways from stern to bow they keep the iron frames what are called ribs in a wooden ship in place and also help to hold the ends of the deckbeams which go from side to side of the ship stringers always consider themselves most important because they are so long  you will take stepswill you this was a long echoing rumble it came from the framesscores and scores of them each one about eighteen inches distant from the next and each riveted to the stringers in four places we think you will have a certain amount of trouble in that and thousands and thousands of the little rivets that held everything together whispered you will you will stop quivering and be quiet hold on brethren hold on hot punches whats that  rivets have no teeth so they cannot chatter with fright but they did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship from stern to bow and she shook like a rat in a terriers mouth  an unusually severe pitch for the sea was rising had lifted the big throbbing screw nearly to the surface and it was spinning round in a kind of sodawaterhalf sea and half airgoing much faster than was proper because there was no deep water for it to work in as it sank again the enginesand they were triple expansion three cylinders in a rowsnorted through all their three pistons was that a joke you fellow outside its an uncommonly poor one how are we to do our work if you fly off the handle that way  i didnt fly off the handle said the screw twirling huskily at the end of the screwshaft if i had youd have been scrapiron by this time the sea dropped away from under me and i had nothing to catch on to thats all  thats all dyou call it said the thrustblock whose business it is to take the push of the screw for if a screw had nothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the engineroom it is the holding back of the screwing action that gives the drive to a ship i know i do my work deep down and out of sight but i warn you i expect justice all i ask for is bare justice why cant you push steadily and evenly instead of whizzing like a whirligig and making me hot under all my collars the thrustblock had six collars each faced with brass and he did not wish to get them heated  all the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screwshaft as it ran to the stern whispered justicegive us justice  i can only give you what i can get the screw answered look out its coming again  he rose with a roar as the dimbula plunged and whackflackwhack whack went the engines furiously for they had little to check them  im the noblest outcome of human ingenuitymr buchanan says so squealed the highpressure cylinder this is simply ridiculous the piston went up savagely and choked for half the steam behind it was mixed with dirty water help oiler fitter stoker help im choking it gasped never in the history of maritime invention has such a calamity overtaken one so young and strong and if i go whos to drive the ship  hush oh hush whispered the steam who of course had been to sea many times before he used to spend his leisure ashore in a cloud or a gutter or a flowerpot or a thunderstorm or anywhere else where water was needed thats only a little priming a little carryingover as they call it itll happen all night on and off i dont say its nice but its the best we can do under the circumstances  what difference can circumstances make im here to do my workon clean dry steam blow circumstances the cylinder roared  the circumstances will attend to the blowing ive worked on the north atlantic run a good many timesits going to be rough before morning  it isnt distressingly calm now said the extra strong framesthey were called webframesin the engineroom theres an upward thrust that we dont understand and theres a twist that is very bad for our brackets and diamondplates and theres a sort of westnorthwesterly pull that follows the twist which seriously annoys us we mention this because we happened to cost a good deal of money and we feel sure that the owner would not approve of our being treated in this frivolous way  im afraid the matter is out of owners hands for the present said the steam slipping into the condenser youre left to your own devices till the weather betters  i wouldnt mind the weather said a flat bass voice below its this confounded cargo thats breaking my heart im the garboardstrake and im twice as thick as most of the others and i ought to know something  the garboardstrake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship and the dimbulas garboardstrake was nearly threequarters of an inch mild steel  the sea pushes me up in a way i should never have expected the strake grunted and the cargo pushes me down and between the two i dont know what im supposed to do  when in doubt hold on rumbled the steam making head in the boilers  yes but theres only dark and cold and hurry down here and how do i know whether the other plates are doing their duty those bulwarkplates up above ive heard aint more than fivesixteenths of an inch thickscandalous i call it  i agree with you said a huge webframe by the main cargohatch he was deeper and thicker than all the others and curved halfway across the ship in the shape of half an arch to support the deck where deckbeams would have been in the way of cargo coming up and down i work entirely unsupported and i observe that i am the sole strength of this vessel so far as my vision extends the responsibility i assure you is enormous i believe the moneyvalue of the cargo is over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds think of that  and every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions here spoke a seavalve that communicated directly with the water outside and was seated not very far from the garboardstrake i rejoice to think that i am a princehyde valve with best para rubber facings five patents cover mei mention this without pridefive separate and several patents each one finer than the other at present i am screwed fast should i open you would immediately be swamped this is incontrovertible  patent things always use the longest words they can it is a trick that they pick up from their inventors  thats news said a big centrifugal bilgepump i had an idea that you were employed to clean decks and things with at least ive used you for that more than once i forget the precise number in thousands of gallons which i am guaranteed to throw per hour but i assure you my complaining friends that there is not the least danger i alone am capable of clearing any water that may find its way here by my biggest deliveries we pitched then  the sea was getting up in workmanlike style it was a dead westerly gale blown from under a ragged opening of green sky narrowed on all sides by fat grey clouds and the wind bit like pincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of the waves  i tell you what it is the foremast telephoned down its wirestays im up here and i can take a dispassionate view of things theres an organised conspiracy against us im sure of it because every single one of these waves is heading directly for our bows the whole sea is concerned in itand sos the wind its awful  whats awful said a wave drowning the capstan for the hundredth time  this organised conspiracy on your part the capstan gurgled taking his cue from the mast organised bubbles and spindrift there has been a depression in the gulf of mexico excuse me he leaped overside but his friends took up the tale one after another  which has advanced that wave hove green water over the funnel  as far as cape hatteras he drenched the bridge  and is now going out to seato seato sea the third went out in three surges making a clean sweep of a boat which turned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside while the broken falls whipped the davits  thats all there is to it seethed the white water roaring through the scuppers theres no animus in our proceedings were only meteorological corollaries  is it going to get any worse said the bowanchor chained down to the deck where he could only breathe once in five minutes  not knowing cant say wind may blow a bit by midnight thanks awfully goodbye  the wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft and found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships which was a welldeck sunk between high bulwarks one of the bulwarkplates which was hung on hinges to open outward had swung out and passed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean smack  evidently thats what im made for said the plate closing again with a sputter of pride oh no you dont my friend the top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside but as the plate did not open in that direction the defeated water spurted back  not bad for fivesixteenths of an inch said the bulwarkplate my work i see is laid down for the night and it began opening and shutting as it was designed to do with the motion of the ship  we are not what you might call idle groaned all the frames together as the dimbula climbed a big wave lay on her side at the top and shot into the next hollow twisting in the descent a huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle and her bow and stern hung free with nothing to support them then one joking wave caught her up at the bow and another at the stern while the rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how she would like it so she was held up at her two ends only and the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning iron keels and bilgestringers  ease off ease off there roared the garboardstrake i want oneeighth of an inch fair play d you hear me you rivets  ease off ease off cried the bilgestringers dont hold us so tight to the frames  ease off grunted the deckbeams as the dimbula rolled fearfully youve cramped our knees into the stringers and we cant move ease off you flatheaded little nuisances  then two converging seas hit the bows one on each side and fell away in torrents of streaming thunder  ease off shouted the forward collisionbulkhead i want to crumple up but im stiffened in every direction ease off you dirty little forgefilings let me breathe  all the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames and make the outside skin of every steamer echoed the call for each plate wanted to shift and creep a little and each plate according to its position complained against the rivets  we cant help it we cant help it they murmured in reply were put here to hold you and were going to do it you never pull us twice in the same direction if youd say what you were going to do next wed try to meet your views  as far as i could feel said the upperdeck planking and that was four inches thick every single iron near me was pushing or pulling in opposite directions now whats the sense of that my friends let us all pull together  pull any way you please roared the funnel so long as you dont try your experiments on me i need fourteen wireropes all pulling in different directions to hold me steady isnt that so  we believe you my boy whistled the funnelstays through their clinched teeth as they twanged in the wind from the top of the funnel to the deck  nonsense we must all pull together the decks repeated pull lengthways  very good said the stringers then stop pushing sideways when you get wet be content to run gracefully fore and aft and curve in at the ends as we do  nono curves at the end a very slight workmanlike curve from side to side with a good grip at each knee and little pieces welded on said the deckbeams  fiddle cried the iron pillars of the deep dark hold who ever heard of curves stand up straight be a perfectly round column and carry tons of good solid weightlike that there a big sea smashed on the deck above and the pillars stiffened themselves to the load  straight up and down is not bad said the frames who ran that way in the sides of the ship but you must also expand yourselves sideways expansion is the law of life children open out open out  come back said the deckbeams savagely as the upward heave of the sea made the frames try to open come back to your bearings you slackjawed irons  rigidity rigidity rigidity thumped the engines absolute unvarying rigidityrigidity  you see whined the rivets in chorus no two of you will ever pull alike andand you blame it all on us we only know how to go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it cant and mustnt and shant move  ive got one fraction of an inch play at any rate said the garboardstrake triumphantly so he had and all the bottom of the ship felt the easier for it  then were no good sobbed the bottom rivets we were orderedwe were orderednever to give and weve given and the sea will come in and well all go to the bottom together first were blamed for everything unpleasant and now we havent the consolation of having done our work  dont say i told you whispered the steam consolingly but between you and me and the last cloud i came from it was bound to happen sooner or later you had to give a fraction and youve given without knowing it now hold on as before  whats the use a few hundred rivets chattered weve givenweve given and the sooner we confess that we cant keep the ship together and go off our little heads the easier it will be no rivet forged can stand this strain  no one rivet was ever meant to share it among you the steam answered  the others can have my share im going to pull out said a rivet in one of the forward plates  if you go others will follow hissed the steam theres nothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going why i knew a little chap like youhe was an eighth of an inch fatter thoughon a steamerto be sure she was only twelve hundred tons now i come to think of it in exactly the same place as you are he pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea not half as bad as this and he started all his friends on the same buttstrap and the plates opened like a furnace door and i had to climb into the nearest fogbank while the boat went down  now thats peculiarly disgraceful said the rivet fatter than me was he and in a steamer not half our tonnage reedy little peg i blush for the family sir he settled himself more firmly than ever in his place and the steam chuckled  you see he went on quite gravely a rivet and especially a rivet in your position is really the one indispensable part of the ship  the steam did not say that he had whispered the very same thing to every single piece of iron aboard there is no sense in telling too much  and all that while the little dimbula pitched and chopped and swung and slewed and lay down as though she were going to die and got up as though she had been stung and threw her nose round and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped for the gale was at its worst it was inky black in spite of the tearing white froth on the waves and to top everything the rain began to fall in sheets so that you could not see your hand before your face this did not make much difference to the ironwork below but it troubled the foremast a good deal  now its all finished he said dismally the conspiracy is too strong for us there is nothing left but to  hurraar brrrraaah brrrrrrp roared the steam through the foghorn till the decks quivered dont be frightened below its only me just throwing out a few words in case any one happens to be rolling round tonight  you dont mean to say theres any one except us on the sea in such weather said the funnel in a husky snuffle  scores of em said the steam clearing its throat rrrrrraaa brraaaaa prrrrp its a trifle windy up here and great boilers how it rains  were drowning said the scuppers they had been doing nothing else all night but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed to be the end of the world  thats all right well be easier in an hour or two first the wind and then the rain soon you may make sail again grrraaaaaah drrrraaaa drrrp i have a notion that the sea is going down already if it does youll learn something about rolling weve only pitched till now by the way arent you chaps in the hold a little easier than you were  there was just as much groaning and straining as ever but it was not so loud or squeaky in tone and when the ship quivered she did not jar stiffly like a poker hit on the floor but gave with a supple little waggle like a perfectly balanced golfclub  we have made a most amazing discovery said the stringers one after another a discovery that entirely changes the situation we have found for the first time in the history of shipbuilding that the inward pull of the deckbeams and the outward thrust of the frames locks us as it were more closely in our places and enables us to endure a strain which is entirely without parallel in the records of marine architecture  the steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the foghorn what massive intellects you great stringers have he said softly when he had finished  we also began the deckbeams are discoverers and geniuses we are of opinion that the support of the holdpillars materially helps us we find that we lock up on them when we are subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above  here the dimbula shot down a hollow lying almost on her side righting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm  in these casesare you aware of this steamthe plating at the bows and particularly at the sternwe would also mention the floors beneath ushelp us to resist any tendency to spring the frames spoke in the solemn awed voice which people use when they have just come across something entirely new for the very first time  im only a poor puffy little flutterer said the steam but i have to stand a good deal of pressure in my business its all tremendously interesting tell us some more you fellows are so strong  watch us and youll see said the bowplates proudly ready behind there heres the father and mother of waves coming sit tight rivets all a great sluicing comber thundered by but through the scuffle and confusion the steam could hear the low quick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took themcries like these easy noweasy now push for all your strength hold out give a fraction hold up pull in shove crossways mind the strain at the ends grip now bite tight let the water get away from underand there she goes  the wave raced off into the darkness shouting not bad that if its your first run and the drenched and ducked ship throbbed to the beat of the engines inside her all three cylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down through the engineroom hatch there was white fur on the canvasbound steampipes and even the brightwork deep below was speckled and soiled but the cylinders had learned to make the most of steam that was half water and were pounding along cheerfully  hows the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it said the steam as he whirled through the engineroom  nothing for nothing in this world of woe the cylinders answered as though they had been working for centuries and precious little for seventyfive pounds head weve made two knots this last hour and a quarter rather humiliating for eight hundred horsepower isnt it  well its better than drifting astern at any rate you seem rather lesshow shall i put itstiff in the back than you were  if youd been hammered as weve been this night you wouldnt be stiffiffiff either theoretirettirettically of course rigidity is the thing purrrpurrpractically there has to be a little give and take we found that out by working on our sides for five minutes at a stretchchchchh hows the weather  seas going down fast said the steam  good business said the highpressure cylinder whack her up boys theyve given us five pounds more steam and he began humming the first bars of said the young obadiah to the old obadiah which as you may have noticed is a pet tune among engines not built for high speed racingliners with twinscrews sing the turkish patrol and the overture to the bronze horse and madame angot till something goes wrong and then they render gounods funeral march of a marionette with variations  youll learn a song of your own some fine day said the steam as he flew up the foghorn for one last bellow  next day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little and the dimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron in her was sick and giddy but luckily they did not all feel ill at the same time otherwise she would have opened out like a wet paper box  the steam whistled warnings as he went about his business it is in this short quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea that most of the accidents happen for then everything thinks that the worst is over and goes off guard so he orated and chattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and things had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another and endure this new kind of strain  they found ample time to practise for they were sixteen days at sea and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of new york the dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with salt and red rust her funnel was dirtygrey from top to bottom two boats had been carried away three copper ventilators looked like hats after a fight with the police the bridge had a dimple in the middle of it the house that covered the steam steeringgear was split as with hatchets there was a bill for small repairs in the engineroom almost as long as the screwshaft the forward cargohatch fell into bucketstaves when they raised the iron crossbars and the steamcapstan had been badly wrenched on its bed altogether as the skipper said it was a pretty general average  but shes soupled he said to mr buchanan for all her deadweight she rode like a yacht ye mind that last blow off the banksi am proud of her buck  its vera good said the chief engineer looking along the dishevelled decks now a man judgin superfeecially would say we were a wreck but we know otherwiseby experience  naturally everything in the dimbula fairly stiffened with pride and the foremast and the forward collisionbulkhead who are pushing creatures begged the steam to warn the port of new york of their arrival tell those big boats all about us they said they seem to take us quite as a matter of course  it was a glorious clear dead calm morning and in single file with less than half a mile between each their bands playing and their tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs were the majestic the paris the touraine the servia the kaiser wilhelm ii and the werkendam all statelily going out to sea as the dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way the steam who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition of himself now and then shouted  oyez oyez oyez princes dukes and barons of the high seas know ye by these presents we are the dimbula fifteen days nine hours from liverpool having crossed the atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for the first time in our career we have not foundered we are here eer eer we are not disabled but we have had a time wholly unparalleled in the annals of shipbuilding our decks were swept we pitched we rolled we thought we were going to die hi hi but we didnt we wish to give notice that we have come to new york all the way across the atlantic through the worst weather in the world and we are the dimbula we arearrhahaharrr  the beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the procession of the seasons the dimbula heard the majestic say hmph and the paris grunted how and the touraine said oui with a little coquettish flicker of steam and the servia said haw and the kaiser and the werkendam said hoch dutch fashionand that was absolutely all  i did my best said the steam gravely but i dont think they were much impressed with us somehow do you  its simply disgusting said the bowplates they might have seen what weve been through there isnt a ship on the sea that has suffered as we haveis there now  well i wouldnt go so far as that said the steam because ive worked on some of those boats and sent them through weather quite as bad as the fortnight that weve had in six days and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons i believe now ive seen the majestic for instance ducked from her bows to her funnel and ive helped the arizona i think she was to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night and i had to run out of the pariss engineroom one day because there was thirty foot of water in it of course i dont deny the steam shut off suddenly as a tugboat loaded with a political club and a brass band that had been to see a new york senator off to europe crossed their bows going to hoboken there was a long silence that reached without a break from the cutwater to the propellerblades of the dimbula  then a new big voice said slowly and thickly as though the owner had just waked up its my conviction that i have made a fool of myself  the steam knew what had happened at once for when a ship finds herself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts into one voice which is the soul of the ship  who are you he said with a laugh i am the dimbula of course ive never been anything else except thatand a fool  the tugboat which was doing its very best to be run down got away just in time its band playing clashily and brassily a popular but impolite air            in the days of old ramesesare you on           in the days of old ramesesare you on           in the days of old rameses           that story had paresis           are you onare you onare you on  well im glad youve found yourself said the steam to tell the truth i was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and stringers heres quarantine after that well go to our wharf and clean up a little andnext month well do it all over again     the tomb of his ancestors   some people will tell you that if there were but a single loaf of bread in all india it would be divided equally between the plowdens the trevors the beadons and the rivettcarnacs that is only one way of saying that certain families serve india generation after generation as dolphins follow in line across the open sea  let us take a small and obscure case there has been at least one representative of the devonshire chinns in or near central india since the days of lieutenantfireworker humphrey chinn of the bombay european regiment who assisted at the capture of seringapatam in 1799 alfred ellis chinn humphreys younger brother commanded a regiment of bombay grenadiers from 1804 to 1813 when he saw some mixed fighting and in 1834 john chinn of the same familywe will call him john chinn the firstcame to light as a levelheaded administrator in time of trouble at a place called mundesur he died young but left his mark on the new country and the honourable the board of directors of the honourable the east india company embodied his virtues in a stately resolution and paid for the expenses of his tomb among the satpura hills  he was succeeded by his son lionel chinn who left the little old devonshire home just in time to be severely wounded in the mutiny he spent his working life within a hundred and fifty miles of john chinns grave and rose to the command of a regiment of small wild hillmen most of whom had known his father his son john was born in the small thatchedroofed mudwalled cantonment which is even today eighty miles from the nearest railway in the heart of a scrubby tigerish country colonel lionel chinn served thirty years and retired in the canal his steamer passed the outwardbound troopship carrying his son eastward to the family duty  the chinns are luckier than most folk because they know exactly what they must do a clever chinn passes for the bombay civil service and gets away to central india where everybody is glad to see him a dull chinn enters the police department or the woods and forest and sooner or later he too appears in central india and that is what gave rise to the saying central india is inhabited by bhils mairs and chinns all very much alike the breed is smallboned dark and silent and the stupidest of them are good shots john chinn the second was rather clever but as the eldest son he entered the army according to chinn tradition his duty was to abide in his fathers regiment for the term of his natural life though the corps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid they were irregulars small dark and blackish clothed in riflegreen with blackleather trimmings and friends called them the wuddars which means a race of lowcaste people who dig up rats to eat but the wuddars did not resent it they were the only wuddars and their points of pride were these  firstly they had fewer english officers than any native regiment secondly their subalterns were not mounted on parade as is the general rule but walked at the head of their men a man who can hold his own with the wuddars at their quickstep must be sound in wind and limb thirdly they were the most pukka shikarries outandout hunters in all india fourthlyup to onehundredthlythey were the wuddarschinns irregular bhil levies of the old days but now henceforward and for ever the wuddars  no englishman entered their mess except for love or through family usage the officers talked to their soldiers in a tongue not two hundred white folk in india understood and the men were their children all drawn from the bhils who are perhaps the strangest of the many strange races in india they were and at heart are wild men furtive shy full of untold superstitions the races whom we call natives of the country found the bhil in possession of the land when they first broke into that part of the world thousands of years ago the books call them prearyan aboriginal dravidian and so forth and in other words that is what the bhils call themselves when a rajput chief whose bards can sing his pedigree backwards for twelve hundred years is set on the throne his investiture is not complete till he has been marked on the forehead with blood from the veins of a bhil the rajputs say the ceremony has no meaning but the bhil knows that it is the last last shadow of his old rights as the longago owner of the soil  centuries of oppression and massacre made the bhil a cruel and halfcrazy thief and cattlestealer and when the english came he seemed to be almost as open to civilisation as the tigers of his own jungles but john chinn the first father of lionel grandfather of our john went into his country lived with him learned his language shot the deer that stole his poor crops and won his confidence so that some bhils learned to plough and sow while others were coaxed into the companys service to police their friends  when they understood that standing in line did not mean instant execution they accepted soldiering as a cumbrous but amusing kind of sport and were zealous to keep the wild bhils under control that was the thin edge of the wedge john chinn the first gave them written promises that if they were good from a certain date the government would overlook previous offences and since john chinn was never known to break his wordhe promised once to hang a bhil locally esteemed invulnerable and hanged him in front of his tribe for seven proved murdersthe bhils settled down as steadily as they knew how it was slow unseen work of the sort that is being done all over india today and though john chinns only reward came as i have said in the shape of a grave at government expense the little people of the hills never forgot him  colonel lionel chinn knew and loved them too and they were very fairly civilised for bhils before his service ended many of them could hardly be distinguished from lowcaste hindoo farmers but in the south where john chinn the first was buried the wildest still clung to the satpura ranges cherishing a legend that some day jan chinn as they called him would return to his own in the mean time they mistrusted the white man and his ways the least excitement would stampede them plundering at random and now and then killing but if they were handled discreetly they grieved like children and promised never to do it again  the bhils of the regimentthe uniformed menwere virtuous in many ways but they needed humouring they felt bored and homesick unless taken after tiger as beaters and their coldblooded daringall wuddars shoot tigers on foot it is their castemarkmade even the officers wonder they would follow up a wounded tiger as unconcernedly as though it were a sparrow with a broken wing and this through a country full of caves and rifts and pits where a wild beast could hold a dozen men at his mercy now and then some little man was brought to barracks with his head smashed in or his ribs torn away but his companions never learned caution they contented themselves with settling the tiger  young john chinn was decanted at the verandah of the wuddars lonely messhouse from the back seat of a twowheeled cart his guncases cascading all round him the slender little hookeynosed boy looked forlorn as a strayed goat when he slapped the white dust off his knees and the cart jolted down the glaring road but in his heart he was contented after all this was the place where he had been born and things were not much changed since he had been sent to england a child fifteen years ago  there were a few new buildings but the air and the smell and the sunshine were the same and the little green men who crossed the paradeground looked very familiar three weeks ago john chinn would have said he did not remember a word of the bhil tongue but at the mess door he found his lips moving in sentences that he did not understandbits of old nursery rhymes and tailends of such orders as his father used to give the men  the colonel watched him come up the steps and laughed  look he said to the major no need to ask the young uns breed hes a pukka chinn might be his father in the fifties over again  hope hell shoot as straight said the major hes brought enough ironmongery with him  wouldnt be a chinn if he didnt watch him blowin his nose regular chinn beak flourishes his handkerchief like his father its the second editionline for line  fairy tale by jove said the major peering through the slats of the jalousies if hes the lawful heir hell now old chinn could no more pass that chick without fiddling with it than  his son said the colonel jumping up  well i be blowed said the major the boys eye had been caught by a splitreed screen that hung on a slew between the veranda pillars and mechanically he had tweaked the edge to set it level old chinn had sworn three times a day at that screen for many years he could never get it to his satisfaction  his son entered the anteroom in the middle of a fivefold silence they made him welcome for his fathers sake and as they took stock of him for his own he was ridiculously like the portrait of the colonel on the wall and when he had washed a little of the dust from his throat he went to his quarters with the old mans short noiseless junglestep  so much for heredity said the major that comes of four generations among the bhils  and the men know it said a wing officer theyve been waiting for this youth with their tongues hanging out i am persuaded that unless he absolutely beats em over the head theyll lie down by companies and worship him  nothin like havin a father before you said the major im a parvenu with my chaps ive only been twenty years in the regiment and my revered parent he was a simple squire theres no getting at the bottom of a bhils mind now why is the superior bearer that young chinn brought with him fleeing across country with his bundle he stepped into the verandah and shouted after the mana typical newjoined subalterns servant who speaks english and cheats in proportion  what is it he called  plenty bad man here i going sar was the reply have taken sahibs keys and say will shoot  doocid luciddoocid convincin how those upcountry thieves can leg it he has been badly frightened by some one the major strolled to his quarters to dress for mess  young chinn walking like a man in a dream had fetched a compass round the entire cantonment before going to his own tiny cottage the captains quarters in which he had been born delayed him for a little then he looked at the well on the paradeground where he had sat of evenings with his nurse and at the tenbyfourteen church where the officers went to service if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come along it seemed very small as compared with the gigantic buildings he used to stare up at but it was the same place  from time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers who saluted they might have been the very men who had carried him on their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers a faint light burned in his room and as he entered hands clasped his feet and a voice murmured from the floor  who is it said young chinn not knowing he spoke in the bhil tongue  i bore you in my arms sahib when i was a strong man and you were a small onecrying crying crying i am your servant as i was your fathers before you we are all your servants  young chinn could not trust himself to reply and the voice went on  i have taken your keys from that fat foreigner and sent him away and the studs are in the shirt for mess who should know if i do not know and so the baby has become a man and forgets his nurse but my nephew shall make a good servant or i will beat him twice a day  then there rose up with a rattle as straight as a bhil arrow a little whitehaired wizened ape of a man with medals and orders on his tunic stammering saluting and trembling behind him a young and wiry bhil in uniform was taking the trees out of chinns messboots  chinns eyes were full of tears the old man held out his keys  foreigners are bad people he will never come back again we are all servants of your fathers son has the sahib forgotten who took him to see the trapped tiger in the village across the river when his mother was so frightened and he was so brave  the scene came back to chinn in great magiclantern flashes bukta he cried and all in a breath you promised nothing should hurt me is it bukta  the man was at his feet a second time he has not forgotten he remembers his own people as his father remembered now can i die but first i will live and show the sahib how to kill tigers that that yonder is my nephew if he is not a good servant beat him and send him to me and i will surely kill him for now the sahib is with his own people ai jan habajan haba my jan haba i will stay here and see that this does his work well take off his boots fool sit down upon the bed sahib and let me look it is jan haba  he pushed forward the hilt of his sword as a sign of service which is an honour paid only to viceroys governors generals or to little children whom one loves dearly chinn touched the hilt mechanically with three fingers muttering he knew not what it happened to be the old answer of his childhood when bukta in jest called him the little general sahib  the majors quarters were opposite chinns and when he heard his servant gasp with surprise he looked across the room then the major sat on the bed and whistled for the spectacle of the senior native commissioned officer of the regiment an unmixed bhil a companion of the order of british india with thirtyfive years spotless service in the army and a rank among his own people superior to that of many bengal princelings valeting the lastjoined subaltern was a little too much for his nerves  the throaty bugles blew the messcall that has a long legend behind it first a few piercing notes like the shrieks of beaters in a faraway cover and next large full and smooth the refrain of the wild song and oh and oh the green pulse of mundoremundore  all little children were in bed when the sahib heard that call last said bukta passing chinn a clean handkerchief the call brought back memories of his cot under the mosquitonetting his mothers kiss and the sound of footsteps growing fainter as he dropped asleep among his men so he hooked the dark collar of his new messjacket and went to dinner like a prince who has newly inherited his fathers crown  old bukta swaggered forth curling his whiskers he knew his own value and no money and no rank within the gift of the government would have induced him to put studs in young officers shirts or to hand them clean ties yet when he took off his uniform that night and squatted among his fellows for a quiet smoke he told them what he had done and they said that he was entirely right thereat bukta propounded a theory which to a white mind would have seemed raving insanity but the whispering levelheaded little men of war considered it from every point of view and thought that there might be a great deal in it  at mess under the oillamps the talk turned as usual to the unfailing subject of shikarbig gameshooting of every kind and under all sorts of conditions young chinn opened his eyes when he understood that each one of his companions had shot several tigers in the wuddar styleon foot that ismaking no more of the business than if the brute had been a dog  in nine cases out of ten said the major a tiger is almost as dangerous as a porcupine but the tenth time you come home feet first  that set all talking and long before midnight chinns brain was in a whirl with stories of tigersmaneaters and cattlekillers each pursuing his own business as methodically as clerks in an office new tigers that had lately come into suchandsuch a district and old friendly beasts of great cunning known by nicknames in the messsuch as puggy who was lazy with huge paws and mrs malaprop who turned up when you never expected her and made female noises then they spoke of bhil superstitions a wide and picturesque field till young chinn hinted that they must be pulling his leg  deed we arent said a man on his left we know all about you youre a chinn and all that and youve a sort of vested right here but if you dont believe what were telling you what will you do when old bukta begins his stories he knows about ghosttigers and tigers that go to a hell of their own and tigers that walk on their hind feet and your grandpapas ridingtiger as well odd he hasnt spoken of that yet  you know youve an ancestor buried down satpura way dont you said the major as chinn smiled irresolutely  of course i do said chinn who had the chronicle of the book of chinn by heart it lies in a worn old ledger on the chinese lacquer table behind the piano in the devonshire home and the children are allowed to look at it on sundays  well i wasnt sure your revered ancestor my boy according to the bhils has a tiger of his owna saddletiger that he rides round the country whenever he feels inclined i dont call it decent in an excollectors ghost but that is what the southern bhils believe even our men who might be called moderately cool dont care to beat that country if they hear that jan chinn is running about on his tiger it is supposed to be a clouded animalnot stripy but blotchy like a tortoiseshell tomcat no end of a brute it is and a sure sign of war or pestilence oror something theres a nice family legend for you  whats the origin of it d you suppose said chinn  ask the satpura bhils old jan chinn was a mighty hunter before the lord perhaps it was the tigers revenge or perhaps hes huntin em still you must go to his tomb one of these days and inquire bukta will probably attend to that he was asking me before you came whether by any illluck you had already bagged your tiger if not he is going to enter you under his own wing of course for you of all men its imperative youll have a firstclass time with bukta  the major was not wrong bukta kept an anxious eye on young chinn at drill and it was noticeable that the first time the new officer lifted up his voice in an order the whole line quivered even the colonel was taken aback for it might have been lionel chinn returned from devonshire with a new lease of life bukta had continued to develop his peculiar theory among his intimates and it was accepted as a matter of faith in the lines since every word and gesture on young chinns part so confirmed it  the old man arranged early that his darling should wipe out the reproach of not having shot a tiger but he was not content to take the first or any beast that happened to arrive in his own villages he dispensed the high low and middle justice and when his peoplenaked and flutteredcame to him with word of a beast marked down he bade them send spies to the kills and the wateringplaces that he might be sure the quarry was such an one as suited the dignity of such a man  three or four times the reckless trackers returned most truthfully saying that the beast was mangy undersizeda tigress worn with nursing or a brokentoothed old maleand bukta would curb young chinns impatience  at last a noble animal was marked downa tenfoot cattlekiller with a huge roll of loose skin along the belly glossyhided fullfrilled about the neck whiskered frisky and young he had slain a man in pure sport they said  let him be fed quoth bukta and the villagers dutifully drove out a cow to amuse him that he might lie up near by  princes and potentates have taken ship to india and spent great moneys for the mere glimpse of beasts onehalf as fine as this of buktas  it is not good said he to the colonel when he asked for shootingleave that my colonels son who may bethat my colonels son should lose his maidenhead on any small jungle beast that may come after i have waited long for this which is a tiger he has come in from the mair country in seven days we will return with the skin  the mess gnashed their teeth enviously bukta had he chosen might have invited them all but he went out alone with chinn two days in a shootingcart and a day on foot till they came to a rocky glary valley with a pool of good water in it it was a parching day and the boy very naturally stripped and went in for a bathe leaving bukta by the clothes a white skin shows far against brown jungle and what bukta beheld on chinns back and right shoulder dragged him forward step by step with staring eyeballs  id forgotten it isnt decent to strip before a man of his position said chinn flouncing in the water how the little devil stares what is it bukta the mark was the whispered answer  it is nothing you know how it is with my people chinn was annoyed the dullred birthmark on his shoulder something like a conventionalised tartar cloud had slipped his memory or he would not have bathed it occurred so they said at home in alternate generations appearing curiously enough eight or nine years after birth and save that it was part of the chinn inheritance would not be considered pretty he hurried ashore dressed again and went on till they met two or three bhils who promptly fell on their faces my people grunted bukta not condescending to notice them and so your people sahib when i was a young man we were fewer but not so weak now we are many but poor stock as may be remembered how will you shoot him sahib from a tree from a shelter which my people shall build by day or by night  on foot and in the daytime said young chinn  that was your custom as i have heard said bukta to himself i will get news of him then you and i will go to him i will carry one gun you have yours there is no need of more what tiger shall stand against thee  he was marked down by a little waterhole at the head of a ravine fullgorged and half asleep in the may sunlight he was walked up like a partridge and he turned to do battle for his life bukta made no motion to raise his rifle but kept his eyes on chinn who met the shattering roar of the charge with a single shotit seemed to him hours as he sightedwhich tore through the throat smashing the backbone below the neck and between the shoulders the brute couched choked and fell and before chinn knew well what had happened bukta bade him stay still while he paced the distance between his feet and the ringing jaws  fifteen said bukta short paces no need for a second shot sahib he bleeds cleanly where he lies and we need not spoil the skin i said there would be no need of these but they camein case  suddenly the sides of the ravine were crowned with the heads of buktas peoplea force that could have blown the ribs out of the beast had chinns shot failed but their guns were hidden and they appeared as interested beaters some five or six waiting the word to skin bukta watched the life fade from the wild eyes lifted one hand and turned on his heel  no need to show that we care said he now after this we can kill what we choose put out your hand sahib  chinn obeyed it was entirely steady and bukta nodded that also was your custom my men skin quickly they will carry the skin to cantonments will the sahib come to my poor village for the night and perhaps forget that i am his officer  but those menthe beaters they have worked hard and perhaps  oh if they skin clumsily we will skin them they are my people in the lines i am one thing here i am another  this was very true when bukta doffed uniform and reverted to the fragmentary dress of his own people he left his civilisation of drill in the next world that night after a little talk with his subjects he devoted to an orgie and a bhil orgie is a thing not to be safely written about chinn flushed with triumph was in the thick of it but the meaning of the mysteries was hidden wild folk came and pressed about his knees with offerings he gave his flask to the elders of the village they grew eloquent and wreathed him about with flowers gifts and loans not all seemly were thrust upon him and infernal music rolled and maddened round red fires while singers sang songs of the ancient times and danced peculiar dances the aboriginal liquors are very potent and chinn was compelled to taste them often but unless the stuff had been drugged how came he to fall asleep suddenly and to waken late the next dayhalf a march from the village  the sahib was very tired a little before dawn he went to sleep bukta explained my people carried him here and now it is time we should go back to cantonments  the voice smooth and deferential the step steady and silent made it hard to believe that only a few hours before bukta was yelling and capering with naked fellowdevils of the scrub  my people were very pleased to see the sahib they will never forget when next the sahib goes out recruiting he will go to my people and they will give him as many men as we need  chinn kept his own counsel except as to the shooting of the tiger and bukta embroidered that tale with a shameless tongue the skin was certainly one of the finest ever hung up in the mess and the first of many when bukta could not accompany his boy on shootingtrips he took care to put him in good hands and chinn learned more of the mind and desire of the wild bhil in his marches and campings by talks at twilight or at wayside pools than an uninstructed man could have come at in a lifetime  presently his men in the regiment grew bold to speak of their relativesmostly in troubleand to lay cases of tribal custom before him they would say squatting in his verandah at twilight after the easy confidential style of the wuddars that suchandsuch a bachelor had run away with suchandsuch a wife at a faroff village now how many cows would chinn sahib consider a just fine or again if written order came from the government that a bhil was to repair to a walled city of the plains to give evidence in a lawcourt would it be wise to disregard that order on the other hand if it were obeyed would the rash voyager return alive  but what have i to do with these things chinn demanded of bukta impatiently i am a soldier i do not know the law  hoo law is for fools and white men give them a large and loud order and they will abide by it thou art their law  but wherefore  every trace of expression left buktas countenance the idea might have smitten him for the first time how can i say he replied perhaps it is on account of the name a bhil does not love strange things give them orders sahibtwo three four words at a time such as they can carry away in their heads that is enough  chinn gave orders then valiantly not realising that a word spoken in haste before mess became the dread unappealable law of villages beyond the smoky hills was in truth no less than the law of jan chinn the first who so the whispered legend ran had come back to earth to oversee the third generation in the body and bones of his grandson  there could be no sort of doubt in this matter all the bhils knew that jan chinn reincarnated had honoured buktas village with his presence after slaying his firstin this lifetiger that he had eaten and drunk with the people as he was used andbukta must have drugged chinns liquor very deeplyupon his back and right shoulder all men had seen the same angry red flying cloud that the high gods had set on the flesh of jan chinn the first when first he came to the bhil as concerned the foolish white world which has no eyes he was a slim and young officer in the wuddars but his own people knew he was jan chinn who had made the bhil a man and believing they hastened to carry his words careful never to alter them on the way  because the savage and the child who plays lonely games have one horror of being laughed at or questioned the little folk kept their convictions to themselves and the colonel who thought he knew his regiment never guessed that each one of the six hundred quickfooted beadyeyed rankandfile to attention beside their rifles believed serenely and unshakenly that the subaltern on the left flank of the line was a demigod twice borntutelary deity of their land and people the earthgods themselves had stamped the incarnation and who would dare to doubt the handiwork of the earthgods  chinn being practical above all things saw that his family name served him well in the lines and in camp his men gave no troubleone does not commit regimental offences with a god in the chair of justiceand he was sure of the best beaters in the district when he needed them they believed that the protection of jan chinn the first cloaked them and were bold in that belief beyond the utmost daring of excited bhils  his quarters began to look like an amateur naturalhistory museum in spite of duplicate heads and horns and skulls that he sent home to devonshire the people very humanly learned the weak side of their god it is true he was unbribable but birdskins butterflies beetles and above all news of big game pleased him in other respects too he lived up to the chinn tradition he was feverproof a nights sitting out over a tethered goat in a damp valley that would have filled the major with a months malaria had no effect on him he was as they said salted before he was born  now in the autumn of his second years service an uneasy rumour crept out of the earth and ran about among the bhils chinn heard nothing of it till a brotherofficer said across the messtable your revered ancestors on the rampage in the satpura country youd better look him up  i dont want to be disrespectful but im a little sick of my revered ancestor bukta talks of nothing else whats the old boy supposed to be doing now  riding crosscountry by moonlight on his processional tiger thats the story hes been seen by about two thousand bhils skipping along the tops of the satpuras and scaring people to death they believe it devoutly and all the satpura chaps are worshipping away at his shrinetomb i meanlike good uns you really ought to go down there must be a queer thing to see your grandfather treated as a god  what makes you think theres any truth in the tale said chinn  because all our men deny it they say theyve never heard of chinns tiger now thats a manifest lie because every bhil has  theres only one thing youve overlooked said the colonel thoughtfully when a local god reappears on earth its always an excuse for trouble of some kind and those satpura bhils are about as wild as your grandfather left them young un it means something  meanin they may go on the warpath said chinn  cant sayas yet shouldnt be surprised a little bit  i havent been told a syllable  proves it all the more they are keeping something back  bukta tells me everything too as a rule now why didnt he tell me that  chinn put the question directly to the old man that night and the answer surprised him  why should i tell what is well known yes the clouded tiger is out in the satpura country  what do the wild bhils think that it means  they do not know they wait sahib what is coming say only one little word and we will be content  we what have tales from the south where the jungly bhils live to do with drilled men  when jan chinn wakes is no time for any bhil to be quiet  but he has not waked bukta  sahibthe old mans eyes were full of tender reproofif he does not wish to be seen why does he go abroad in the moonlight we know he is awake but we do not know what he desires is it a sign for all the bhils or one that concerns the satpura folk alone say one little word sahib that i may carry it to the lines and send on to our villages why does jan chinn ride out who has done wrong is it pestilence is it murrain will our children die is it a sword remember sahib we are thy people and thy servants and in this life i bore thee in my armsnot knowing  bukta has evidently looked on the cup this evening chinn thought but if i can do anything to soothe the old chap i must its like the mutiny rumours on a small scale  he dropped into a deep wicker chair over which was thrown his first tigerskin and his weight on the cushion flapped the clawed paws over his shoulders he laid hold of them mechanically as he spoke drawing the painted hide cloakfashion about him  now will i tell the truth bukta he said leaning forward the dried muzzle on his shoulder to invent a specious lie  i see that it is the truth was the answer in a shaking voice  jan chinn goes abroad among the satpuras riding on the clouded tiger ye say be it so therefore the sign of the wonder is for the satpura bhils only and does not touch the bhils who plough in the north and east the bhils of the khandesh or any others except the satpura bhils who as we know are wild and foolish  it is then a sign for them good or bad  beyond doubt good for why should jan chinn make evil to those whom he has made men the nights over yonder are hot it is ill to lie in one bed overlong without turning and jan chinn would look again upon his people so he rises whistles his clouded tiger and goes abroad a little to breathe the cool air if the satpura bhils kept to their villages and did not wander after dark they would not see him indeed bukta it is no more than that he would see the light again in his own country send this news south and say that it is my word  bukta bowed to the floor good heavens thought chinn and this blinking pagan is a firstclass officer and as straight as a die i may as well round it off neatly he went on  if the satpura bhils ask the meaning of the sign tell them that jan chinn would see how they kept their old promises of good living perhaps they have plundered perhaps they mean to disobey the orders of the government perhaps there is a dead man in the jungle and so jan chinn has come to see  is he then angry  bah am i ever angry with my bhils i say angry words and threaten many things thou knowest bukta i have seen thee smile behind the hand i know and thou knowest the bhils are my children i have said it many times  ay we be thy children said bukta  and no otherwise is it with jan chinn my fathers father he would see the land he loved and the people once again it is a good ghost bukta i say it go and tell them and i do hope devoutly he added that it will calm em down flinging back the tigerskin he rose with a long unguarded yawn that showed his wellkept teeth  bukta fled to be received in the lines by a knot of panting inquirers  it is true said bukta he wrapped himself in the skin and spoke from it he would see his own country again the sign is not for us and indeed he is a young man how should he lie idle of nights he says his bed is too hot and the air is bad he goes to and fro for the love of nightrunning he has said it  the greywhiskered assembly shuddered  he says the bhils are his children ye know he does not lie he has said it to me  but what of the satpura bhils what means the sign for them  nothing it is only nightrunning as i have said he rides to see if they obey the government as he taught them to do in his first life  and what if they do not  he did not say  the light went out in chinns quarters  look said bukta now he goes away none the less it is a good ghost as he has said how shall we fear jan chinn who made the bhil a man his protection is on us and ye know jan chinn never broke a protection spoken or written on paper when he is older and has found him a wife he will lie in his bed till morning  a commanding officer is generally aware of the regimental state of mind a little before the men and this is why the colonel said a few days later that some one had been putting the fear of god into the wuddars as he was the only person officially entitled to do this it distressed him to see such unanimous virtue its too good to last he said i only wish i could find out what the little chaps mean  the explanation as it seemed to him came at the change of the moon when he received orders to hold himself in readiness to allay any possible excitement among the satpura bhils who were to put it mildly uneasy because a paternal government had sent up against them a mahratta stateeducated vaccinator with lancets lymph and an officially registered calf in the language of state they had manifested a strong objection to all prophylactic measures had forcibly detained the vaccinator and were on the point of neglecting or evading their tribal obligations  that means they are in a blue funksame as they were at censustime said the colonel and if we stampede them into the hills well never catch em in the first place and in the second theyll whoop off plundering till further orders wonder who the godforsaken idiot is who is trying to vaccinate a bhil i knew trouble was coming one good thing is that theyll only use local corps and we can knock up something well call a campaign and let them down easy fancy us potting our best beaters because they dont want to be vaccinated theyre only crazy with fear  dont you think sir said chinn the next day that perhaps you could give me a fortnights shootingleave  desertion in the face of the enemy by jove the colonel laughed i might but id have to antedate it a little because were warned for service as you might say however well assume that you applied for leave three days ago and are now well on your way south  id like to take bukta with me  of course yes i think that will be the best plan youve some kind of hereditary influence with the little chaps and they may listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them wild youve never been in that part of the world before have you take care they dont send you to your family vault in your youth and innocence i believe youll be all right if you can get em to listen to you  i think so sir but ifif they should accidentally put anmake asses of emselvesthey might you knowi hope youll represent that they were only frightened there isnt an ounce of real vice in em and i should never forgive myself if any one ofof my name got them into trouble  the colonel nodded but said nothing  chinn and bukta departed at once bukta did not say that ever since the official vaccinator had been dragged into the hills by indignant bhils runner after runner had skulked up to the lines entreating with forehead in the dust that jan chinn should come and explain this unknown horror that hung over his people  the portent of the clouded tiger was now too clear let jan chinn comfort his own for vain was the help of mortal man bukta toned down these beseechings to a simple request for chinns presence nothing would have pleased the old man better than a roughandtumble campaign against the satpuras whom he as an unmixed bhil despised but he had a duty to all his nation as jan chinns interpreter and he devoutly believed that forty plagues would fall on his village if he tampered with that obligation besides jan chinn knew all things and he rode the clouded tiger  they covered thirty miles a day on foot and pony raising the blue walllike line of the satpuras as swiftly as might be bukta was very silent  they began the steep climb a little after noon but it was near sunset ere they reached the stone platform clinging to the side of a rifted junglecovered hill where jan chinn the first was laid as he had desired that he might overlook his people all india is full of neglected graves that date from the beginning of the eighteenth centurytombs of forgotten colonels of corps long since disbanded mates of east india men who went on shooting expeditions and never came back factors agents writers and ensigns of the honourable the east india company by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands english folk forget quickly but natives have long memories and if a man has done good in his life it is remembered after his death the weathered marble foursquare tomb of jan chinn was hung about with wild flowers and nuts packets of wax and honey bottles of native spirits and infamous cigars with buffalo horns and plumes of dried grass at one end was a rude clay image of a white man in the oldfashioned tophat riding on a bloated tiger  bukta salamed reverently as they approached chinn bared his head and began to pick out the blurred inscription so far as he could read it ran thusword for word and letter for letter

to the plains yes its a big work all of it even my little share he must have been worth knowing bukta where are my people  not here sahib no man comes here except in full sun they wait above let us climb and see  but chinn remembering the first law of oriental diplomacy in an even voice answered i have come this far only because the satpura folk are foolish and dared not visit our lines now bid them wait on me here i am not a servant but the master of bhils  i goi go clucked the old man night was falling and at any moment jan chinn might whistle up his dreaded steed from the darkening scrub  now for the first time in a long life bukta disobeyed a lawful command and deserted his leader for he did not come back but pressed to the flat tabletop of the hill and called softly men stirred all about himlittle trembling men with bows and arrows who had watched the two since noon  where is he whispered one  at his own place he bids you come said bukta  now  now  rather let him loose the clouded tiger upon us we do not go  nor i though i bore him in my arms when he was a child in this his life wait here till the day  but surely he will be angry  he will be very angry for he has nothing to eat but he has said to me many times that the bhils are his children by sunlight i believe this butby moonlight i am not so sure what folly have ye satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all  one came to us in the name of the government with little ghostknives and a magic calf meaning to turn us into cattle by the cutting off of our arms we were greatly afraid but we did not kill the man he is here bounda black man and we think he comes from the west he said it was an order to cut us all with knivesespecially the women and the children we did not hear that it was an order so we were afraid and kept to our hills some of our men have taken ponies and bullocks from the plains and others pots and cloths and earrings  are any slain  by our men not yet but the young men are blown to and fro by many rumours like flames upon a hill i sent runners asking for jan chinn lest worse should come to us it was this fear that he foretold by the sign of the clouded tiger  he says it is otherwise said bukta and he repeated with amplifications all that young chinn had told him at the conference of the wicker chair  think you said the questioner at last that the government will lay hands on us  not i bukta rejoined jan chinn will give an order and ye will obey the rest is between the government and jan chinn i myself know something of the ghostknives and the scratching it is a charm against the smallpox but how it is done i cannot tell nor need that concern you  if he stands by us and before the anger of the government we will most strictly obey jan chinn exceptexcept we do not go down to that place tonight  they could hear young chinn below them shouting for bukta but they cowered and sat still expecting the clouded tiger the tomb had been holy ground for nearly half a century if jan chinn chose to sleep there who had better right but they would not come within eyeshot of the place till broad day  at first chinn was exceedingly angry till it occurred to him that bukta most probably had a reason which indeed he had and his own dignity might suffer if he yelled without answer he propped himself against the foot of the grave and alternately dozing and smoking came through the warm night proud that he was a lawful legitimate feverproof chinn  he prepared his plan of action much as his grandfather would have done and when bukta appeared in the morning with a most liberal supply of food said nothing of the overnight desertion bukta would have been relieved by an outburst of human anger but chinn finished his victual leisurely and a cheroot ere he made any sign  they are very much afraid said bukta who was not too bold himself it remains only to give orders they said they will obey if thou wilt only stand between them and the government  that i know said chinn strolling slowly to the tableland a few of the elder men stood in an irregular semicircle in an open glade but the ruck of peoplewomen and children were hidden in the thicket they had no desire to face the first anger of jan chinn the first  seating himself on a fragment of split rock he smoked his cheroot to the butt hearing men breathe hard all about him then he cried so suddenly that they jumped  bring the man that was bound  a scuffle and a cry were followed by the appearance of a hindoo vaccinator quaking with fear bound hand and foot as the bhils of old were accustomed to bind their human sacrifices he was pushed cautiously before the presence but young chinn did not look at him  i saidthe man that was bound is it a jest to bring me one tied like a buffalo since when could the bhil bind folk at his pleasure cut  half a dozen hasty knives cut away the thongs and the man crawled to chinn who pocketed his case of lancets and tubes of lymph then sweeping the semicircle with one comprehensive forefinger and in the voice of compliment he said clearly and distinctly pigs  ai whispered bukta now he speaks woe to foolish people  i have come on foot from my house the assembly shuddered to make clear a matter which any other satpura bhil would have seen with both eyes from a distance ye know the smallpox who pits and scars your children so that they look like waspcombs it is an order of the government that whoso is scratched on the arm with these little knives which i hold up is charmed against her all sahibs are thus charmed and very many hindoos this is the mark of the charm look  he rolled back his sleeve to the armpit and showed the white scars of the vaccinationmark on his white skin come all and look  a few daring spirits came up and nodded their heads wisely there was certainly a mark and they knew well what other dread marks were hidden by the shirt merciful was jan chinn that then and there proclaimed his godhead  now all these things the man whom ye bound told you  i dida hundred times but they answered with blows groaned the operator chafing his wrists and ankles  but being pigs ye did not believe and so came i here to save you first from smallpox next from a great folly of fear and lastly it may be from the rope and the jail it is no gain to me it is no pleasure to me but for the sake of that one who is yonder who made the bhil a manhe pointed down the hilli who am of his blood the son of his son come to turn your people and i speak the truth as did jan chinn  the crowd murmured reverently and men stole out of the thicket by twos and threes to join it there was no anger in their gods face  these are my orders heaven send theyll take em but i seem to have impressed em so far i myself will stay among you while this man scratches your arms with the knives after the order of the government in three or it may be five or seven days your arms will swell and itch and burn that is the power of smallpox fighting in your base blood against the orders of the government i will therefore stay among you till i see that smallpox is conquered and i will not go away till the men and the women and the little children show me upon their arms such marks as i have even now showed you i bring with me two very good guns and a man whose name is known among beasts and men we will hunt together i and he and your young men and the others shall eat and lie still this is my order  there was a long pause while victory hung in the balance a whitehaired old sinner standing on one uneasy leg piped up  there are ponies and some few bullocks and other things for which we need a kowl protection they were not taken in the way of trade  the battle was won and john chinn drew a breath of relief the young bhils had been raiding but if taken swiftly all could be put straight  i will write a kowl so soon as the ponies the bullocks and the other things are counted before me and sent back whence they came but first we will put the government mark on such as have not been visited by smallpox in an undertone to the vaccinator if you show you are afraid youll never see poona again my friend  there is not sufficient ample supply of vaccination for all this population said the man they destroyed the offeecial calf  they wont know the difference scrape em and give me a couple of lancets ill attend to the elders  the aged diplomat who had demanded protection was the first victim he fell to chinns hand and dared not cry out as soon as he was freed he dragged up a companion and held him fast and the crisis became as it were a childs sport for the vaccinated chased the unvaccinated to treatment vowing that all the tribe must suffer equally the women shrieked and the children ran howling but chinn laughed and waved the pinktipped lancet  it is an honour he cried tell them bukta how great an honour it is that i myself mark them nay i cannot mark every onethe hindoo must also do his workbut i will touch all marks that he makes so there will be an equal virtue in them thus do the rajputs stick pigs ho brother with one eye catch that girl and bring her to me she need not run away yet for she is not married and i do not seek her in marriage she will not come then she shall be shamed by her little brother a fat boy a bold boy he puts out his arm like a soldier look he does not flinch at the blood some day he shall be in my regiment and now mother of many we will lightly touch thee for smallpox has been before us here it is a true thing indeed that this charm breaks the power of mata there will be no more pitted faces among the satpuras and so ye can ask many cows for each maid to be wed  and so on and so onquickpoured showmans patter sauced in the bhil huntingproverbs and tales of their own brand of coarse humour till the lancets were blunted and both operators worn out  but nature being the same the world over the unvaccinated grew jealous of their marked comrades and came near to blows about it then chinn declared himself a court of justice no longer a medical board and made formal inquiry into the late robberies  we are the thieves of mahadeo said the bhils simply it is our fate and we were frightened when we are frightened we always steal  simply and directly as children they gave in the tale of the plunder all but two bullocks and some spirits that had gone amissing these chinn promised to make good out of his own pocket and ten ringleaders were despatched to the lowlands with a wonderful document written on the leaf of a notebook and addressed to an assistant district superintendent of police there was warm calamity in that note as jan chinn warned them but anything was better than loss of liberty  armed with this protection the repentant raiders went downhill they had no desire whatever to meet mr dundas fawne of the police aged twentytwo and of a cheerful countenance nor did they wish to revisit the scene of their robberies steering a middle course they ran into the camp of the one government chaplain allowed to the various irregular corps through a district of some fifteen thousand square miles and stood before him in a cloud of dust he was by way of being a priest they knew and what was more to the point a good sportsman who paid his beaters generously  when he read chinns note he laughed which they deemed a lucky omen till he called up policemen who tethered the ponies and the bullocks by the piled housegear and laid stern hands upon three of that smiling band of the thieves of mahadeo the chaplain himself addressed them magisterially with a ridingwhip that was painful but jan chinn had prophesied it they submitted but would not give up the written protection fearing the jail on their way back they met mr d fawne who had heard about the robberies and was not pleased  certainly said the eldest of the gang when the second interview was at an end certainly jan chinns protection has saved us our liberty but it is as though there were many beatings in one small piece of paper put it away  one climbed into a tree and stuck the letter into a cleft forty feet from the ground where it could do no harm warmed sore but happy the ten returned to jan chinn next day where he sat among uneasy bhils all looking at their right arms and all bound under terror of their gods disfavour not to scratch  it was a good kowl said the leader first the chaplain who laughed took away our plunder and beat three of us as was promised next we meet fawne sahib who frowned and asked for the plunder we spoke the truth and so he beat us all one after another and called us chosen names he then gave us these two bundlesthey set down a bottle of whisky and a box of cherootsand we came away the kowl is left in a tree because its virtue is that so soon as we show it to a sahib we are beaten  but for that kowl said jan chinn sternly ye would all have been marching to jail with a policeman on either side ye come now to serve as beaters for me these people are unhappy and we will go hunting till they are well tonight we will make a feast  it is written in the chronicles of the satpura bhils together with many other matters not fit for print that through five days after the day that he had put his mark upon them jan chinn the first hunted for his people and on the five nights of those days the tribe was gloriously and entirely drunk jan chinn bought country spirits of an awful strength and slew wild pig and deer beyond counting so that if any fell sick they might have two good reasons  between headand stomachaches they found no time to think of their arms but followed jan chinn obediently through the jungles and with each days returning confidence men women and children stole away to their villages as the little army passed by they carried news that it was good and right to be scratched with ghostknives that jan chinn was indeed reincarnated as a god of free food and drink and that of all nations the satpura bhils stood first in his favour if they would only refrain from scratching henceforward that kindly demigod would be connected in their minds with great gorgings and the vaccine and lancets of a paternal government  and tomorrow i go back to my home said jan chinn to his faithful few whom neither spirits overeating nor swollen glands could conquer it is hard for children and savages to behave reverently at all times to the idols of their makebelief and they had frolicked excessively with jan chinn but the reference to his home cast a gloom on the people  and the sahib will not come again said he who had been vaccinated first  that is to be seen answered chinn warily  nay but come as a white mancome as a young man whom we know and love for as thou alone knowest we are a weak people if we again saw thythy horse they were picking up their courage  i have no horse i came on foot with bukta yonder what is this  thou knowestthe thing that thou hast chosen for a nighthorse the little men squirmed in fear and awe  nighthorses bukta what is this last tale of children  bukta had been a silent leader in chinns presence since the night of his desertion and was grateful for a chanceflung question  they know sahib he whispered it is the clouded tiger that that comes from the place where thou didst once sleep it is thy horseas it has been these three generations  my horse that was a dream of the bhils  it is no dream do dreams leave the tracks of broad pugs on earth why make two faces before thy people they know of the nightridings and theyand they  are afraid and would have them cease  bukta nodded if thou hast no further need of him he is thy horse  the thing leaves a trail then said chinn  we have seen it it is like a village road under the tomb  can ye find and follow it for me  by daylightif one comes with us and above all stands near by  i will stand close and we will see to it that jan chinn does not ride any more  the bhils shouted the last words again and again  from chinns point of view the stalk was nothing more than an ordinary onedownhill through split and crannied rocks unsafe perhaps if a man did not keep his wits by him but no worse than twenty others he had undertaken yet his menthey refused absolutely to beat and would only traildripped sweat at every move they showed the marks of enormous pugs that ran always downhill to a few hundred feet below jan chinns tomb and disappeared in a narrowmouthed cave it was an insolently open road a domestic highway beaten without thought of concealment  the beggar might be paying rent and taxes chinn muttered ere he asked whether his friends taste ran to cattle or man  cattle was the answer two heifers a week we drive them for him at the foot of the hill it is his custom if we did not he might seek us  blackmail and piracy said chinn i cant say i fancy going into the cave after him whats to be done  the bhils fell back as chinn lodged himself behind a rock with his rifle ready tigers he knew were shy beasts but one who had been long cattlefed in this sumptuous style might prove overbold  he speaks some one whispered from the rear he knows too  well of all the infernal cheek said chinn there was an angry growl from the cavea direct challenge  come out then chinn shouted come out of that lets have a look at you the brute knew well enough that there was some connection between brown nude bhils and his weekly allowance but the white helmet in the sunlight annoyed him and he did not approve of the voice that broke his rest lazily as a gorged snake he dragged himself out of the cave and stood yawning and blinking at the entrance the sunlight fell upon his flat right side and chinn wondered never had he seen a tiger marked after this fashion except for his head which was staringly barred he was dapplednot striped but dappled like a childs rockinghorse in rich shades of smoky black on red gold that portion of his belly and throat which should have been white was orange and his tail and paws were black  he looked leisurely for some ten seconds and then deliberately lowered his head his chin dropped and drawn in staring intently at the man the effect of this was to throw forward the round arch of his skull with two broad bands across it while below the bands glared the unwinking eyes so that head on as he stood he showed something like a diabolically scowling pantomimemask it was a piece of natural mesmerism that he had practised many times on his quarry and though chinn was by no means a terrified heifer he stood for a while held by the extraordinary oddity of the attack the headthe body seemed to have been packed away behind itthe ferocious skulllike head crept nearer to the switching of an angry tailtip in the grass left and right the bhils had scattered to let john chinn subdue his own horse  my word he thought hes trying to frighten me and fired between the saucerlike eyes leaping aside upon the shot  a big coughing mass reeking of carrion bounded past him up the hill and he followed discreetly the tiger made no attempt to turn into the jungle he was hunting for sight and breathnose up mouth open the tremendous forelegs scattering the gravel in spurts  scuppered said john chinn watching the flight now if he was a partridge hed tower lungs must be full of blood  the brute had jerked himself over a boulder and fallen out of sight the other side john chinn looked over with a ready barrel but the red trail led straight as an arrow even to his grandfathers tomb and there among the smashed spiritbottles and the fragments of the mud image the life left with a flurry and a grunt  if my worthy ancestor could see that said john chinn hed have been proud of me eyes lower jaw and lungs a very nice shot he whistled for bukta as he drew the tape over the stiffening bulk  tensixeightby jove its nearly elevencall it eleven forearm twentyfourfiveseven and a half a short tail too three feet one but what a skin oh bukta bukta the men with the knives swiftly  is he beyond question dead said an awestricken voice behind a rock  that was not the way i killed my first tiger said chinn i did not think that bukta would run i had no second gun  itit is the clouded tiger said bukta unheeding the taunt  he is dead  whether all the bhils vaccinated and unvaccinated of the satpuras had lain by to see the kill chinn could not say but the whole hills flank rustled with little men shouting singing and stamping and yet till he had made the first cut in the splendid skin not a man would take a knife and when the shadows fell they ran from the redstained tomb and no persuasion would bring them back till dawn so chinn spent a second night in the open guarding the carcass from jackals and thinking about his ancestor  he returned to the lowlands to the triumphal chant of an escorting army three hundred strong the mahratta vaccinator close at his elbow and the rudely dried skin a trophy before him when that army suddenly and noiselessly disappeared as quail in high corn he argued he was near civilisation and a turn in the road brought him upon the camp of a wing of his own corps he left the skin on a carttail for the world to see and sought the colonel  theyre perfectly right he explained earnestly there isnt an ounce of vice in em they were only frightened ive vaccinated the whole boiling and they like it awfully what arewhat are we doing here sir  thats what im trying to find out said the colonel i dont know yet whether were a piece of a brigade or a police force however i think well call ourselves a police force how did you manage to get a bhil vaccinated  well sir said chinn ive been thinking it over and as far as i can make out ive got a sort of hereditary influence over em  so i know or i wouldnt have sent you but what exactly  its rather rummy it seems from what i can make out that im my own grandfather reincarnated and ive been disturbing the peace of the country by riding a padtiger of nights if i hadnt done that i dont think theyd have objected to the vaccination but the two together were more than they could stand and so sir ive vaccinated em and shot my tigerhorse as a sort o proof of good faith you never saw such a skin in your life  the colonel tugged his moustache thoughtfully now how the deuce said he am i to include that in my report  indeed the official version of the bhils antivaccination stampede said nothing about lieutenant john chinn his godship but bukta knew and the corps knew and every bhil in the satpura hills knew  and now bukta is zealous that john chinn shall swiftly be wedded and impart his powers to a son for if the chinn succession fails and the little bhils are left to their own imaginings there will be fresh trouble in the satpuras     the devil and the deep sea  all supplies very bad and dear and there are no facilities for even the smallest repairssailing directions   her nationality was british but you will not find her houseflag in the list of our mercantile marine she was a ninehundredton iron schoonerrigged screw cargoboat differing externally in no way from any other tramp of the sea but it is with steamers as it is with men there are those who will for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind and in the present state of a fallen world such people and such steamers have their use from the hour that the aglaia first entered the clydenew shiny and innocent with a quart of cheap champagne trickling down her cutwaterfate and her owner who was also her captain decreed that she should deal with embarrassed crowned heads fleeing presidents financiers of overextended ability women to whom change of air was imperative and the lesser lawbreaking powers her career led her sometimes into the admiralty courts where the sworn statements of her skipper filled his brethren with envy the mariner cannot tell or act a lie in the face of the sea or mislead a tempest but as lawyers have discovered he makes up for chances withheld when he returns to shore an affidavit in either hand  the aglaia figured with distinction in the great mackinaw salvagecase it was her first slip from virtue and she learned how to change her name but not her heart and to run across the sea as the guiding light she was very badly wanted in a south american port for the little matter of entering harbour at full speed colliding with a coalhulk and the states only manofwar just as that manofwar was going to coal she put to sea without explanations though three forts fired at her for half an hour as the julia mgregor she had been concerned in picking up from a raft certain gentlemen who should have stayed in noumea but who preferred making themselves vastly unpleasant to authority in quite another quarter of the world and as the shahinshah she had been overtaken on the high seas indecently full of munitions of war by the cruiser of an agitated power at issue with its neighbour that time she was very nearly sunk and her riddled hull gave eminent lawyers of two countries great profit after a season she reappeared as the martin hunt painted a dull slatecolour with pure saffron funnel and boats of robinsegg blue engaging in the odessa trade till she was invited and the invitation could not well be disregarded to keep away from black sea ports altogether  she had ridden through many waves of depression freights might drop out of sight seamens unions throw spanners and nuts at certificated masters or stevedores combine till cargo perished on the dockhead but the boat of many names came and went busy alert and inconspicuous always her skipper made no complaint of hard times and port officers observed that her crew signed and signed again with the regularity of atlantic liner boatswains her name she changed as occasion called her wellpaid crew never and a large percentage of the profits of her voyages was spent with an open hand on her engineroom she never troubled the underwriters and very seldom stopped to talk with a signalstation for her business was urgent and private  but an end came to her tradings and she perished in this manner deep peace brooded over europe asia africa america australasia and polynesia the powers dealt together more or less honestly banks paid their depositors to the hour diamonds of price came safely to the hands of their owners republics rested content with their dictators diplomats found no one whose presence in the least incommoded them monarchs lived openly with their lawfully wedded wives it was as though the whole earth had put on its best sunday bib and tucker and business was very bad for the martin hunt the great virtuous calm engulfed her slate sides yellow funnel and all but cast up in another hemisphere the steam whaler haliotis black and rusty with a manurecoloured funnel a litter of dingy white boats and an enormous stove or furnace for boiling blubber on her forward welldeck there could be no doubt that her trip was successful for she lay at several ports not too well known and the smoke of her tryingout insulted the beaches  anon she departed at the speed of the average london fourwheeler and entered a semiinland sea warm still and blue which is perhaps the most strictly preserved water in the world there she stayed for a certain time and the great stars of those mild skies beheld her playing pussinthecorner among islands where whales are never found all that while she smelt abominably and the smell though fishy was not whalesome one evening calamity descended upon her from the island of pygangwatai and she fled while her crew jeered at a fat blackandbrown gunboat puffing far behind they knew to the last revolution the capacity of every boat on those seas that they were anxious to avoid a british ship with a good conscience does not as a rule flee from the manofwar of a foreign power and it is also considered a breach of etiquette to stop and search british ships at sea these things the skipper of the haliotis did not pause to prove but held on at an inspiriting eleven knots an hour till nightfall one thing only he overlooked  the power that kept an expensive steampatrol moving up and down those waters they had dodged the two regular ships of the station with an ease that bred contempt had newly brought up a third and a fourteenknot boat with a clean bottom to help the work and that was why the haliotis driving hard from the east to the west found herself at daylight in such a position that she could not help seeing an arrangement of four flags a mile and a half behind which read heave to or take the consequences  she had her choice and she took it the end came when presuming on her lighter draught she tried to draw away northward over a friendly shoal the shell that arrived by way of the chief engineers cabin was some five inches in diameter with a practice not a bursting charge it had been intended to cross her bows and that was why it knocked the framed portrait of the chief engineers wifeand she was a very pretty girlon to the floor splintered his washhand stand crossed the alleyway into the engineroom and striking on a grating dropped directly in front of the forward engine where it burst neatly fracturing both the bolts that held the connectingrod to the forward crank  what follows is worth consideration the forward engine had no more work to do its released pistonrod therefore drove up fiercely with nothing to check it and started most of the nuts of the cylindercover it came down again the full weight of the steam behind it and the foot of the disconnected connectingrod useless as the leg of a man with a sprained ankle flung out to the right and struck the starboard or righthand castiron supportingcolumn of the forward engine cracking it clean through about six inches above the base and wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the ships side there the connectingrod jammed meantime the afterengine being as yet unembarrassed went on with its work and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine which smote the already jammed connectingrod bending it and therewith the pistonrod crossheadthe big crosspiece that slides up and down so smoothly  the crosshead jammed sideways in the guides and in addition to putting further pressure on the already broken starboard supportingcolumn cracked the port or lefthand supportingcolumn in two or three places there being nothing more that could be made to move the engines brought up all standing with a hiccup that seemed to lift the haliotis a foot out of the water and the engineroom staff opening every steam outlet that they could find in the confusion arrived on deck somewhat scalded but calm there was a sound below of things happeninga rushing clicking purring grunting rattling noise that did not last for more than a minute it was the machinery adjusting itself on the spur of the moment to a hundred altered conditions mr wardrop one foot on the upper grating inclined his ear sideways and groaned you cannot stop engines working at twelve knots an hour in three seconds without disorganising them the haliotis slid forward in a cloud of steam shrieking like a wounded horse there was nothing more to do the fiveinch shell with a reduced charge had settled the situation and when you are full all three holds of strictly preserved pearls when you have cleaned out the tanna bank the seahorse bank and four other banks from one end to the other of the amanala seawhen you have ripped out the very heart of a rich government monopoly so that five years will not repair your wrongdoingsyou must smile and take what is in store but the skipper reflected as a launch put out from the manofwar that he had been bombarded on the high seas with the british flagseveral of thempicturesquely disposed above him and tried to find comfort from the thought  where said the stolid naval lieutenant hoisting himself aboard where are those dam pearls  they were there beyond evasion no affidavit could do away with the fearful smell of decayed oysters the divingdresses and the shelllittered hatches they were there to the value of seventy thousand pounds more or less and every pound poached  the manofwar was annoyed for she had used up many tons of coal she had strained her tubes and worse than all her officers and crew had been hurried every one on the haliotis was arrested and rearrested several times as each officer came aboard then they were told by what they esteemed to be the equivalent of a midshipman that they were to consider themselves prisoners and finally were put under arrest  its not the least good said the skipper suavely youd much better send us a tow  be stillyou are arrest was the reply  where the devil do you expect we are going to escape to were helpless youve got to tow us into somewhere and explain why you fired on us mr wardrop were helpless arent we  ruined from end to end said the man of machinery if she rolls the forward cylinder will come down and go through her bottom both columns are clean cut through theres nothing to hold anything up  the council of war clanked off to see if mr wardrops words were true he warned them that it was as much as a mans life was worth to enter the engineroom and they contented themselves with a distant inspection through the thinning steam the haliotis lifted to the long easy swell and the starboard supportingcolumn ground a trifle as a man grits his teeth under the knife the forward cylinder was depending on that unknown force men call the pertinacity of materials which now and then balances that other heartbreaking power the perversity of inanimate things  you see said mr wardrop hurrying them away the engines arent worth their price as old iron  we tow was the answer afterwards we shall confiscate  the manofwar was shorthanded and did not see the necessity for putting a prizecrew aboard the haliotis so she sent one sublieutenant whom the skipper kept very drunk for he did not wish to make the tow too easy and moreover he had an inconspicuous little rope hanging from the stem of his ship  then they began to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour the haliotis was very hard to move and the gunnerylieutenant who had fired the fiveinch shell had leisure to think upon consequences mr wardrop was the busy man he borrowed all the crew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the bottom and sides of the ship it was a days risky work but anything was better than drowning at the end of a towrope and if the forward cylinder had fallen it would have made its way to the seabed and taken the haliotis after  where are we going to and how long will they tow us he asked of the skipper  god knows and this prizelieutenants drunk what do you think you can do  theres just the bare chance mr wardrop whispered though no one was within hearingtheres just the bare chance o repairin her if a man knew how theyve twisted the very guts out of her bringing her up with that jerk but im saying that with time and patience theres just the chance o making steam yet we could do it  the skippers eye brightened do you mean he began that she is any good  oh no said mr wardrop shell need three thousand pounds in repairs at the lowest if shes to take the sea again an that apart from any injury to her structure shes like a man fallen down five pair o stairs we cant tell for months what has happened but we know shell never be good again without a new inside ye should see the condensertubes an the steam connections to the donkey for two things only im not afraid of them repairin her im afraid of them stealin things  theyve fired on us theyll have to explain that  our reputations not good enough to ask for explanations lets take what we have and be thankful ye would not have consuls remembern the guidin light an the shahinshah an the aglaia at this most alarmin crisis weve been no better than pirates these ten years under providence were no worse than thieves now weve much to be thankful forif we eer get back to her  make it your own way then said the skipper if theres the least chance  ill leave none said mr wardropnone that theyll dare to take keep her heavy on the tow for we need time  the skipper never interfered with the affairs of the engineroom and mr wardropan artist in his professionturned to and composed a work terrible and forbidding his background was the darkgrained sides of the engineroom his material the metals of power and strength helped out with spars baulks and ropes the manofwar towed sullenly and viciously the haliotis behind her hummed like a hive before swarming with extra and totally unneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward engine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding and the butts of the shores interfered with every view that a dispassionate eye might wish to take and that the dispassionate mind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm the wellsunk bolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends of ropes giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity next mr wardrop took up a collection from the afterengine which as you will remember had not been affected in the general wreck the cylinder escapevalve he abolished with a flogginghammer it is difficult in faroff ports to come by such valves unless like mr wardrop you keep duplicates in store at the same time men took off the nuts of two of the great holdingdown bolts that serve to keep the engines in place on their solid bed an engine violently arrested in midcareer may easily jerk off the nut of a holdingdown bolt and this accident looked very natural  passing along the tunnel he removed several shaft couplingbolts andnuts scattering other and ancient pieces of iron underfoot cylinderbolts he cut off to the number of six from the afterengine cylinder so that it might match its neighbour and stuffed the bilgeand feedpumps with cottonwaste then he made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had gathered from the engineslittle things like nuts and valvespindles all carefully tallowedand retired with them under the floor of the engineroom where he sighed being fat as he passed from manhole to manhole of the double bottom and in a fairly dry submarine compartment hid them any engineer particularly in an unfriendly port has a right to keep his spare stores where he chooses and the foot of one of the cylinder shores blocked all entrance into the regular storeroom even if that had not been already closed with steel wedges in conclusion he disconnected the afterengine laid piston and connectingrod carefully tallowed where it would be most inconvenient to the casual visitor took out three of the eight collars of the thrustblock hid them where only he could find them again filled the boilers by hand wedged the sliding doors of the coalbunkers and rested from his labours the engineroom was a cemetery and it did not need the contents of the ashlift through the skylight to make it any worse  he invited the skipper to look at the completed work  saw ye ever such a forsaken wreck as that said he proudly it almost frights me to go under those shores now what d you think theyll do to us  wait till we see said the skipper itll be bad enough when it comes  he was not wrong the pleasant days of towing ended all too soon though the haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted jib stayed out into the shape of a pocket and mr wardrop was no longer an artist of imagination but one of sevenandtwenty prisoners in a prison full of insects the manofwar had towed them to the nearest port not to the headquarters of the colony and when mr wardrop saw the dismal little harbour with its ragged line of chinese junks its one crazy tug and the boatbuilding shed that under the charge of a philosophical malay represented a dockyard he sighed and shook his head  i did well he said this is the habitation o wreckers an thieves were at the uttermost ends of the earth think you theyll ever know in england  doesnt look like it said the skipper  they were marched ashore with what they stood up in under a generous escort and were judged according to the customs of the country which though excellent are a little out of date there were the pearls there were the poachers and there sat a small but hot governor he consulted for a while and then things began to move with speed for he did not wish to keep a hungry crew at large on the beach and the manofwar had gone up the coast with a wave of his handa stroke of the pen was not necessaryhe consigned them to the black gangtana the backcountry and the hand of the law removed them from his sight and the knowledge of men they were marched into the palms and the backcountry swallowed them upall the crew of the haliotis  deep peace continued to brood over europe asia africa america australasia and polynesia                        it was the firing that did it they should have kept their counsel but when a few thousand foreigners are bursting with joy over the fact that a ship under the british flag has been fired at on the high seas news travels quickly and when it came out that the pearlstealing crew had not been allowed access to their consul there was no consul within a few hundred miles of that lonely port even the friendliest of powers has a right to ask questions the great heart of the british public was beating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious racehorse and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents but somewhere deep in the hull of the ship of state there is machinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign affairs that machinery began to revolve and who so shocked and surprised as the power that had captured the haliotis it explained that colonial governors and faraway menofwar were difficult to control and promised that it would most certainly make an example both of the governor and the vessel as for the crew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical climes it would produce them as soon as possible and it would apologise if necessary now no apologies were needed when one nation apologises to another millions of amateurs who have no earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the strife and embarrass the trained specialist it was requested that the crew be found if they were still alivethey had been eight months beyond knowledgeand it was promised that all would be forgotten  the little governor of the little port was pleased with himself sevenandtwenty white men made a very compact force to throw away on a war that had neither beginning nor enda jungle and stockade fight that flickered and smouldered through the wet hot years in the hills a hundred miles away and was the heritage of every wearied official he had he thought deserved well of his country and if only some one would buy the unhappy haliotis moored in the harbour below his verandah his cup would be full he looked at the neatly silvered lamps that he had taken from her cabins and thought of much that might be turned to account but his countrymen in that moist climate had no spirit they would peep into the silent engineroom and shake their heads even the menofwar would not tow her further up the coast where the governor believed that she could be repaired she was a bad bargain but her cabin carpets were undeniably beautiful and his wife approved of her mirrors  three hours later cables were bursting round him like shells for though he knew it not he was being offered as a sacrifice by the nether to the upper millstone and his superiors had no regard for his feelings he had said the cables grossly exceeded his power and failed to report on events he would thereforeat this he cast himself back in his hammockproduce the crew of the haliotis he would send for them and if that failed he would put his dignity on a pony and fetch them himself he had no conceivable right to make pearlpoachers serve in any war he would be held responsible  next morning the cables wished to know whether he had found the crew of the haliotis they were to be found freed and fedhe was to feed themtill such time as they could be sent to the nearest english port in a manofwar if you abuse a man long enough in great words flashed over the seabeds things happen the governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners who were also soldiers and never was a militia regiment more anxious to reduce its strength no power short of death could make these mad men wear the uniform of their service they would not fight except with their fellows and it was for that reason the regiment had not gone to war but stayed in a stockade reasoning with the new troops the autumn campaign had been a fiasco but here were the englishmen all the regiment marched back to guard them and the hairy enemy armed with blowpipes rejoiced in the forest five of the crew had died but there lined up on the governors verandah twoandtwenty men marked about the legs with the scars of leechbites a few of them wore fringes that had once been trousers the others used loincloths of gay patterns and they existed beautifully but simply in the governors verandah and when he came out they sang at him when you have lost seventy thousand pounds worth of pearls your pay your ship and all your clothes and have lived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences of civilisation you know what true independence means for you become the happiest of created thingsnatural man  the governor told the crew that they were evil and they asked for food when he saw how they ate and when he remembered that none of the pearl patrolboats were expected for two months he sighed but the crew of the haliotis lay down in the verandah and said that they were pensioners of the governors bounty a greybearded man fat and baldheaded his one garment a greenandyellow loincloth saw the haliotis in the harbour and bellowed for joy the men crowded to the verandahrail kicking aside the long cane chairs they pointed gesticulated and argued freely without shame the militia regiment sat down in the governors garden the governor retired to his hammockit was as easy to be killed lying as standingand his women squeaked from the shuttered rooms  she sold said the greybearded man pointing to the haliotis he was mr wardrop  no good said the governor shaking his head no one come buy  hes taken my lamps though said the skipper he wore one leg of a pair of trousers and his eye wandered along the verandah the governor quailed there were cuddy campstools and the skippers writingtable in plain sight  theyve cleaned her out o course said mr wardrop they would well go aboard and take an inventory see he waved his hands over the harbour welivetherenow sorry  the governor smiled a smile of relief  hes glad of that said one of the crew reflectively i shouldnt wonder  they flocked down to the harbourfront the militia regiment clattering behind and embarked themselves in what they foundit happened to be the governors boat then they disappeared over the bulwarks of the haliotis and the governor prayed that they might find occupation inside  mr wardrops first bound took him to the engineroom and when the others were patting the wellremembered decks they heard him giving god thanks that things were as he had left them the wrecked engines stood over his head untouched no inexpert hand had meddled with his shores the steel wedges of the storeroom were rusted home and best of all the hundred and sixty tons of good australian coal in the bunkers had not diminished  i dont understand it said mr wardrop any malay knows the use o copper they ought to have cut away the pipes and with chinese junks coming here too its a special interposition o providence  you think so said the skipper from above theres only been one thief here and hes cleaned her out of all my things anyhow  here the skipper spoke less than the truth for under the planking of his cabin only to be reached by a chisel lay a little money which never drew any interesthis sheetanchor to windward it was all in clean sovereigns that pass current the world over and might have amounted to more than a hundred pounds  hes left me alone lets thank god repeated mr wardrop  hes taken everything else look  the haliotis except as to her engineroom had been systematically and scientifically gutted from one end to the other and there was strong evidence that an unclean guard had camped in the skippers cabin to regulate that plunder she lacked glass plate crockery cutlery mattresses cuddy carpets and chairs all boats and her copper ventilators these things had been removed with her sails and as much of the wire rigging as would not imperil the safety of the masts  he must have sold those said the skipper the other things are in his house i suppose  every fitting that could be pried or screwed out was gone port starboard and masthead lights teak gratings sliding sashes of the deckhouse the captains chest of drawers with charts and charttable photographs brackets and lookingglasses cabin doors rubber cuddy mats hatchirons half the funnelstays cork fenders carpenters grindstone and toolchest holystones swabs squeegees all cabin and pantry lamps galleyfittings en bloc flags and flaglocker clocks chronometers the forward compass and the ships bell and belfry were among the missing  there were great scarred marks on the deckplanking over which the cargoderricks had been hauled one must have fallen by the way for the bulwarkrails were smashed and bent and the sideplates bruised  its the governor said the skipper hes been selling her on the instalment plan  lets go up with spanners and shovels and kill em all shouted the crew lets drown him and keep the woman  then well be shot by that blackandtan regimentour regiment whats the trouble ashore theyve camped our regiment on the beach  were cut off thats all go and see what they want said mr wardrop youve the trousers  in his simple way the governor was a strategist he did not desire that the crew of the haliotis should come ashore again either singly or in detachments and he proposed to turn their steamer into a convicthulk they would waithe explained this from the quay to the skipper in the bargeand they would continue to wait till the manofwar came along exactly where they were if one of them set foot ashore the entire regiment would open fire and he would not scruple to use the two cannon of the town meantime food would be sent daily in a boat under an armed escort the skipper bare to the waist and rowing could only grind his teeth and the governor improved the occasion and revenged himself for the bitter words in the cables by saying what he thought of the morals and manners of the crew the barge returned to the haliotis in silence and the skipper climbed aboard white on the cheekbones and blue about the nostrils  i knew it said mr wardrop and they wont give us good food either we shall have bananas morning noon and night an a man cant work on fruit we know that  then the skipper cursed mr wardrop for importing frivolous sideissues into the conversation and the crew cursed one another and the haliotis the voyage and all that they knew or could bring to mind they sat down in silence on the empty decks and their eyes burned in their heads the green harbour water chuckled at them overside they looked at the palmfringed hills inland at the white houses above the harbour road at the single tier of native craft by the quay at the stolid soldiery sitting round the two cannon and last of all at the blue bar of the horizon mr wardrop was buried in thought and scratched imaginary lines with his untrimmed fingernails on the planking  i make no promise he said at last for i cant say what may or may not have happened to them but heres the ship and heres us  there was a little scornful laughter at this and mr wardrop knitted his brows he recalled that in the days when he wore trousers he had been chief engineer of the haliotis  harland mackesy noble hay naughton fink ohara trumbull  here sir the instinct of obedience waked to answer the rollcall of the engineroom  below  they rose and went  captain ill trouble you for the rest of the men as i want them well get my stores out and clear away the shores we dont need and then well patch her up my men will remember that theyre in the haliotisunder me  he went into the engineroom and the others stared they were used to the accidents of the sea but this was beyond their experience none who had seen the engineroom believed that anything short of new engines from end to end could stir the haliotis from her moorings  the engineroom stores were unearthed and mr wardrops face red with the filth of the bilges and the exertion of travelling on his stomach lit with joy the spare gear of the haliotis had been unusually complete and twoandtwenty men armed with screwjacks differential blocks tackle vices and a forge or so can look kismet between the eyes without winking the crew were ordered to replace the holdingdown and shaftbearing bolts and return the collars of the thrustblock when they had finished mr wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound engines without the aid of the shops and the men sat about on the cold machinery the crosshead jammed in the guides leered at them drunkenly but offered no help they ran their fingers hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supportingcolumn and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores while mr wardrops voice rose and fell echoing till the quick tropic night closed down over the engineroom skylight  next morning the work of reconstruction began it has been explained that the foot of the connectingrod was forced against the foot of the starboard supportingcolumn which it had cracked through and driven outward towards the ships skin to all appearance the job was more than hopeless for rod and column seemed to have been welded into one but herein providence smiled on them for one moment to hearten them through the weary weeks ahead the second engineermore reckless than resourcefulstruck at random with a cold chisel into the castiron of the column and a greasy grey flake of metal flew from under the imprisoned foot of the connectingrod while the rod itself fell away slowly and brought up with a thunderous clang somewhere in the dark of the crankpit the guidesplates above were still jammed fast in the guides but the first blow had been struck they spent the rest of the day grooming the donkeyengine which stood immediately forward of the engineroom hatch its tarpaulin of course had been stolen and eight warm months had not improved the working parts further the last dying hiccup of the haliotis seemedor it might have been the malay from the boathouseto have lifted the thing bodily on its bolts and set it down inaccurately as regarded its steam connections  if we only had one single cargoderrick mr wardrop sighed we can take the cylindercover off by hand if we sweat but to get the rod out o the pistons not possible unless we use steam well therell be steam the morn if theres nothing else shell fizzle  next morning men from the shore saw the haliotis through a cloud for it was as though the deck smoked her crew were chasing steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the forward donkeyengine and where oakum failed to plug a crack they stripped off their loincloths for lapping and swore halfboiled and mothernaked the donkeyengine workedat a pricethe price of constant attention and furious stokingworked long enough to allow a wirerope it was made up of a funnel and a foremaststay to be led into the engineroom and made fast on the cylindercover of the forward engine that rose easily enough and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck many hands assisting the doubtful steam then came the tug of war for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed pistonrod they removed two of the piston junkring studs screwed in two strong iron eyebolts by way of handles doubled the wirerope and set half a dozen men to smite with an extemporised batteringram at the end of the pistonrod where it peered through the piston while the donkeyengine hauled upwards on the piston itself after four hours of this furious work the pistonrod suddenly slipped and the piston rose with a jerk knocking one or two men over into the engineroom but when mr wardrop declared that the piston had not split they cheered and thought nothing of their wounds and the donkeyengine was hastily stopped its boiler was nothing to tamper with  and day by day their supplies reached them by boat the skipper humbled himself once more before the governor and as a concession had leave to get drinkingwater from the malay boatbuilder on the quay it was not good drinkingwater but the malay was anxious to supply anything in his power if he were paid for it  now when the jaws of the forward engine stood as it were stripped and empty they began to wedge up the shores of the cylinder itself that work alone filled the better part of three dayswarm and sticky days when the hands slipped and sweat ran into the eyes when the last wedge was hammered home there was no longer an ounce of weight on the supportingcolumns and mr wardrop rummaged the ship for boilerplate threequarters of an inch thick where he could find it there was not much available but what there was was more than beaten gold to him in one desperate forenoon the entire crew naked and lean haled back more or less into place the starboard supportingcolumn which as you remember was cracked clean through mr wardrop found them asleep where they had finished the work and gave them a days rest smiling upon them as a father while he drew chalkmarks about the cracks they woke to new and more trying labour for over each one of those cracks a plate of threequarterinch boileriron was to be worked hot the rivetholes being drilled by hand all that time they were fed on fruits chiefly bananas with some sago  those were the days when men swooned over the ratchetdrill and the handforge and where they fell they had leave to lie unless their bodies were in the way of their fellows feet and so patch upon patch and a patch over all the starboard supportingcolumn was clouted but when they thought all was secure mr wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never support working engines at the best it could only hold the guidebars approximately true he deadweight of the cylinders must be borne by vertical struts and therefore a gang would repair to the bows and take out with files the big bowanchor davits each of which was some three inches in diameter they threw hot coals at wardrop and threatened to kill him those who did not weep they were ready to weep on the least provocation but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end and they limped forward and the davits came with them when they returned they slept sixteen hours on the strength of it and in three days two struts were in place bolted from the foot of the starboard supportingcolumn to the under side of the cylinder there remained now the port or condensercolumn which though not so badly cracked as its fellow had also been strengthened in four places with boilerplate patches but needed struts they took away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work and crazy with toil did not see till all was in place that the rounded bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the airpump levers to clear them it was wardrops oversight and he wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to unbolt the struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame now the broken engine was underpinned firmly and they took away the wooden shores from under the cylinders and gave them to the robbed bridge thanking god for even half a days work on gentle kindly wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls eight months in the backcountry among the leeches at a temperature of 84 degrees moist is very bad for the nerves  they had kept the hardest work to the last as boys save latin prose and worn though they were mr wardrop did not dare to give them rest the pistonrod and connectingrod were to be straightened and this was a job for a regular dockyard with every appliance they fell to it cheered by a little chalk showing of work done and time consumed which mr wardrop wrote up on the engineroom bulkhead fifteen days had gonefifteen days of killing labourand there was hope before them  it is curious that no man knows how the rods were straightened the crew of the haliotis remember that week very dimly as a fever patient remembers the delirium of a long night there were fires everywhere they say the whole ship was one consuming furnace and the hammers were never still now there could not have been more than one fire at the most for mr wardrop distinctly recalls that no straightening was done except under his own eye they remember too that for many years voices gave orders which they obeyed with their bodies but their minds were abroad on all the seas it seems to them that they stood through days and nights slowly sliding a bar backwards and forwards through a white glow that was part of the ship they remember an intolerable noise in their burning heads from the walls of the stokehole and they remember being savagely beaten by men whose eyes seemed asleep when their shift was over they would draw straight lines in the air anxiously and repeatedly and would question one another in their sleep crying is she straight  at lastthey do not remember whether this was by day or by nightmr wardrop began to dance clumsily and wept the while and they too danced and wept and went to sleep twitching all over and when they woke men said that the rods were straightened and no one did any work for two days but lay on the decks and ate fruit mr wardrop would go below from time to time and pat the two rods where they lay and they heard him singing hymns  then his trouble of mind went from him and at the end of the third days idleness he made a drawing in chalk upon the deck with letters of the alphabet at the angles he pointed out that though the pistonrod was more or less straight the pistonrod crossheadthe thing that had been jammed sideways in the guideshad been badly strained and had cracked the lower end of the pistonrod he was going to forge and shrink a wroughtiron collar on the neck of the pistonrod where it joined the crosshead and from the collar he would bolt a yshaped piece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the crosshead if anything more were needed they could use up the last of the boilerplate  so the forges were lit again and men burned their bodies but hardly felt the pain the finished connection was not beautiful but it seemed strong enoughat least as strong as the rest of the machinery and with that job their labours came to an end all that remained was to connect up the engines and to get food and water the skipper and four men dealt with the malay boatbuilder by night chiefly it was no time to haggle over the price of sago and dried fish the others stayed aboard and replaced piston pistonrod cylindercover crosshead and bolts with the aid of the faithful donkeyengine the cylindercover was hardly steamproof and the eye of science might have seen in the connectingrod a flexure something like that of a christmastree candle which has melted and been straightened by hand over a stove but as mr wardrop said she didnt hit anything  as soon as the last bolt was in place men tumbled over one another in their anxiety to get to the hand startinggear the wheel and worm by which some engines can be moved when there is no steam aboard they nearly wrenched off the wheel but it was evident to the blindest eye that the engines stirred they did not revolve in their orbits with any enthusiasm as good machines should indeed they groaned not a little but they moved over and came to rest in a way which proved that they still recognised mans hand then mr wardrop sent his slaves into the darker bowels of the engineroom and the stokehole and followed them with a flarelamp the boilers were sound but would take no harm from a little scaling and cleaning mr wardrop would not have any one overzealous for he feared what the next stroke of the tool might show the less we know about her now said he the better for us all im thinkin yell understand me when i say that this is in no sense regular engineerin  as his raiment when he spoke was his grey beard and uncut hair they believed him they did not ask too much of what they met but polished and tallowed and scraped it to a false brilliancy  a lick of paint would make me easier in my mind said mr wardrop plaintively i know half the condensertubes are started and the propellershaftins god knows how far out of the true and well need a new airpump an the mainsteam leaks like a sieve and theres worse each way i look butpaints like clothes to a man an ours is near all gone  the skipper unearthed some stale ropy paint of the loathsome green that they used for the galleys of sailingships and mr wardrop spread it abroad lavishly to give the engines selfrespect  his own was returning day by day for he wore his loincloth continuously but the crew having worked under orders did not feel as he did the completed work satisfied mr wardrop he would at the last have made shift to run to singapore and gone home without vengeance taken to show his engines to his brethren in the craft but the others and the captain forbade him they had not yet recovered their selfrespect  it would be safer to make what ye might call a trial trip but beggars mustnt be choosers an if the engines will go over to the handgear the probabilityim only saying its a probabilitythe chance is that theyll hold up when we put steam on her  how long will you take to get steam said the skipper  god knows four hoursa dayhalf a week if i can raise sixty pound ill not complain  be sure of her first we cant afford to go out half a mile and break down  my soul and body man were one continuous breakdown fore an aft we might fetch singapore though  well break down at pygangwatai where we can do good was the answer in a voice that did not allow argument shes my boat andive had eight months to think in  no man saw the haliotis depart though many heard her she left at two in the morning having cut her moorings and it was none of her crews pleasure that the engines should strike up a thundering halfseasover chanty that echoed among the hills mr wardrop wiped away a tear as he listened to the new song  shes gibberinshes just gibberin he whimpered yons the voice of a maniac  and if engines have any soul as their masters believe he was quite right there were outcries and clamours sobs and bursts of chattering laughter silences where the trained ear yearned for the clear note and torturing reduplications where there should have been one deep voice down the screwshaft ran murmurs and warnings while a heartdiseased flutter without told that the propeller needed rekeying  how does she make it said the skipper  she moves butbut shes breakin my heart the sooner were at pygangwatai the better shes mad and were waking the town  is she at all near safe  what do i care how safe she is shes mad hear that now to be sure nothings hittin anything and the bearins are fairly cool butcan ye not hear  if she goes said the skipper i dont care a curse and shes my boat too  she went trailing a fathom of weed behind her from a slow two knots an hour she crawled up to a triumphant four anything beyond that made the struts quiver dangerously and filled the engineroom with steam morning showed her out of sight of land and there was a visible ripple under her bows but she complained bitterly in her bowels and as though the noise had called it there shot along across the purple sea a swift dark proa hawklike and curious which presently ranged alongside and wished to know if the haliotis were helpless ships even the steamers of the white men had been known to break down in those waters and the honest malay and javanese traders would sometimes aid them in their own peculiar way but this ship was not full of lady passengers and welldressed officers men white naked and savage swarmed down her sidessome with redhot iron bars and others with large hammersthrew themselves upon those innocent inquiring strangers and before any man could say what had happened were in full possession of the proa while the lawful owners bobbed in the water overside half an hour later the proas cargo of sago and trepang as well as a doubtfulminded compass was in the haliotis the two huge triangular mat sails with their seventyfoot yards and booms had followed the cargo and were being fitted to the stripped masts of the steamer  they rose they swelled they filled and the empty steamer visibly laid over as the wind took them they gave her nearly three knots an hour and what better could men ask but if she had been forlorn before this new purchase made her horrible to see imagine a respectable charwoman in the tights of a balletdancer rolling drunk along the streets and you will come to some faint notion of the appearance of that ninehundredton welldecked once schoonerrigged cargoboat as she staggered under her new help shouting and raving across the deep with steam and sail that marvellous voyage continued and the brighteyed crew looked over the rail desolate unkempt unshorn shamelessly clothed beyond the decencies  at the end of the third week she sighted the island of pygangwatai whose harbour is the turningpoint of a pearl seapatrol here the gunboats stay for a week ere they retrace their line there is no village at pygangwatai only a stream of water some palms and a harbour safe to rest in till the first violence of the southeast monsoon has blown itself out  they opened up the low coral beach with its mound of whitewashed coal ready for supply the deserted huts for the sailors and the flagless flagstaff  next day there was no haliotisonly a little proa rocking in the warm rain at the mouth of the harbour whose crew watched with hungry eyes the smoke of a gunboat on the horizon  months afterwards there were a few lines in an english newspaper to the effect that some gunboat of some foreign power had broken her back at the mouth of some faraway harbour by running at full speed into a sunken wreck     william the conqueror  part i                     i have done one braver thing                    than all the worthies did                   and yet a braver thence doth spring                    which is to keep that hid                                         the undertaking  is it officially declared yet  theyve gone as far as to admit extreme local scarcity and theyve started reliefworks in one or two districts the paper says  that means it will be declared as soon as they can make sure of the men and the rollingstock shouldnt wonder if it were as bad as the 78 famine  cant be said scott turning a little in the long cane chair  weve had fifteenanna crops in the north and bombay and bengal report more than they know what to do with theyll be able to check it before it gets out of hand it will only be local  martyn picked the pioneer from the table read through the telegrams once more and put up his feet on the chairrests it was a hot dark breathless evening heavy with the smell of the newly watered mall the flowers in the club gardens were dead and black on their stalks the little lotuspond was a circle of caked mud and the tamarisktrees were white with the dust of weeks most of the men were at the bandstand in the public gardensfrom the club verandah you could hear the native police band hammering stale waltzesor on the pologround or in the highwalled fivescourt hotter than a dutch oven half a dozen grooms squatted at the heads of their ponies waited their masters return from time to time a man would ride at a footpace into the club compound and listlessly loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building these were supposed to be chambers men lived in them meeting the same white faces night after night at dinner and drawing out their officework till the latest possible hour that they might escape that doleful company  what are you going to do said martyn with a yawn lets have a swim before dinner  waters hot i was at the bath today  play you game o billiardsfifty up  its a hundred and five in the hall now sit still and dont be so abominably energetic  a grunting camel swung up to the porch his badged and belted rider fumbling a leather pouch  kubberkargazkiyektraaa the man whined handing down the newspaper extraa slip printed on one side only and damp from the press it was pinned up on the greenbaize board between notices of ponies for sale and foxterriers missing  martyn rose lazily read it and whistled its declared he cried one two threeeight districts go under the operations of the famine code ek dum theyve put jimmy hawkins in charge  good business said scott with the first sign of interest he had shown when in doubt hire a punjabi i worked under jimmy when i first came out and he belonged to the punjab he has more bundobust than most men  jimmys a jubilee knight now said martyn hes a good chap even though he is a thriceborn civilian and went to the benighted presidency what unholy names these madras districts rejoice inall ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums  a dogcart drove up in the dusk and a man entered mopping his head he was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a province of twentyfive million natives and a few hundred white men as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant his officehours ran variously from ten to twenty a day  hi raines youre supposed to know everything said martyn stopping him hows this madras scarcity going to turn out  no one knows as yet theres a message as long as your arm coming in on the telephone ive left my cub to fill it out madras has owned she cant manage it alone and jimmy seems to have a free hand in getting all the men he needs arbuthnots warned to hold himself in readiness  badger arbuthnot  the peshawur chap yes and the pi wires that ellis and clay have been moved from the northwest already and theyve taken half a dozen bombay men too its pukka famine by the looks of it  theyre nearer the scene of action than we are but if it comes to indenting on the punjab this early theres more in this than meets the eye said martyn  here today and gone tomorrow didnt come to stay for ever said scott dropping one of marryats novels and rising to his feet martyn your sisters waiting for you  a rough grey horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the verandah where the light of a kerosene lamp fell on a browncalico habit and a white face under a greyfelt hat  right o said martyn im ready better come and dine with us if youve nothing to do scott william is there any dinner in the house  ill go home and see was the riders answer you can drive him overat eight remember  scott moved leisurely to his room and changed into the eveningdress of the season and the country spotless white linen from head to foot with a broad silk cummerbund dinner at the martyns was a decided improvement on the goatmutton twineytough fowl and tinned entrees of the club but it was a great pity that martyn could not afford to send his sister to the hills for the hot weather as an acting district superintendent of police martyn drew the magnificent pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month and his little fourroomed bungalow said just as much there were the usual blueandwhitestriped jailmade rugs on the uneven floor the usual glassstudded amritsar phulkaris draped on nails driven into the flaking whitewash of the walls the usual halfdozen chairs that did not match picked up at sales of dead mens effects and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather punkathong ran through the wall it was as though everything had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning not a door in the house was true on its hinges the little windows fifteen feet up were darkened with waspnests and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the woodceiled roof but all this was part of scotts life thus did people live who had such an income and in a land where each mans pay age and position are printed in a book that all may read it is hardly worth while to play at pretence in word or deed scott counted eight years service in the irrigation department and drew eight hundred rupees a month on the understanding that if he served the state faithfully for another twentytwo years he could retire on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month his workinglife which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters where a man could sleep eat and write letters was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation canals the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds and the payment of vast sums of coined silver  he had finished that spring not without credit the last section of the great mosuhl canal andmuch against his will for he hated officeworkhad been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the department with sole charge of the sweltering suboffice at the capital of the province martyn knew this william his sister knew it and everybody knew it scott knew too as well as the rest of the world that miss martyn had come out to india four years ago to keep house for her brother who as every one knew had borrowed the money to pay for her passage and that she ought as all the world said to have married at once in stead of this she had refused some half a dozen subalterns a civilian twenty years her senior one major and a man in the indian medical department this too was common property she had stayed down three hot weathers as the saying is because her brother was in debt and could not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap hillstation therefore her face was white as bone and in the centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a shillingthe mark of a delhi sore which is the same as a bagdad date this comes from drinking bad water and slowly eats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out  none the less william had enjoyed herself hugely in her four years twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river once she had been run away with on a camel had witnessed a midnight attack of thieves on her brothers camp had seen justice administered with long sticks in the open under trees could speak urdu and even rough punjabi with a fluency that was envied by her seniors had entirely fallen out of the habit of writing to her aunts in england or cutting the pages of the english magazines had been through a very bad cholera year seeing sights unfit to be told and had wound up her experiences by six weeks of typhoid fever during which her head had been shaved and hoped to keep her twentythird birthday that september it is conceivable that the aunts would not have approved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse were within hail who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her skirt who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head who answered indifferently to the name of william or bill whose speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular who could act in amateur theatricals play on the banjo rule eight servants and two horses their accounts and their diseases and look men slowly and deliberately between the eyeseven after they had proposed to her and been rejected  i like men who do things she had confided to a man in the educational department who was teaching the sons of clothmerchants and dyers the beauty of wordsworths excursion in annotated crambooks and when he grew poetical william explained that she didnt understand poetry very much it made her head ache and another broken heart took refuge at the club but it was all williams fault she delighted in hearing men talk of their own work and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet  scott had known her for some three years meeting her as a rule under canvass when his camp and her brothers joined for a day on the edge of the indian desert he had danced with her several times at the big christmas gatherings when as many as five hundred white people came in to the station and had always a great respect for her housekeeping and her dinners  she looked more like a boy than ever when the meal ended she sat rolling cigarettes her low forehead puckered beneath the dark curls as she twiddled the papers and stuck out her rounded chin when the tobacco stayed in place or with a gesture as true as a schoolboys throwing a stone tossed the finished article across the room to martyn who caught it with one hand and continued his talk with scott it was all shopcanals and the policing of canals the sins of villagers who stole more water than they had paid for and the grosser sin of native constables who connived at the thefts of the transplanting bodily of villages to newly irrigated ground and of the coming fight with the desert in the south when the provincial funds should warrant the opening of the longsurveyed luni protective canal system and scott spoke openly of his great desire to be put on one particular section of the work where he knew the land and the people and martyn sighed for a billet in the himalayan foothills and said his mind of his superiors and william rolled cigarettes and said nothing but smiled gravely on her brother because he was happy  at ten scotts horse came to the door and the evening was ended the lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was printed showed bright across the road it was too early to try to find sleep and scott drifted over to the editor raines stripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun lay half asleep in a long chair waiting for night telegrams he had a theory that if a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night he laid himself open to fever so he ate and slept among his files  can you do it he said drowsily i didnt mean to bring you over  about what ive been dining at the martyns  the madras famine of course martyns warned too theyre taking men where they can find em i sent a note to you at the club just now asking if you could do us a letter once a week from the southbetween two and three columns say nothing sensational of course but just plain facts about who is doing what and so forth our regular ratesten rupees a column  sorry but its out of my line scott answered staring absently at the map of india on the wall its rough on martynvery wonder what hell do with his sister wonder what the deuce theyll do with me ive no famine experience this is the first ive heard of it am i ordered  oh yes heres the wire theyll put you on to reliefworks raines said with a horde of madrassis dying like flies one native apothecary and half a pint of choleramixture among the ten thousand of you it comes of your being idle for the moment every man who isnt doing two mens work seems to have been called upon hawkins evidently believes in punjabis its going to be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten years  its all in the days work worse luck i suppose i shall get my orders officially some time tomorrow im awfully glad i happened to drop in better go and pack my kit now who relieves me heredo you know  raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams mceuan said he from murree  scott chuckled he thought he was going to be cool all summer hell be very sick about this well no good talking night  two hours later scott with a clear conscience laid himself down to rest on a string cot in a bare room two worn bullock trunks a leather waterbottle a tin icebox and his pet saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door and the club secretarys receipt for last months bill was under his pillow his orders came next morning and with them an unofficial telegram from sir james hawkins who was not in the habit of forgetting good men when he had once met them bidding him report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south for the famine was sore in the land and white men were needed  a pink and fattish youth arrived in the redhot noonday whimpering a little at fate and famines which never allowed any one three months peace he was scotts successoranother cog in the machinery moved forward behind his fellow whose services as the official announcement ran were placed at the disposal of the madras government for famine duty until further orders scott handed over the funds in his charge showed him the coolest corner in the office warned him against excess of zeal and as twilight fell departed from the club in a hired carriage with his faithful bodyservant faiz ullah and a mound of disordered baggage atop to catch the southern mail at the loopholed and bastioned railwaystation the heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a hot towel and he reflected that there were at least five nights and four days of this travel before him faiz ullah used to the chances of service plunged into the crowd on the stone platform while scott a black cheroot between his teeth waited till his compartment should be set away a dozen native policemen with their rifles and bundles shouldered into the press of punjabi farmers sikh craftsmen and greasylocked afreedee pedlars escorting with all pomp martyns uniformcase waterbottles icebox and beddingroll they saw faiz ullahs lifted hand and steered for it  my sahib and your sahib said faiz ullah to martyns man will travel together thou and i o brother will thus secure the servants places close by and because of our masters authority none will dare to disturb us  when faiz ullah reported all things ready scott settled down at full length coatless and bootless on the broad leathercovered bunk the heat under the ironarched roof of the station might have been anything over a hundred degrees at the last moment martyn entered dripping  dont swear said scott lazily its too late to change your carriage and well divide the ice  what are you doing here said the policeman  im lent to the madras government same as you by jove its a bender of a night are you taking any of your men down  a dozen i suppose i shall have to superintend relief distributions didnt know you were under orders too  i didnt till after i left you last night raines had the news first my orders came this morning mceuan relieved me at four and i got off at once shouldnt wonder if it wouldnt be a good thingthis famineif we come through it alive  jimmy ought to put you and me to work together said martyn and then after a pause my sisters here  good business said scott heartily going to get off at umballa i suppose and go up to simla wholl she stay with there  noo thats just the trouble of it shes going down with me  scott sat bolt upright under the oillamps as the train jolted past tarntaran what you dont mean you couldnt afford  taint that id have scraped up the money somehow  you might have come to me to begin with said scott stiffly we arent altogether strangers  well you neednt be stuffy about it i might butyou dont know my sister ive been explaining and exhorting and all the rest of it all daylost my temper since seven this morning and havent got it back yetbut she wouldnt hear of any compromise a womans entitled to travel with her husband if she wants to and william says shes on the same footing you see weve been together all our lives more or less since my people died it isnt as if she were an ordinary sister  all the sisters ive ever heard of would have stayed where they were well off  shes as clever as a man confoundmartyn went on she broke up the bungalow over my head while i was talking at her settled the whole thing in three hoursservants horses and all i didnt get my orders till nine  jimmy hawkins wont be pleased said scott a famines no place for a woman  mrs jimi mean lady jims in camp with him at any rate she says she will look after my sister william wired down to her on her own responsibility asking if she could come and knocked the ground from under me by showing me her answer  scott laughed aloud if she can do that she can take care of herself and mrs jim wont let her run into any mischief there arent many women sisters or wives who would walk into a famine with their eyes open it isnt as if she didnt know what these things mean she was through the jalo cholera last year  the train stopped at amritsar and scott went back to the ladies compartment immediately behind their carriage william with a cloth ridingcap on her curls nodded affably  come in and have some tea she said best thing in the world for heatapoplexy  do i look as if i were going to have heatapoplexy  never can tell said william wisely its always best to be ready  she had arranged her compartment with the knowledge of an old campaigner a feltcovered waterbottle hung in the draught of one of the shuttered windows a teaset of russian china packed in a wadded basket stood on the seat and a travelling spiritlamp was clamped against the woodwork above it  william served them generously in large cups hot tea which saves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot night it was characteristic of the girl that her plan of action once settled she asked for no comments on it life among men who had a great deal of work to do and very little time to do it in had taught her the wisdom of effacing as well as of fending for herself she did not by word or deed suggest that she would be useful comforting or beautiful in their travels but continued about her business serenely put the cups back without clatter when tea was ended and made cigarettes for her guests  this time last night said scott we didnt expecterthis kind of thing did we  ive learned to expect anything said william you know in our service we live at the end of the telegraph but of course this ought to be a good thing for us all departmentallyif we live  it knocks us out of the running in our own province scott replied with equal gravity i hoped to be put on the luni protective works this cold weather but theres no saying how long the famine may keep us  hardly beyond october i should think said martyn it will be ended one way or the other then  and weve nearly a week of this said william shant we be dusty when its over  for a night and a day they knew their surroundings and for a night and a day skirting the edge of the great indian desert on a narrowgauge railway they remembered how in the days of their apprenticeship they had come by that road from bombay then the languages in which the names of the stations were written changed and they launched south into a foreign land where the very smells were new many long and heavily laden graintrains were in front of them and they could feel the hand of jimmy hawkins from far off they waited in extemporised sidings while processions of empty trucks returned to the north and were coupled on to slow crawling trains and dropped at midnight heaven knew where but it was furiously hot and they walked to and fro among sacks and dogs howled then they came to an india more strange to them than to the untravelled englishmanthe flat red india of palmtree palmyrapalm and ricethe india of the picturebooks of little harry and his bearerall dead and dry in the baking heat they had left the incessant passengertraffic of the north and west far and far behind them here the people crawled to the side of the train holding their little ones in their arms and a loaded truck would be left behind the men and women clustering round it like ants by spilled honey once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a regiment of little brown men each bearing a body over his shoulder and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck they perceived that the burdens were not corpses but only foodless folk picked up beside dead oxen by a corps of irregular troops now they met more white men here one and there two whose tents stood close to the line and who came armed with written authorities and angry words to cut off a truck they were too busy to do more than nod at scott and martyn and stare curiously at william who could do nothing except make tea and watch how her men staved off the rush of wailing walking skeletons putting them down three at a time in heaps with their own hands uncoupling the marked trucks or taking receipts from the holloweyed weary white men who spoke another argot than theirs they ran out of ice out of sodawater and out of tea for they were six days and seven nights on the road and it seemed to them like seven times seven years  at last in a dry hot dawn in a land of death lit by long red fires of railwaysleepers where they were burning the dead they came to their destination and were met by jim hawkins the head of the famine unshaven unwashed but cheery and entirely in command of affairs  martyn he decreed then and there was to live on trains till further orders was to go back with empty trucks filling them with starving people as he found them and dropping them at a faminecamp on the edge of the eight districts he would pick up supplies and return and his constables would guard the loaded graincars also picking up people and would drop them at a camp a hundred miles south scotthawkins was very glad to see scott againwould that same hour take charge of a convoy of bullockcarts and would go south feeding as he went to yet another faminecamp where he would leave his starvingthere would be no lack of starving on the routeand wait for orders by telegraph generally scott was in all small things to act as he thought best  william bit her under lip there was no one in the wide world like her one brother but martyns orders gave him no discretion  she came out on the platform masked with dust from head to foot a horseshoe wrinkle on her forehead put here by much thinking during the past week but as selfpossessed as ever mrs jimwho should have been lady jim but that no one remembered the titletook possession of her with a little gasp  oh im so glad youre here she almost sobbed you oughtnt to of course but therethere isnt another woman in the place and we must help each other you know and weve all the wretched people and the little babies they are selling  ive seen some said william  isnt it ghastly ive bought twenty theyre in our camp but wont you have something to eat first weve more than ten people can do here and ive got a horse for you oh im so glad youve come dear youre a punjabi too you know  steady lizzie said hawkins over his shoulder well look after you miss martyn sorry i cant ask you to breakfast martyn youll have to eat as you go leave two of your men to help scott these poor devils cant stand up to load carts saunders this to the enginedriver who was half asleep in the cab back down and get those empties away youve line clear to anundrapillay theyll give you orders north of that scott load up your carts from that b p p truck and be off as soon as you can the eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter and guide youll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of the second wagon hes been trying to bolt youll have to look after him lizzie drive miss martyn to camp and tell them to send the red horse down here for me  scott with faiz ullah and two policemen was already busied with the carts backing them up to the truck and unbolting the sideboards quietly while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat hawkins watched him for as long as it took to fill one cart  thats a good man he said if all goes well i shall work him hard this was jim hawkinss notion of the highest compliment one human being could pay another  an hour later scott was under way the apothecary threatening him with the penalties of the law for that he a member of the subordinate medical department had been coerced and bound against his will and all laws governing the liberty of the subject the pinkshirted eurasian begging leave to see his mother who happened to be dying some three miles away only verree verree short leave of absence and will presently return sar the two constables armed with staves bringing up the rear and faiz ullah a mohammedans contempt for all hindoos and foreigners in every line of his face explaining to the drivers that though scott sahib was a man to be feared on all fours he faiz ullah was authority itself  the procession creaked past hawkinss campthree stained tents under a clump of dead trees behind them the famineshed where a crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the cookingkettles  wish to heaven william had kept out of it said scott to himself after a glance well have cholera sure as a gun when the rains break  but william seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the famine code which when famine is declared supersede the workings of the ordinary law scott saw her the centre of a mob of weeping women in a calico ridinghabit and a bluegrey felt hat with a gold puggaree  i want fifty rupees please i forgot to ask jack before he went away can you lend it me its for condensedmilk for the babies said she  scott took the money from his belt and handed it over without a word for goodness sake take care of yourself he said  oh i shall be all right we ought to get the milk in two days by the way the orders are i was to tell you that youre to take one of sir jims horses theres a grey cabuli here that i thought would be just your style so ive said youd take him was that right  thats awfully good of you we cant either of us talk much about style i am afraid  scott was in a weatherstained drill shootingkit very white at the seams and a little frayed at the wrists william regarded him thoughtfully from his pith helmet to his greased ankleboots you look very nice i think are you sure youve everything youll needquinine chlorodyne and so on  think so said scott patting three or four of his shootingpockets as he mounted and rode alongside his convoy  goodbye he cried  goodbye and good luck said william im awfully obliged for the money she turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into the tent while the carts pushed on past the faminesheds past the roaring lines of the thick fat fires down to the baked gehenna of the south    part ii                    so let us melt and make no noise                    no tearfloods nor sightempests move                  twere profanation of our joys                    to tell the laity our love                                                a valediction  it was punishing work even though he travelled by night and camped by day but within the limits of his vision there was no man whom scott could call master he was as free as jimmy hawkinsfreer in fact for the government held the head of the famine tied neatly to a telegraphwire and if jimmy had ever regarded telegrams seriously the deathrate of that famine would have been much higher than it was  at the end of a few days crawling scott learned something of the size of the india which he served and it astonished him his carts as you know were loaded with wheat millet and barley good foodgrains needing only a little grinding but the people to whom he brought the lifegiving stuffs were riceeaters they could hull rice in their mortars but they knew nothing of the heavy stone querns of the north and less of the material that the white man convoyed so laboriously they clamoured for riceunhusked paddy such as they were accustomed toand when they found that there was none broke away weeping from the sides of the cart what was the use of these strange hard grains that choked their throats they would die and then and there very many of them kept their word others took their allowance and bartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate a few put their share into the ricemortars pounded it and made a paste with foul water but they were very few scott understood dimly that many people in the india of the south ate rice as a rule but he had spent his service in a grain province had seldom seen rice in the blade or ear and least of all would have believed that in time of deadly need men could die at arms length of plenty sooner than touch food they did not know in vain the interpreters interpreted in vain his two policemen showed in vigorous pantomime what should be done the starving crept away to their bark and weeds grubs leaves and clay and left the open sacks untouched but sometimes the women laid their phantoms of children at scotts feet looking back as they staggered away  faiz ullah opined it was the will of god that these foreigners should die and it remained only to give orders to burn the dead none the less there was no reason why the sahib should lack his comforts and faiz ullah a campaigner of experience had picked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession that they might give milk for the morning meal he was feeding them on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected yes said faiz ullah if the sahib thought fit a little milk might be given to some of the babies but as the sahib well knew babies were cheap and for his own part faiz ullah held that there was no government order as to babies scott spoke forcefully to faiz ullah and the two policemen and bade them capture goats where they could find them this they most joyfully did for it was a recreation and many ownerless goats were driven in once fed the poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts and a few days good foodfood such as human beings died for lack ofset them in milk again  but i am no goatherd said faiz ullah it is against my izzat my honour  when we cross the bias river again we will talk of izzat scott replied till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers to the camp if i give the order  thus then it is done grunted faiz ullah if the sahib will have it so and he showed how a goat should be milked while scott stood over him  now we will feed them said scott twice a day we will feed them and he bowed his back to the milking and took a horrible cramp  when you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless mother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death you suffer in all your system but the babies were fed each morning and evening scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunnybags under the carttilts there were always many who could do no more than breathe and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop with due pauses when they choked each morning too the goats were fed and since they would straggle without a leader and since the natives were hirelings scott was forced to give up riding and pace slowly at the head of his flocks accommodating his step to their weaknesses all this was sufficiently absurd and he felt the absurdity keenly but at least he was saving life and when the women saw that their children did not die they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods and crawled after the carts blessing the master of the goats  give the women something to live for said scott to himself as he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet and theyll hang on somehow this beats williams condensedmilk trick all to pieces i shall never live it down though  he reached his destination very slowly found that a riceship had come in from burmah and that stores of paddy were available found also an overworked englishman in charge of the shed and loading the carts set back to cover the ground he had already passed he left some of the children and half his goats at the famineshed for this he was not thanked by the englishman who had already more stray babies than he knew what to do with scotts back was suppled to stooping now and he went on with his wayside ministrations in addition to distributing the paddy more babies and more goats were added unto him but now some of the babies wore rags and beads round their wrists or necks that said the interpreter as though scott did not know signifies that their mothers hope in eventual contingency to resume them offeecially  the sooner the better said scott but at the same time he marked with the pride of ownership how this or that little ramasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam as the paddycarts were emptied he headed for hawkinss camp by the railway timing his arrival to fit in with the dinnerhour for it was long since he had eaten at a cloth he had no desire to make any dramatic entry but an accident of the sunset ordered it that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening breeze the low light should fall across his forehead and he could not see what was before him while one waiting at the tent door beheld with new eyes a young man beautiful as paris a god in a halo of golden dust walking slowly at the head of his flocks while at his knee ran small naked cupids but she laughedwilliam in a slatecoloured blouse laughed consumedly till scott putting the best face he could upon the matter halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten it was an unseemly sight but the proprieties had been left ages ago with the teaparty at amritsar station fifteen hundred miles to the north  they are coming on nicely said william weve only fiveandtwenty here now the women are beginning to take them away again  are you in charge of the babies then  yesmrs jim and i we didnt think of goats though weve been trying condensedmilk and water  any losses  more than i care to think of said william with a shudder and you  scott said nothing there had been many little burials along his routeone cannot burn a dead babymany mothers who had wept when they did not find again the children they had trusted to the care of the government  then hawkins came out carrying a razor at which scott looked hungrily for he had a beard that he did not love and when they sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few words as it might have been an official report mrs jim snuffled from time to time and jim bowed his head judicially but williams grey eyes were on the cleanshaven face and it was to her that scott seemed to appeal  good for the pauper province said william her chin on her hand as she leaned forward among the wineglasses her cheeks had fallen in and the scar on her forehead was more prominent than ever but the wellturned neck rose roundly as a column from the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted eveningdress in camp  it was awfully absurd at times said scott you see i didnt know much about milking or babies theyll chaff my head off if the tale goes up north  let em said william haughtily weve all done cooliework since we came i know jack has this was to hawkinss address and the big man smiled blandly  your brothers a highly efficient officer william said he and ive done him the honour of treating him as he deserves remember i write the confidential reports  then you must say that williams worth her weight in gold said mrs jim i dont know what we should have done without her she has been everything to us she dropped her hand upon williams which was rough with much handling of reins and william patted it softly jim beamed on the company things were going well with his world three of his more grossly incompetent men had died and their places had been filled by their betters every day brought the rains nearer they had put out the famine in five of the eight districts and after all the deathrate had not been too heavythings considered he looked scott over carefully as an ogre looks over a man and rejoiced in his thews and ironhard condition  hes just the least bit in the world tucked up said jim to himself but he can do two mens work yet then he was aware that mrs jim was telegraphing to him and according to the domestic code the message ran a clear case look at them  he looked and listened all that william was saying was what can you expect of a country where they call a bhistee a watercarrier a tunnicutch and all that scott answered was i shall be glad to get back to the club save me a dance at the christmas ball wont you  its a far cry from here to the lawrence hall said jim better turn in early scott its paddycarts tomorrow youll begin loading at five  arent you going to give mr scott a single days rest  wish i could lizzie but im afraid i cant as long as he can stand up we must use him  well ive had one europe evening at least by jove id nearly forgotten what do i do about those babies of mine  leave them here said williamwe are in charge of thatand as many goats as you can spare i must learn how to milk now  if you care to get up early enough tomorrow ill show you i have to milk you see half of em have beads and things round their necks you must be careful not to take em off in case the mothers turn up  you forget ive had some experience here  i hope to goodness you wont overdo scotts voice was unguarded  ill take care of her said mrs jim telegraphing hundredword messages as she carried william off while jim gave scott his orders for the coming campaign it was very latenearly nine oclock  jim youre a brute said his wife that night and the head of the famine chuckled  not a bit of it dear i remember doing the first jandiala settlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline and she was slender lizzie ive never done as good a piece of work since hell work like a demon  but you might have given him one day  and let things come to a head now no dear its their happiest time  i dont believe either of the darlings know whats the matter with them isnt it beautiful isnt it lovely  getting up at three to learn to milk bless her heart oh ye gods why must we grow old and fat  shes a darling she has done more work under me  under you the day after she came she was in charge and you were her subordinate youve stayed there ever since she manages you almost as well as you manage me  she doesnt and thats why i love her shes as direct as a manas her brother  her brothers weaker than she is hes always to me for orders but hes honest and a glutton for work i confess im rather fond of william and if i had a daughter  the talk ended far away in the derajat was a childs grave more than twenty years old and neither jim nor his wife spoke of it any more  all the same youre responsible jim added a moments silence  bless em said mrs jim sleepily  before the stars paled scott who slept in an empty cart waked and went about his work in silence it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse faiz ullah and the interpreter his head being close to the ground he did not hear william till she stood over him in the dingy old ridinghabit her eyes still heavy with sleep a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands there was a baby on the ground squirming on a piece of blanket and a sixyearold child peered over scotts shoulder  hai you little rip said scott how the deuce do you expect to get your rations if you arent quiet  a cool white hand steadied the brat who forthwith choked as the milk gurgled into his mouth  mornin said the milker youve no notion how these little fellows can wriggle  oh yes i have she whispered because the world was asleep only i feed them with a spoon or a rag yours are fatter than mine and youve been doing this day after day the voice was almost lost  yes it was absurd now you try he said giving place to the girl look out a goats not a cow  the goat protested against the amateur and there was a scuffle in which scott snatched up the baby then it was all to do over again and william laughed softly and merrily she managed however to feed two babies and a third  dont the little beggars take it well said scott i trained em  they were very busy and interested when lo it was broad daylight and before they knew the camp was awake and they kneeled among the goats surprised by the day both flushed to the temples yet all the round world rolling up out of the darkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between them  oh said william unsteadily snatching up the tea and toast i had this made for you its stonecold now i thought you mightnt have anything ready so early better not drink it itsits stonecold  thats awfully kind of you its just right its awfully good of you really ill leave my kids and goats with you and mrs jim and of course any one in camp can show you about the milking  of course said william and she grew pinker and pinker and statelier and more stately as she strode back to her tent fanning herself with the saucer  there were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder children saw their nurse move off without them faiz ullah unbent so far as to jest with the policemen and scott turned purple with shame because hawkins already in the saddle roared  a child escaped from the care of mrs jim and running like a rabbit clung to scotts boot william pursuing with long easy strides  i will not goi will not go shrieked the child twining his feet round scotts ankle they will kill me here i do not know these people  i say said scott in broken tamil i say she will do you no harm go with her and be well fed  come said william panting with a wrathful glance at scott who stood helpless and as it were hamstrung  go back said scott quickly to william ill send the little chap over in a minute  the tone of authority had its effect but in a way scott did not exactly intend the boy loosened his grasp and said with gravity i did not know the woman was thine i will go then he cried to his companions a mob of three four and fiveyearolds waiting on the success of his venture ere they stampeded go back and eat it is our mans woman she will obey his orders  jim collapsed where he sat faiz ullah and the two policemen grinned and scotts orders to the cartmen flew like hail  that is the custom of the sahibs when truth is told in their presence said faiz ullah the time comes that i must seek new service young wives especially such as speak our language and have knowledge of the ways of the police make great trouble for honest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts  what william thought of it all she did not say but when her brother ten days later came to camp for orders and heard of scotts performances he said laughing well that settles it hell be bakri scott to the end of his days bakri in the northern vernacular means a goat what a lark id have given a months pay to have seen him nursing famine babies i fed some with conjee ricewater but that was all right  its perfectly disgusting said his sister with blazing eyes a man does something likelike thatand all you other men think of is to give him an absurd nickname and then you laugh and think its funny  ah said mrs jim sympathetically  well you cant talk william you christened little miss demby the buttonquail last cold weather you know you did indias the land of nicknames  thats different william replied she was only a girl and she hadnt done anything except walk like a quail and she does but it isnt fair to make fun of a man  scott wont care said martyn you cant get a rise out of old scotty ive been trying for eight years and youve only known him for three how does he look  he looks very well said william and went away with a flushed cheek bakri scott indeed then she laughed to herself for she knew her country but it will he bakri all the same and she repeated it under her breath several times slowly whispering it into favour  when he returned to his duties on the railway martyn spread the name far and wide among his associates so that scott met it as he led his paddycarts to war the natives believed it to be some english title of honour and the cartdrivers used it in all simplicity till faiz ullah who did not approve of foreign japes broke their heads there was very little time for milking now except at the big camps where jim had extended scotts idea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern grains sufficient paddy had come now into the eight districts to hold the people safe if it were only distributed quickly and for that purpose no one was better than the big canal officer who never lost his temper never gave an unnecessary order and never questioned an order given scott pressed on saving his cattle washing their galled necks daily so that no time should be lost on the road reported himself with his rice at the minor faminesheds unloaded and went back light by forced nightmarch to the next distributing centre to find hawkinss unvarying telegram do it again and he did it again and again and yet again while jim hawkins fifty miles away marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels gridironing the stricken lands others did wellhawkins reported at the end they all did wellbut scott was the most excellent for he kept good coined rupees by him settled for his own cartrepairs on the spot and ran to meet all sorts of unconsidered extras trusting to be recouped later on theoretically the government should have paid for every shoe and linchpin for every hand employed in the loading but government vouchers cash themselves slowly and intelligent and efficient clerks write at great length contesting unauthorised expenditures of eight annas the man who wants to make his work a success must draw on his own bankaccount of money or other things as he goes  i told you hed work said jimmy to his wife at the end of six weeks hes been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up north on the mosuhl canal for a year but he gives less trouble than young martyn with his ten constables and im morally certainonly government doesnt recognise moral obligationshes spent about half his pay to grease his wheels look at this lizzie for one weeks work forty miles in two days with twelve carts two days halt building a famineshed for young rogers rogers ought to have built it himself the idiot then forty miles back again loading six carts on the way and distributing all sunday then in the evening he pitches in a twentypage demiofficial to me saying the people where he is might be advantageously employed on reliefwork and suggesting that he put em to work on some brokendown old reservoir hes discovered so as to have a good watersupply when the rains break thinks he can cauk the dam in a fortnight look at his marginal sketchesarent they clear and good i knew he was pukka but i didnt know he was as pukka as this  i must show these to william said mrs jim the childs wearing herself out among the babies  not more than you are dear well another two months ought to see us out of the wood im sorry its not in my power to recommend you for a v c  william sat late in her tent that night reading through page after page of the square handwriting patting the sketches of proposed repairs to the reservoir and wrinkling her eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated watersupply and he finds time to do all this she cried to herself andwell i also was present ive saved one or two babies  she dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust and woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children scores of them wastrels picked up by the wayside their bones almost breaking their skin terrible and covered with sores  scott was not allowed to leave his cartwork but his letter was duly forwarded to the government and he had the consolation not rare in india of knowing that another man was reaping where he had sown that also was discipline profitable to the soul  hes much too good to waste on canals said jimmy any one can oversee coolies you neednt be angry william he canbut i need my pearl among bullockdrivers and ive transferred him to the khanda district where hell have it all to do over again he should be marching now  hes not a coolie said william furiously he ought to be doing his regulation work  hes the best man in his service and thats saying a good deal but if you must use razors to cut grindstones why i prefer the best cutlery  isnt it almost time we saw him again said mrs jim im sure the poor boy hasnt had a respectable meal for a month he probably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers  all in good time dear duty before decencywasnt it mr chucks said that  no it was midshipman easy william laughed i sometimes wonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again or sit under a roof i cant believe i ever wore a ballfrock in my life  one minute said mrs jim who was thinking if he goes to khanda he passes within five miles of us of course hell ride in  oh no he wont said william  how do you know dear  it will take him off his work he wont have time  hell make it said mrs jim with a twinkle  it depends on his own judgment theres absolutely no reason why he shouldnt if he thinks fit said jim  he wont see fit william replied without sorrow or emotion it wouldnt be him if he did  one certainly gets to know people rather well in times like these said jim drily but williams face was serene as ever and even as she prophesied scott did not appear  the rains fell at last late but heavily and the dry gashed earth was red mud and servants killed snakes in the camp where every one was weatherbound for a fortnightall except hawkins who took horse and plashed about in the wet rejoicing now the government decreed that seedgrain should be distributed to the people as well as advances of money for the purchase of new oxen and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty while william skipped from brick to brick laid down on the trampled mud and dosed her charges with warming medicines that made them rub their little round stomachs and the milch goats throve on the rank grass there was never a word from scott in the khanda district away to the southeast except the regular telegraphic report to hawkins the rude country roads had disappeared his drivers were half mutinous one of martyns loaned policemen had died of cholera and scott was taking thirty grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes with the rain but those were things scott did not consider necessary to report he was as usual working from a base of supplies on a railway line to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius and since full loads were impossible he took quarterloads and toiled four times as hard by consequence for he did not choose to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by assembling villagers in thousands at the reliefsheds it was cheaper to take government bullocks work them to death and leave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs  that was the time when eight years of clean living and hard condition told though a mans head were ringing like a bell from the cinchona and the earth swayed under his feet when he stood and under his bed when he slept if hawkins had seen fit to make him a bullockdriver that he thought was entirely hawkinss own affair there were men in the north who would know what he had done men of thirty years service in his own department who would say that it was not half bad and above immeasurably above all men of all grades there was william in the thick of the fight who would approve because she understood he had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the mechanical routine of the day though his own voice sounded strange in his own ears and his hands when he wrote grew large as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists that steadfastness bore his body to the telegraphoffice at the railwaystation and dictated a telegram to hawkins saying that the khanda district was in his judgment now safe and he waited further orders  the madrassee telegraphclerk did not approve of a large gaunt man falling over him in a dead faint not so much because of the weight as because of the names and blows that faiz ullah dealt him when he found the body rolled under a bench then faiz ullah took blankets quilts and coverlets where he found them and lay down under them at his masters side and bound his arms with a tentrope and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs and set the policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the intolerable heat of his coverings and shut the door of the telegraphoffice to keep out the curious for two nights and one day and when a light engine came down the line and hawkins kicked in the door scott hailed him weakly but in a natural voice and faiz ullah stood back and took all the credit  for two nights heavenborn he was pagal said faiz ullah look at my nose and consider the eye of the policeman he beat us with his bound hands but we sat upon him heavenborn and though his words were tez we sweated him heavenborn never has been such a sweat he is weaker now than a child but the fever has gone out of him by the grace of god there remains only my nose and the eye of the constabeel sahib shall i ask for my dismissal because my sahib has beaten me and faiz ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on scotts chest to be sure that the fever was all gone ere he went out to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose  the districts all right scott whispered it doesnt make any difference you got my wire i shall be fit in a week cant understand how it happened i shall be fit in a few days  youre coming into camp with us said hawkins  but look herebut  its all over except the shouting we shant need you punjabis any more on my honour we shant martyn goes back in a few weeks arbuthnots returned already ellis and clay are putting the last touches to a new feederline the governments built as reliefwork mortens deadhe was a bengal man though you wouldnt know him pon my word you and willmiss martynseem to have come through it as well as anybody  oh how is she bytheway the voice went up and down as he spoke  going strong when i left her the roman catholic missions are adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests the basil mission is taking some and the mothers are taking the rest you should hear the little beggars howl when theyre sent away from william shes pulled down a bit but so are we all now when do you suppose youll be able to move  i cant come into camp in this state i wont he replied pettishly  well you are rather a sight but from what i gathered there it seemed to me theyd be glad to see you under any conditions ill look over your work here if you like for a couple of days and you can pull yourself together while faiz ullah feeds you up  scott could walk dizzily by the time hawkinss inspection was ended and he flushed all over when jim said of his work that it was not half bad and volunteered further that he had considered scott his righthand man through the famine and would feel it his duty to say as much officially  so they came back by rail to the old camp but there were no crowds near it the long fires in the trenches were dead and black and the faminesheds were almost empty  you see said jim there isnt much more to do better ride up and see the wife theyve pitched a tent for you dinners at seven ive some work here  riding at a footpace faiz ullah by his stirrup scott came to william in the browncalico ridinghabit sitting at the diningtent door her hands in her lap white as ashes thin and worn with no lustre in her hair there did not seem to be any mrs jim on the horizon and all that william could say was my word how pulled down you look  ive had a touch of fever you dont look very well yourself  oh im fit enough weve stamped it out i suppose you know  scott nodded we shall all be returned in a few weeks hawkins told me  before christmas mrs jim says shant you be glad to go back i can smell the woodsmoke already william sniffed we shall be in time for all the christmas doings i dont suppose even the punjab government would be base enough to transfer jack till the new year  it seems hundreds of years agothe punjab and all thatdoesnt it are you glad you came  now its all over yes it has been ghastly here though you know we had to sit still and do nothing and sir jim was away so much  do nothing how did you get on with the milking  i managed it somehowafter you taught me remember  then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar still no mrs jim  that reminds me i owe you fifty rupees for the condensedmilk i thought perhaps youd be coming here when you were transferred to the khanda district and i could pay you then but you didnt  i passed within five miles of the camp but it was in the middle of a march you see and the carts were breaking down every few minutes and i couldnt get em over the ground till ten oclock that night i wanted to come awfully you knew i did didnt you  ibelieveidid said william facing him with level eyes she was no longer white  did you understand  why you didnt ride in of course i did  why  because you couldnt of course i knew that  did you care  if you had come inbut i knew you wouldntbut if you had i should have cared a great deal you know i should  thank god i didnt oh but i wanted to i couldnt trust myself to ride in front of the carts because i kept edging em over here dont you know  i knew you wouldnt said william contentedly heres your fifty  scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy notes its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the head  and you knew too didnt you said william in a new voice  no on my honour i didnt i hadnt thethe cheek to expect anything of the kind except i say were you out riding anywhere the day i passed by to khanda  william nodded and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised in a good deed  then it was just a speck i saw of your habit in the  palmgrove on the southern cartroad i saw your helmet when you came up from the mullah by the templejust enough to be sure that you were all right d you care  this time scott did not kiss her hand for they were in the dusk of the diningtent and because williams knees were trembling under her she had to sit down in the nearest chair where she wept long and happily her head on her arms and when scott imagined that it would be well to comfort her she needing nothing of the kind she ran to her own tent and scott went out into the world and smiled upon it largely and idiotically but when faiz ullah brought him a drink he found it necessary to support one hand with the other or the good whisky and soda would have been spilled abroad there are fevers and fevers  but it was worsemuch worsethe strained eyeshirking talk at dinner till the servants had withdrawn and worst of all when mrs jim who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down kissed scott and william and they drank one whole bottle of champagne hot because there was no ice and scott and william sat outside the tent in the starlight till mrs jim drove them in for fear of more fever  apropos of these things and some others william said being engaged is abominable because you see one has no official position we must be thankful weve lots of things to do  things to do said jim when that was reported to him theyre neither of them any good any more i cant get five hours work a day out of scott hes in the clouds half the time  oh but theyre so beautiful to watch jimmy it will break my heart when they go cant you do anything for him  ive given the government the impressionat least i hope i havethat he personally conducted the entire famine but all he wants is to get on to the luni canal works and williams just as bad have you ever heard em talking of barrage and aprons and wastewater its their style of spooning i suppose  mrs jim smiled tenderly ah thats in the intervalsbless em  and so love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight while men picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the famine in the eight districts                        morning brought the penetrating chill of the northern december the layers of woodsmoke the dusty greyblue of the tamarisks the domes of ruined tombs and all the smell of the white northern plains as the mailtrain ran on to the milelong sutlej bridge william wrapped in a poshteena silkembroidered sheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhanlooked out with moist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously the south of pagodas and palmtrees the overpopulated hindu south was done with here was the land she knew and loved and before her lay the good life she understood among folk of her own caste and mind  they were picking them up at almost every station nowmen and women coming in for the christmas week with racquets with bundles of polosticks with dear and bruised cricketbats with foxterriers and saddles the greater part of them wore jackets like williams for the northern cold is as little to be trifled with as the northern heat and william was among them and of them her hands deep in her pockets her collar turned up over her ears stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and down to get warm visiting from carriage to carriage and everywhere being congratulated scott was with the bachelors at the far end of the train where they chaffed him mercilessly about feeding babies and milking goats but from time to time he would stroll up to williams window and murmur good enough isnt it and william would answer with sighs of pure delight good enough indeed the large open names of the home towns were good to listen to umballa ludianah phillour jullundur they rang like the coming marriagebells in her ears and william felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsidersvisitors tourists and those freshcaught for the service of the country  it was a glorious return and when the bachelors gave the christmas ball william was unofficially you might say the chief and honoured guest among the stewards who could make things very pleasant for their friends she and scott danced nearly all the dances together and sat out the rest in the big dark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor where the uniforms blazed and the spurs clinked and the new frocks and four hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags on the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it  about midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came over from the club to play waits and that was a surprise the stewards had arrangedbefore any one knew what had happened the band stopped and hidden voices broke into good king wenceslaus and william in the gallery hummed and beat time with her foot               mark my footsteps well my page                 tread thou in them boldly               thou shalt feel the winters rage                 freeze thy blood less coldly  oh i hope they are going to give us another isnt it pretty coming out of the dark in that way looklook down theres mrs gregory wiping her eyes  its like home rather said scott i remember  hsh listendear and it began again               when shepherds watched their flocks by night  ahh said william drawing closer to scott                all seated on the ground                the angel of the lord came down                and glory shone around               fear not said he for mighty dread                had seized their troubled mind               glad tidings of great joy i bring                to you and all mankind  this time it was william that wiped her eyes     007   a locomotive is next to a marine engine the most sensitive thing man ever made and no 007 besides being sensitive was new the red paint was hardly dry on his spotless bumperbar his headlight shone like a firemans helmet and his cab might have been a hardwoodfinish parlour they had run him into the roundhouse after his trialhe had said goodbye to his best friend in the shops the overhead travellingcranethe big world was just outside and the other locos were taking stock of him he looked at the semicircle of bold unwinking headlights heard the low purr and mutter of the steam mounting in the gaugesscornful hisses of contempt as a slack valve lifted a littleand would have given a months oil for leave to crawl through his own drivingwheels into the brick ashpit beneath him 007 was an eightwheeled american loco slightly different from others of his type and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the companys books but if you had bought him at his own valuation after half an hours waiting in the darkish echoing roundhouse you would have saved exactly nine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine dollars and ninetyeight cents  a heavy mogul freight with a short cowcatcher and a firebox that came down within three inches of the rail began the impolite game speaking to a pittsburgh consolidation who was visiting  where did this thing blow in from he asked with a dreamy puff of light steam  its all i can do to keep track of our makes was the answer without lookin after your backnumbers guess its something peter cooper left over when he died  007 quivered his steam was getting up but he held his tongue even a handcar knows what sort of locomotive it was that peter cooper experimented upon in the faraway thirties it carried its coal and water in two applebarrels and was not much bigger than a bicycle  then up and spoke a small newish switchingengine with a little step in front of his bumpertimber and his wheels so close together that he looked like a broncho getting ready to buck  somethings wrong with the road when a pennsylvania gravelpusher tells us anything about our stock i think that kids all right eustis designed him and eustis designed me aint that good enough  007 could have carried the switchingloco round the yard in his tender but he felt grateful for even this little word of consolation  we dont use handcars on the pennsylvania said the consolidation thaterpeanutstand is old enough and ugly enough to speak for himself  he hasnt bin spoken to yet hes bin spoke at haint ye any manners on the pennsylvania said the switchingloco  you ought to be in the yard poney said the mogul severely were all longhaulers here  thats what you think the little fellow replied youll know more fore the nights out ive bin down to track 17 and the freight thereoh christmas  ive trouble enough in my own division said a lean light suburban loco with very shiny brakeshoes my commuters wouldnt rest till they got a parlourcar theyve hitched it back of all and it hauls worsen a snowplough ill snap her off someday sure and then theyll blame every one except their foolselves theyll be askin me to haul a vestibuled next  they made you in new jersey didnt they said poney thought so commuters and truckwagons aint any sweet haulin but i tell you theyre a heap better n cuttin out refrigeratorcars or oiltanks why ive hauled  haul you said the mogul contemptuously its all you can do to bunt a coldstorage car up the yard now i he paused a little to let the words sink ini handle the flying freighteleven cars worth just anything you please to mention on the stroke of eleven i pull out and im timed for thirtyfive an hour costlyperishablefragile immediatethats me suburban traffics only but one degree better than switching express freights what pays  well i aint given to blowing as a rule began the pittsburgh consolidation  no you was sent in here because you grunted on the grade poney interrupted  where i grunt youd lie down poney but as i was saying i dont blow much notwithstandin if you want to see freight that is freight moved lively you should see me warbling through the alleghanies with thirtyseven orecars behind me and my brakemen fightin tramps sos they cant attend to my tooter i have to do all the holdin back then and though i say it ive never had a load get away from me yet no sir haulinss one thing but judgment and discretions another you want judgment in my business  ah butbut are you not paralysed by a sense of your overwhelming responsibilities said a curious husky voice from a corner  whos that007 whispered to the jersey commuter  compoundexperimentng shes bin switchin in the b  a yards for six months when she wasnt in the shops shes economical i call it mean in her coal but she takes it out in repairs ahem i presume you found boston somewhat isolated madam after your new york season  i am never so well occupied as when i am alone the compound seemed to be talking from halfway up her smokestack  sure said the irreverent poney under his breath they dont hanker after her any in the yard  but with my constitution and temperamentmy work lies in bostoni find your outrecuidance  outer which said the mogul freight simple cylinders are good enough for me  perhaps i should have said faroucherie hissed the compound  i dont hold with any make of papiermache wheel the mogul insisted  the compound sighed pityingly and said no more  git em all shapes in this world dont ye said poney thats masschusetts all over they half start an then they stick on a deadcentre an blame it all on other folks ways o treatin them talkin o boston comanche told me last night he had a hotbox just beyond the newtons friday that was why he says the accommodation was held up made out no end of a tale comanche did  if id heard that in the shops with my boiler out for repairs id know t was one o comanches lies the new jersey commuter snapped hotbox him what happened was theyd put an extra car on and he just lay down on the grade and squealed they had to send 127 to help him through made it out a hotbox did he time before that he said he was ditched looked me square in the headlight and told me that as cool asas a watertank in a cold wave hotbox you ask 127 about comanches hotbox why comanche he was sidetracked and 127 he was just about as mad as they make em on account o being called out at ten oclock at night took hold and snapped her into boston in seventeen minutes hotbox hot fraud thats what comanche is  then007 put both drivers and his pilot into it as the saying is for he asked what sort of thing a hotbox might be  paint my bell skyblue said poney the switcher make me a surfacerailroad loco with a hardwood skirtinboard round my wheels break me up and cast me into fivecent sidewalkfakirs mechanical toys heres an eightwheel coupled american dont know what a hotbox is never heard of an emergencystop either did ye dont know what ye carry jackscrews for youre too innocent to be left alone with your own tender oh youyou flatcar  there was a roar of escaping steam before any one could answer and 007 nearly blistered his paint off with pure mortification  a hotbox began the compound picking and choosing her words as though they were coal a hotbox is the penalty exacted from inexperience by haste ahem  hotbox said the jersey suburban its the price you pay for going on the tear its years since ive had one its a disease that dont attack shorthaulers as a rule  we never have hotboxes on the pennsylvania said the consolidation they get em in new yorksame as nervous prostration  ah go home on a ferryboat said the mogul you think because you use worse grades than our road ud allow youre a kind of alleghany angel now ill tell you what you heres my folk well i cant stop see you later perhaps  he rolled forward majestically to the turntable and swung like a manofwar in a tideway till he picked up his track but as for you you peagreen swiveling coffeepot this to007 you go out and learn something before you associate with those whove made more mileage in a week than youll roll up in a year costlyperishablefragile immediatethats me s long  split my tubes if thats actin polite to a new member o the brotherhood said poney there wasnt any call to trample on ye like that but manners was left out when moguls was made keep up your fire kid an burn your own smoke guess well all be wanted in a minute  men were talking rather excitedly in the roundhouse one man in a dingy jersey said that he hadnt any locomotives to waste on the yard another man with a piece of crumpled paper in his hand said that the yardmaster said that he was to say that if the other man said anything he the other man was to shut his head then the other man waved his arms and wanted to know if he was expected to keep locomotives in his hippocket then a man in a black prince albert without a collar came up dripping for it was a hot august night and said that what he said went and between the three of them the locomotives began to go toofirst the compound then the consolidation then007  now deep down in his firebox 007 had cherished a hope that as soon as his trial was done he would be led forth with songs and shoutings and attached to a greenandchocolate vestibuled flyer under charge of a bold and noble engineer who would pat him on his back and weep over him and call him his arab steed the boys in the shops where he was built used to read wonderful stories of railroad life and 007 expected things to happen as he had heard but there did not seem to be many vestibuled fliers in the roaring rumbling electriclighted yards and his engineer only said  now what sort of a foolsort of an injector has eustis loaded on to this rig this time and he put the lever over with an angry snap crying am i supposed to switch with this thing hey  the collarless man mopped his head and replied that in the present state of the yard and freight and a few other things the engineer would switch and keep on switching till the cows came home 007 pushed out gingerly his heart in his headlight so nervous that the clang of his own bell almost made him jump the track lanterns waved or danced up and down before and behind him and on every side six tracks deep sliding backward and forward with clashings of couplers and squeals of handbrakes were carsmore cars than 007 had dreamed of there were oilcars and haycars and stockcars full of lowing beasts and orecars and potatocars with stovepipeends sticking out in the middle coldstorage and refrigerator cars dripping ice water on the tracks ventilated fruitand milkcars flatcars with truckwagons full of marketstuff flatcars loaded with reapers and binders all red and green and gilt under the sizzling electric lights flatcars piled high with strongscented hides pleasant hemlockplank or bundles of shingles flatcars creaking to the weight of thirtyton castings angleirons and rivetboxes for some new bridge and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of boxcars loaded locked and chalked menhot and angrycrawled among and between and under the thousand wheels men took flying jumps through his cab when he halted for a moment men sat on his pilot as he went forward and on his tender as he returned and regiments of men ran along the tops of the boxcars beside him screwing down brakes waving their arms and crying curious things  he was pushed forward a foot at a time whirled backward his rear drivers clinking and clanking a quarter of a mile jerked into a switch yardswitches are very stubby and unaccommodating bunted into a red d or merchants transport car and with no hint or knowledge of the weight behind him started up anew when his load was fairly on the move three or four cars would be cut off and 007 would bound forward only to be held hiccupping on the brake then he would wait a few minutes watching the whirled lanterns deafened with the clang of the bells giddy with the vision of the sliding cars his brakepump panting forty to the minute his front coupler lying sideways on his cowcatcher like a tired dogs tongue in his mouth and the whole of him covered with halfburnt coaldust  tisnt so easy switching with a straightbacked tender said his little friend of the roundhouse bustling by at a trot but youre comin on pretty fair ever seen a flyin switch no then watch me  poney was in charge of a dozen heavy flatcars suddenly he shot away from them with a sharp whutt a switch opened in the shadows ahead he turned up it like a rabbit as it snapped behind him and the long line of twelvefoothigh lumber jolted on into the arms of a fullsized roadloco who acknowledged receipt with a dry howl  my mans reckoned the smartest in the yard at that trick he said returning gives me cold shivers when another fool tries it though thats where my short wheelbase comes in like as not youd have your tender scraped off if you tried it  007 had no ambitions that way and said so  no of course this aint your regular business but say dont you think its interestin have you seen the yardmaster well hes the greatest man on earth an dont you forget it when are we through why kid its always like this day an nightsundays an weekdays see that thirtycar freight slidin in four no five tracks off shes all mixed freight sent here to be sorted out into straight trains thats why were cuttin out the cars one by one he gave a vigorous push to a westbound car as he spoke and started back with a little snort of surprise for the car was an old friendan m

got track of her dunno quite how our men fix it swap around i guess anyway ive done my duty shes on her way to kansas via chicago but ill lay my next boilerful shell be held there to wait consignees convenience and sent back to us with wheat in the fall  just then the pittsburgh consolidation passed at the head of a dozen cars  im goin home he said proudly  cant get all them twelve on to the flat break em in half dutchy cried poney but it was007 who was backed down to the last six cars and he nearly blew up with surprise when he found himself pushing them on to a huge ferryboat he had never seen deep water before and shivered as the flat drew away and left his bogies within six inches of the black shiny tide  after this he was hurried to the freighthouse where he saw the yardmaster a smallish whitefaced man in shirt trousers and slippers looking down upon a sea of trucks a mob of bawling truckmen and squadrons of backing turning sweating sparkstriking horses  thats shippers carts loadin on to the receivin trucks said the small engine reverently but he dont care he lets em cuss hes the czarkingboss he says please and then they kneel down an pray theres three or four strings o todays freight to be pulled before he can attend to them when he waves his hand that way things happen  a string of loaded cars slid out down the track and a string of empties took their place bales crates boxes jars carboys frails cases and packages flew into them from the freighthouse as though the cars had been magnets and they iron filings  kiyah shrieked little poney aint it great  a purplefaced truckman shouldered his way to the yardmaster and shook his fist under his nose the yardmaster never looked up from his bundle of freight receipts he crooked his forefinger slightly and a tall young man in a red shirt lounging carelessly beside him hit the truckman under the left ear so that he dropped quivering and clucking on a haybale  eleven seven ninetyseven l y s fourteen ought ought three nineteen thirteen one one four seventeen ought twentyone m b and the ten westbound all straight except the two last cut em off at the junction an thats all right pull that string the yardmaster with mild blue eyes looked out over the howling truckmen at the waters in the moonlight beyond and hummed                   all things bright and beautiful                   all creatures great and small                   all things wise and wonderful                   the lawd gawd he made all  007 moved out the cars and delivered them to the regular roadengine he had never felt quite so limp in his life before  curious aint it said poney puffing on the next track you an me if we got that man under our bumpers wed work him into red waste an not know what wed done butup therewith the steam hummin in his boiler that awful quiet way  i know said007 makes me feel as if id dropped my fire an was getting cold he is the greatest man on earth  they were at the far north end of the yard now under a switchtower looking down on the fourtrack way of the main traffic the boston compound was to haul 007s string to some faraway northern junction over an indifferent roadbed and she mourned aloud for the ninetysix pound rails of the b  a  youre young youre young she coughed you dont realise your responsibilities  yes he does said poney sharply but he dont lie down under em then with asidespurt of steam exactly like a tough spitting there aint more than fifteen thousand dollars worth o freight behind her anyway and she goes on as if t were a hundred thousandsame as the moguls excuse me madam but youve the track shes stuck on a deadcentre againbein specially designed not to  the compound crawled across the tracks on a long slant groaning horribly at each switch and moving like a cow in a snowdrift there was a little pause along the yard after her taillights had disappeared switches locked crisply and every one seemed to be waiting  now ill show you something worth said poney when the purple emperor aint on time its about time to amend the constitution the first stroke of twelve is  boom went the clock in the big yardtower and far away007 heard a full vibrating yah yah yah a headlight twinkled on the horizon like a star grew an overpowering blaze and whooped up the humming track to the roaring music of a happy giants song    with a michnaighignaishtingal  yah  yah  yah    einzweidreimutter  yah  yah  yah         she climb upon der shteeple         und she frighten all der people    singin michnaighignaishtingal  yah  yah  the last defiant yah yah was delivered a mile and a half beyond the passengerdepot but 007 had caught one glimpse of the superb sixwheelcoupled racinglocomotive who hauled the pride and glory of the roadthe giltedged purple emperor the millionaires southbound express laying the miles over his shoulder as a man peels a shaving from a soft board the rest was a blur of maroon enamel a bar of white light from the electrics in the cars and a flicker of nickelplated handrail on the rear platform  ooh said007  seventyfive miles an hour these five miles baths ive heard barbers shop ticker and a library and the rest to match yes sir seventyfive an hour but hell talk to you in the roundhouse just as democratic as i would and icuss my wheelbaseid kick clean off the track at half his gait hes the master of our lodge cleans up at our house ill introdooce you some day hes worth knowin there aint many can sing that song either  007 was too full of emotions to answer he did not hear a raging of telephonebells in the switchtower nor the man as he leaned out and called to 007s engineer got any steam  nough to run her a hundred mile out o this if i could said the engineer who belonged to the open road and hated switching  then get the flying freights ditched forty mile out with fifty rod o track ploughed up no no ones hurt but both tracks are blocked lucky the wreckincar an derrick are this end of the yard crew ll be along in a minute hurry youve the track  well i could jest kick my little sawedoff self said poney as 007 was backed with a bang on to a grim and grimy car like a caboose but full of toolsa flatcar and a derrick behind it some folks are one thing and some are another but youre in luck kid they push a wreckingcar now dont get rattled your wheelbase will keep you on the track and there aint any curves worth mentionin oh say comanche told me theres one section o sawedged track thats liable to jounce ye a little fifteen an a half out after the grade at jacksons crossin youll know it by a farmhouse an a windmill an five maples in the dooryard windmills west o the maples an theres an eightyfoot iron bridge in the middle o that section with no guardrails see you later luck  before he knew well what had happened 007 was flying up the track into the dumb dark world then fears of the night beset him he remembered all he had ever heard of landslides rainpiled boulders blown trees and strayed cattle all that the boston compound had ever said of responsibility and a great deal more that came out of his own head with a very quavering voice he whistled for his first gradecrossing an event in the life of a locomotive and his nerves were in no way restored by the sight of a frantic horse and a whitefaced man in a buggy less than a yard from his right shoulder then he was sure he would jump the track felt his flanges mounting the rail at every curve knew that his first grade would make him lie down even as comanche had done at the newtons he whirled down the grade to jacksons crossing saw the windmill west of the maples felt the badly laid rails spring under him and sweated big drops all over his boiler at each jarring bump he believed an axle had smashed and he took the eightyfoot bridge without the guardrail like a hunted cat on the top of a fence then a wet leaf stuck against the glass of his headlight and threw a flying shadow on the track so that he thought it was some little dancing animal that would feel soft if he ran over it and anything soft underfoot frightens a locomotive as it does an elephant but the men behind seemed quite calm the wreckingcrew were climbing carelessly from the caboose to the tendereven jesting with the engineer for he heard a shuffling of feet among the coal and the snatch of a song something like this     oh the empire state must learn to wait     and the cannonball go hang     when the westbounds ditched and the toolcars hitched     and its way for the breakdown gang tarera     way for the breakdown gang  say eustis knew what he was doin when he designed this rig shes a hummer new too  snff phew she is new that aint paint thats  a burning pain shot through 007s right rear drivera crippling stinging pain  this said 007 as he flew is a hotbox now i know what it means i shall go to pieces i guess my first roadrun too  het a bit aint she the fireman ventured to suggest to the engineer  shell hold for all we want of her were most there guess you chaps back had better climb into your car said the engineer his hand on the brake lever ive seen men snapped off  but the crew fled back with laughter they had no wish to be jerked on to the track the engineer half turned his wrist and 007 found his drivers pinned firm  now its come said 007 as he yelled aloud and slid like a sleigh for the moment he fancied that he would jerk bodily from off his underpinning  that must be the emergencystop that poney guyed me about he gasped as soon as he could think hotboxemergencystop they both hurt but now i can talk back in the roundhouse  he was halted all hissing hot a few feet in the rear of what doctors would call a compoundcomminuted car his engineer was kneeling down among his drivers but he did not call007 his arab steed nor cry over him as the engineers did in the newspapers he just bad worded007 and pulled yards of charred cottonwaste from about the axles and hoped he might some day catch the idiot who had packed it nobody else attended to him for evans the moguls engineer a little cut about the head but very angry was exhibiting by lanternlight the mangled corpse of a slim blue pig  t were nt even a decentsized hog he said t were a shote  dangerousest beasts they are said one of the crew get under the pilot an sort o twiddle ye off the track dont they  dont they roared evans who was a redheaded welshman you talk as if i was ditched by a hog every foolday o the week i aint friends with all the cussed halffed shotes in the state o new york no indeed yes this is himan look what hes done  it was not a bad nights work for one stray piglet the flying freight seemed to have flown in every direction for the mogul had mounted the rails and run diagonally a few hundred feet from right to left taking with him such cars as cared to follow some did not they broke their couplers and lay down while rear cars frolicked over them in that game they had ploughed up and removed and twisted a good deal of the lefthand track the mogul himself had waddled into a cornfield and there he kneltfantastic wreaths of green twisted round his crankpins his pilot covered with solid clods of field on which corn nodded drunkenly his fire put out with dirt evans had done that as soon as he recovered his senses and his broken headlight half full of halfburnt moths his tender had thrown coal all over him and he looked like a disreputable buffalo who had tried to wallow in a general store for there lay scattered over the landscape from the burst cars typewriters sewingmachines bicycles in crates a consignment of silverplated imported harness french dresses and gloves a dozen finely moulded hardwood mantels a fifteenfoot naphthalaunch with a solid brass bedstead crumpled around her bows a case of telescopes and microscopes two coffins a case of very best candies some giltedged dairy produce butter and eggs in an omelette a broken box of expensive toys and a few hundred other luxuries a camp of tramps hurried up from nowhere and generously volunteered to help the crew so the brakemen armed with couplerpins walked up and down on one side and the freightconductor and the fireman patrolled the other with their hands in their hippockets a longbearded man came out of a house beyond the cornfield and told evans that if the accident had happened a little later in the year all his corn would have been burned and accused evans of carelessness then he ran away for evans was at his heels shrieking t was his hog done ithis hog done it let me kill him let me kill him then the wreckingcrew laughed and the farmer put his head out of a window and said that evans was no gentleman  but 007 was very sober he had never seen a wreck before and it frightened him the crew still laughed but they worked at the same time and 007 forgot horror in amazement at the way they handled the mogul freight they dug round him with spades they put ties in front of his wheels and jackscrews under him they embraced him with the derrickchain and tickled him with crowbars while 007 was hitched on to wrecked cars and backed away till the knot broke or the cars rolled clear of the track by dawn thirty or forty men were at work replacing and ramming down the ties gauging the rails and spiking them by daylight all cars who could move had gone on in charge of another loco the track was freed for traffic and 007 had hauled the old mogul over a small pavement of ties inch by inch till his flanges bit the rail once more and he settled down with a clank but his spirit was broken and his nerve was gone  t werent even a hog he repeated dolefully t were a shote and youyou of all of emhad to help me on  but how in the whole long road did it happen asked 007 sizzling with curiosity  happen it didnt happen it just come i sailed right on top of him around that last curvethought he was a skunk yes he was all as little as that he hadnt more n squealed once fore i felt my bogies lift hed rolled right under the pilot and i couldnt catch the track again to save me swivelled clean off i was then i felt him sling himself along all greasy under my left leadin driver and oh boilers that mounted the rail i heard my flanges zippin along the ties an the next i knew i was playin sally sally waters in the corn my tender shuckin coal through my cab an old man evans lyin still an bleedin in front o me shook there aint a stay or a bolt or a rivet in me that aint sprung to glory somewhere  umm said 007 what d you reckon you weigh  without these lumps o dirt im all of a hundred thousand pound  and the shote  eighty call him a hundred pound at the outside hes worth about four n a half dollars aint it awful aint it enough to give you nervous prostration aint it paralysin why i come just around that curve and the mogul told the tale again for he was very badly shaken  well its all in the days run i guess said 007 soothingly anan a cornfields pretty soft fallin  if it had bin a sixtyfoot bridge an i could ha slid off into deep water an blown up an killed both men same as others have done i wouldnt ha cared but to be ditched by a shotean you to help me outin a cornfieldan an old hayseed in his nightgown cussin me like as if i was a sick truckhorse oh its awful dont call me mogul im a sewinmachine theyll guy my sandbox off in the yard  and 007 his hotbox cooled and his experience vastly enlarged hauled the mogul freight slowly to the roundhouse  hello old man bin out all night haint ye said the irrepressible poney who had just come off duty well i must say you look it costlyperishablefragileimmediatethats you go to the shops take them vineleaves out o your hair an git em to play the hose on you  leave him alone poney said 007 severely as he was swung on the turntable or ill  didnt know the old granger was any special friend o yours kid he wasnt overcivil to you last time i saw him  i know it but ive seen a wreck since then and it has about scared the paint off me im not going to guy anyone as long as i steamnot when theyre new to the business an anxious to learn and im not goin to guy the old mogul either though i did find him wreathed around with roastinears t was a little bit of a shotenot a hogjust a shote poneyno biggern a lump of anthracitei saw itthat made all the mess anybody can be ditched i guess  found that out already have you well thats a good beginnin it was the purple emperor with his high tight plateglass cab and green velvet cushion waiting to be cleaned for his next days fly  let me make you two genlemen acquainted said poney this is our purple emperor kid whom you were admirin and i may say envyin last night this is a new brother worshipful sir with most of his mileage ahead of him but so far as a servingbrother can ill answer for him  happy to meet you said the purple emperor with a glance round the crowded roundhouse i guess there are enough of us here to form a full meetin ahem by virtue of the authority vested in me as head of the road i hereby declare and pronounce no007 a full and accepted brother of the amalgamated brotherhood of locomotives and as such entitled to all shop switch track tank and roundhouse privileges throughout my jurisdiction in the degree of superior flier it bein well known and credibly reported to me that our brother has covered fortyone miles in thirtynine minutes and a half on an errand of mercy to the afflicted at a convenient time i myself will communicate to you the song and signal of this degree whereby you may be recognised in the darkest night take your stall newly entered brother among locomotives                        now in the darkest night even as the purple emperor said if you will stand on the bridge across the freightyard looking down upon the fourtrack way at 230 a m neither before nor after when the white moth that takes the overflow from the purple emperor tears south with her seven vestibuled creamwhite cars you will hear as the yardclock makes the halfhour a faraway sound like the bass of a violoncello and then a hundred feet to each word      with a michnaighignaishtingal  yah  yah  yah      einzweidreimutter  yah  yah  yah            she climb upon der shteeple            und she frighten all der people      singin michnaighignaishtingal  yah  yah  that is 007 covering his one hundred and fiftysix miles in two hundred and twentyone minutes     the maltese cat  they had good reason to be proud and better reason to be afraid all twelve of them for though they had fought their way game by game up the teams entered for the polo tournament they were meeting the archangels that afternoon in the final match and the archangels men were playing with half a dozen ponies apiece as the game was divided into six quarters of eight minutes each that meant a fresh pony after every halt the skidars team even supposing there were no accidents could only supply one pony for every other change and two to one is heavy odds again as shiraz the grey syrian pointed out they were meeting the pink and pick of the poloponies of upper india ponies that had cost from a thousand rupees each while they themselves were a cheap lot gathered often from countrycarts by their masters who belonged to a poor but honest native infantry regiment  money means pace and weight said shiraz rubbing his blacksilk nose dolefully along his neatfitting boot and by the maxims of the game as i know it  ah but we arent playing the maxims said the maltese cat were playing the game and weve the great advantage of knowing the game just think a stride shiraz weve pulled up from bottom to second place in two weeks against all those fellows on the ground here thats because we play with our heads as well as our feet  it makes me feel undersized and unhappy all the same said kittiwynk a mousecoloured mare with a red browband and the cleanest pair of legs that ever an aged pony owned theyve twice our style these others  kittiwynk looked at the gathering and sighed the hard dusty pologround was lined with thousands of soldiers black and white not counting hundreds and hundreds of carriages and drags and dogcarts and ladies with brilliantcoloured parasols and officers in uniform and out of it and crowds of natives behind them and orderlies on camels who had halted to watch the game instead of carrying letters up and down the station and native horsedealers running about on thineared biluchi mares looking for a chance to sell a few firstclass poloponies then there were the ponies of thirty teams that had entered for the upper india freeforall cupnearly every pony of worth and dignity from mhow to peshawar from allahabad to multan prize ponies arabs syrian barb countrybred deccanee waziri and kabul ponies of every colour and shape and temper that you could imagine some of them were in matroofed stables close to the pologround but most were under saddle while their masters who had been defeated in the earlier games trotted in and out and told the world exactly how the game should be played  it was a glorious sight and the come and go of the little quick hooves and the incessant salutations of ponies that had met before on other pologrounds or racecourses were enough to drive a fourfooted thing wild  but the skidars team were careful not to know their neighbours though half the ponies on the ground were anxious to scrape acquaintance with the little fellows that had come from the north and so far had swept the board  lets see said a soft goldcoloured arab who had been playing very badly the day before to the maltese cat didnt we meet in abdul rahmans stable in bombay four seasons ago i won the paikpattan cup next season you may remember  not me said the maltese cat politely i was at malta then pulling a vegetablecart i dont race i play the game  oh said the arab cocking his tail and swaggering off  keep yourselves to yourselves said the maltese cat to his companions we dont want to rub noses with all those gooserumped halfbreeds of upper india when weve won this cup theyll give their shoes to know us  we shant win the cup said shiraz how do you feel  stale as last nights feed when a muskrat has run over it said polaris a rather heavyshouldered grey and the rest of the team agreed with him  the sooner you forget that the better said the maltese cat cheerfully theyve finished tiffin in the big tent we shall be wanted now if your saddles are not comfy kick if your bits arent easy rear and let the saises know whether your boots are tight  each pony had his sais his groom who lived and ate and slept with the animal and had betted a good deal more than he could afford on the result of the game there was no chance of anything going wrong but to make sure each sais was shampooing the legs of his pony to the last minute behind the saises sat as many of the skidars regiment as had leave to attend the matchabout half the native officers and a hundred or two dark blackbearded men with the regimental pipers nervously fingering the big beribboned bagpipes the skidars were what they call a pioneer regiment and the bagpipes made the national music of half their men the native officers held bundles of polosticks long canehandled mallets and as the grand stand filled after lunch they arranged themselves by ones and twos at different points round the ground so that if a stick were broken the player would not have far to ride for a new one an impatient british cavalry band struck up if you want to know the time ask a pleeceman and the two umpires in light dustcoats danced out on two little excited ponies the four players of the archangels team followed and the sight of their beautiful mounts made shiraz groan again  wait till we know said the maltese cat two of em are playing in blinkers and that means they cant see to get out of the way of their own side or they may shy at the umpires ponies theyve all got white webreins that are sure to stretch or slip  and said kittiwynk dancing to take the stiffness out of her they carry their whips in their hands instead of on their wrists hah  true enough no man can manage his stick and his reins and his whip that way said the maltese cat ive fallen over every square yard of the malta ground and i ought to know  he quivered his little fleabitten withers just to show how satisfied he felt but his heart was not so light ever since he had drifted into india on a troopship taken with an old rifle as part payment for a racing debt the maltese cat had played and preached polo to the skidars team on the skidars stony pologround now a polopony is like a poet if he is born with a love for the game he can be made the maltese cat knew that bamboos grew solely in order that poloballs might be turned from their roots that grain was given to ponies to keep them in hard condition and that ponies were shod to prevent them slipping on a turn but besides all these things he knew every trick and device of the finest game in the world and for two seasons had been teaching the others all he knew or guessed  remember he said for the hundredth time as the riders came up you must play together and you must play with your heads whatever happens follow the ball who goes out first  kittiwynk shiraz polaris and a short high little bay fellow with tremendous hocks and no withers worth speaking of he was called corks were being girthed up and the soldiers in the background stared with all their eyes  i want you men to keep quiet said lutyens the captain of the team and especially not to blow your pipes  not if we win captain sahib asked the piper  if we win you can do what you please said lutyens with a smile as he slipped the loop of his stick over his wrist and wheeled to canter to his place the archangels ponies were a little bit above themselves on account of the manycoloured crowd so close to the ground their riders were excellent players but they were a team of crack players instead of a crack team and that made all the difference in the world they honestly meant to play together but it is very hard for four men each the best of the team he is picked from to remember that in polo no brilliancy in hitting or riding makes up for playing alone their captain shouted his orders to them by name and it is a curious thing that if you call his name aloud in public after an englishman you make him hot and fretty lutyens said nothing to his men because it had all been said before he pulled up shiraz for he was playing back to guard the goal powell on polaris was halfback and macnamara and hughes on corks and kittiwynk were forwards the tough bamboo ball was set in the middle of the ground one hundred and fifty yards from the ends and hughes crossed sticks heads up with the captain of the archangels who saw fit to play forward that is a place from which you cannot easily control your team the little click as the caneshafts met was heard all over the ground and then hughes made some sort of quick wriststroke that just dribbled the ball a few yards kittiwynk knew that stroke of old and followed as a cat follows a mouse while the captain of the archangels was wrenching his pony round hughes struck with all his strength and next instant kittiwynk was away corks following close behind her their little feet pattering like raindrops on glass  pull out to the left said kittiwynk between her teeth its coming your way corks  the back and halfback of the archangels were tearing down on her just as she was within reach of the ball hughes leaned forward with a loose rein and cut it away to the left almost under kittiwynks foot and it hopped and skipped off to corks who saw that if he was not quick it would run beyond the boundaries that long bouncing drive gave the archangels time to wheel and send three men across the ground to head off corks kittiwynk stayed where she was for she knew the game corks was on the ball half a fraction of a second before the others came up and macnamara with a backhanded stroke sent it back across the ground to hughes who saw the way clear to the archangels goal and smacked the ball in before any one quite knew what had happened  thats luck said corks as they changed ends a goal in three minutes for three hits and no riding to speak of  dont know said polaris weve made em angry too soon shouldnt wonder if they tried to rush us off our feet next time  keep the ball hanging then said shiraz that wears out every pony that is not used to it  next time there was no easy galloping across the ground all the archangels closed up as one man but there they stayed for corks kittiwynk and polaris were somewhere on the top of the ball marking time among the rattling sticks while shiraz circled about outside waiting for a chance  we can do this all day said polaris ramming his quarters into the side of another pony where do you think youre shoving to  illill be driven in an ekka if i know was the gasping reply and id give a weeks feed to get my blinkers off i cant see anything  the dust is rather bad whew that was one for my offhock wheres the ball corks  under my tail at least the mans looking for it there this is beautiful they cant use their sticks and its driving em wild give old blinkers a push and then hell go over  here dont touch me i cant see illill back out i think said the pony in blinkers who knew that if you cant see all round your head you cannot prop yourself against the shock  corks was watching the ball where it lay in the dust close to his near foreleg with macnamaras shortened stick taptapping it from time to time kittiwynk was edging her way out of the scrimmage whisking her stump of a tail with nervous excitement  ho theyve got it she snorted let me out and she galloped like a riflebullet just behind a tall lanky pony of the archangels whose rider was swinging up his stick for a stroke  not today thank you said hughes as the blow slid off his raised stick and kittiwynk laid her shoulder to the tall ponys quarters and shoved him aside just as lutyens on shiraz sent the ball where it had come from and the tall pony went skating and slipping away to the left kittiwynk seeing that polaris had joined corks in the chase for the ball up the ground dropped into polaris place and then time was called  the skidars ponies wasted no time in kicking or fuming they knew that each minutes rest meant so much gain and trotted off to the rails and their saises began to scrape and blanket and rub them at once  whew said corks stiffening up to get all the tickle of the big vulcanite scraper if we were playing pony for pony we would bend those archangels double in half an hour but theyll bring up fresh ones and fresh ones and fresh ones after thatyou see  who cares said polaris weve drawn first blood is my hock swelling  looks puffy said corks you must have had rather a wipe dont let it stiffen you ll be wanted again in half an hour  whats the game like said the maltese cat  grounds like your shoe except where they put too much water on it said kittiwynk then its slippery dont play in the centre theres a bog there i dont know how their next four are going to behave but we kept the ball hanging and made em lather for nothing who goes out two arabs and a couple of countrybreds thats bad what a comfort it is to wash your mouth out  kitty was talking with a neck of a lathercovered sodawater bottle between her teeth and trying to look over her withers at the same time this gave her a very coquettish air  whats bad said grey dawn giving to the girth and admiring his wellset shoulders  you arabs cant gallop fast enough to keep yourselves warmthats what kitty means said polaris limping to show that his hock needed attention are you playing back grey dawn  looks like it said grey dawn as lutyens swung himself up powell mounted the rabbit a plain bay countrybred much like corks but with mulish ears macnamara took faizullah a handy shortbacked little red arab with a long tail and hughes mounted benami an old and sullen brown beast who stood over in front more than a polopony should  benami looks like business said shiraz hows your temper ben the old campaigner hobbled off without answering and the maltese cat looked at the new archangel ponies prancing about on the ground they were four beautiful blacks and they saddled big enough and strong enough to eat the skidars team and gallop away with the meal inside them  blinkers again said the maltese cat good enough  theyre chargerscavalry chargers said kittiwynk indignantly theyll never see thirteenthree again  theyve all been fairly measured and theyve all got their certificates said the maltese cat or they wouldnt be here we must take things as they come along and keep your eyes on the ball  the game began but this time the skidars were penned to their own end of the ground and the watching ponies did not approve of that  faizullah is shirkingas usual said polaris with a scornful grunt  faizullah is eating whip said corks they could hear the leatherthonged poloquirt lacing the little fellows wellrounded barrel then the rabbits shrill neigh came across the ground  i cant do all the work he cried desperately  play the gamedont talk the maltese cat whickered and all the ponies wriggled with excitement and the soldiers and the grooms gripped the railings and shouted a black pony with blinkers had singled out old benami and was interfering with him in every possible way they could see benami shaking his head up and down and flapping his under lip  therell be a fall in a minute said polaris benami is getting stuffy  the game flickered up and down between goalpost and goalpost and the black ponies were getting more confident as they felt they had the legs of the others the ball was hit out of a little scrimmage and benami and the rabbit followed it faizullah only too glad to be quiet for an instant  the blinkered black pony came up like a hawk with two of his own side behind him and benamis eye glittered as he raced the question was which pony should make way for the other for each rider was perfectly willing to risk a fall in a good cause the black who had been driven nearly crazy by his blinkers trusted to his weight and his temper but benami knew how to apply his weight and how to keep his temper they met and there was a cloud of dust the black was lying on his side all the breath knocked out of his body the rabbit was a hundred yards up the ground with the ball and benami was sitting down he had slid nearly ten yards on his tail but he had had his revenge and sat cracking his nostrils till the black pony rose  thats what you get for interfering do you want any more said benami and he plunged into the game nothing was done that quarter because faizullah would not gallop though macnamara beat him whenever he could spare a second the fall of the black pony had impressed his companions tremendously and so the archangels could not profit by faizullahs bad behaviour  but as the maltese cat said when time was called and the four came back blowing and dripping faizullah ought to have been kicked all round umballa if he did not behave better next time the maltese cat promised to pull out his arab tail by the roots andeat it  there was no time to talk for the third four were ordered out  the third quarter of a game is generally the hottest for each side thinks that the others must be pumped and most of the winning play in a game is made about that time  lutyens took over the maltese cat with a pat and a hug for lutyens valued him more than anything else in the world powell had shikast a little grey rat with no pedigree and no manners outside polo macnamara mounted bamboo the largest of the team and hughes whos who alias the animal he was supposed to have australian blood in his veins but he looked like a clotheshorse and you could whack his legs with an iron crowbar without hurting him  they went out to meet the very flower of the archangels team and when whos who saw their elegantly booted legs and their beautiful satin skins he grinned a grin through his light wellworn bridle  my word said whos who we must give em a little football these gentlemen need a rubbing down  no biting said the maltese cat warningly for once or twice in his career whos who had been known to forget himself in that way  who said anything about biting im not playing tiddlywinks im playing the game  the archangels came down like a wolf on the fold for they were tired of football and they wanted polo they got it more and more just after the game began lutyens hit a ball that was coming towards him rapidly and it rolled in the air as a ball sometimes will with the whirl of a frightened partridge shikast heard but could not see it for the minute though he looked everywhere and up into the air as the maltese cat had taught him when he saw it ahead and overhead he went forward with powell as fast as he could put foot to ground it was then that powell a quiet and levelheaded man as a rule became inspired and played a stroke that sometimes comes off successfully after long practice he took his stick in both hands and standing up in his stirrups swiped at the ball in the air munipore fashion there was one second of paralysed astonishment and then all four sides of the ground went up in a yell of applause and delight as the ball flew true you could see the amazed archangels ducking in their saddles to dodge the line of flight and looking at it with open mouths and the regimental pipes of the skidars squealed from the railings as long as the pipers had breath shikast heard the stroke but he heard the head of the stick fly off at the same time nine hundred and ninetynine ponies out of a thousand would have gone tearing on after the ball with a useless player pulling at their heads but powell knew him and he knew powell and the instant he felt powells right leg shift a trifle on the saddleflap he headed to the boundary where a native officer was frantically waving a new stick before the shouts had ended powell was armed again  once before in his life the maltese cat had heard that very same stroke played off his own back and had profited by the confusion it wrought this time he acted on experience and leaving bamboo to guard the goal in case of accidents came through the others like a flash head and tail lowlutyens standing up to ease himswept on and on before the other side knew what was the matter and nearly pitched on his head between the archangels goalpost as lutyens kicked the ball in after a straight scurry of a hundred and fifty yards if there was one thing more than another upon which the maltese cat prided himself it was on this quick streaking kind of run half across the ground he did not believe in taking balls round the field unless you were clearly overmatched after this they gave the archangels fiveminuted football and an expensive fast pony hates football because it rumples his temper whos who showed himself even better than polaris in this game he did not permit any wriggling away but bored joyfully into the scrimmage as if he had his nose in a feedbox and was looking for something nice little shikast jumped on the ball the minute it got clear and every time an archangel pony followed it he found shikast standing over it asking what was the matter  if we can live through this quarter said the maltese cat i shant care dont take it out of yourselves let them do the lathering  so the ponies as their riders explained afterwards shutup the archangels kept them tied fast in front of their goal but it cost the archangels ponies all that was left of their tempers and ponies began to kick and men began to repeat compliments and they chopped at the legs of whos who and he set his teeth and stayed where he was and the dust stood up like a tree over the scrimmage until that hot quarter ended  they found the ponies very excited and confident when they went to their saises and the maltese cat had to warn them that the worst of the game was coming  now we are all going in for the second time said he and they are trotting out fresh ponies you think you can gallop but youll find you cant and then youll be sorry  but two goals to nothing is a halterlong lead said kittiwynk prancing  how long does it take to get a goal the maltese cat answered for pitys sake dont run away with a notion that the game is halfwon just because we happen to be in luck now theyll ride you into the grand stand if they can you must not give em a chance follow the ball  football as usual said polaris my hocks half as big as a nosebag  dont let them have a look at the ball if you can help it now leave me alone i must get all the rest i can before the last quarter  he hung down his head and let all his muscles go slack shikast bamboo and whos who copying his example  better not watch the game he said we arent playing and we shall only take it out of ourselves if we grow anxious look at the ground and pretend its flytime  they did their best but it was hard advice to follow the hooves were drumming and the sticks were rattling all up and down the ground and yells of applause from the english troops told that the archangels were pressing the skidars hard the native soldiers behind the ponies groaned and grunted and said things in undertones and presently they heard a longdrawn shout and a clatter of hurrahs  one to the archangels said shikast without raising his head times nearly up oh my sire and dam  faizullah said the maltese cat if you dont play to the last nail in your shoes this time ill kick you on the ground before all the other ponies  ill do my best when my time comes said the little arab sturdily  the saises looked at each other gravely as they rubbed their ponies legs this was the time when long purses began to tell and everybody knew it kittiwynk and the others came back the sweat dripping over their hooves and their tails telling sad stories  theyre better than we are said shiraz i knew how it would be  shut your big head said the maltese cat weve one goal to the good yet  yes but its two arabs and two countrybreds to play now said corks faizullah remember he spoke in a biting voice  as lutyens mounted grey dawn he looked at his men and they did not look pretty they were covered with dust and sweat in streaks their yellow boots were almost black their wrists were red and lumpy and their eyes seemed two inches deep in their heads but the expression in the eyes was satisfactory  did you take anything at tiffin said lutyens and the team shook their heads they were too dry to talk  all right the archangels did they are worse pumped than we are  theyve got the better ponies said powell i shant be sorry when this business is over  that fifth quarter was a painful one in every way faizullah played like a little red demon and the rabbit seemed to be everywhere at once and benami rode straight at anything and everything that came in his way while the umpires on their ponies wheeled like gulls outside the shifting game but the archangels had the better mountsthey had kept their racers till late in the gameand never allowed the skidars to play football they hit the ball up and down the width of the ground till benami and the rest were outpaced then they went forward and time and again lutyens and grey dawn were just and only just able to send the ball away with a long spitting backhander grey dawn forgot that he was an arab and turned from grey to blue as he galloped indeed he forgot too well for he did not keep his eyes on the ground as an arab should but stuck out his nose and scuttled for the dear honour of the game they had watered the ground once or twice between the quarters and a careless waterman had emptied the last of his skinful all in one place near the skidars goal it was close to the end of the play and for the tenth time grey dawn was bolting after the ball when his near hindfoot slipped on the greasy mud and he rolled over and over pitching lutyens just clear of the goalpost and the triumphant archangels made their goal then time was calledtwo goals all but lutyens had to be helped up and grey dawn rose with his near hindleg strained somewhere  whats the damage said powell his arm around lutyens  collarbone of course said lutyens between his teeth it was the third time he had broken it in two years and it hurt him  powell and the others whistled  games up said hughes  hold on weve five good minutes yet and it isnt my right hand we ll stick it out  i say said the captain of the archangels trotting up are you hurt lutyens well wait if you care to put in a substitute i wishi meanthe fact is you fellows deserve this game if any team does wish we could give you a man or some of our poniesor something  you re awfully good but well play it to a finish i think  the captain of the archangels stared for a little thats not half bad he said and went back to his own side while lutyens borrowed a scarf from one of his native officers and made a sling of it then an archangel galloped up with a big bathsponge and advised lutyens to put it under his armpit to ease his shoulder and between them they tied up his left arm scientifically and one of the native officers leaped forward with four long glasses that fizzed and bubbled  the team looked at lutyens piteously and he nodded it was the last quarter and nothing would matter after that they drank out the dark golden drink and wiped their moustaches and things looked more hopeful  the maltese cat had put his nose into the front of lutyens shirt and was trying to say how sorry he was  he knows said lutyens proudly the beggar knows ive played him without a bridle before nowfor fun  its no fun now said powell but we havent a decent substitute  no said lutyens its the last quarter and weve got to make our goal and win ill trust the cat  if you fall this time youll suffer a little said macnamara  ill trust the cat said lutyens  you hear that said the maltese cat proudly to the others its worth while playing polo for ten years to have that said of you now then my sons come along well kick up a little bit just to show the archangels this team havent suffered  and sure enough as they went on to the ground the maltese cat after satisfying himself that lutyens was home in the saddle kicked out three or four times and lutyens laughed the reins were caught up anyhow in the tips of his strapped left hand and he never pretended to rely on them he knew the cat would answer to the least pressure of the leg and by way of showing offfor his shoulder hurt him very muchhe bent the little fellow in a close figureofeight in and out between the goalposts there was a roar from the native officers and men who dearly loved a piece of dugabashi horsetrick work as they called it and the pipes very quietly and scornfully droned out the first bars of a common bazaar tune called freshly fresh and newly new just as a warning to the other regiments that the skidars were fit all the natives laughed  and now said the maltese cat as they took their place remember that this is the last quarter and follow the ball  dont need to be told said whos who  let me go on all those people on all four sides will begin to crowd injust as they did at malta youll hear people calling out and moving forward and being pushed back and that is going to make the archangel ponies very unhappy but if a ball is struck to the boundary you go after it and let the people get out of your way i went over the pole of a fourinhand once and picked a game out of the dust by it back me up when i run and follow the ball  there was a sort of an allround sound of sympathy and wonder as the last quarter opened and then there began exactly what the maltese cat had foreseen people crowded in close to the boundaries and the archangels ponies kept looking sideways at the narrowing space if you know how a man feels to be cramped at tennisnot because he wants to run out of the court but because he likes to know that he can at a pinchyou will guess how ponies must feel when they are playing in a box of human beings  ill bend some of those men if i can get away said whos who as he rocketed behind the ball and bamboo nodded without speaking they were playing the last ounce in them and the maltese cat had left the goal undefended to join them lutyens gave him every order that he could to bring him back but this was the first time in his career that the little wise grey had ever played polo on his own responsibility and he was going to make the most of it  what are you doing here said hughes as the cat crossed in front of him and rode off an archangel  the cats in chargemind the goal shouted lutyens and bowing forward hit the ball full and followed on forcing the archangels towards their own goal  no football said the maltese cat keep the ball by the boundaries and cramp em play open order and drive em to the boundaries  across and across the ground in big diagonals flew the ball and whenever it came to a flying rush and a stroke close to the boundaries the archangel ponies moved stiffly they did not care to go headlong at a wall of men and carriages though if the ground had been open they could have turned on a sixpence  wriggle her up the sides said the cat keep her close to the crowd they hate the carriages shikast keep her up this side  shikast and powell lay left and right behind the uneasy scuffle of an open scrimmage and every time the ball was hit away shikast galloped on it at such an angle that powell was forced to hit it towards the boundary and when the crowd had been driven away from that side lutyens would send the ball over to the other and shikast would slide desperately after it till his friends came down to help it was billiards and no football this timebilliards in a corner pocket and the cues were not well chalked  if they get us out in the middle of the ground theyll walk away from us dribble her along the sides cried the maltese cat  so they dribbled all along the boundary where a pony could not come on their righthand side and the archangels were furious and the umpires had to neglect the game to shout at the people to get back and several blundering mounted policemen tried to restore order all close to the scrimmage and the nerves of the archangels ponies stretched and broke like cobwebs  five or six times an archangel hit the ball up into the middle of the ground and each time the watchful shikast gave powell his chance to send it back and after each return when the dust had settled men could see that the skidars had gained a few yards  every now and again there were shouts of side off side from the spectators but the teams were too busy to care and the umpires had all they could do to keep their maddened ponies clear of the scuffle  at last lutyens missed a short easy stroke and the skidars had to fly back helterskelter to protect their own goal shikast leading powell stopped the ball with a backhander when it was not fifty yards from the goalposts and shikast spun round with a wrench that nearly hoisted powell out of his saddle  nows our last chance said the cat wheeling like a cockchafer on a pin weve got to ride it out come along  lutyens felt the little chap take a deep breath and as it were crouch under his rider the ball was hopping towards the righthand boundary an archangel riding for it with both spurs and a whip but neither spur nor whip would make his pony stretch himself as he neared the crowd the maltese cat glided under his very nose picking up his hind legs sharp for there was not a foot to spare between his quarters and the other ponys bit it was as neat an exhibition as fancy figureskating lutyens hit with all the strength he had left but the stick slipped a little in his hand and the ball flew off to the left instead of keeping close to the boundary whos who was far across the ground thinking hard as he galloped he repeated stride for stride the cats manoeuvres with another archangel pony nipping the ball away from under his bridle and clearing his opponent by half a fraction of an inch for whos who was clumsy behind then he drove away towards the right as the maltese cat came up from the left and bamboo held a middle course exactly between them the three were making a sort of governmentbroadarrowshaped attack and there was only the archangels back to guard the goal but immediately behind them were three archangels racing all they knew and mixed up with them was powell sending shikast along on what he felt was their last hope it takes a very good man to stand up to the rush of seven crazy ponies in the last quarters of a cup game when men are riding with their necks for sale and the ponies are delirious the archangels back missed his stroke and pulled aside just in time to let the rush go by bamboo and whos who shortened stride to give the cat room and lutyens got the goal with a clean smooth smacking stroke that was heard all over the field but there was no stopping the ponies they poured through the goalposts in one mixed mob winners and losers together for the pace had been terrific the maltese cat knew by experience what would happen and to save lutyens turned to the right with one last effort that strained a backsinew beyond hope of repair as he did so he heard the righthand goalpost crack as a pony cannoned into itcrack splinter and fall like a mast it had been sawed three parts through in case of accidents but it upset the pony nevertheless and he blundered into another who blundered into the lefthand post and then there was confusion and dust and wood bamboo was lying on the ground seeing stars an archangel pony rolled beside him breathless and angry shikast had sat down dogfashion to avoid falling over the others and was sliding along on his little bobtail in a cloud of dust and powell was sitting on the ground hammering with his stick and trying to cheer all the others were shouting at the top of what was left of their voices and the men who had been spilt were shouting too as soon as the people saw no one was hurt ten thousand native and english shouted and clapped and yelled and before any one could stop them the pipers of the skidars broke on to the ground with all the native officers and men behind them and marched up and down playing a wild northern tune called zakhme began and through the insolent blaring of the pipes and the highpitched native yells you could hear the archangels band hammering for they are all jolly good fellows and then reproachfully to the losing team ooh kafoozalum kafoozalum kafoozalum  besides all these things and many more there was a commanderinchief and an inspectorgeneral of cavalry and the principal veterinary officer of all india standing on the top of a regimental coach yelling like schoolboys and brigadiers and colonels and commissioners and hundreds of pretty ladies joined the chorus but the maltese cat stood with his head down wondering how many legs were left to him and lutyens watched the men and ponies pick themselves out of the wreck of the two goalposts and he patted the maltese cat very tenderly  i say said the captain of the archangels spitting a pebble out of his mouth will you take three thousand for that ponyas he stands  no thank you ive an idea hes saved my life said lutyens getting off and lying down at full length both teams were on the ground too waving their boots in the air and coughing and drawing deep breaths as the saises ran up to take away the ponies and an officious watercarrier sprinkled the players with dirty water till they sat up  my aunt said powell rubbing his back and looking at the stumps of the goalposts that was a game  they played it over again every stroke of it that night at the big dinner when the freeforall cup was filled and passed down the table and emptied and filled again and everybody made most eloquent speeches about two in the morning when there might have been some singing a wise little plain little grey little head looked in through the open door  hurrah bring him in said the archangels and his sais who was very happy indeed patted the maltese cat on the flank and he limped in to the blaze of light and the glittering uniforms looking for lutyens he was used to messes and mens bedrooms and places where ponies are not usually encouraged and in his youth had jumped on and off a messtable for a bet so he behaved himself very politely and ate bread dipped in salt and was petted all round the table moving gingerly and they drank his health because he had done more to win the cup than any man or horse on the ground  that was glory and honour enough for the rest of his days and the maltese cat did not complain much when the veterinary surgeon said that he would be no good for polo any more when lutyens married his wife did not allow him to play so he was forced to be an umpire and his pony on these occasions was a fleabitten grey with a neat polotail lame all round but desperately quick on his feet and as everybody knew past pluperfect prestissimo player of the game     bread upon the waters   if you remember my improper friend brugglesmith you will also bear in mind his friend mcphee chief engineer of the breslau whose dingey brugglesmith tried to steal his apologies for the performances of brugglesmith may one day be told in their proper place the tale before us concerns mcphee he was never a racing engineer and took special pride in saying as much before the liverpool men but he had a thirtytwo years knowledge of machinery and the humours of ships one side of his face had been wrecked through the bursting of a pressuregauge in the days when men knew less than they do now and his nose rose grandly out of the wreck like a club in a public riot there were cuts and lumps on his head and he would guide your forefinger through his short irongrey hair and tell you how he had come by his trademarks he owned all sorts of certificates of extracompetency and at the bottom of his cabin chest of drawers where he kept the photograph of his wife were two or three royal humane society medals for saving lives at sea professionallyit was different when crazy steeragepassengers jumped overboardprofessionally mcphee does not approve of saving life at sea and he has often told me that a new hell awaits stokers and trimmers who sign for a strong mans pay and fall sick the second day out he believes in throwing boots at fourth and fifth engineers when they wake him up at night with word that a bearing is redhot all because a lamps glare is reflected red from the twirling metal he believes that there are only two poets in the world one being robert burns of course and the other gerald massey when he has time for novels he reads wilkie collins and charles reade chiefly the latterand knows whole pages of very hard cash by heart in the saloon his table is next to the captains and he drinks only water while his engines work  he was good to me when we first met because i did not ask questions and believed in charles reade as a most shamefully neglected author later he approved of my writings to the extent of one pamphlet of twentyfour pages that i wrote for holdock steiner  chase owners of the line when they bought some ventilating patent and fitted it to the cabins of the breslau spandau and koltzau the purser of the breslau recommended me to holdocks secretary for the job and holdock who is a wesleyan methodist invited me to his house and gave me dinner with the governess when the others had finished and placed the plans and specifications in my hand and i wrote the pamphlet that same afternoon it was called comfort in the cabin and brought me seven pound ten cash downan important sum of money in those days and the governess who was teaching master john holdock his scales told me that mrs holdock had told her to keep an eye on me in case i went away with coats from the hatrack mcphee liked that pamphlet enormously for it was composed in the bouveriebyzantine style with baroque and rococo embellishments and afterwards he introduced me to mrs mcphee who succeeded dinah in my heart for dinah was half a world away and it is wholesome and antiseptic to love such a woman as janet mcphee they lived in a little twelvepound house close to the shipping when mcphee was away mrs mcphee read the lloyds column in the papers and called on the wives of senior engineers of equal social standing once or twice too mrs holdock visited mrs mcphee in a brougham with celluloid fittings and i have reason to believe that after she had played owners wife long enough they talked scandal the holdocks lived in an oldfashioned house with a big brick garden not a mile from the mcphees for they stayed by their money as their money stayed by them and in summer you met their brougham solemnly junketing by theydon bois or loughton but i was mrs mcphees friend for she allowed me to convoy her westward sometimes to theatres where she sobbed or laughed or shivered with a simple heart and she introduced me to a new world of doctors wives captains wives and engineers wives whose whole talk and thought centred in and about ships and lines of ships you have never heard of there were sailingships with stewards and mahogany and maple saloons trading to australia taking cargoes of consumptives and hopeless drunkards for whom a seavoyage was recommended there were frowzy little west african boats full of rats and cockroaches where men died anywhere but in their bunks there were brazilian boats whose cabins could be hired for merchandise that went out loaded nearly awash there were zanzibar and mauritius steamers and wonderful reconstructed boats that plied to the other tide of borneo these were loved and known for they earned our bread and a little butter and we despised the big atlantic boats and made fun of the p  o and orient liners and swore by our respective ownerswesleyan baptist or presbyterian as the case might be  i had only just come back to england when mrs mcphee invited me to dinner at three oclock in the afternoon and the notepaper was almost bridal in its scented creaminess when i reached the house i saw that there were new curtains in the window that must have cost fortyfive shillings a pair and as mrs mcphee drew me into the little marblepapered hall she looked at me keenly and cried  have ye not heard what d ye think o the hatrack  now that hatrack was oakthirty shillings at least mcphee came downstairs with a sober foothe steps as lightly as a cat for all his weight when he is at seaand shook hands in a new and awful mannera parody of old holdocks style when he says goodbye to his skippers i perceived at once that a legacy had come to him but i held my peace though mrs mcphee begged me every thirty seconds to eat a great deal and say nothing it was rather a mad sort of meal because mcphee and his wife took hold of hands like little children they always do after voyages and nodded and winked and choked and gurgled and hardly ate a mouthful  a female servant came in and waited though mrs mcphee had told me time and again that she would thank no one to do her housework while she had her health but this was a servant with a cap and i saw mrs mcphee swell and swell under her garancecoloured gown there is no small freeboard to janet mcphee nor is garance any subdued tint and with all this unexplained pride and glory in the air i felt like watching fireworks without knowing the festival when the maid had removed the cloth she brought a pineapple that would have cost half a guinea at that season only mcphee has his own way of getting such things and a canton china bowl of dried lichis and a glass plate of preserved ginger and a small jar of sacred and imperial chowchow that perfumed the room mcphee gets it from a dutchman in java and i think he doctors it with liqueurs but the crown of the feast was some madeira of the kind you can only come by if you know the wine and the man a little maizewrapped fig of clotted madeira cigars went with the wine and the rest was a pale blue smoky silence janet in her splendour smiling on us two and patting mcphees hand  well drink said mcphee slowly rubbing his chin to the eternal damnation o holdock steiner  chase  of course i answered amen though i had made seven pound ten shillings out of the firm mcphees enemies were mine and i was drinking his madeira  yeve heard nothing said janet not a word not a whisper  not a word nor a whisper on my word i have not  tell him mac said she and that is another proof of janets goodness and wifely love a smaller woman would have babbled first but janet is five feet nine in her stockings  were rich said mcphee i shook hands all round  were damned rich he added i shook hands all round a second time  ill go to sea no moreunlesstheres no sayina private yacht maybewi a small an handy auxiliary  its not enough for that said janet were fair richwelltodo but no more a new gown for church and one for the theatre well have it made west  how much is it i asked  twentyfive thousand pounds i drew a long breath an ive been earnin twentyfive an twenty pound a month  the last words came away with a roar as though the wide world was conspiring to beat him down  all this time im waiting i said i know nothing since last september was it left you  they laughed aloud together it was left said mcphee choking ou ay it was left thats vara good of course it was left janet d ye note that it was left now if youd put that in your pamphlet it would have been vara jocose it was left he slapped his thigh and roared till the wine quivered in the decanter  the scotch are a great people but they are apt to hang over a joke too long particularly when no one can see the point but themselves  when i rewrite my pamphlet ill put it in mcphee only i must know something more first  mcphee thought for the length of half a cigar while janet caught my eye and led it round the room to one new thing after anotherthe new vinepattern carpet the new chiming rustic clock between the models of the colombo outriggerboats the new inlaid sideboard with a purple cutglass flowerstand the fender of gilt and brass and last the new blackandgold piano  in october o last year the board sacked me began mcphee in october o last year the breslau came in for winter overhaul shed been runnin

 i went out an sat down by the hall porter to get my wits again im thinkin i swore at the board then auld mcrimmono mcnaughten  mcrimmoncame oot o his office thats on the same floor an looked at me proppin up one eyelid wi his forefinger ye know they call him the blind deevil forbye he onythin but blind an no deevil in his dealins wi memcrimmon o the black bird line  whats here mister mcphee said he  i was past prayin for by then a chief engineer sacked after twenty years service because hell not risk the breslau on the new timin an be damned to ye mcrimmon i said  the auld man sucked in his lips an whistled ah said he the new timin i see he doddered into the boardroom id just left an the dandiedog that is just his blind mans leader stayed wi me that was providential in a minute he was back again yeve cast your bread on the watter mcphee an be damned to you he says whaurs my dog my word is he on your knee theres more discernment in a dog than a jew what garred ye curse your board mcphee its expensive  theyll pay more for the breslau i said get off my knee ye smotherin beast  bearins hot eh said mcrimmon its thirty year since a man daur curse me to my face time was id ha cast ye doon the stairway for that  forgies all i said he was wearin to eighty as i knew i was wrong mcrimmon but when a mans shown the door for doin his plain duty hes not always ceevil  so i hear says mcrimmon ha ye ony objection to a tramp freighter its only fifteen a month but they say the blind deevil feeds a man better than others shes my kite come ben ye can thank dandie here im no used to thanks an noo says he what possessed ye to throw up your berth wi holdock  the new timin said i the breslau will not stand it  hoot oot said he ye might ha crammed her a littleenough to show ye were drivin heran brought her in twa days behind whats easier than to say ye slowed for bearins eh all my men do it andi believe em  mcrimmon says i whats her virginity to a lassie  he puckered his dry face an twisted in his chair the warld an a says he my god the vara warld an a but what ha you or me to do wi virginity this late along  this i said theres just one thing that each one of us in his trade or profession will not do for ony consideration whatever if i run to time i run to time barrio always the risks o the high seas less than that under god i have not done more than that by god i will not do theres no trick o the trade im not acquaint wi  so ive heard says mcrimmon dry as a biscuit  but yon matter o fair rennin s just my shekinah yell understand i daurna tamper wi that nursing weak engines is fair craftsmanship but what the board ask is cheatin wi the risk o manslaughter addeetional yell note i know my business  there was some more talk an next week i went aboard the kite twentyfive hunder ton simple compound a black bird tramp the deeper she rode the better shed steam ive snapped as much as eleven out of her but eight point three was her fair normal good food forward an better aft all indents passed wiout marginal remarks the best coal new donkeys and good crews there was nothin the old man would not do except paint that was his deeficulty ye could no more draw paint than his last teeth from him hed come down to dock an his boats a scandal all along the watter an hed whine an cry an say they looked all he could desire every owner has his non plus ultra ive obsairved paint was mcrimmons but you could get round his engines without riskin your life an for all his blindness ive seen him reject five flawed intermediates one after the other on a nod from me an his cattlefittins were guaranteed for north atlantic winter weather ye ken what that means mcrimmon an the black bird line god bless him  oh i forgot to say she would lie down an fill her forward deck green an snore away into a twentyknot gale fortyfive to the minute three an a half knots an hour the engines runnin sweet an true as a bairn breathin in its sleep bell was skipper an forbye theres no love lost between crews an owners we were fond o the auld blind deevil an his dog an im thinkin he liked us he was worth the windy side o twa million sterlin an no friend to his own bloodkin moneys an awfu thingovermuchfor a lonely man  id taken her out twice there an back again when word came o the breslaus breakdown just as i prophesied calder was her engineerhes not fit to run a tug down the solentand he fairly lifted the engines off the bedplates an they fell down in heaps by what i heard so she filled from the after stuffinbox to the after bulkhead an lay stargazing with seventynine squealin passengers in the saloon till the camaralzaman o ramsey  golds cartagena line gave her a tow to the tune o five thousand seven hunder an forty pound wi costs in the admiralty court she was helpless yell understand an in no case to meet ony weather five thousand seven hunder an forty pounds with costs an exclusive o new engines theyd ha done better to ha kept me on the old timin  but even so the new board were all for retrenchment young steiner the jew was at the bottom of it they sacked men right an left that would not eat the dirt the board gave em they cut down repairs they fed crews wi leavins an scrapins and reversin mcrimmons practice they hid their defeeciencies wi paint an cheap gildin quem deus vult perrdere prrius dementat ye remember  in january we went to drydock an in the next dock lay the grotkau their big freighter that was the dolabella o piegan piegan  walshs line in 84a clydebuilt iron boat a flatbottomed pigeonbreasted underengined bullnosed bitch of a five thousand ton freighter that would neither steer nor steam nor stop when ye asked her whiles shed attend to her helm whiles shed take charge whiles shed wait to scratch herself an whiles shed buttock into a dockhead but holdock and steiner had bought her cheap and painted her all over like the hoor o babylon an we called her the hoor for short by the way mcphee kept to that name throughout the rest of his tale so you must read accordingly i went to see young bannisterhe had to take what the board gave him an he an calder were shifted together from the breslau to this abortionan talkin to him i went into the dock under her her plates were pitted till the men that were paint paint paintin her laughed at it but the warst was at the last shed a great clumsy iron twelvefoot thresher propelleraitcheson designed the kitesand just on the tail o the shaft behind the boss was a red weepin crack ye could ha put a penknife to man it was an awful crack  when d ye ship a new tailshaft i said to bannister  he knew what i meant oh yons a superfeecial flaw says he not lookin at me  superfeecial gehenna i said yell not take her oot wi a solution o continuity that like  theyll putty it up this evening he said im a married man anye used to know the board  i een said what was gied me in that hour ye know how a drydock echoes i saw young steiner standin listenin above me an man he used language provocative of a breach o the peace i was a spy and a disgraced employ an a corrupter o young bannisters morals an hed prosecute me for libel he went away when i ran up the stepsid ha thrown him into the dock if id caught himan there i met mcrimmon wi dandie pullin on the chain guidin the auld man among the railway lines  mcphee said he yere no paid to fight holdock steiner chase  company limited when ye meet whats wrong between you  no more than a tailshaft rotten as a kailstump for ony sakes go an look mcrimmon its a comedietta  im feared o yon conversational hebrew said he whaurs the flaw an what like  a seveninch crack just behind the boss theres no power on earth will fend it just jarrin off  when  thats beyon my knowledge i said  so it is so it is said mcrimmon weve all oor leemitations yere certain it was a crack  man its a crevasse i said for there were no words to describe the magnitude of it an young bannisters sayin its no more than a superfeecial flaw  weell i tak it oor business is to mind oor business if yeve ony friends aboard her mcphee why not bid them to a bit dinner at radleys  i was thinkin o tea in the cuddy i said engineers o tramp freighters cannot afford hotel prices  na na says the auld man whimperin not the cuddy theyll laugh at my kite for shes no plastered with paint like the hoor bid them to radleys mcphee an send me the bill thank dandie here man im no used to thanks then he turned him round i was just thinkin the vara same thing mister mcphee said he this is not senile dementia  preserve s i said clean jumped oot o mysel i was but thinkin youre fey mcrimmon  dod the auld deevil laughed till he nigh sat down on dandie send me the bill says he im long past champagne but tell me how it tastes the morn  bell and i bid young bannister and calder to dinner at radleys theyll have no laughin an singin there but we took a private roomlike yachtowners fra cowes  mcphee grinned all over and lay back to think  and then said i  we were no drunk in ony preceese sense o the word but radleys showed me the dead men there were six magnums o dry champagne an maybe a bottle o whisky  do you mean to tell me that you four got away with a magnum and a half a piece besides whisky i demanded  mcphee looked down upon me from between his shoulders with toleration  man we were not settin down to drink he said they no more than made us wutty to be sure young bannister laid his head on the table an greeted like a bairn an calder was all for callin on steiner at two in the morn an painting him galleygreen but theyd been drinkin the afternoon lord how they twa cursed the board an the grotkau an the tailshaft an the engines an a they didna talk o superfeecial flaws that night i mind young bannister an calder shakin hands on a bond to be revenged on the board at ony reasonable cost this side o losing their certificates now mark ye how false economy ruins business the board fed them like swine i have good reason to know it an ive obsairved wi my ain people that if ye touch his stomach ye wauken the deil in a scot men will tak a dredger across the atlantic if they re well fed an fetch her somewhere on the broadside o the americas but bad foods bad service the warld over  the bill went to mcrimmon an he said no more to me till the weekend when i was at him for more paint for wed heard the kite was chartered liverpoolside bide whaur yere put said the blind deevil man do ye wash in champagne the kites no leavin here till i gie the order anhow am i to waste paint onher wi the lammergeyer docked for who knows how long an a  she was our big freightermcintyre was engineeran i knew shed come from overhaul not three months that morn i met mcrimmons headclerkyell not know himfair bitin his nails off wi mortification  the auld mans gone gyte says he hes withdrawn the lammergeyer  maybe he has reasons says i  reasons hes daft  hell no be daft till he begins to paint i said  thats just what hes doneand south american freights higher than well live to see them again hes laid her up to paint herto paint herto paint her says the little clerk dancin like a hen on a hot plate five thousand ton o potential freight rottin in drydock man an he dolin the paint out in quarterpound tins for it cuts him to the heart mad though he is an the grotkauthe grotkau of all conceivable bottomssoaking up every pound that should be ours at liverpool  i was staggered wi this follyconsiderin the dinner at radleys in connection wi the same  ye may well stare mcphee says the headclerk theres engines an rollin stock an iron bridgesd ye know what freights are noo an pianos an millinery an fancy brazil cargo o every species pourin into the grotkauthe grotkau o the jerusalem firmand the lammergeyers bein painted  losh i thought hed drop dead wi the fits  i could say no more than obey orders if ye break owners but on the kite we believed mcrimmon was mad an mcintyre of the lammergeyer was for lockin him up by some patent legal process hed found in a book o maritime law an a that week south american freights rose an rose it was sinfu  syne bell got orders to tak the kite round to liverpool in waterballast and mcrimmon came to bids goodbye yammerin an whinin oer the acres o paint hed lavished on the lammergeyer  i look to you to retrieve it says he i look to you to reimburse me fore god why are ye not cast off are ye dawdlin in dock for a purpose  what odds mcrimmon says bell well be a day behind the fair at liverpool the grotkaus got all the freight that might ha been ours an the lammergeyers mcrimmon laughed an chuckledthe pairfect eemage o senile dementia ye ken his eyebrows wark up an down like a gorillas  yere under sealed orders said he teeheein an scratchin himself yons theyto be opened seriatim  says bell shufflin the envelopes when the auld man had gone ashore were to creep round a the south coast standin in for orders his weather too theres no question o his lunacy now  well we buttocked the auld kite alongvara bad weather we madestandin in all alongside for telegraphic orders which are the curse o skippers syne we made over to holyhead an bell opened the last envelope for the last instructions i was wi him in the cuddy an he threw it over to me cryin did ye ever know the like mac  ill no say what mcrimmon had written but he was far from mad there was a souwester brewin when we made the mouth o the mersey a bitter cold morn wi a greygreen sea and a greygreen skyliverpool weather as they say an there we lay choppin an the crew swore ye canna keep secrets aboard ship they thought mcrimmon was mad too  syne we saw the grotkau rollin oot on the top o flood deep an double deep wi her newpainted funnel an her newpainted boats an a she looked her name an moreover she coughed like it calder tauld me at radleys what ailed his engines but my own ear would ha told me twa mile awa by the beat o them round we came plungin an squatterin in her wake an the wind cut wi good promise o more to come by six it blew hard but clear an before the middle watch it was a souwester in airnest  shell edge into ireland this gait says bell i was with him on the bridge watchin the grotkaus port light ye canna see green so far as red or wed ha kept to leeward wed no passengers to consider an all eyes being on the grotkau we fair walked into a liner rampin home to liverpool or to be preceese bell no more than twisted the kite oot from under her bows and there was a little damnin betwix the twa bridges noo a passengermcphee regarded me benignantlywad ha told the papers that as soon as he got to the customs we stuck to the grotkaus tail that night an the next twa daysshe slowed down to five knot by my reckonin and we lapped along the weary way to the fastnet  but you dont go by the fastnet to get to any south american port do you i said  we do not we prefer to go as direct as may be but we were followin the grotkau an shed no walk into that gale for ony consideration knowin what i did to her discredit i couldna blame young bannister it was warkin up to a north atlantic winter gale snow an sleet an a perishin wind eh it was like the deil walkin abroad o the surface o the deep whuppin off the top o the waves before he made up his mind theyd bore up against it so far but the minute she was clear o the skelligs she fair tucked up her skirts an ran for it by dunmore head wow she rolled  shell be makin smerwick says bell  shed ha tried for ventry by noo if she meant that i said  theyll roll the funnel oot o her this gait says bell why canna bannister keep her head to sea  its the tailshaft ony rollins better than pitchin wi superfeecial cracks in the tailshaft calder knows that much i said  its ill wark retreevin steamers this weather said bell his beard and whiskers were frozen to his oilskin an the spray was white on the weather side of him pairfect north atlantic winter weather  one by one the sea raxed away our three boats an the davits were crumpled like rams horns  yons bad said bell at the last ye canna pass a hawser wioot a boat bell was a vara judeecious manfor an aberdonian  im not one that fashes himself for eventualities outside the engineroom so i een slipped down betwixt waves to see how the kite fared man shes the best geared boat of her class that ever left clyde kinloch my second knew her as well as i did i found him dryin his socks on the mainsteam an combin his whiskers wi the comb janet gied me last year for the warld an a as though we were in port i tried the feed speered into the stokehole thumbed all bearins spat on the thrust for luck gied em my blessin an took kinlochs socks before i went up to the bridge again  then bell handed me the wheel an went below to warm himself when he came up my gloves were frozen to the spokes an the ice clicked over my eyelids pairfect north atlantic winter weather as i was sayin  the gale blew out by night but we lay in smotherin crossseas that made the auld kite chatter from stem to stern i slowed to thirtyfour i mindno thirtyseven there was a long swell the morn an the grotkau was headin into it west awa  shell win to rio yet tailshaft or no tailshaft says bell  last night shook her i said shell jar it off yet mark my word  we were then maybe a hunder and fifty mile westsouwest o slyne head by dead reckonin next day we made a hunder an thirtyyell note we were not racinboatsan the day after a hunder an sixtyone an that made us well say eighteen an a bittock west an maybe fiftyone an a bittock north crossin all the north atlantic liner lanes on the long slant always in sight o the grotkau creepin up by night and fallin awa by day after the gale it was cold weather wi dark nights  i was in the engineroom on friday night just before the middle watch when bell whustled down the tube shes done it an up i came  the grotkau was just a fair distance south an one by one she ran up the three red lights in a vertical linethe sign of a steamer not under control  yons a tow for us said bell lickin his chops shell be worth more than the breslau well go down to her mcphee  bide a while i said the seas fair throng wi ships here  reason why said bell its a fortune gaun beggin what d ye think man  gie her till daylight she knows were here if bannister needs help hell loose a rocket  wha told ye bannisters need well ha some raganbone tramp snappin her up under oor nose said he an he put the wheel over we were goin slow  bannister wad like better to go home on a liner an eat in the saloon mind ye what they said o holdock  steiners food that night at radleys keep her awa mankeep her awa a tows a tow but a derelicts big salvage  eeh said bell yons an inshot o yours mac i love ye like a brother well bide whaur we are till daylight an he kept her awa  syne up went a rocket forward an twa on the bridge an a blue light aft syne a tarbarrel forward again  shes sinkin said bell its all gaun an ill get no more than a pair o nightglasses for pickin up young bannisterthe fool   fair an soft again i said shes signallin to the south of us bannister knows as well as i that one rocket would bring the breslau hell no be wastin fireworks for nothin hear her ca  the grotkau whustled an whustled for five minutes an then there were more fireworksa regular exhibeetion  thats no for men in the regular trade says bell yere right mac thats for a cuddy full o passengers he blinked through the nightglasses when it lay a bit thick to southward  what d ye make of it i said  liner he says yons her rocket ou ay theyve waukened the goldstrapped skipper annoo theyve waukened the passengers theyre turnin on the electrics cabin by cabin yons anither rocket theyre comin up to help the perishin in deep watters  gie me the glass i said but bell danced on the bridge clean dementit mailsmailsmails said he under contract wi the government for the due conveyance o the mails an as such mac yell note she may rescue life at sea but she canna towshe canna tow yons her nightsignal shell be up in half an hour  gowk i said an we blazin here wi all oor lights oh bell yere a fool  he tumbled off the bridge forward an i tumbled aft an before ye could wink our lights were oot the engineroom hatch was covered an we lay pitchdark watchin the lights o the liner come up that the grotkaud been signallin to twenty knot an hour she came every cabin lighted an her boats swung awa it was grandly done an in the inside of an hour she stopped like mrs holdocks machine down went the gangway down went the boats an in ten minutes we heard the passengers cheerin an awa she fled  theyll tell o this all the days they live said bell a rescue at sea by night as pretty as a play young bannister an calder will be drinkin in the saloon an six months hence the board o trade ll gie the skipper a pair o binoculars its vara philanthropic all round  well lay by till dayye may think we waited for it wi sore eyes an there sat the grotkau her nose a bit cocked just leerin at us she looked paifectly ridiculous  shell be fillin aft says bell for why is she down by the stern the tailshafts punched a hole in her anwe ve no boats theres three hunder thousand pound sterlin at a conservative estimate droonin before our eyes whats to do an his bearins got hot again in a minute he was an incontinent man  run her as near as ye daur i said gie me a jacket an a lifeline an ill swum for it there was a bit lump of a sea an it was cold in the windvara cold but theyd gone overside like passengers young bannister an calder an a leaving the gangway down on the leeside it would ha been a flyin in the face o manifest providence to overlook the invitation we were within fifty yards o her while kinloch was garmin me all over wi oil behind the galley an as we ran past i went outboard for the salvage o three hunder thousand pound man it was perishin cold but id done my job judgmatically an came scrapin all along her side slap on to the lower gratin o the gangway no one more astonished than me i assure ye before id caught my breath id skinned both my knees on the gratin an was climbin up before she rolled again i made my line fast to the rail an squattered aft to young bannisters cabin whaaur i dried me wi everything in his bunk an put on every conceivable sort o rig i found till the blood was circulatin three pair drawers i mind i foundto begin uponan i needed them all it was the coldest cold i remember in all my experience  syne i went aft to the engineroom the grotkau sat on her own tail as they say she was vara shortshafted an her gear was all aft there was four or five foot o water in the engineroom slummockin to and fro black an greasy maybe there was six foot the stokehold doors were screwed home an the stokehold was tight enough but for a minute the mess in the engineroom deceived me only for a minute though an that was because i was not in a manner o speakin as calm as ordinar i looked again to mak sure t was just black wi bilge dead watter that must ha come in fortuitously ye ken  mcphee im only a passenger i said but you dont persuade me that six foot o water can come into an engineroom fortuitously  whos tryin to persuade one way or the other mcphee retorted im statin the facts o the casethe simple natural facts six or seven foot o dead watter in the engineroom is a vara depressin sight if ye think theres like to be more comin but i did not consider that such was likely and so yell note i was not depressed  thats all very well but i want to know about the water i said  ive told ye there was six feet or more there wi calders cap floatin on top  where did it come from  weel in the confusion o things after the propeller had dropped off an the engines were racin an a its vara possible that calder might ha lost it off his head an no troubled himself to pick it up again i remember seem that cap on him at southampton  i dont want to know about the cap im asking where the water came from and what it was doing there and why you were so certain that it wasnt a leak mcphee  for good reasonfor good an sufficient reason  give it to me then  weel its a reason that does not properly concern myself only to be preceese im of opinion that it was due the watter in part to an error o judgment in another man we can a mak mistakes  oh i beg your pardon  i got me to the rail again an whats wrang said bell hailin  shell do i said sends oer a hawser an a man to steer ill pull him in by the lifeline  i could see heads bobbin back an forth an a whuff or two o strong words then bell said theyll not trust themselvesone of emin this waiterexcept kinloch an ill no spare him  the more salvage to me then i said ill make shift solo  says one dockrat at this d ye think shes safe  ill guarantee ye nothing i said except maybe a hammerin for keepin me this long  then he sings out theres no more than one lifebelt an they canna find it or id come  throw him over the jezebel i said for i was oot o patience an they took haud o that volunteer before he knew what was in store and hove him over in the bight of my lifeline so i een hauled him upon the sag of it hand over fista vara welcome recruit when id tilted the salt watter oot of him for by the way he could na swim  syne they bent a twainch rope to the lifeline an a hawser to that an i led the rope oer the drum of a handwinch forward an we sweated the hawser inboard an made it fast to the grotkaus bitts  bell brought the kite so close i feared shed roll in an do the grotkaus plates a mischief he hove anither lifeline to me an went astern an we had all the weary winch work to do again wi a second hawser for all that bell was right wed along tow before us an though providence had helped us that far there was no sense in leavin too much to its keepin when the second hawser was fast i was wet wi sweat an i cried bell to tak up his slack an go home the other man was by way o helpin the work wi askin for drinks but i een told him he must hand reef an steer beginnin with steerin for i was goin to turn in he steeredoh ay he steered in a manner o speakin at the least he grippit the spokes an twiddled em an looked wise but i doubt if the hoor ever felt it i turned in there an then to young bannisters bunk an slept past expression i waukened ragin wi hunger a fair lump o sea runnin the kite snorin awa four knots an hour an the grotkau slappin her nose under an yawin an standin over at discretion she was a most disgracefu tow but the shameful thing of all was the food i raxed me a meal fra galleyshelves an pantries an lazareetes an cubbyholes that i would not ha gied to the mate of a cardiff collier an ye ken we say a cardiff mate will eat clinkers to save waste im sayin it was simply vile the crew had written what they thought of it on the new paint o the focsle but i had not a decent soul wi me to complain on there was nothin for me to do save watch the hawsers an the kites tail squatterin down in white watter when she lifted to a sea so i got steam on the after donkeypump an pumped oot the engineroom theres no sense in leavin waiter loose in a ship when she was dry i went doun the shafttunnel an found she was leakin a little through the stuffinbox but nothin to make wark the propeller had een jarred off as i knew it must an calder had been waitin for it to go wi his hand on the gear he told me as much when i met him ashore there was nothin started or strained it had just slipped awa to the bed o the atlantic as easy as a man dyin wi due warninga most providential business for all concerned syne i took stock o the grotkaus upper works her boats had been smashed on the davits an here an there was the rail missin an a ventilator or two had fetched awa an the bridgerails were bent by the seas but her hatches were tight and shed taken no sort of harm dod i came to hate her like a human bein for i was eight weary days aboard starvinay starvinwithin a cables length o plenty all day i laid in the bunk reading the womanhater the grandest book charlie reade ever wrote an pickin a toothful here an there it was weary weary work eight days man i was aboard the grotkau an not one full meal did i make sma blame her crew would not stay by her the other man oh i warked him wi a vengeance to keep him warm  it came on to blow when we fetched soundins an that kept me standin by the hawsers lashed to the capstan breathin twixt green seas i near died o cauld an hunger for the grotkau towed like a barge an bell howkit her along through or over it was vara thick upchannel too we were standin in to make some sort o light an we near walked over twa three fishinboats an they cried us we were overclose to falmouth then we were near cut down by a drunken foreign fruiter that was blunderin between us an the shore and it got thicker an thicker that night an i could feel by the tow bell did not know whaur he was losh we knew in the morn for the wind blew the fog oot like a candle an the sun came clear and as surely as mcrimmon gied me my cheque the shadow o the eddystone lay across our towrope we were that nearay we were that near bell fetched the kite round with the jerk that came close to tearin the bitts out o the grotkau an i mind i thanked my maker in young bannisters cabin when we were inside plymouth breakwater  the first to come aboard was mcrimmon wi dandie did i tell you our orders were to take anything we found into plymouth the auld deil had just come down overnight puttin two an two together from what calder had told him when the liner landed the grotkaus men he had preceesely hit oor time id hailed bell for something to eat an he sent it oer in the same boat wi mcrimmon when the auld man came to me he grinned an slapped his legs and worked his eyebrows the while i ate  how do holdock steiner  chase feed their men said he  ye can see i said knockin the top off another beerbottle i did not sign to be starved mcrimmon  nor to swum either said he for bell had tauld him how i carried the line aboard well im thinkin youll be no loser what freight could we ha put into the lammergeyer would equal salvage on four hunder thousand poundshull an cargo eh mcphee this cuts the liver out o holdock steiner chase  company limited eh mcphee an im sufferin from senile dementia now eh mcphee an im not daft am i till i begin to paint the lammergeyer eh mcphee ye may weel lift your leg dandie i ha the laugh o them all ye found watter in the engineroom  to speak wioot prejudice i said there was some watter  they thought she was sinkin after the propeller went she filled wi extraordinary rapeedity calder said it grieved him an bannister to abandon her  i thought o the dinner at radleys an what like o food id eaten for eight days  it would grieve them sore i said  but the crew would not hear o stayin and workin her back under canvas theyre gaun up an down sayin theyd ha starved first  theyd ha starved if theyd stayed said i  i tak it fra calders account there was a mutiny amost  ye know more than i mcrimmon i said speakin wioot prejudice for were all in the same boat who opened the bilgecock  oh thats itis it said the auld man an i could see he was surprised a bilgecock ye say  i believe it was a bilgecock they were all shut when i came aboard but some one had flooded the engineroom eight feet over all and shut it off with the wormanwheel gear from the second gratin afterwards  losh said mcrimmon the ineequity o mans beyond belief but its awfu discreditable to holdock steiner  chase if that came oot in court  its just my own curiosity i said  aweel dandies afflicted wi the same disease dandie strive against curiosity for it brings a little dog into traps an suchlike whaur was the kite when yon painted liner took off the grotkaus people  just there or thereabouts i said  an which o you twa thought to cover your lights said he winkin  dandle i said to the dog we must both strive against curiosity its an unremunerative business whats our chance o salvage dandie  he laughed till he choked tak what i gie you mcphee an be content he said lord how a man

their berths and janet found a very sick woman in the secondclass saloon so that for sixteen days she lived below and chatted with the stewardesses at the foot of the secondsaloon stairs while her patient slept mcphee was a passenger for exactly twentyfour hours then the engineers messwhere the oilcloth tables arejoyfully took him to its bosom and for the rest of the voyage that company was richer by the unpaid services of a highly certificated engineer     an error in the fourth dimension   before he was thirty he discovered that there was no one to play with him though the wealth of three toilsome generations stood to his account though his tastes in the matter of books bindings rugs swords bronzes lacquer pictures plate statuary horses conservatories and agriculture were educated and catholic the public opinion of his country wanted to know why he did not go to office daily as his father had before him  so he fled and they howled behind him that he was an unpatriotic anglomaniac born to consume fruits one totally lacking in public spirit he wore an eyeglass he had built a wall round his country house with a high gate that shut instead of inviting america to sit on his flowerbeds he ordered his clothes from england and the press of his abiding city cursed him from his eyeglass to his trousers for two consecutive days  when he rose to light again it was where nothing less than the tents of an invading army in piccadilly would make any difference to anybody if he had money and leisure england stood ready to give him all that money and leisure could buy that price paid she would ask no questions he took his chequebook and accumulated thingswarily at first for he remembered that in america things own the man to his delight he discovered that in england he could put his belongings under his feet for classes ranks and denominations of people rose as it were from the earth and silently and discreetly took charge of his possessions they had been born and bred for that sole purposeservants of the chequebook when that was at an end they would depart as mysteriously as they had come  the impenetrability of this regulated life irritated him and he strove to learn something of the human side of these people he retired baffled to be trained by his menials in america the native demoralises the english servant in england the servant educates the master wilton sargent strove to learn all they taught as ardently as his father had striven to wreck before capture the railways of his native land and it must have been some touch of the old bandit railway blood that bade him buy for a song holt hangars whose fortyacre lawn as every one knows sweeps down in velvet to the quadruple tracks of the great buchonian railway their trains flew by almost continuously with a beelike drone in the day and a flutter of strong wings at night the son of merton sargent had good right to be interested in them he owned controlling interests in several thousand miles of tracknot permanent waybuilt on altogether different plans where locomotives eternally whistled for gradecrossings and parlorcars of fabulous expense and unrestful design skated round curves that the great buchonian would have condemned as unsafe in a constructionline from the edge of his lawn he could trace the chaired metals falling away rigid as a bowstring into the valley of the prest studded with the long perspective of the block signals buttressed with stone and carried high above all possible risk on a fortyfoot embankment  left to himself he would have builded a private car and kept it at the nearest railwaystation amberley royal five miles away but those into whose hands he had committed himself for his english training had little knowledge of railways and less of private cars the one they knew was something that existed in the scheme of things for their convenience the other they held to be distinctly american and with the versatility of his race wilton sargent had set out to be just a little more english than the english  he succeeded to admiration he learned not to redecorate holt hangars though he warmed it to leave his guests alone to refrain from superfluous introductions to abandon manners of which he had great store and to hold fast by manner which can after labour be acquired he learned to let other people hired for the purpose attend to the duties for which they were paid he learnedthis he got from a ditcher on the estatethat every man with whom he came in contact had his decreed position in the fabric of the realm which position he would do well to consult last mystery of all he learned to golfwell and when an american knows the innermost meaning of dont press slow back and keep your eye on the ball he is for practical purposes denationalised  his other education proceeded on the pleasantest lines was he interested in any conceivable thing in heaven above or the earth beneath or the waters under the earth forthwith appeared at his table guided by those safe hands into which he had fallen the very men who had best said done written explored excavated built launched created or studied that one thingherders of books and prints in the british museum specialists in scarabs cartouches and dynasties egyptian rovers and raiders from the heart of unknown lands toxicologists orchidhunters monographers on flint implements carpets prehistoric man or early renaissance music they came and they played with him they asked no questions they cared not so much as a pin who or what he was they demanded only that he should be able to talk and listen courteously their work was done elsewhere and out of his sight  there were also women  never said wilton sargent to himself has an american seen england as im seeing it and he thought blushing beneath the bedclothes of the unregenerate and blatant days when he would steam to office down the hudson in his twelvehundredton oceangoing steamyacht and arrive by gradations at bleecker street hanging on to a leather strap between an irish washerwoman and a german anarchist if any of his guests had seen him then they would have said how distinctly american andwilton did not care for that tone he had schooled himself to an english walk and so long as he did not raise it an english voice he did not gesticulate with his hands he sat down on most of his enthusiasms but he could not rid himself of the shibboleth he would ask for the worcestershire sauce even howard his immaculate butler could not break him of this  it was decreed that he should complete his education in a wild and wonderful manner and further that i should be in at that death  wilton had more than once asked me to holt hangars for the purpose of showing how well the new life fitted him and each time i had declared it creaseless his third invitation was more informal than the others and he hinted of some matter in which he was anxious for my sympathy or counsel or both there is room for an infinity of mistakes when a man begins to take liberties with his nationality and i went down expecting things a sevenfoot dogcart and a groom in the black holt hangars livery met me at amberley royal at holt hangars i was received by a person of elegance and true reserve and piloted to my luxurious chamber there were no other guests in the house and this set me thinking  wilton came into my room about half an hour before dinner and though his face was masked with a dropcurtain of highly embroidered indifference i could see that he was not at ease in time for he was then almost as difficult to move as one of my own countrymen i extracted the talesimple in its extravagance extravagant in its simplicity it seemed that hackman of the british museum had been staying with him about ten days before boasting of scarabs hackman has a way of carrying really priceless antiquities on his tiering and in his trouser pockets apparently he had intercepted something on its way to the boulak museum which he said was a genuine amenhotepa queens scarab of the fourth dynasty now wilton had bought from cassavetti whose reputation is not above suspicion a scarab of much the same scarabeousness and had left it in his london chambers hackman at a venture but knowing cassavetti pronounced it an imposition there was long discussionsavant versus millionaire one saying ut i know it cannot be and the other but i can and will prove it wilton found it necessary for his souls satisfaction to go up to town then and therea fortymile runand bring back the scarab before dinner it was at this point that he began to cut corners with disastrous results amberley royal station being five miles away and putting in of horses a matter of time wilton had told howard the immaculate butler to signal the next train to stop and howard who was more of a man of resource than his master gave him credit for had with the red flag of the ninth hole of the links which crossed the bottom of the lawn signalled vehemently to the first downtrain and it had stopped here wiltons account became confused he attempted it seems to get into that highly indignant express but a guard restrained him with more or less forcehauled him in fact backyards from the window of a locked carriage wilton must have struck the gravel with some vehemence for the consequences he admitted were a free fight on the line in which he lost his hat and was at last dragged into the guards van and set down breathless  he had pressed money upon the man and very foolishly had explained everything but his name this he clung to for he had a vision of tall headlines in the new york papers and well knew no son of merton sargent could expect mercy that side the water the guard to wiltons amazement refused the money on the grounds that this was a matter for the company to attend to wilton insisted on his incognito and therefore found two policemen waiting for him at st botolph terminus when he expressed a wish to buy a new hat and telegraph to his friends both policemen with one voice warned him that whatever he said would be used as evidence against him and this had impressed wilton tremendously  they were so infernally polite he said if they had clubbed me i wouldnt have cared but it was step this way sir and up those stairs please sir till they jailed mejailed me like a common drunk and i had to stay in a filthy little cubbyhole of a cell all night  that comes of not giving your name and not wiring your lawyer i replied what did you get  forty shillings or a month said wilton promptlynext morning bright and early they were working us off three a minute a girl in a pink hatshe was brought in at three in the morninggot ten days i suppose i was lucky i must have knocked his senses out of the guard he told the old duck on the bench that i had told him i was a sergeant in the army and that i was gathering beetles on the track that comes of trying to explain to an englishman  and you  oh i said nothing i wanted to get out i paid my fine and bought a new hat and came up here before noon next morning there were a lot of people in the house and i told em id been unavoidably detained and then they began to recollect engagements elsewhere hackman must have seen the fight on the track and made a story of it i suppose they thought it was distinctly americanconfound em its the only time in my life that ive ever flagged a train and i wouldnt have done it but for that scarab t wouldnt hurt their old trains to be held up once in a while  well its all over now i said choking a little and your name didnt get into the papers it is rather transatlantic when you come to think of it  over wilton grunted savagely its only just begun that trouble with the guard was just common ordinary assaultmerely a little criminal business the flagging of the train is civil infernally civiland means something quite different theyre after me for that now  who  the great buchonian there was a man in court watching the case on behalf of the company i gave him my name in a quiet corner before i bought my hat andcome to dinner now ill show you the results afterwards the telling of his wrongs had worked wilton sargent into a very fine temper and i do not think that my conversation soothed him in the course of the dinner prompted by a devil of pure mischief i dwelt with loving insistence on certain smells and sounds of new york which go straight to the heart of the native in foreign parts and wilton began to ask many questions about his associates aforetimemen of the new york yacht club storm king or the restigouche owners of rivers ranches and shipping in their playtime lords of railways kerosene wheat and cattle in their offices when the green mint came i gave him a peculiarly oily and atrocious cigar of the brand they sell in the tessellated electriclighted with expensivepictures of the nude adorned bar of the pandemonium and wilton chewed the end for several minutes ere he lit it the butler left us alone and the chimney of the oakpanelled diningroom began to smoke  thats another said he poking the fire savagely and i knew what he meant one cannot put steamheat in houses where queen elizabeth slept the steady beat of a nightmail whirling down the valley recalled me to business what about the great buchonian i said  come into my study thats allas yet  it was a pile of seidlitzpowderscoloured correspondence perhaps nine inches high and it looked very businesslike  you can go through it said wilton now i could take a chair and a red flag and go into hyde park and say the most atrocious things about your queen and preach anarchy and all that y know till i was hoarse and no one would take any notice the police damn emwould protect me if i got into trouble but for a little thing like flagging a dirty little sawedoff trainrunning through my own grounds tooi get the whole british constitution down on me as if i sold bombs i dont understand it  no more does the great buchonianapparently i was turning over the letters heres the traffic superintendent writing that its utterly incomprehensible that any man should good heavens wilton you have done it i giggled as i read on  whats funny now said my host  it seems that you or howard for you stopped the threeforty northern down  i ought to know that they all had their knife into me from the enginedriver up  but its the threefortythe indunasurely youve heard of the great buchonians induna  how the deuce am i to know one train from another they come along about every two minutes  quite so but this happens to be the indunathe one train of the whole line shes timed for fiftyseven miles an hour she was put on early in the sixties and she has never been stopped  i know since william the conqueror came over or king charles hid in her smokestack youre as bad as the rest of these britishers if shes been run all that while its time she was flagged once or twice  the american was beginning to ooze out all over wilton and his smallboned hands were moving restlessly  suppose you flagged the empire state express or the western cyclone  suppose i did i know otis harveyor used to id send him a wire and hed understand it was a groundhog case with me thats exactly what i told this british fossil company here  have you been answering their letters without legal advice then  of course i have  oh my sainted country go ahead wilton  i wrote em that id be very happy to see their president and explain to him in three words all about it but that wouldnt do seems their president must be a god he was too busy andwell you can read for yourselfthey wanted explanations the stationmaster at amberley royaland he grovels before me as a rulewanted an explanation and quick too the head sachem at st botolphs wanted three or four and the lord high mukkamuk that oils the locomotives wanted one every fine day i told emive told hem about fifty timesi stopped their holy and sacred train because i wanted to board her did they think i wanted to feel her pulse  you didnt say that  feel her pulse of course not  no board her  what else could i say  my dear wilton what is the use of mrs sherborne and the clays and all that lot working over you for four years to make an englishman out of you if the very first time youre rattled you go back to the vernacular  im through with mrs sherborne and the rest of the crowd americas good enough for me what ought i to have said please or thanks awfly or how  there was no chance now of mistaking the mans nationality speech gesture and step so carefully drilled into him had gone away with the borrowed mask of indifference it was a lawful son of the youngest people whose predecessors were the red indian his voice had risen to the high throaty crow of his breed when they labour under excitement his closeset eyes showed by turns unnecessary fear annoyance beyond reason rapid and purposeless flights of thought the childs lust for immediate revenge and the childs pathetic bewilderment who knocks his head against the bad wicked table and on the other side i knew stood the company as unable as wilton to understand  and i could buy their old road three times over he muttered playing with a paperknife and moving restlessly to and fro  you didnt tell em that i hope  there was no answer but as i went through the letters i felt that wilton must have told them many surprising things the great buchonian had first asked for an explanation of the stoppage of their induna and had found a certain levity in the explanation tendered it then advised mr w sargent to refer his solicitor to their solicitor or whatever the legal phrase is  and you didnt i said looking up  no they were treating me exactly as if i had been a kid playing on the cabletracks there was not the least necessity for any solicitor five minutes quiet talk would have settled everything  i returned to the correspondence the great buchonian regretted that owing to pressure of business none of their directors could accept mr w sargents invitation to run down and discuss the difficulty the great buchonian was careful to point out that no animus underlay their action nor was money their object their duty was to protect the interests of their line and these interests could not be protected if a precedent were established whereby any of the queens subjects could stop a train in midcareer again this was another branch of the correspondence not more than five heads of departments being concerned the company admitted that there was some reasonable doubt as to the duties of expresstrains in all crises and the matter was open to settlement by process of law till an authoritative ruling was obtainedfrom the house of lords if necessary  that broke me all up said wilton who was reading over my shoulder i knew id struck the british constitution at last the house of lordsmy lord and anyway im not one of the queens subjects  why i had a notion that youd got yourself naturalised  wilton blushed hotly as he explained that very many things must happen to the british constitution ere he took out his papers  how does it all strike you he said isnt the great buchonian crazy  i dont know youve done something that no one ever thought of doing before and the company dont know what to make of it i see they offer to send down their solicitor and another official of the company to talk things over informally then heres another letter suggesting that you put up a fourteenfoot wall crowned with bottleglass at the bottom of the garden  talk of british insolence the man who recommends that hes another bloated functionary says that i shall derive great pleasure from watching the wall going up day by day did you ever dream of such gall ive offered em money enough to buy a new set of cars and pension the driver for three generations but that doesnt seem to be what they want they expect me to go to the house of lords and get a ruling and build walls between times are they all stark raving mad one ud think i made a profession of flagging trains how in tophet was i to know their old induna from a waytrain i took the first that came along and ive been jailed and fined for that once already  that was for slugging the guard  he had no right to haul me out when i was halfway through a window  what are you going to do about it  their lawyer and the other official cant they trust their men unless they send em in pairs are coming heretonight i told em i was busy as a rule till after dinner but they might send along the entire directorate if it eased em any  now afterdinner visiting for business or pleasure is the custom of the smaller american town and not that of england where the end of the day is sacred to the owner not the public verily wilton sargent had hoisted the striped flag of rebellion  isnt it time that the humour of the situation began to strike you wilton i asked  wheres the humour of baiting an american citizen just because he happens to be a millionairepoor devil he was silent for a little time and then went on of course now i see he spun round and faced me excitedly its as plain as mud these ducks are laying their pipes to skin me  they say explicitly they dont want money  thats all a blind sos their addressing me as w sargent they know well enough who i am they know im the old mans son why didnt i think of that before  one minute wilton if you climbed to the top of the dome of st pauls and offered a reward to any englishman who could tell you who or what merton sargent had been there wouldnt be twenty men in all london to claim it  thats their insular provincialism then i dont care a cent the old man would have wrecked the great buchonian before breakfast for a pipeopener my god ill do it in dead earnest ill show em that they cant bulldoze a foreigner for flagging one of their little tinpot trains andive spent fifty thousand a year here at least for the last four years  i was glad i was not his lawyer i reread the correspondence notably the letter which recommended himalmost tenderly i fanciedto build a fourteenfoot brick wall at the end of his garden and halfway through it a thought struck me which filled me with pure joy  the footman ushered in two men frockcoated greytrousered smoothshaven heavy of speech and gait it was nearly nine oclock but they looked as newly come from a bath i could not understand why the elder and taller of the pair glanced at me as though we had an understanding nor why he shook hands with an unenglish warmth  this simplifies the situation he said in an undertone and as i stared he whispered to his companion i fear i shall be of very little service at present perhaps mr folsom had better talk over the affair with mr sargent  that is what i am here for said wilton  the man of law smiled pleasantly and said that he saw no reason why the difficulty should not be arranged in two minutes quiet talk his air as he sat down opposite wilton was soothing to the last degree and his companion drew me upstage the mystery was deepening but i followed meekly and heard wilton say with an uneasy laugh  ive had insomnia over this affair mr folsom lets settle it one way or the other for heavens sake  ah has he suffered much from this lately said my man with a preliminary cough  i really cant say i replied  then i suppose you have only lately taken charge here  i came this evening i am not exactly in charge of anything  i see merely to observe the course of events in case he nodded  exactly observation after all is my trade  he coughed again slightly and came to business  nowi am asking solely for informations sakedo you find the delusions persistent  which delusions  they are variable then that is distinctly curious becausebut do i understand that the type of the delusion varies for example mr sargent believes that he can buy the great buchonian  did he write you that  he made the offer to the companyon a halfsheet of notepaper now has he by chance gone to the other extreme and believed that he is in danger of becoming a pauper the curious economy in the use of a halfsheet of paper shows that some idea of that kind might have flashed through his mind and the two delusions can coexist but it is not common as you must know the delusion of vast wealththe folly of grandeurs i believe our friends the french call itis as a rule persistent to the exclusion of all others  then i heard wiltons best english voice at the end of the study  my dear sir i have explained twenty times already i wanted to get that scarab in time for dinner suppose you had left an important legal document in the same way  that touch of cunning is very significant my fellowpractitionersince he insisted on itmuttered  i am very happy of course to meet you but if you had only sent your president down to dinner here i could have settled the thing in half a minute why i could have bought the buchonian from him while your clerks were sending me this wilton dropped his hand heavily on the blueandwhite correspondence and the lawyer started  but speaking frankly the lawyer replied it is if i may say so perfectly inconceivable even in the case of the most important legal documents that any one should stop the threeforty expressthe indunaour induna my dear sir  absolutely my companion echoed then to me in a lower tone you notice again the persistent delusion of wealth i was called in when he wrote us that you can see it is utterly impossible for the company to continue to run their trains through the property of a man who may at any moment fancy himself divinely commissioned to stop all traffic if he had only referred us to his lawyerbut naturally that he would not do under the circumstances a pitya great pity he is so young by the way it is curious is it not to note the absolute conviction in the voice of those who are similarly afflictedheartrending i might say and the inability to follow a chain of connected thought  i cant see what you want wilton was saying to the lawyer  it need not be more than fourteen feet higha really desirable structure and it would be possible to grow pear trees on the sunny side the lawyer was speaking in an unprofessional voice there are few things pleasanter than to watch so to say ones own vine and fig tree in full bearing consider the profit and amusement you would derive from it if you could see your way to doing this we could arrange all the details with your lawyer and it is possible that the company might bear some of the cost i have put the matter i trust in a nutshell if you my dear sir will interest yourself in building that wall and will kindly give us the name of your lawyers i dare assure you that you will hear no more from the great buchonian  but why am i to disfigure my lawn with a new brick wall  grey flint is extremely picturesque  grey flint then if you put it that way why the dickens must i go building towers of babylon just because i have held up one of your trainsonce  the expression he used in his third letter was that he wished to board her said my companion in my ear that was very curiousa marine delusion impinging as it were upon a land one what a marvellous world he must move inand will before the curtain falls so young tooso very young  well if you want the plain english of it im damned if i go wallbuilding to your orders you can fight it all along the line into the house of lords and out again and get your rulings by the running foot if you like said wilton hotly great heavens man i only did it once  we have at present no guarantee that you may not do it again and with our traffic we must in justice to our passengers demand some form of guarantee it must not serve as a precedent all this might have been saved if you had only referred us to your legal representative the lawyer looked appealingly around the room the deadlock was complete  wilton i asked may i try my hand now  anything you like said wilton it seems i cant talk english i wont build any wall though he threw himself back in his chair  gentlemen i said deliberately for i perceived that the doctors mind would turn slowly mr sargent has very large interests in the chief railway systems of his own country  his own country said the lawyer  at that age said the doctor  certainly he inherited them from his father mr sargent who was an american  and proud of it said wilton as though he had been a western senator let loose on the continent for the first time  my dear sir said the lawyer half rising why did you not acquaint the company with this factthis vital factearly in our correspondence we should have understood we should have made allowances  allowances be damned am i a red indian or a lunatic  the two men looked guilty  if mr sargents friend had told us as much in the beginning said the doctor very severely much might have been saved alas i had made a lifes enemy of that doctor  i hadnt a chance i replied now of course you can see that a man who owns several thousand miles of line as mr sargent does would be apt to treat railways a shade more casually than other people  of course of course he is an american that accounts still it was the induna but i can quite understand that the customs of our cousins across the water differ in these particulars from ours and do you always stop trains in this way in the states mr sargent  i should if occasion ever arose but ive never had to yet are you going to make an international complication of the business  you need give yourself no further concern whatever in the matter we see that there is no likelihood of this action of yours establishing a precedent which was the only thing we were afraid of now that you understand that we cannot reconcile our system to any sudden stoppages we feel quite sure that  i shant be staying long enough to flag another train wilton said pensively  you are returning then to our fellowkinsmen across theahbig pond you call it  no sir the oceanthe north atlantic ocean its three thousand miles broad and three miles deep in places i wish it were ten thousand  i am not so fond of seatravel myself but i think it is every englishmans duty once in his life to study the great branch of our anglosaxon race across the ocean said the lawyer  if ever you come over and care to flag any train on my system illill see you through said wilton  thank youah thank you youre very kind im sure i should enjoy myself immensely  we have overlooked the fact the doctor whispered to me that your friend proposed to buy the great buchonian  he is worth anything from twenty to thirty million dollarsfour to five million pounds i answered knowing that it would be hopeless to explain  really that is enormous wealth but the great buchonian is not in the market  perhaps he does not want to buy it now  it would be impossible under any circumstances said the doctor  how characteristic murmured the lawyer reviewing matters in his mind i always understood from books that your countrymen were in a hurry and so you would have gone forty miles to town and backbefore dinnerto get a scarab how intensely american but you talk exactly like an englishman mr sargent  that is a fault that can be remedied theres only one question id like to ask you you said it was inconceivable that any man should stop a train on your road  and so it isabsolutely inconceivable  any sane man that is  that is what i meant of course i mean with excep  thank you  the two men departed wilton checked himself as he was about to fill a pipe took one of my cigars instead and was silent for fifteen minutes  then said he have you got a list of the southampton sailings on you  far away from the greystone wings the dark cedars the faultless gravel drives and the mintsauce lawns of holt hangars runs a river called the hudson whose unkempt banks are covered with the palaces of those wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice here where the hoot of the haverstraw brickbargetug answers the howl of the locomotive

slayer think he slays      or if the slain think he is slain    they know not well the subtle ways       i keep and pass and turn again                                    emerson  it was the unreproducible slid r as he said this was his fyist visit to england that told me he was a newyorker from new york and when in the course of our long lazy journey westward from waterloo he enlarged upon the beauties of his city i professing ignorance said no word he had amazed and delighted at the mans civility given the london porter a shilling for carrying his bag nearly fifty yards he had thoroughly investigated the firstclass lavatory compartment which the london and southwestern sometimes supply without extra charge and now halfawed halfcontemptuous but wholly interested he looked out upon the ordered english landscape wrapped in its sunday peace while i watched the wonder grow upon his face why were the cars so short and stilted why had every other freightcar a tarpaulin drawn over it what wages would an engineer get now where was the swarming population of england he had read so much about what was the rank of all those men on tricycles along the roads when were we due at plymouth i told him all i knew and very much that i did not he was going to plymouth to assist in a consultation upon a fellowcountryman who had retired to a place called the hoewas that uptown or downtownto recover from nervous dyspepsia yes he himself was a doctor by profession and how any one in england could retain any nervous disorder passed his comprehension never had he dreamed of an atmosphere so soothing even the deep rumble of london traffic was monastical by comparison with some cities he could name and the countrywhy it was paradise a continuance of it he confessed would drive him mad but for a few months it was the most sumptuous restcure in his knowledge  ill come over every year after this he said in a burst of delight as we ran between two tenfoot hedges of pink and white may its seeing all the things ive ever read about of course it doesnt strike you that way i presume you belong here what a finished land it is its arrived must have been born this way now where i used to livehello i whats up  the train stopped in a blaze of sunshine at framlynghame admiral which is made up entirely of the nameboard two platforms and an overhead bridge without even the usual siding i had never known the slowest of locals stop here before but on sunday all things are possible to the london and southwestern one could hear the drone of conversation along the carriages and scarcely less loud the drone of the bumblebees in the wallflowers up the bank my companion thrust his head through the window and sniffed luxuriously  where are we now said he  in wiltshire said i  ah a man ought to be able to write novels with his left hand in a country like this well well and so this is about tesss country aint it i feel just as if i were in a book say the conducthe guard has something on his mind whats he getting at  the splendid badged and belted guard was striding up the platform at the regulation official pace and in the regulation official voice was saying at each door  has any gentleman here a bottle of medicine a gentleman has taken a bottle of poison laudanum by mistake  between each five paces he looked at an official telegram in his hand refreshed his memory and said his say the dreamy look on my companions facehe had gone far away with tesspassed with the speed of a snapshutter after the manner of his countrymen he had risen to the situation jerked his bag down from the overhead rail opened it and i heard the click of bottles find out where the man is he said briefly ive got something here that will fix himif he can swallow still  swiftly i fled up the line of carriages in the wake of the guard there was clamour in a rear compartmentthe voice of one bellowing to be let out and the feet of one who kicked with the tail of my eye i saw the new york doctor hastening thither bearing in his hand a blue and brimming glass from the lavatory compartment the guard i found scratching his head unofficially by the engine and murmuring well i put a bottle of medicine off at andoverim sure i did  better say it again anyow said the driver orders is orders say it again  once more the guard paced back i anxious to attract his attention trotting at his heels  in a minutein a minute sir he said waving an arm capable of starting all the traffic on the london and southwestern railway at a wave has any gentleman here got a bottle of medicine a gentleman has taken a bottle of poison laudanum by mistake  wheres the man i gasped  woking eres my orders he showed me the telegram on which were the words to be said e must have left is bottle in the train an took another by mistake es been wirin from woking awful an now i come to think of it im nearly sure i put a bottle of medicine off at andover  then the man that took the poison isnt in the train  lord no sir no one didnt take poison that way e took it away with im in is ands es wirin from wokin my orders was to ask everybody in the train and i ave an were four minutes late now are you comin on sir no right beind  there is nothing unless perhaps the english language more terrible than the workings of an english railwayline an instant before it seemed as though we were going to spend all eternity at framlynghame admiral and now i was watching the tail of the train disappear round the curve of the cutting  but i was not alone on the one bench of the down platform sat the largest navvy i have ever seen in my life softened and made affable for he smiled generously with liquor in his huge hands he nursed an empty tumbler marked lswrmarked also internally with streaks of bluegrey sediment before him a hand on his shoulder stood the doctor and as i came within earshot this is what i heard him say just you hold on to your patience for a minute or two longer and youll be as right as ever you were in your life ill stay with you till youre better  lord im comfortable enough said the navvy never felt better in my life  turning to me the doctor lowered his voice he might have died while that fool conductguard was saying his piece ive fixed him though the stuffs due in about five minutes but theres a heap to him i dont see how we can make him take exercise  for the moment i felt as though seven pounds of crushed ice had been neatly applied in the form of a compress to my lower stomach  howhow did you manage it i gasped  i asked him if hed have a drink he was knocking spots out of the carstrength of his constitution i suppose he said hed go most anywhere for a drink so i lured onto the platform and loaded him up coldblooded people you britishers are that trains gone and no one seemed to care a cent  weve missed it i said  he looked at me curiously  well get another before sundown if thats your only trouble say porter whens the next train down  seven fortyfive said the one porter and passed out through the wicketgate into the landscape it was then threetwenty of a hot and sleepy afternoon the station was absolutely deserted the navvy had closed his eyes and now nodded  thats bad said the doctor the man i mean not the train we must make him walk somehowwalk up and down  swiftly as might be i explained the delicacy of the situation and the doctor from new york turned a full bronzegreen then he swore comprehensively at the entire fabric of our glorious constitution cursing the english language root branch and paradigm through its most obscure derivatives his coat and bag lay on the bench next to the sleeper thither he edged cautiously and i saw treachery in his eye  what devil of delay possessed him to slip on his spring overcoat i cannot tell they say a slight noise rouses a sleeper more surely than a heavy one and scarcely had the doctor settled himself in his sleeves than the giant waked and seized that silkfaced collar in a hot right hand there was rage in his facerage and the realisation of new emotions  imim not so comfortable as i were he said from the deeps of his interior youll wait along o me you will he breathed heavily through shut lips  now if there was one thing more than another upon which the doctor had dwelt in his conversation with me it was upon the essential lawabidingness not to say gentleness of his muchmisrepresented country and yet truly it may have been no more than a button that irked him i saw his hand travel backwards to his right hip clutch at something and come away empty  he wont kill you i said hell probably sue you in court if i know my own people better give him some money from time to time  if he keeps quiet till the stuff gets in its work the doctor answered im all right if he doesnt my name is emoryjulian b emory193 steenth street corner of madison and  i feel worse than ive ever felt said the navvy with suddenness whatdidyougivemethedrinkfor  the matter seemed to be so purely personal that i withdrew to a strategic position on the overhead bridge and abiding in the exact centre looked on from afar  i could see the white road that ran across the shoulder of salisbury plain unshaded for mile after mile and a dot in the middle distance the back of the one porter returning to framlynghame admiral if such a place existed till seven fortyfive the bell of a church invisible clanked softly there was a rustle in the horsechestnuts to the left of the line and the sound of sheep cropping close  the peace of nirvana lay upon the land and brooding in it my elbow on the warm iron girder of the footbridge it is a fortyshilling fine to cross by any other means i perceived as never before how the consequences of our acts run eternal through time and through space if we impinge never so slightly upon the life of a fellowmortal the touch of our personality like the ripple of a stone cast into a pond widens and widens in unending circles across the aeons till the faroff gods themselves cannot say where action ceases also it was i who had silently set before the doctor the tumbler of the firstclass lavatory compartment now speeding plymouthward yet i was in spirit at least a million leagues removed from that unhappy man of another nationality who had chosen to thrust an inexpert finger into the workings of an alien life the machinery was dragging him up and down the sunlit platform the two men seemed to be learning polkamazurkas together and the burden of their song borne by one deep voice was what did you give me the drink for  i saw the flash of silver in the doctors hand the navvy took it and pocketed it with his left but never for an instant did his strong right leave the doctors coatcollar and as the crisis approached louder and louder rose his bulllike roar what did you give me the drink for  they drifted under the great twelveinch pinned timbers of the footbridge towards the bench and i gathered the time was very near at hand the stuff was getting in its work blue white and blue again rolled over the navvys face in waves till all settled to one rich claybank yellow andthat fell which fell  i thought of the blowing up of hell gate of the geysers in the yellowstone park of jonah and his whale but the lively original as i watched it foreshortened from above exceeded all these things he staggered to the bench the heavy wooden seat cramped with iron cramps into the enduring stone and clung there with his left hand it quivered and shook as a breakwaterpile quivers to the rush of landwardracing seas nor was there lacking when he caught his breath the scream of a maddened beach dragged down by the tide his right hand was upon the doctors collar so that the two shook to one paroxysm pendulums vibrating together while i apart shook with them  it was colossalimmense but of certain manifestations the english language stops short french only the caryatid french of victor hugo would have described it so i mourned while i laughed hastily shuffling and discarding inadequate adjectives the vehemence of the shock spent itself and the sufferer half fell half knelt across the bench he was calling now upon god and his wife huskily as the wounded bull calls upon the unscathed herd to stay curiously enough he used no bad language that had gone from him with the rest the doctor exhibited gold it was taken and retained so too was the grip on the coatcollar  if i could stand boomed the giant despairingly id smash youyou an your drinks im dyindyindyin  thats what you think said the doctor youll find it will do you a lot of good and making a virtue of a somewhat imperative necessity he added ill stay by you if youd let go of me a minute id give you something that would settle you  youve settled me now you damned anarchist takin the bread out of the mouth of an english workinman but ill keep old of you till im well or dead i never did you no arm spose i were a little full they pumped me out once at guys with a stummickpump i could see that but i cant see this ere an its killin of me by slow degrees  youll be all right in halfanhour what do you suppose id want to kill you for said the doctor who came of a logical breed  ow do i know tell em in court youll get seven years for this you bodysnatcher thats what you area bloomin bodysnatcher theres justice i tell you in england and my unionll prosecute too we dont stand no tricks with peoples insides ere they give a woman ten years for a sight less than this an youll ave to pay undreds an undreds o pounds besides a pension to the missus youll see you physickin furriner wheres your licence to do such youll catch it i tell you  then i observed what i have frequently observed before that a man who is but reasonably afraid of an altercation with an alien has a most poignant dread of the operations of foreign law the doctors voice was flutelike in its exquisite politeness as he answered  but ive given you a very great deal of moneyfifthree pounds i think  an whats three pound for poisonin the likes o me they told me at guys id fetch twentycoldon the slates ouh its comin again  a second time he was cut down by the foot as it were and the straining bench rocked to and fro as i averted my eyes  it was the very point of perfection in the heart of an english mayday the unseen tides of the air had turned and all nature was setting its face with the shadows of the horsechestnuts towards the peace of the coming night but there were hours yet i knewlong long hours of the eternal english twilightto the ending of the day i was well content to be aliveto abandon myself to the drift of time and fate to absorb great peace through my skin and to love my country with the devotion that three thousand miles of intervening sea bring to fullest flower and what a garden of eden it was this fatted clipped and washen land a man could camp in any open field with more sense of home and security than the stateliest buildings of foreign cities could afford and the joy was that it was all mine alienablygroomed hedgerow spotless road decent greystone cottage serried spinney tasselled copse applebellied hawthorn and wellgrown tree a light puff of windit scattered flakes of may over the gleaming railsgave me a faint whiff as it might have been of fresh cocoanut and i knew that the golden gorse was in bloom somewhere out of sight linneeus had thanked god on his bended knees when he first saw a field of it and by the way the navvy was on his knees too but he was by no means praying he was purely disgustful  the doctor was compelled to bend over him his face towards the back of the seat and from what i had seen i supposed the navvy was now dead if that were the case it would be time for me to go but i knew that so long as a man trusts himself to the current of circumstance reaching out for and rejecting nothing that comes his way no harm can overtake him it is the contriver the schemer who is caught by the law and never the philosopher i knew that when the play was played destiny herself would move me on from the corpse and i felt very sorry for the doctor  in the far distance presumably upon the road that led to framlynghame admiral there appeared a vehicle and a horsethe one ancient fly that almost every village can produce at need this thing was advancing unpaid by me towards the station would have to pass along the deepcut lane below the railwaybridge and come out on the doctors side i was in the centre of things so all sides were alike to me here then was my machine from the machine when it arrived something would happen or something else for the rest i owned my deeply interested soul  the doctor by the seat turned so far as his cramped position allowed his head over his left shoulder and laid his right hand upon his lips i threw back my hat and elevated my eyebrows in the form of a question the doctor shut his eyes and nodded his head slowly twice or thrice beckoning me to come i descended cautiously and it was as the signs had told the navvy was asleep empty to the lowest notch yet his hand clutched still the doctors collar and at the lightest movement the doctor was really very cramped tightened mechanically as the hand of a sick woman tightens on that of the watcher he had dropped squatting almost upon his heels and falling lower had dragged the doctor over to the left  the doctor thrust his right hand which was free into his pocket drew forth some keys and shook his head the navvy gurgled in his sleep silently i dived into my pocket took out one sovereign and held it up between finger and thumb again the doctor shook his head money was not what was lacking to his peace his bag had fallen from the seat to the ground he looked towards it and opened his mouthoshape the catch was not a difficult one and when i had mastered it the doctors right forefinger was sawing the air with an immense caution i extracted from the bag such a knife as they use for cutting collops off legs the doctor frowned and with his first and second fingers imitated the action of scissors again i searched and found a most diabolical pair of cocknosed shears capable of vandyking the interiors of elephants the doctor then slowly lowered his left shoulder till the navvys right wrist was supported by the bench pausing a moment as the spent volcano rumbled anew lower and lower the doctor sank kneeling now by the navvys side till his head was on a level with and just in front of the great hairy fist andthere was no tension on the coatcollar then light dawned on me  beginning a little to the right of the spinal column i cut a huge demilune out of his new spring overcoat bringing it round as far under his left side which was the right side of the navvy as i dared passing thence swiftly to the back of the seat and reaching between the splines i sawed through the silkfaced front on the lefthand side of the coat till the two cuts joined  cautiously as the boxturtle of his native heath the doctor drew away sideways and to the right with the air of a frustrated burglar coming out from under a bed and stood up free one black diagonal shoulder projecting through the grey of his ruined overcoat i returned the scissors to the bag snapped the catch and held all out to him as the wheels of the fly rang hollow under the railway arch  it came at a footpace past the wicketgate of the station and the doctor stopped it with a whisper it was going some five miles across country to bring home from church some onei could not catch the namebecause his own carriagehorses were lame its destination happened to be the one place in all the world that the doctor was most burningly anxious to visit and he promised the driver untold gold to drive to some ancient flame of hishelen blazes she was called  arent you coming too he said bundling his overcoat into his bag  now the fly had been so obviously sent to the doctor and to no one else that i had no concern with it our roads i saw divided and there was further a need upon me to laugh  i shall stay here i said its a very pretty country  my god he murmured as softly as he shut the door and i felt that it was a prayer  then he went out of my life and i shaped my course for the railwaybridge it was necessary to pass by the bench once more but the wicket was between us the departure of the fly had waked the navvy he crawled on to the seat and with malignant eyes watched the driver flog down the road  the man inside o that he called as poisoned me es a bodysnatcher es comin back again when im cold eres my evidence  he waved his share of the overcoat and i went my way because i was hungry framlynghame admiral village is a good two miles from the station and i waked the holy calm of the evening every step of that way with shouts and yells casting myself down in the flank of the good green hedge when i was too weak to stand there was an inna blessed inn with a thatched roof and peonies in the gardenand i ordered myself an upper chamber in which the foresters held their courts for the laughter was not all out of me a bewildered woman brought me ham and eggs and i leaned out of the mullioned window and laughed between mouthfuls i sat long above the beer and the perfect smoke that followed till the lights changed in the quiet street and i began to think of the seven fortyfive down and all that world of the arabian nights i had quitted  descending i passed a giant in moleskins who filled the lowceiled taproom many empty plates stood before him and beyond them a fringe of the framlynghame admiralty to whom he was unfolding a wondrous tale of anarchy of bodysnatching of bribery and the valley of the shadow from the which he was but newly risen and as he talked he ate and as he ate he drank for there was much room in him and anon he paid royally speaking of justice and the law before whom all englishmen are equal and all foreigners and anarchists vermin and slime  on my way to the station he passed me with great strides his head high among the lowflying bats his feet firm on the packed roadmetal his fists clinched and his breath coming sharply there was a beautiful smell in the airthe smell of white dust bruised nettles and smoke that brings tears to the throat of a man who sees his country but seldoma smell like the echoes of the lost talk of lovers the infinitely suggestive odour of an immemorial civilisation it was a perfect walk and lingering on every step i came to the station just as the one porter lighted the last of a truckload of lamps and set them back in the lamproom while he dealt tickets to four or five of the population who not contented with their own peace thought fit to travel it was no ticket that the navvy seemed to need he was sitting on a bench wrathfully grinding a tumbler into fragments with his heel i abode in obscurity at the end of the platform interested as ever thank heaven in my surroundings there was a jar of wheels on the road the navvy rose as they approached strode through the wicket and laid a hand upon a horses bridle that brought the beast up on his hireling hind legs it was the providential fly coming back and for a moment i wondered whether the doctor had been mad enough to revisit his practice  get away youre drunk said the driver  im not said the navvy ive been waitin ere hours and hours come out you beggar inside there  go on driver said a voice i did not knowa crisp clear english voice  all right said the navvy you wouldnt ear me when i was polite now will you come  there was a chasm in the side of the fly for he had wrenched the door bodily off its hinges and was feeling within purposefully a wellbooted leg rewarded him and there came out not with delight hopping on one foot a round and greyhaired englishman from whose armpits dropped hymnbooks but from his mouth an altogether different service of song  come on you bloomin bodysnatcher you thought i was dead did you roared the navvy and the respectable gentleman came accordingly inarticulate with rage  eres a man murderin the squire the driver shouted and fell from his box upon the navvys neck  to do them justice the people of framlynghame admiral so many as were on the platform rallied to the call in the best spirit of feudalism it was the one porter who beat the navvy on the nose with a ticketpunch but it was the three thirdclass tickets who attached themselves to his legs and freed the captive  send for a constable lock him up said that man adjusting his collar and unitedly they cast him into the lamproom and turned the key while the driver mourned over the wrecked fly  till then the navvy whose only desire was justice had kept his temper nobly then he went berserk before our amazed eyes the door of the lamproom was generously constructed and would not give an inch but the window he tore from its fastenings and hurled outwards the one porter counted the damage in a loud voice and the others arming themselves with agricultural implements from the station garden kept up a ceaseless winnowing before the window themselves backed close to the wall and bade the prisoner think of the gaol he answered little to the point so far as they could understand but seeing that his exit was impeded he took a lamp and hurled it through the wrecked sash it fell on the metals and went out with inconceivable velocity the others fifteen in all followed looking like rockets in the gloom and with the last he could have had no plan the berserk rage left him as the doctors deadly brewage waked up under the stimulus of violent exercise and a very full meal to one last cataclysmal exhibition andwe heard the whistle of the seven fortyfive down  they were all acutely interested in as much of the wreck as they could see for the station smelt to heaven of oil and the engine skittered over broken glass like a terrier in a cucumberframe the guard had to hear of it and the squire had his version of the brutal assault and heads were out all along the carriages as i found me a seat  what is the row said a young man as i entered man drunk  well the symptoms so far as my observation has gone more resemble those of asiatic cholera than anything else i answered slowly and judicially that every word might carry weight in the appointed scheme of things up till then you will observe i had taken no part in that war  he was an englishman but he collected his belongings as swiftly as had the american ages before and leaped upon the platform crying can i be of any service im a doctor  from the lamproom i heard a wearied voice wailing another bloomin doctor  and the seven fortyfive carried me on a step nearer to eternity by the road that is worn and seamed and channelled with the passions and weaknesses and warring interests of man who is immortal and master of his fate     the brushwood boy     girls and boys come out to play    the moon is shining as bright as day    leave your supper and leave your sleep    and come with your playfellows out in the street    up the ladder and down the wall  a child of three sat up in his crib and screamed at the top of his voice his fists clinched and his eyes full of terror at first no one heard for his nursery was in the west wing and the nurse was talking to a gardener among the laurels then the housekeeper passed that way and hurried to soothe him he was her special pet and she disapproved of the nurse  what was it then what was it then theres nothing to frighten him georgie dear  it wasit was a policeman he was on the downi saw him he came in jane said he would  policemen dont come into houses dearie turn over and take my hand  i saw himon the down he came here where is your hand harper  the housekeeper waited till the sobs changed to the regular breathing of sleep before she stole out  jane what nonsense have you been telling master georgie about policemen  i havent told him anything  you have hes been dreaming about them  we met tisdall on dowhead when we were in the donkeycart this morning praps thats what put it into his head  oh now you arent going to frighten the child into fits with your silly tales and the master know nothing about it if ever i catch you again etc                        a child of six was telling himself stories as he lay in bed it was a new power and he kept it a secret a month before it had occurred to him to carry on a nursery tale left unfinished by his mother and he was delighted to find the tale as it came out of his own head just as surprising as though he were listening to it all new from the beginning there was a prince in that tale and he killed dragons but only for one night ever afterwards georgie dubbed himself prince pasha giantkiller and all the rest you see he could not tell any one for fear of being laughed at and his tales faded gradually into dreamland where adventures were so many that he could not recall the half of them they all began in the same way or as georgie explained to the shadows of the nightlight there was the same startingoff placea pile of brushwood stacked somewhere near a beach and round this pile georgie found himself running races with little boys and girls these ended ships ran high up the dry land and opened into cardboard boxes or giltandgreen iron railings that surrounded beautiful gardens turned all soft and could be walked through and overthrown so long as he remembered it was only a dream he could never hold that knowledge more than a few seconds ere things became real and instead of pushing down houses full of grownup people a just revenge he sat miserably upon gigantic doorsteps trying to sing the multiplicationtable up to four times six  the princess of his tales was a person of wonderful beauty she came from the old illustrated edition of grimm now out of print and as she always applauded georgies valour among the dragons and buffaloes he gave her the two finest names he had ever heard in his lifeannie and louise pronounced annieanlouise when the dreams swamped the stories she would change into one of the little girls round the brushwoodpile still keeping her title and crown she saw georgie drown once in a dreamsea by the beach it was the day after he had been taken to bathe in a real sea by his nurse and he said as he sank poor annieanlouise shell be sorry for me now but annieanlouise walking slowly on the beach called ha ha said the duck laughing which to a waking mind might not seem to bear on the situation it consoled georgie at once and must have been some kind of spell for it raised the bottom of the deep and he waded out with a twelveinch flowerpot on each foot as he was strictly forbidden to meddle with flowerpots in real life he felt triumphantly wicked                        the movements of the grownups whom georgie tolerated but did not pretend to understand removed his world when he was seven years old to a place called oxfordonavisit here were huge buildings surrounded by vast prairies with streets of infinite length and above all something called the buttery which georgie was dying to see because he knew it must be greasy and therefore delightful he perceived how correct were his judgments when his nurse led him through a stone arch into the presence of an enormously fat man who asked him if he would like some bread and cheese georgie was used to eat all round the clock so he took what buttery gave him and would have taken some brown liquid called auditale but that his nurse led him away to an afternoon performance of a thing called peppers ghost this was intensely thrilling peoples heads came off and flew all over the stage and skeletons danced bone by bone while mr pepper himself beyond question a man of the worst waved his arms and flapped a long gown and in a deep bass voice georgie had never heard a man sing before told of his sorrows unspeakable some grownup or other tried to explain that the illusion was made with mirrors and that there was no need to be frightened georgie did not know what illusions were but he did know that a mirror was the lookingglass with the ivory handle on his mothers dressingtable therefore the grownup was just saying things after the distressing custom of grownups and georgie cast about for amusement between scenes next to him sat a little girl dressed all in black her hair combed off her forehead exactly like the girl in the book called alice in wonderland which had been given him on his last birthday the little girl looked at georgie and georgie looked at her there seemed to be no need of any further introduction  ive got a cut on my thumb said he it was the first work of his first real knife a savage triangular hack and he esteemed it a most valuable possession  im tho thorry she lisped let me look pleathe  theres a diacklum plaster on but its all raw under georgie answered complying  dothent it hurther grey eyes were full of pity and interest  awfly perhaps it will give me lockjaw  it lookth very horrid im tho thorry she put a forefinger to his hand and held her head sidewise for a better view  here the nurse turned and shook him severely you mustnt talk to strange little girls master georgie  she isnt strange shes very nice i like her an ive showed her my new cut  the idea you change places with me  she moved him over and shut out the little girl from his view while the grownup behind renewed the futile explanations  i am not afraid truly said the boy wriggling in despair but why dont you go to sleep in the afternoons same as provost of oriel  georgie had been introduced to a grownup of that name who slept in his presence without apology georgie understood that he was the most important grownup in oxford hence he strove to gild his rebuke with flatteries this grownup did not seem to like it but he collapsed and georgie lay back in his seat silent and enraptured mr pepper was singing again and the deep ringing voice the red fire and the misty waving gown all seemed to be mixed up with the little girl who had been so kind about his cut when the performance was ended she nodded to georgie and georgie nodded in return he spoke no more than was necessary till bedtime but meditated on new colors and sounds and lights and music and things as far as he understood them the deepmouthed agony of mr pepper mingling with the little girls lisp that night he made a new tale from which he shamelessly removed the rapunzelrapunzelletdownyourhair princess gold crown grimm edition and all and put a new annieanlouise in her place so it was perfectly right and natural that when he came to the brushwoodpile he should find her waiting for him her hair combed off her forehead more like alice in wonderland than ever and the races and adventures began  ten years at an english public school do not encourage dreaming georgie won his growth and chest measurement and a few other things which did not appear in the bills under a system of cricket football and paperchases from four to five days a week which provided for three lawful cuts of a groundash if any boy absented himself from these entertainments he became a rumplecollared dustyhatted fag of the lower third and a light halfback at little side football was pushed and prodded through the slack backwaters of the lower fourth where the raffle of a school generally accumulates won his secondfifteen cap at football enjoyed the dignity of a study with two companions in it and began to look forward to office as a subprefect at last he blossomed into full glory as head of the school exofficio captain of the games head of his house where he and his lieutenants preserved discipline and decency among seventy boys from twelve to seventeen general arbiter in the quarrels that spring up among the touchy sixthand intimate friend and ally of the head himself when he stepped forth in the black jersey white knickers and black stockings of the first fifteen the new matchball under his arm and his old and frayed cap at the back of his head the small fry of the lower forms stood apart and worshipped and the new caps of the team talked to him ostentatiously that the world might see and so in summer when he came back to the pavilion after a slow but eminently safe game it mattered not whether he had made nothing or as once happened a hundred and three the school shouted just the same and womenfolk who had come to look at the match looked at cottarcottar major thats cottar above all he was responsible for that thing called the tone of the school and few realise with what passionate devotion a certain type of boy throws himself into this work home was a faraway country full of ponies and fishing and shooting and menvisitors who interfered with ones plans but school was the real world where things of vital importance happened and crises arose that must be dealt with promptly and quietly not for nothing was it written let the consuls look to it that the republic takes no harm and georgie was glad to be back in authority when the holidays ended behind him but not too near was the wise and temperate head now suggesting the wisdom of the serpent now counselling the mildness of the dove leading him on to see more by halfhints than by any direct word how boys and men are all of a piece and how he who can handle the one will assuredly in time control the other  for the rest the school was not encouraged to dwell on its emotions but rather to keep in hard condition to avoid false quantities and to enter the army direct without the help of the expensive london crammer under whose roof young blood learns too much cottar major went the way of hundreds before him the head gave him six months final polish taught him what kind of answers best please a certain kind of examiners and handed him over to the properly constituted authorities who passed him into sandhurst here he had sense enough to see that he was in the lower third once more and behaved with respect toward his seniors till they in turn respected him and he was promoted to the rank of corporal and sat in authority over mixed peoples with all the vices of men and boys combined his reward was another string of athletic cups a goodconduct sword and at last her majestys commission as a subaltern in a firstclass line regiment he did not know that he bore with him from school and college a character worth much fine gold but was pleased to find his mess so kindly he had plenty of money of his own his training had set the public school mask upon his face and had taught him how many were the things no fellow can do by virtue of the same training he kept his pores open and his mouth shut  the regular working of the empire shifted his world to india where he tasted utter loneliness in subalterns quartersone room and one bullocktrunkand with his mess learned the new life from the beginning but there were horses in the landponies at reasonable price there was polo for such as could afford it there were the disreputable remnants of a pack of hounds and cottar worried his way along without too much despair it dawned on him that a regiment in india was nearer the chance of active service than he had conceived and that a man might as well study his profession a major of the new school backed this idea with enthusiasm and he and cottar accumulated a library of military works and read and argued and disputed far into the nights but the adjutant said the old thing get to know your men young un and they ll follow you anywhere thats all you wantknow your men cottar thought he knew them fairly well at cricket and the regimental sports but he never realised the true inwardness of them till he was sent off with a detachment of twenty to sit down in a mud fort near a rushing river which was spanned by a bridge of boats when the floods came they went forth and hunted strayed pontoons along the banks otherwise there was nothing to do and the men got drunk gambled and quarrelled they were a sickly crew for a junior subaltern is by custom saddled with the worst men cottar endured their rioting as long as he could and then sent downcountry for a dozen pairs of boxinggloves  i wouldnt blame you for fightin said he if you only knew how to use your hands but you dont take these things and ill show you the men appreciated his efforts now instead of blaspheming and swearing at a comrade and threatening to shoot him they could take him apart and soothe themselves to exhaustion as one explained whom cottar found with a shut eye and a diamondshaped mouth spitting blood through an embrasure we tried it with the gloves sir for twenty minutes and that done us no good sir then we took off the gloves and tried it that way for another twenty minutes same as you showed us sir an that done us a world o good t wasnt fightin sir there was a bet on  cottar dared not laugh but he invited his men to other sports such as racing across country in shirt and trousers after a trail of torn paper and to singlestick in the evenings till the native population who had a lust for sport in every form wished to know whether the white men understood wrestling they sent in an ambassador who took the soldiers by the neck and threw them about the dust and the entire command were all for this new game they spent money on learning new falls and holds which was better than buying other doubtful commodities and the peasantry grinned five deep round the tournaments  that detachment who had gone up in bullockcarts returned to headquarters at an average rate of thirty miles a day fair heelandtoe no sick no prisoners and no court martials pending they scattered themselves among their friends singing the praises of their lieutenant and looking for causes of offense  how did you do it young un the adjutant asked  oh i sweated the beef off em and then i sweated some muscle on to em it was rather a lark  if thats your way of lookin at it we can give you all the larks you want young davies isnt feelin quite fit and hes next for detachment duty care to go for him  sure he wouldnt mind i dont want to shove myself forward you know  you neednt bother on daviess account well give you the sweepins of the corps and you can see what you can make of em  all right said cottar its better fun than loafin about cantonments  rummy thing said the adjutant after cottar had returned to his wilderness with twenty other devils worse than the first if cottar only knew it half the women in the station would give their eyesconfound emto have the young un in tow  that accounts for mrs elery sayin i was workin my nice new boy too hard said a wing commander  oh yes and why doesnt he come to the bandstand in the evenings and cant i get him to make up a four at tennis with the hammon girls the adjutant snorted look at young davies makin an ass of himself over muttondressedaslamb old enough to be his mother  no one can accuse young cottar of runnin after women white or black the major replied thoughtfully but then thats the kind that generally goes the worst mucker in the end  not cottar ive only run across one of his muster beforea fellow called ingles in south africa he was just the same hard trained athleticsports build of animal always kept himself in the pink of condition didnt do him much good though shot at wesselstroom the week before majuba wonder how the young un will lick his detachment into shape  cottar turned up six weeks later on foot with his pupils he never told his experiences but the men spoke enthusiastically and fragments of it leaked back to the colonel through sergeants batmen and the like  there was great jealousy between the first and second detachments but the men united in adoring cottar and their way of showing it was by sparing him all the trouble that men know how to make for an unloved officer he sought popularity as little as he had sought it at school and therefore it came to him he favoured no onenot even when the company sloven pulled the company cricketmatch out of the fire with an unexpected fortythree at the last moment there was very little getting round him for he seemed to know by instinct exactly when and where to head off a malingerer but he did not forget that the difference between a dazed and sulky junior of the upper school and a bewildered browbeaten lump of a private fresh from the depot was very small indeed the sergeants seeing these things told him secrets generally hid from young officers his words were quoted as barrack authority on bets in canteen and at tea and the veriest shrew of the corps bursting with charges against other women who had used the cookingranges out of turn forbore to speak when cottar as the regulations ordained asked of a morning if there were any complaints  im full o complaints said mrs corporal morrison an id kill ohallorans fat sow of a wife any day but ye know how it is e puts is head just inside the door an looks down is blessed nose so bashful an e whispers any complaints ye cant complain after that i want to kiss him some day i think i will heighho shell be a lucky woman that gets young innocence see im now girls do ye blame me  cottar was cantering across to polo and he looked a very satisfactory figure of a man as he gave easily to the first excited bucks of his pony and slipped over a low mud wall to the practiceground there were more than mrs corporal morrison who felt as she did but cottar was busy for eleven hours of the day he did not care to have his tennis spoiled by petticoats in the court and after one long afternoon at a gardenparty he explained to his major that this sort of thing was futile priffle and the major laughed theirs was not a married mess except for the colonels wife and cottar stood in awe of the good lady she said my regiment and the world knows what that means none the less when they wanted her to give away the prizes after a shootingmatch and she refused because one of the prizewinners was married to a girl who had made a jest of her behind her broad back the mess ordered cottar to tackle her in his best callingkit this he did simply and laboriously and she gave way altogether  she only wanted to know the facts of the case he explained i just told her and she saw at once  yees said the adjutant i expect thats what she did comin to the fusiliers dance tonight galahad  no thanks ive got a fight on with the major the virtuous apprentice sat up till midnight in the majors quarters with a stopwatch and a pair of compasses shifting little painted leadblocks about a fourinch map  then he turned in and slept the sleep of innocence which is full of healthy dreams one peculiarity of his dreams he noticed at the beginning of his second hot weather two or three times a month they duplicated or ran in series he would find himself sliding into dreamland by the same roada road that ran along a beach near a pile of brushwood to the right lay the sea sometimes at full tide sometimes withdrawn to the very horizon but he knew it for the same sea by that road he would travel over a swell of rising ground covered with short withered grass into valleys of wonder and unreason beyond the ridge which was crowned with some sort of streetlamp anything was possible but up to the lamp it seemed to him that he knew the road as well as he knew the paradeground he learned to look forward to the place for once there he was sure of a good nights rest and indian hot weather can be rather trying first shadowy under closing eyelids would come the outline of the brushwoodpile next the white sand of the beachroad almost overhanging the black changeful sea then the turn inland and uphill to the single light when he was unrestful for any reason he would tell himself how he was sure to get theresure to get thereif he shut his eyes and surrendered to the drift of things but one night after a foolishly hard hours polo the thermometer was 94° in his quarters at ten oclock sleep stood away from him altogether though he did his best to find the wellknown road the point where true sleep began at last he saw the brushwoodpile and hurried along to the ridge for behind him he felt was the wideawake sultry world he reached the lamp in safety tingling with drowsiness when a policemana common country policemansprang up before him and touched him on the shoulder ere he could dive into the dim valley below he was filled with terrorthe hopeless terror of dreamsfor the policeman said in the awful distinct voice of dreampeople i am policeman day coming back from the city of sleep you come with me georgie knew it was truethat just beyond him in the valley lay the lights of the city of sleep where he would have been sheltered and that this policemanthing had full power and authority to head him back to miserable wakefulness he found himself looking at the moonlight on the wall dripping with fright and he never overcame that horror though he met the policeman several times that hot weather and his coming was the forerunner of a bad night  but other dreamsperfectly absurd onesfilled him with an incommunicable delight all those that he remembered began by the brushwoodpile for instance he found a small clockwork steamer he had noticed it many nights before lying by the searoad and stepped into it whereupon it moved with surpassing swiftness over an absolutely level sea this was glorious for he felt he was exploring great matters and it stopped by a lily carved in stone which most naturally floated on the water seeing the lily was labelled hongkong georgie said of course this is precisely what i expected hongkong would be like how magnificent thousands of miles farther on it halted at yet another stone lily labelled java and this again delighted him hugely because he knew that now he was at the worlds end but the little boat ran on and on till it lay in a deep freshwater lock the sides of which were carven marble green with moss lilypads lay on the water and reeds arched above some one moved among the reedssome one whom georgie knew he had travelled to this worlds end to reach therefore everything was entirely well with him he was unspeakably happy and vaulted over the ships side to find this person when his feet touched that still water it changed with the rustle of unrolling maps to nothing less than a sixth quarter of the globe beyond the most remote imagining of mana place where islands were coloured yellow and blue their lettering strung across their faces they gave on unknown seas and georgies urgent desire was to return swiftly across this floating atlas to known bearings he told himself repeatedly that it was no good to hurry but still he hurried desperately and the islands slipped and slid under his feet the straits yawned and widened till he found himself utterly lost in the worlds fourth dimension with no hope of return yet only a little distance away he could see the old world with the rivers and mountainchains marked according to the sandhurst rules of mapmaking then that person for whom he had come to the lily lock that was its name ran up across unexplored territories and showed him away they fled hand in hand till they reached a road that spanned ravines and ran along the edge of precipices and was tunnelled through mountains this goes to our brushwoodpile said his companion and all his trouble was at an end he took a pony because he understood that this was the thirtymile ride and he must ride swiftly and raced through the clattering tunnels and round the curves always downhill till he heard the sea to his left and saw it raging under a full moon against sandy cliffs it was heavy going but he recognised the nature of the country the darkpurple downs inland and the bents that whistled in the wind the road was eaten away in places and the sea lashed at himblack foamless tongues of smooth and glossy rollers but he was sure that there was less danger from the sea than from them whoever they were inland to his right he knew too that he would be safe if he could reach the down with the lamp on it this came as he expected he saw the one light a mile ahead along the beach dismounted turned to the right walked quietly over to the brushwoodpile found the little steamer had returned to the beach whence he had unmoored it andmust have fallen asleep for he could remember no more im gettin the hang of the geography of that place he said to himself as he shaved next morning i must have made some sort of circle lets see the thirtymile ride now how the deuce did i know it was called the thirtymile ride joins the searoad beyond the first down where the lamp is and that atlascountry lies at the back of the thirtymile ride somewhere out to the right beyond the hills and tunnels rummy things dreams wonder what makes mine fit into each other so  he continued on his solid way through the recurring duties of the seasons the regiment was shifted to another station and he enjoyed roadmarching for two months with a good deal of mixed shooting thrown in and when they reached their new cantonments he became a member of the local tent club and chased the mighty boar on horseback with a short stabbingspear there he met the mahseer of the poonch beside whom the tarpon is as a herring and he who lands him can say that he is a fisherman this was as new and as fascinating as the biggame shooting that fell to his portion when he had himself photographed for the mothers benefit sitting on the flank of his first tiger  then the adjutant was promoted and cottar rejoiced with him for he admired the adjutant greatly and marvelled who might be big enough to fill his place so that he nearly collapsed when the mantle fell on his own shoulders and the colonel said a few sweet things that made him blush an adjutants position does not differ materially from that of head of the school and cottar stood in the same relation to the colonel as he had to his old head in england only tempers wear out in hot weather and things were said and done that tried him sorely and he made glorious blunders from which the regimental sergeantmajor pulled him with a loyal soul and a shut mouth slovens and incompetents raged against him the weakminded strove to lure him from the ways of justice the smallmindedyea men whom cottar believed would never do things no fellow can doimputed motives mean and circuitous to actions that he had not spent a thought upon and he tasted injustice and it made him very sick but his consolation came on parade when he looked down the full companies and reflected how few were in hospital or cells and wondered when the time would come to try the machine of his love and labour  but they needed and expected the whole of a mans workingday and maybe three or four hours of the night curiously enough he never dreamed about the regiment as he was popularly supposed to the mind set free from the days doings generally ceased working altogether or if it moved at all carried him along the old beachroad to the downs the lamppost and once in a while to terrible policeman day the second time that he returned to the worlds lost continent this was a dream that repeated itself again and again with variations on the same ground he knew that if he only sat still the person from the lily lock would help him and he was not disappointed sometimes he was trapped in mines of vast depth hollowed out of the heart of the world where men in torment chanted echoing songs and he heard this person coming along through the galleries and everything was made safe and delightful they met again in lowroofed indian railwaycarriages that halted in a garden surrounded by giltandgreen railings where a mob of stony white people all unfriendly sat at breakfasttables covered with roses and separated georgie from his companion while underground voices sang deepvoiced songs georgie was filled with enormous despair till they two met again they foregathered in the middle of an endless hot tropic night and crept into a huge house that stood he knew somewhere north of the railwaystation where the people ate among the roses it was surrounded with gardens all moist and dripping and in one room reached through leagues of whitewashed passages a sick thing lay in bed now the least noise georgie knew would unchain some waiting horror and his companion knew it too but when their eyes met across the bed georgie was disgusted to see that she was a childa little girl in strapped shoes with her black hair combed back from her forehead  what disgraceful folly he thought now she could do nothing whatever if its head came off  then the thing coughed and the ceiling shattered down in plaster on the mosquitonetting and they rushed in from all quarters he dragged the child through the stifling garden voices chanting behind them and they rode the thirtymile ride under whip and spur along the sandy beach by the booming sea till they came to the downs the lamppost and the brushwoodpile which was safety very often dreams would break up about them in this fashion and they would be separated to endure awful adventures alone but the most amusing times were when he and she had a clear understanding that it was all makebelieve and walked through milewide roaring rivers without even taking off their shoes or set light to populous cities to see how they would burn and were rude as any children to the vague shadows met in their rambles later in the night they were sure to suffer for this either at the hands of the railway people eating among the roses or in the tropic uplands at the far end of the thirtymile ride together this did no much affright them but often georgie would hear her shrill cry of boy boy half a world away and hurry to her rescue before they maltreated her  he and she explored the darkpurple downs as far inland from the brushwoodpile as they dared but that was always a dangerous matter the interior was filled with them and they went about singing in the hollows and georgie and she felt safer on or near the seaboard so thoroughly had he come to know the place of his dreams that even waking he accepted it as a real country and made a rough sketch of it he kept his own counsel of course but the permanence of the land puzzled him his ordinary dreams were as formless and as fleeting as any healthy dreams could be but once at the brushwoodpile he moved within known limits and could see where he was going there were months at a time when nothing notable crossed his sleep then the dreams would come in a batch of five or six and next morning the map that he kept in his writing case would be written up to date for georgie was a most methodical person there was indeed a dangerhis seniors said soof his developing into a regular auntie fuss of an adjutant and when an officer once takes to oldmaidism there is more hope for the virgin of seventy than for him  but fate sent the change that was needed in the shape of a little winter campaign on the border which after the manner of little campaigns flashed out into a very ugly war and cottars regiment was chosen among the first  now said a major thisll shake the cobwebs out of us allespecially you galahad and we can see what your henwithonechick attitude has done for the regiment  cottar nearly wept with joy as the campaign went forward they were fitphysically fit beyond the other troops they were good children in camp wet or dry fed or unfed and they followed their officers with the quick suppleness and trained obedience of a firstclass football fifteen they were cut off from their apology for a base and cheerfully cut their way back to it again they crowned and cleaned out hills full of the enemy with the precision of wellbroken dogs of chase and in the hour of retreat when hampered with the sick and wounded of the column they were persecuted down eleven miles of waterless valley they serving as rearguard covered themselves with a great glory in the eyes of fellowprofessionals any regiment can advance but few know how to retreat with a sting in the tail then they turned to made roads most often under fire and dismantled some inconvenient mud redoubts they were the last corps to be withdrawn when the rubbish of the campaign was all swept up and after a month in standing camp which tries morals severely they departed to their own place in column of fours singing                  es goin to do without em                    dont want em any more                  es goin to do without em                     as es often done before                  es goin to be a martyr                     on a ighly novel plan                   an all the boys and girls will say                   ow what a nice young manmanman                   ow what a nice young man  there came out a gazette in which cottar found that he had been behaving with courage and coolness and discretion in all his capacities that he had assisted the wounded under fire and blown in a gate also under fire net result his captaincy and a brevet majority coupled with the distinguished service order  as to his wounded he explained that they were both heavy men whom he could lift more easily than any one else otherwise of course i should have sent out one of my men and of course about that gate business we were safe the minute we were well under the walls but this did not prevent his men from cheering him furiously whenever they saw him or the mess from giving him a dinner on the eve of his departure to england a years leave was among the things he had snaffled out of the campaign i to use his own words the doctor who had taken quite as much as was good for him quoted poetry about a good blade carving the casques of men and so on and everybody told cottar that he was an excellent person but when he rose to make his maiden speech they shouted so that he was understood to say it isnt any use tryin to speak with you chaps rottin me like this lets have some pool                        it is not unpleasant to spend eightandtwenty days in an easygoing steamer on warm waters in the company of a woman who lets you see that you are head and shoulders superior to the rest of the world even though that woman may be and most often is ten counted years your senior po boats are not lighted with the disgustful particularity of atlantic liners there is more phosphorescence at the bows and greater silence and darkness by the handsteering gear aft  awful things might have happened to georgie but for the little fact that he had never studied the first principles of the game he was expected to play so when mrs zuleika at aden told him how motherly an interest she felt in his welfare medals brevet and all georgie took her at the foot of the letter and promptly talked of his own mother three hundred miles nearer each day of his home and so forth all the way up the red sea it was much easier than he had supposed to converse with a woman for an hour at a time then mrs zuleika turning from parental affection spoke of love in the abstract as a thing not unworthy of study and in discreet twilights after dinner demanded confidences georgie would have been delighted to supply them but he had none and did not know it was his duty to manufacture them mrs zuleika expressed surprise and unbelief and askedthose questions which deep asks of deep she learned all that was necessary to conviction and being very much a woman resumed georgie never knew that she had abandoned the motherly attitude  do you know she said somewhere in the mediterranean i think youre the very dearest boy i have ever met in my life and id like you to remember me a little you will when you are older but i want you to remember me now youll make some girl very happy  oh hope so said georgie gravely but theres heaps of time for marryin an all that sort of thing aint there  that depends here are your beanbags for the ladies competition i think im growing too old to care for these tamashas  they were getting up sports and georgie was on the committee he never noticed how perfectly the bags were sewn but another woman did and smiledonce he liked mrs zuleika greatly she was a bit old of course but uncommonly nice there was no nonsense about her  a few nights after they passed gibraltar his dream returned to him she who waited by the brushwoodpile was no longer a little girl but a woman with black hair that grew into a widows peak combed back from her forehead he knew her for the child in black the companion of the last six years and as it had been in the time of the meetings on the lost continent he was filled with delight unspeakable they for some dreamland reason were friendly or had gone away that night and the two flitted together over all their country from the brushwoodpile up the thirtymile ride till they saw the house of the sick thing a pinpoint in the distance to the left stamped through the railway waitingroom where the roses lay on the spread breakfasttables and returned by the ford and the city they had once burned for sport to the great swells of the downs under the lamppost wherever they moved a strong singing followed them underground but this night there was no panic all the land was empty except for themselves and at the last they were sitting by the lamppost hand in hand she turned and kissed him he woke with a start staring at the waving curtain of the cabin door he could almost have sworn that the kiss was real  next morning the ship was rolling in a biscay sea and people were not happy but as georgie came to breakfast shaven tubbed and smelling of soap several turned to look at him because of the light in his eyes and the splendour of his countenance  well you look beastly fit snapped a neighbour any one left you a legacy in the middle of the bay  georgie reached for the curry with a seraphic grin i suppose its the gettin so near home and all that i do feel rather festive this mornin rolls a bit doesnt she  mrs zuleika stayed in her cabin till the end of the voyage when she left without bidding him farewell and wept passionately on the dockhead for pure joy of meeting her children who she had often said were so like their father  georgie headed for his own country wild with delight of his first long furlough after the lean seasons nothing was changed in that orderly life from the coachman who met him at the station to the white peacock that stormed at the carriage from the stone wall above the shaven lawns the house took toll of him with due regard to precedencefirst the mother then the father then the housekeeper who wept and praised god then the butler and so on down to the underkeeper who had been dogboy in georgies youth and called him master georgie and was reproved by the groom who had taught georgie to ride  not a thing changed he sighed contentedly when the three of them sat down to dinner in the late sunlight while the rabbits crept out upon the lawn below the cedars and the big trout in the ponds by the home paddock rose for their evening meal  our changes are all over dear cooed the mother and now i am getting used to your size and your tan youre very brown georgie i see you havent changed in the least youre exactly like the pater  the father beamed on this man after his own heartyoungest major in the army and should have had the vc sirand the butler listened with his professional mask off when master georgie spoke of war as it is waged today and his father crossquestioned  they went out on the terrace to smoke among the roses and the shadow of the old house lay long across the wonderful english foliage which is the only living green in the world  perfect by jove its perfect georgie was looking at the roundbosomed woods beyond the home paddock where the white pheasant boxes were ranged and the golden air was full of a hundred sacred scents and sounds georgie felt his fathers arm tighten in his  its not half badbut hodie mihi cras tibi isnt it i suppose youll be turning up some fine day with a girl under your arm if you havent one now eh  you can make your mind easy sir i havent one  not in all these years said the mother  i hadnt time mummy they keep a man pretty busy these days in the service and most of our mess are unmarried too  but you must have met hundreds in societyat balls and so on  im like the tenth mummy i dont dance  dont dance what have you been doing with yourself thenbacking other mens bills said the father  oh yes ive done a little of that too but you see as things are now a man has all his work cut out for him to keep abreast of his profession and my days were always too full to let me lark about half the night  hmmsuspiciously  its never too late to learn we ought to give some kind of housewarming for the people about now youve come back unless you want to go straight up to town dear  no i dont want anything better than this lets sit still and enjoy ourselves i suppose there will be something for me to ride if i look for it  seeing ive been kept down to the old brown pair for the last six weeks because all the others were being got ready for master georgie i should say there might be the father chuckled theyre reminding me in a hundred ways that i must take the second place now  brutes  the pater doesnt mean it dear but every one has been trying to make your homecoming a success and you do like it dont you  perfect perfect theres no place like englandwhen you ve done your work  thats the proper way to look at it my son  and so up and down the flagged walk till their shadows grew long in the moonlight and the mother went indoors and played such songs as a small boy once clamoured for and the squat silver candlesticks were brought in and georgie climbed to the two rooms in the west wing that had been his nursery and his playroom in the beginning then who should come to tuck him up for the night but the mother and she sat down on the bed and they talked for a long hour as mother and son should if there is to be any future for the empire with a simple womans deep guile she asked questions and suggested answers that should have waked some sign in the face on the pillow and there was neither quiver of eyelid nor quickening of breath neither evasion nor delay in reply so she blessed him and kissed him on the mouth which is not always a mothers property and said something to her husband later at which he laughed profane and incredulous laughs  all the establishment waited on georgie next morning from the tallest sixyearold with a mouth like a kid glove master georgie to the underkeeper strolling carelessly along the horizon georgies pet rod in his hand and theres a fourpounder risin below the lasher you dont ave em in injia mastmajor georgie it was all beautiful beyond telling even though the mother insisted on taking him out in the landau the leather had the hot sunday smell of his youth and showing him off to her friends at all the houses for six miles round and the pater bore him up to town and a lunch at the club where he introduced him quite carelessly to not less than thirty ancient warriors whose sons were not the youngest majors in the army and had not the dso after that it was georgies turn and remembering his friends he filled up the house with that kind of officer who live in cheap lodgings at southsea or montpelier square bromptongood men all but not well off the mother perceived that they needed girls to play with and as there was no scarcity of girls the house hummed like a dovecote in spring they tore up the place for amateur theatricals they disappeared in the gardens when they ought to have been rehearsing they swept off every available horse and vehicle especially the governesscart and the fat pony they fell into the troutponds they picnicked and they tennised and they sat on gates in the twilight two by two and georgie found that he was not in the least necessary to their entertainment  my word said he when he saw the last of their dear backs they told me theyve enjoyed emselves but they havent done half the things they said they would  i know theyve enjoyed themselvesimmensely said the mother youre a public benefactor dear  now we can be quiet again cant we  oh quite ive a very dear friend of mine that i want you to know she couldnt come with the house so full because shes an invalid and she was away when you first came shes a mrs lacy  lacy i dont remember the name about here  no they came after you went to indiafrom oxford her husband died there and she lost some money i believe they bought the firs on the bassett road shes a very sweet woman and were very fond of them both  shes a widow didnt you say  she has a daughter surely i said so dear  does she fall into troutponds and gas and giggle and oh major cottah and all that sort of thing  no indeed shes a very quiet girl and very musical she always came over here with her musicbookscomposing you know and she generally works all day so you wont  talking about miriam said the pater coming up the mother edged toward him within elbowreach there was no finesse about georgies father oh miriams a dear girl plays beautifully rides beautifully too shes a regular pet of the household used to call me the elbow went home and ignorant but obedient always the pater shut himself off  what used she to call you sir  all sorts of pet names im very fond of miriam  sounds jewishmiriam  jew youll be calling yourself a jew next shes one of the herefordshire lacys when her aunt dies again the elbow  oh you wont see anything of her georgie shes busy with her music or her mother all day besides youre going up to town tomorrow arent you i thought you said something about an institute meeting the mother spoke  go up to town now what nonsense once more the pater was shut off  i had some idea of it but im not quite sure said the son of the house why did the mother try to get him away because a musical girl and her invalid parent were expected he did not approve of unknown females calling his father pet names he would observe these pushing persons who had been only seven years in the county  all of which the delighted mother read in his countenance herself keeping an air of sweet disinterestedness  theyll be here this evening for dinner im sending the carriage over for them and they wont stay more than a week  perhaps i shall go up to town i dont quite know yet georgie moved away irresolutely there was a lecture at the united services institute on the supply of ammunition in the field and the one man whose theories most irritated major cottar would deliver it a heated discussion was sure to follow and perhaps he might find himself moved to speak he took his rod that afternoon and went down to thrash it out among the trout  good sport dear said the mother from the terrace  fraid it wont be mummy all those men from town and the girls particularly have put every trout off his feed for weeks there isnt one of em that cares for fishinreally fancy stampin and shoutin on the bank and tellin every fish for half a mile exactly what youre goin to do and then chuckin a brute of a fly at him by jove it would scare me if i was a trout  but things were not as bad as he had expected the black gnat was on the water and the water was strictly preserved a threequarterpounder at the second cast set him for the campaign and he worked downstream crouching behind the reed and meadowsweet creeping between a hornbeam hedge and a footwide strip of bank where he could see the trout but where they could not distinguish him from the background lying almost on his stomach to switch the blueupright sidewise through the checkered shadows of a gravelly ripple under overarching trees but he had known every inch of the water since he was four feet high the aged and astute between sunk roots with the large and fat that lay in the frothy scum below some strong rush of water sucking as lazily as carp came to trouble in their turn at the hand that imitated so delicately the flicker and wimple of an eggdropping fly consequently georgie found himself five miles from home when he ought to have been dressing for dinner the housekeeper had taken good care that her boy should not go empty and before he changed to the white moth he sat down to excellent claret with sandwiches of potted egg and things that adoring women make and men never notice then back to surprise the otter grubbing for freshwater mussels the rabbits on the edge of the beechwoods foraging in the clover and the policemanlike white owl stooping to the little fieldmice till the moon was strong and he took his rod apart and went home through wellremembered gaps in the hedges he fetched a compass round the house for though he might have broken every law of the establishment every hour the law of his boyhood was unbreakable after fishing you went in by the south garden backdoor cleaned up in the outer scullery and did not present yourself to your elders and your betters till you had washed and changed  halfpast ten by jove well well make the sport an excuse they wouldnt want to see me the first evening at any rate gone to bed probably he skirted by the open french windows of the drawingroom no they havent they look very comfy in there  he could see his father in his own particular chair the mother in hers and the back of a girl at the piano by the big potpourrijar the gardens looked half divine in the moonlight and he turned down through the roses to finish his pipe  a preludeended and there floated out a voice of the kind that in his childhood he used to call creamy a full true contralto and this is the song that he heard every syllable of it    over the edge of the purple down         where the single lamplight gleams   know ye the road to the merciful town         that is hard by the sea of dreams   where the poor may lay their wrongs away         and the sick may forget to weep   but wepity us  oh pity us         we wakeful ah pity us   we must go back with policeman day         back from the city of sleep    weary they turn from the scroll and crown         fetter and prayer and plough   they that go up to the merciful town         for her gates are closing now   it is their right in the baths of night         body and soul to steep   but wepity us ah pity us         we wakeful oh pity us   we must go back with policeman day         back from the city of sleep    over the edge of the purple down         ere the tender dreams begin   lookwe may lookat the merciful town         but we may not enter in   outcasts all from her guarded wall         back to our watch we creep   wepity us ah pity us         we wakeful oh pity us   we that go back with policeman day         back from the city of sleep  at the last echo he was aware that his mouth was dry and unknown pulses were beating in the roof of it the housekeeper who would have it that he must have fallen in and caught a chill was waiting to catch him on the stairs and since he neither saw nor answered her carried a wild tale abroad that brought his mother knocking at the door  anything happened dear harper said she thought you werent  no its nothing im all right mummy please dont bother  he did not recognise his own voice but that was a small matter beside what he was considering obviously most obviously the whole coincidence was crazy lunacy he proved it to the satisfaction of major george cottar who was going up to town tomorrow to hear a lecture on the supply of ammunition in the field and having so proved it the soul and brain and heart and body of georgie cried joyously thats the lily lock girlthe lost continent girlthe thirtymile ride girlthe brushwood girl i know her  he waked stiff and cramped in his chair to reconsider the situation by sunlight when it did not appear normal but a man must eat and he went to breakfast his heart between his teeth holding himself severely in hand  late as usual said the mother my boy miss lacy  a tall girl in black raised her eyes to his and georgies life training deserted himjust as soon as he realised that she did not know he stared coolly and critically there was the abundant black hair growing in a widows peak turned back from the forehead with that peculiar ripple over the right ear there were the grey eyes set a little close together the short upper lip resolute chin and the known poise of the head there was also the small wellcut mouth that had kissed him  georgiedear said the mother amazedly for miriam was flushing under the stare  ii beg your pardon he gulped i dont know whether the mother has told you but im rather an idiot at times specially before ive had my breakfast itsits a family failing he turned to explore among the hotwater dishes on the sideboard rejoicing that she did not knowshe did not know  his conversation for the rest of the meal was mildly insane though the mother thought she had never seen her boy look half so handsome how could any girl least of all one of miriams discernment forbear to fall down and worship but deeply miriam was displeased she had never been stared at in that fashion before and promptly retired into her shell when georgie announced that he had changed his mind about going to town and would stay to play with miss lacy if she had nothing better to do  oh but dont let me throw you out im at work ive things to do all the morning  what possessed georgie to behave so oddly the mother sighed to herself miriams a bundle of feelingslike her mother  you composedont you must be a fine thing to be able to do that pigoh pig thought miriam i think i heard you singin when i came in last night after fishin all about a sea of dreams wasnt it miriam shuddered to the core of the soul that afflicted her awfully pretty song how d you think of such things  you only composed the music dear didnt you  the words too im sure of it said georgie with a sparkling eye no she did not know  yeth i wrote the words too miriam spoke slowly for she knew she lisped when she was nervous  now how could you tell georgie said the mother as delighted as though the youngest major in the army were ten years old showing off before company  i was sure of it somehow oh there are heaps of things about me mummy that you dont understand looks as if it were goin to be a hot dayfor england would you care for a ride this afternoon miss lacy we can start out after tea if youd like it  miriam could not in decency refuse but any woman might see she was not filled with delight  that will be very nice if you take the bassett road it will save me sending martin down to the village said the mother filling in gaps  like all good managers the mother had her one weaknessa mania for little strategies that should economise horses and vehicles her menfolk complained that she turned them into common carriers and there was a legend in the family that she had once said to the pater on the morning of a meet if you should kill near bassett dear and if it isnt too late would you mind just popping over and matching me this  i knew that was coming youd never miss a chance mother if its a fish or a trunk i wont georgie laughed  its only a duck they can do it up very neatly at malletts said the mother simply you wont mind will you well have a scratch dinner at nine because its so hot  the long summer day dragged itself out for centuries but at last there was tea on the lawn and miriam appeared  she was in the saddle before he could offer to help with the clean spring of the child who mounted the pony for the thirtymile ride the day held mercilessly though georgie got down thrice to look for imaginary stones in rufuss foot one cannot say even simple things in broad light and this that georgie meditated was not simple so he spoke seldom and miriam was divided between relief and scorn it annoyed her that the great hulking thing should know she had written the words of the song overnight for though a maiden may sing her most secret fancies aloud she does not care to have them trampled over by the male philistine they rode into the little redbrick street of bassett and georgie made untold fuss over the disposition of that duck it must go in just such a package and be fastened to the saddle in just such a manner though eight oclock had struck and they were miles from dinner  we must be quick said miriam bored and angry  theres no great hurry but we can cut over dowhead down and let em out on the grass that will save us half an hour  the horses capered on the short sweetsmelling turf and the delaying shadows gathered in the valley as they cantered over the great dun down that overhangs bassett and the western coachingroad insensibly the pace quickened without thought of molehills rufus gentleman that he was waiting on miriams dandy till they should have cleared the rise then down the twomile slope they raced together the wind whistling in their ears to the steady throb of eight hoofs and the light clickclick of the shifting bits  oh that was glorious miriam cried reining in dandy and i are old friends but i dont think weve ever gone better together  no but youve gone quicker once or twice  really when  georgie moistened his lips dont you remember the thirtymile ridewith mewhen they were after uson the beachroad with the sea to the leftgoing toward the lamppost on the downs  the girl gasped whatwhat do you mean she said hysterically  the thirtymile ride andand all the rest of it  you mean i didnt sing anything about the thirtymile ride i know i didnt i have never told a living soul  you told about policeman day and the lamp at the top of the downs and the city of sleep it all joins on you knowits the same countryand it was easy enough to see where you had been  good godit joins onof course it does buti have beenyou have beenoh lets walk please or i shall fall off  georgie ranged alongside and laid a hand that shook below her bridlehand pulling dandy into a walk miriam was sobbing as he had seen a man sob under the touch of the bullet  its all rightits all right he whispered feebly onlyonly its true you know  true am i mad  not unless im mad as well do try to think a minute quietly how could any one conceivably know anything about the thirtymile ride having anything to do with you unless he had been there  but where but where tell me  therewherever it may bein our country i suppose do you remember the first time you rode itthe thirtymile ride i mean you must  it was all dreamsall dreams  yes but tell please because i know  let me think iwe were on no account to make any noiseon no account to make any noise she was staring between dandys ears with eyes that did not see and a suffocating heart  because it was dying in the big house georgie went on reining in again  there was a garden with greenandgilt railingsall hot do you remember  i ought to i was sitting on the other side of the bed before it coughed and they came in  youthe deep voice was unnaturally full and strong and the girls wideopened eyes burned in the dusk as she stared him through and through then youre the boymy brushwood boy and ive known you all my life  she fell forward on dandys neck georgie forced himself out of the weakness that was overmastering his limbs and slid an arm round her waist the head dropped on his shoulder and he found himself with parched lips saying things that up till then he believed existed only in printed works of fiction mercifully the horses were quiet she made no attempt to draw herself away when she recovered but lay still whispering of course youre the boy and i didnt knowi didnt know  i knew last night and when i saw you at breakfast  oh that was why i wondered at the time you would of course  i couldnt speak before this keep your head where it is dear its all right nowall right now isnt it  but how was it i didnt knowafter all these years and years i rememberoh what lots of things i remember  tell me some ill look after the horses  i remember waiting for you when the steamer came in do you  at the lily lock beyond hongkong and java  do you call it that too  you told me it was when i was lost in the continent that was you that showed me the way through the mountains  when the islands slid it must have been because youre the only one i remember all the others were them  awful brutes they were too  i remember showing you the thirtymile ride the first time you ride just as you used tothen you are you  thats odd i thought that of you this afternoon isnt it wonderful  what does it all mean why should you and i of the millions of people in the world have thisthis thing between us what does it mean im frightened  this said georgie the horses quickened their pace they thought they had heard an order perhaps when we die we may find out more but it means this now  there was no answer what could she say as the world went they had known each other rather less than eight and a half hours but the matter was one that did not concern the world there was a very long silence while the breath in their nostrils drew cold and sharp as it might have been a fume of ether  thats the second georgie whispered you remember dont you  its notfuriously its not  on the downs the other nightmonths ago you were just as you are now and we went over the country for miles and miles  it was all empty too they had gone away nobody frightened us i wonder why boy  oh if you remember that you must remember the rest confess  i remember lots of things but i know i didnt i never havetill just now  you did dear  i know i didnt becauseoh its no use keeping anything back because i truthfully meant to  and truthfully did  no meant to but some one else came by  there wasnt any one else there never has been  there wasthere always is it was another womanout thereon the sea i saw her it was the 26th of may ive got it written down somewhere  oh youve kept a record of your dreams too thats odd about the other woman because i happened to be on the sea just then  i was right how do i know what youve done when you were awakeand i thought it was only you  you never were more wrong in your life what a little temper youve got listen to me a minute dear and georgie though he knew it not committed black perjury itit isnt the kind of thing one says to any one because theyd laugh but on my word and honour darling ive never been kissed by a living soul outside my own people in all my life dont laugh dear i wouldnt tell any one but you but its the solemn truth  i knew you are you oh i knew youd come some day but i didnt know you were you in the
