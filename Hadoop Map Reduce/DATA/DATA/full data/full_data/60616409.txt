together the big garret was the scene of many dramatic revels after a long day of teaching sewing and helping mother the greatest delight of the girls was to transform themselves into queens knights and cavaliers of high degree and ascend into a world of fancy and romance cinderellas godmother waved her wand and the dismal room became a fairyland flowers bloomed forests arose music sounded and lovers exchanged their vows by moonlight nothing was too ambitious to attempt armor gondolas harps towers and palaces grew as if by magic and wonderful scenes of valor and devotion were enacted before admiring audiences  jo of course played the villains ghosts bandits and disdainful queens for her tragedyloving soul delighted in the lurid parts and no drama was perfect in her eyes without a touch of the demonic or supernatural meg loved the sentimental r√¥les the tender maiden with the airy robes and flowing locks who made impossible sacrifices for ideal lovers or the cavalier singing soft serenades and performing lofty acts of gallantry and prowess amy was the fairy sprite while beth enacted the page or messenger when the scene required their aid  but the most surprising part of the performance was the length of the cast and the size of the company for jo and meg usually acted the whole play each often assuming five or six characters and with rapid change of dress becoming in one scene a witch a soldier a beauteous lady and a haughty noble this peculiar arrangement accounts for many queer devices and the somewhat singular fact that each scene offers but two actors who vanish and reappear at most inopportune moments and in a great variety of costume long speeches were introduced to allow a ruffian to become a priest or a lovely damsel to disguise herself in the garb of a sorceress while great skill was required to preserve the illusion and astonish the audience by these wonderful transformations  the young amateur of today who can easily call to her aid all the arts of the costumer and scenemaker will find it hard to understand the difficulties of this little company for not only did they compose their plays but they were also their own carpenters scenepainters propertymen dressmakers and managers in place of a wellappointed stage with the brilliant lights and inspiring accessories of a mimic theatre the little women had a gloomy garret or empty barn and were obliged to exercise all their ingenuity to present the scenes of their ambitious dramas  but it is surprising what fine effects can be produced with old sheets bright draperies and a judicious arrangement of lights garlands and picturesque properties and jos dramatic taste made her an admirable stagemanager meg was especially handy with saw and hammer and acted as stagecarpenterbuilding balconies thrones boats and towers after peculiar designs of her own bureaus tables and chairs piled aloft and arched with dark shawls made dungeon walls and witchs cave or formed a background for haunted forest and lonely glen screens of white cloth furnished canvas on which little amys skilful hand depicted palace halls or romantic scene for lovers tryst and beths deft fingers were most apt in constructing properties for stage adornment and transforming the frailest material into dazzling raiment for the costumes were a serious consideration no money could be spared from the slender purse to supply the wardrobes of these aspiring actors and many were the devices to clothe the little company  thus a robe in one scene became a cloak in the next and the drapery of a couch in the third while a bit of lace served as mantle veil or turban as best suited the turn of the play hats covered with old velvet and adorned with feathers plucked from the duster made most effective headgear for gay cavalier or tragic villain from colored cotton were manufactured fine greek tunics and flowing trains and remarkable court costumes were evolved from an old sofacovering which had seen better days and boasted a little gold thread and embroidery  stars of tin sewed upon dark cambric made a suit of shining armor sandals were cut from old boots strips of wood and silver paper were fashioned into daggers swords and spears while from cardboard were created helmets harps guitars and antique lamps that were considered masterpieces of stage art  everything available was pressed into service colored paper odds and ends of ribbon even tin cans and their bright wrappings were treasures to the young actors and all reappeared as splendid properties  at first a store of red curtains some faded brocades and ancient shawls comprised the stage wardrobe but as the fame of the performances spread abroad contributions were made to the little stock and the girls became the proud possessors of a velvet robe a plumed hat adorned with silver long yellow boots and a quantity of mock pearls and tinsel ornaments  such wealth determined them to write a play which should surpass all former efforts give jo a chance to stalk haughtily upon the stage in the magnificent boots and meg to appear in gorgeous train and diadem of jewels  the witchs curse was the result and it was produced with astounding effect quite paralyzing the audience by its splendid gloom jo called it the lurid drama and always considered it her masterpiece but it cost hours of thought and labor for to construct a dungeon a haunted chamber a cavern and a lonely forest taxed to the uttermost the ingenuity of the actors to introduce into one short scene a bandit two cavaliers a witch and a fairy spiritall enacted by two peoplerequired some skill and lightning change of costume to call up the ghostly visions and mysterious voices which should appall the guilty count rodolpho was a task of no small difficulty but inspired by the desire to outshine themselves the children accomplished a play full of revenge jealousy murder and sorcery of all which indeed they knew nothing but the name  hitherto their dramas had been of the most sentimental description given to the portrayal of womans devotion filial affection heroism and selfsacrifice indeed these comic tragedies with their highflown romance and fantastic ideas of love and honor are most characteristic of the young girls whose lives were singularly free from the experiences of many maidens of their age  of the world they knew nothing lovers were ideal beings clothed with all the beauty of their innocent imaginations love was a blissful dream constancy truth courage and virtue quite everyday affairs of life their few novels furnished the romantic element the favorite fairytales gave them material for the supernatural and their strong dramatic taste enabled them to infuse both fire and pathos into their absurd situations  jo revelled in catastrophe and the darker scenes were her delight but she usually required meg to do the lovepart which she considered quite beneath her pen thus their productions were a queer mixture of sentiment and adventure with entire disregard of such matters as grammar history and geographyall of which were deemed of no importance by these aspiring dramatists  from the little stage library still extant the following plays have been selected as fair examples of the work of these children of sixteen and seventeen with some slight changes and omissions they remain as written more than forty years ago by meg and jo so dear to the hearts of many other little women      concord mass 1893                       illustration the theatre of 1848  those concord days were the happiest of my

the back wherein the spirits called up by norna might appear a kitchen kettle filled with steaming water made an effective caldron over which the sorceress should murmur her incantations flaming pineknots cast a lurid glare over the scene and large boughs artfully arranged about the stage gave it the appearance of a gloomy wood  when louis retires within he at once arrays himself in the white robes of the vision and awaits the witchs call to rise behind the aperture in true dramatic style he vanishes quickly resumes his own attire while norna continues to weave her spells till she sees he

to scene fifth  the apparently impossible transformations of this scene when played by two actors only may be thus explained  the costumes of louis and norna being merely loose garments afford opportunities for rapid change and the indulgent audience overlooking such minor matters as boots and wigs it became an easy matter for jo to transform herself into either of the four characters which she assumed on this occasion  beneath the flowing robes of the sorceress jo was fully dressed as count rodolpho laid conveniently near were the black cloak hat and mask of louisalso the white draperies required for the ghostly theresa  thus norna appears in long gray robe to which are attached the hood and elflocks of the witch seeing hugo approach she conceals herself among the trees thus gaining time to don the costume of louis and appear to hugo who awaits him  hugo stabs and drags him from the stage louis then throws off his disguise and becomes rodolpho fully dressed for his entrance a moment later  as hugo does not again appear it is an easy matter to assume the character of the spectre and produce the sights and sounds which terrify the guilty count then slipping on the
