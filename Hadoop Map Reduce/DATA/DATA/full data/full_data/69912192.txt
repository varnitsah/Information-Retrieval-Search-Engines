preface   three young ranchmen relates the adventures of three brothers allen chetwood and paul winthrop who are left to shift for themselves upon a lonely ranch home situated in the mountainous region of the beautiful state of idaho near one of the numerous branches of the salmon river  the lads although sturdy and brave have no easy time making a living and among other troubles they are visited by horse thieves and also by a crafty prospector who wishes to take their claim away from them in the meantime an uncle of the lads has gone off to visit the city and he disappears entirely adding to the complexity of the situation what the boys did to straighten out the trouble is told in the chapters which follow  in writing this story i have tried to give my boy readers a fair idea of life on a ranch of today as well as of life in the wild mountains of idaho with some idea of the ranch hands and miners to be met with in these localities the tale has been drawn as true to nature as possible and i trust its reading will prove both entertaining and useful  captain ralph bonehill     contents   chapter i an unpleasant discovery  chapter ii allen on the trail  chapter iii a

illustrations   horse and youth went plunging headlong  the man caught the end of the gun  vainly he put out his hands to stay his progress  holding the snake he leaped out of the circle of reptiles  the three young ranchmen talked it over     three young ranchmen     chapter i  an unpleasant discovery   when do you think allen will be back paul  he ought to be back by two or three oclock chet his horse was fresh and the roads are very good just now  i hope he brings good news dont you i am tired of waiting here  we will have to content ourselves on the ranch another year i am afraid father left matters in a very unsettled condition and what has become of uncle barnaby the world only knows  i dont care so much about the dullnessi like to hunt and fish and round up the cattle just as well as any onebut what im complaining of is the uncertainty of the way things are going to turn for all we know we may be cast adrift as the saying goes any day  that is true although i imagine our title to the ranch is o k if those title papers hadnt been burned up when one end of the house took fire i wouldnt worry a bit  neither would i but we all know what captain grady isthe meanest man that ever drew the breath of lifeand if he once learns that we havent the papers hell be down on us quicker than a grizzly bear in the spring  well we wont let him know that the papers have been burned up we will continue to bluff him off  we cant bluff him forever to my mind  the boy broke off short and coming to a halt pointed with his disengaged hand toward the barn  did you leave that door unlocked he went on  certainly i didnt who opened it perhaps allen is back  and perhaps there are horse thieves around was the quick reply come on  without a word more the two boys dropped their burdens and started for the structure in which the horse belonging to each had been stabled  the boys were chetwood and paul winthrop two brothers tall wellbuilt and handsome the face of each was browned by exposure and showed the perfect health that only a life in the open can give  chet and paul lived with their elder brother allen at a typical ranch home in idaho on one of the numerous branches of the winding salmon river the home was a rude but comfortable affair with several outbuildings close at hand the whole surrounded by a rude but substantial stockade a relic of the time when troubles with the indians were numerous  it was a warm sunshiny day in august and the two boys had been down to the river fishing at a favorite deep hole near the roots of a clump of cottonwood trees each had a nice mess of fish strung on a brush branch showing that their quest of game had not been a vain one  for three years the three winthrop boys had lived alone at the ranch home their former history was a peculiar one the particulars of which will be given later just now we will follow chet and paul to the barn the door to which stood half open  gone  the single word burst from the lips of both simultaneously it was enough for it told the whole story their two animals jasper and rush had vanished  thieves as sure as fate ejaculated paul gazing rapidly on all sides see how the lock has been broken open  and they have taken all the extra harness as well added chet his black eyes snapping angrily i wonder how long ago this happened  theres no telling chet lets seewe went off about eight oclock didnt we  yes  then the rascals have had nearly four hours in which to do their dirty work by this time they are probably miles away this is the worst luck of all  you are not going to sit down and suck your thumb are you paul questioned the younger brother quickly  not if we can do anything but we are tied fast herewe cant follow on footthey knew that when they came to rob us  have you any idea who the thieves can be  most likely a remnant of that old gang from jordan creek i knew they would spring up again even after sol davids was lynched let us take a look around and see if we cant find some clew to their identity  if only allen would come  fire off your gun if he is in hearing that will hasten his movements  thus directed chet hastened outside and running to the house quickly brought forth his doublebarreled shotgun two reports rent the air a second later and then the youth returned with the still smoking firearm to the barn  have you found anything he asked  here is a strap that doesnt belong to our outfit replied paul but its only a common affair that might belong to any one  and here is a silver cross cried chet as he sprang forward to pick up the object  the article which chet had found embedded in the dirt flooring of the barn was really of silver but so unpolished that it did not shine it was not over an inch in length and height with a round hole directly in the center at the four corners of the cross were the letters d a f g  what do you make of it asked paul impatiently as he bent over to examine the object as it lay in his younger brothers palm  nothing its a silver cross with letters on it thats all i never saw one like it before  is there no name on the back  quickly the cross was turned over there dug into the metal as if with a jackknife were the letters s m  s m said chet slowly who can they stand for  sam somebody i suppose replied paul i reckon there are a good many folks in idaho with the initials s m  that is true too but its not likely many of them are mean enough to turn horse thieves  chet surveyed the cross for a few seconds longer then he rammed it into his pocket and went on with the search and paul followed suit  but their further efforts remained unrewarded not another thing of value was brought to light  they were on the point of giving up when a clatter of hoofs was heard outside on the rocks leading from the trail back to the willows and cottonwoods  there is allen now cried paul joyfully hi allen this way quick he added elevating his voice  all right paul my boy came in a cheery voice from the elder of the winthrops as he dashed up on his faithful mare whats wanted  the horses have been stolen  phew it was a low and significant whistle that allen winthrop emitted and the pleasant look on his fine features gave way to one of deep concern  stolen he said at last when by whom  we dont know replied paul we just got back from the river a few minutes ago and found the barn door broken open and both horses gone  and no clew  we found this  allen winthrop caught up the silver cross quickly and gazed at it for the fraction of a minute then he muttered something under his breath  did you ever see this cross before asked paul  no but i have heard father tell of it was the answer it is the cross the old sol davids gang used to wear do you see those lettersd a f g they stand for dare all for gold that was the gangs motto and they never hesitated to carry it out  then we were right in thinking that the horse thieves might be some leftovers from the old gang observed paul  yes they are most likely of the same old crowd said allen the hanging of old sol did not drive them out of this district  but what of the initials s m asked chet i never heard of any horse thief that those would fit  well find out about that when we run the thieves down said allen you say you discovered the robbery but a short while since  less than a quarter of an hour ago  have you been up to the house  i went for my gun began chet i wonder if it were possible he commenced and then meeting his older brothers eyes stopped short not one of the trio said more just then all made a wild dash from the barn to the house they burst into the living room of the latter like a cyclone  it looks all right began paul  but it isnt all right burst out chet see the side window has been forced open  allen said nothing having passed into one of the sleeping rooms he began to rummage around the apartment into the closet and the trunks  by gracious he burst out presently  whats up questioned his two brothers in a breath  its gone  gone  yes every dollar is gone groaned allen  he referred to three bags which had contained silver and gold to the amount of seven hundred dollarsthe winthrop savings for several years  paul and chet gave a groan something like a lump arose in the throat of the younger youth but he cleared it away with a cough  the mean contemptible scoundrels burst out paul we must get after them somehow  ill go after them replied allen with swift determination give me my rifle i already have my pistol  you are not going alone are you demanded paul  ill have to there is only my mare to be had  its foolhardy allen urged chet what could one fellow do against two or more they would knock you over at the first chance  i wont give them the first chance grimly replied allen as he ran for his rifle as they used to say when father was young ill shoot first and talk afterward  cant two of us ride on the mare asked paul i am not so very heavy  the older brother shook his head  it cant be done paul not with her all tired out after her mornings jaunt no ill go alone perhaps the trail will lead past some other ranch and then ill call on the neighbors for help  can you follow the trail  i reckon i can leastwise i can try i wont lose it unless they take to the rocks and leave the river entirely and it aint likely theyll do that  chet and paul shook their heads to them it seemed dangerous and so it was but it was no use arguing with allen when he had once made up his mind so they let him have his own way  three minutes later allen was off on the trail of the horse thieves     chapter ii  allen on the trail   although allen winthrop was but a young man in years yet the fact that he had had the care of the family on his shoulders since the death of his parents had tended to make him older in experience and give him the courage to face whatever arose before him in the path of duty  he was four years older than chet and two years the senior of paul and the others had always looked upon him as a guiding spirit in all undertakings  consequently but little was said by way of opposition when allen determined to go after the thieves alone but nevertheless the hearts of both the younger brothers were filled with anxiety when they saw allen disappear on the back of his mare up the trail that led to the southwest  its too bad that we cant accompany him was the way chet expressed himself id give all i possess for a good horse just now  all you possess isnt much seeing weve all been cleaned out replied paul with a trace of grim humor he did not really feel but i too wish i had a horse and could go along  still somebody ought to stay on the ranch went on chet we might have more unprofitable visitors  its not likely that the gang will dare to show themselves in this vicinity again in a hurry like as not theyll steer for deadwood sell the horses and then spend their illgotten gains around the gambling saloons that is their usual style they cant content themselves in the mountains or on the plains as long as they have the dust in their pockets  after allen had disappeared the two boys locked up the barn as well as was possible using a wooden pin in lieu of the padlock that had been forced asunder and then went back to the house chet brought in the string of fish and threw them in a big tin basin  i suppose i might as well fry a couple of these he observed though to tell the truth i am not a bit hungry  i too have lost my appetite replied paul but we must eat and dinner will help pass away the time i reckon there is no telling when allen will be back  no i dont care much if he only keeps from getting into serious trouble  in the meantime allen had passed down the trail until the buildings of the ranch were left far behind he knew the way well and had no difficulty in finding the tracksnew onesmade by the hoofs of four horses  as long as they remain as fresh as they are now it will be easy enough to follow them was the mental conclusion which he reached as he urged forward his tired mare in a way that showed his fondness for the animal and his disinclination to make her do more than could fairly be expected  the belt of cottonwood was soon passed and allen emerged upon the bank of a small brook which flowed into the river at a point nearly half a mile further on  he examined the wet bank of the brook minutely and came to the conclusion that here the horse thieves had stopped the animals for a drink  i imagine they came a long distance to get here he thought and that means they will go a long way before they settle down for the night heighho i have a long and difficult search before me  the brook had been forded and allen crossed over likewise and five minutes later reached a bit of rolling land dotted here and there with sage and other brush  allen wondered if the trail would lead to gold fork as the little mining town at the foot of the mountains was called  if they went that way i will have no trouble in getting help to run them down he said to himself i can get ike watson and mat prigley who will go willingly and there is no better man to take hold of this sort of thing than ike watson  mile after mile was passed and the trail remained as plain as before  it looks as if they didnt anticipate being followed was the way allen figured it but he soon found out his mistake when on coming around a rocky spur of ground the trail suddenly vanished  the young ranchman came to a halt in some dismay and a look of perplexity quickly stole over his face he looked to the right and the left and ahead but all to no purpose the trail was gone  heres a state of things he murmured as he continued to gaze around where in the land of goodness has it gone to they couldnt have taken wings and flown away  allen spent all of a quarter of an hour on the rocky spur then on a venture he moved forward over the bare rocks feeling pretty certain that it was the only way they could have gone without leaving tracks behind them  he calculated that he had traveled nearly ten miles his mare showed signs of being tired and he spoke to her more kindly than ever  it wont do lilly he said patting her soft neck affectionately we have got to get through somehow or other you must brace up and when it is all over you can take the best kind of a long resting spell  and the faithful animal laid back her ears and appeared to understand every word he said to her she was a most knowing creature and allen would have gone wild had she been one of those stolen  the barren rocky way lasted for upward of half a mile and came to an end in a slight decline covered with rich grass and more brush allen looked about him eagerly  hurrah there is the trail true enough he cried as the well understood marks in the growth beneath his feet met his gaze that was a lucky chance i took on lilly and well have jasper and rush back before nightfall or know the reason why  away flew the mare once more over the plain that stretched before her for several miles beyond were the mountains covered with a purplish haze  the vicinity of the mountains was gained at last and now more than tired the mare dropped into a walk as the first upward slope was struck  hardly had she done so than allen saw something that made his heart jump it was a man and he was riding chets horse     chapter iii  a dangerous situation   it was not possible for allen winthrop to make any mistake regarding the animal the man on the mountain trail was riding too often had he ridden on rushs back and too well did he know the sturdy little horses characteristics  but the man was a stranger to the young ranchman and he could not even remember having seen the rascals face before  stop called out allen as he struck lilly to urge her on stop do you hear me  the man caught the words and wheeled about quickly he was evidently much disturbed by the encounter he had been looking ahead and had known nothing of allens approach  stop do you hear repeated allen  wot do yer want was the surly response but the speaker did not draw rein in the least  i want you to stop exclaimed allen growing excited that horse belongs to my brother  reckon you air mistaken stranger was the cool reply this air hoss is mine  this unexpected reply staggered allen he had expected the man to either show fight or take to his heels it was plainly evident that the fellow intended if possible to bluff him off  your horse not much whoa rush old boy  commanded by that familiar tongue the horse came to a halt that was so sudden it nearly pitched the rider out of his saddle he muttered something under his breath straightened up and gave the reins a vicious yank that made rush rear up in resentment  see here youngster keep your parley to yourself howled the man scowling at allen  i willafter you get down and turn that nag over to me rejoined allen as coolly as he could although he was in an exceedingly high state of suppressed excitement  and whyfore should i turn him over to you seein as how he belongs to me growled the man as brazenly as he could  you stole that horse from our barn not four hours ago retorted allen i will waste no more words with you get down or take the consequences  as he concluded the youth unslung his rifle in a suggestive manner he had lived out in those wilds long enough to know that to trifle in such a case as this would be sheer foolishness  youre a hotheaded youngster tew say the least was the reply and as he spoke the man scowled more viciously than ever the sight of the ready rifle in allens hands was not at all to his liking he made a movement toward his pistols but a second glance at the youth made him change his mind  i said i would waste no more words with you repeated allen get down  but see here youngster  get down and up came the rifle in a motion that caused the man to start back in terror  there must be a mistake somewhar he said slowly as soon as he could recover my pard turned this critter over to me and i reckoned it war all right  there is where you reckoned wrong are you going to get down now or not  supposin we talk it over with my pard first thar he is now  the man pointed to the trail behind allen his manner was so natural that for the instant the young ranchman was deceived he looked about  with a dash and a clatter the horse thief urged rush on digging his spurs deep into the little horses flesh as he did so he dropped partly under the horses neck thus to shield himself from a chance shot should it be taken  but although astonished and angered at being so easily duped allen did not fire rush was moving along over the rocks too rapidly for him to take the risk of killing his brothers favorite beast besides only a small portion of the rider could be seen at one time  ill follow him until i get a better chance he thought and he cried to lilly to follow in pursuit  once again the gallant mare responded although she was now thoroughly jaded up the rocks they went and around numerous bends the clatter ahead telling plainly that the race was about even for pursued and pursuer  i must be on my guard or that fellow may play me foul thought allen he looks like a most desperate character and he knows well enough what capture by the lawabiding folks of this state means they would lynch him in a minute  allen wondered what had become of the other thieves and the horse jasper surely they could not be far away  perhaps that fellow is trying to reach the others who may have gone on ahead he speculated mentally if he reaches them it will be so much the worse for me for i can never fight two or more among these rocks and bushes on lilly we must run him down at once  but the little mare could be urged no longer she had reached her limit and went forward with a doggedness that was pitiful to behold  in five minutes allen heard the clatter ahead drawing away from him soon it ceased entirely  but he did not give up it was not in his nature to surrender a cause so long as one spark of hope of success remained  the mountain trail now led downward for a few hundred yards and then wound through a rocky pass dark and forbidding allen kept watch on either side for a possible ambush but none presented itself  he has gone on that is certain he thought i rather guess he thinks to tire me out knowing the condition my mare is in but if he thinks that he is mistaken ill follow if i have to do it on foot  at last the trail left the rocky pass and came out upon some shelving rocks overlooking a deep canyon at the bottom of which sparkled the swiftrunning stream here a rude bridge led to the other side a bridge composed of slender trees and roughhewn planks  without hesitation allen rode upon the bridge as he did so a derisive laugh resounded from the other side of the canyon and he saw the man he was after and two others ride into view  then before he could turn back allen felt the bridge sagging beneath him suddenly it parted in the center and horse and youth went plunging headlong toward the waters far beneath     chapter iv  the man in the sink hole   we will now return to the ranch and see how chet and paul were faring during their elder brothers absence  chet took the string of fish and selecting two began to clean them he was used to the work and did it with a dexterity and quickness that could not have been excelled ever since his mother had died it had fallen upon chets young shoulders to do the culinary work about the ranch home  while chet was thus engaged paul busied himself in looking over the shotguns cleaning and oiling them and then loading up  the fish cooked chet set the table putting on three plates although he himself was almost certain allen would not come back in time for the meal  its queer ive been thinking remarked paul during the progress of the meal allen said nothing about the result of his morning trip  he was too excited over the theft of the horses to think of anything else i reckon was the reply chet made it was enough to upset any ones mind  at least he might have said if he had heard from uncle barnaby grumbled paul more particularly as we were just dying to know  i imagine if he had heard he would have said so and left us the letter paul allen knows as well as you or i how anxious we really were  its queer the way uncle barnaby disappeared mused paul as he mashed the potatoes on his plate with a fork one would not think a man could go to san francisco and disappear forever  he might if he went to chinatown and got sandbagged or something like that  oh you dont really think such a thing would happen  it might uncle was a great hand to see the sights and also to make a show of his money and the chinese in san francisco are many of them a bloodthirsty set  do you really believe he discovered the rich mine he talked about  he discovered something that is certain and he had faith enough in it to go to san francisco in the hope of starting a company to develop the claim  it was in this strain that the two boys talked on until long after the meal was finished and while they are conversing let us take a brief glance at their former history  as i have said the three brothers were orphans their parents having died several years before  the ranch had belonged to their father who had willed it to his three sons equally and as none of them were yet of age he had appointed his brother barnaby his executor  barnaby winthrop was an old prospector who had spent a life among the hills prospecting for gold and silver as has been said he was a peculiar man but warm and generous hearted to the last degree  as there was really little to do at the ranch but look after the cattle the uncle had left the place in charge of the three boys and continued month in and month out ranging over the hills and among the mountains in search of the precious metal which lay hidden beneath the surface  one day uncle barnaby had staggered into the house weak and hungry he had made a perilous trip up to a point theretofore considered unattainable he announced that he had at last struck a mining spot that if properly worked would prove a bonanza he refused to state the exact location and announced his intention of going at once to san francisco to organize a company to open up a mine  he started apparently in the best of health and although he had been gone now a number of months and they had been anxiously awaiting his reappearance they had seen or heard nothing of him  during this period the boys had had considerable trouble at home which had occupied their attention at the start some of the cattle had gone astray and it had taken a ten days hunt over the long range to find them then had come captain hank grady who had sought in various ways to get possession of the ranch stating that their father had borrowed money from him and that it had not been paid back the captain was known to be both mean and unscrupulous and all of the boys doubted very much if he spoke the truth but they had expected much more trouble from him before the end was reached and they were destined not to be disappointed captain grady knew the value of the ranch even if the boys did not and he meant to gain possession of it if not by fair means then by foul  well have to take a look for the cattle this afternoon said paul some time after the conversation concerning uncle barnaby came to a close we dont want any of them to get in the sink hole again  thats so well start at once and well see to it that we lock up good laughed chet no more thieves wanted  the house was soon tidied up and then after closing up everything well and setting an alarm to scare away any newcomer chet and paul set out on foot over the rolling land which led from the river  half a mile beyond the rolling land was a nasty bit of spongy soil known as the sink hole not unfrequently the cattle would stray in this direction and more than one had sunk to death in the mire  some cattle around there now cried paul as they drew close to the spot its lucky we came this way  go to the westward of them said chet we can drive them chet broke off short for just then a piercing cry rang in their ears  help help for the sake of heaven help  chet and paul were thrilled to the heart to hear that wild agonizing cry for assistance which rang out so clearly on the afternoon air plainly a human being was in distress and needed immediate assistance  they looked around but for several seconds saw nothing then the cry rang out again more sharply more pitiably than ever  help help save me from death  do you see him demanded paul breathlessly  no i do not rejoined chet but he must be near did not the cry come from over there pointing with his finger to the right  i believe it did come on  paul set off on a run around the edge of the sink hole which was all of several hundred feet in diameter close behind him came chet wondering who the man could be and how they might assist him should he be beyond their reach  two dozen steps brought them in sight of the sufferer he was a young man and his general dress and appearance betokened that he was a stranger in those parts and in fact a stranger to the wilds a city fellow born and bred  save me help cried the man for a third time he was up to his middle in the spongy soil and sinking rapidly  keep up your courage we will assist you shouted paul in return  thank god somebody has heard my cry murmured the man gratefully you must be quick i am sinking rapidly he continued aloud  have you anything in the shape of a rope with you asked paul of chet  i have not  this was a sad predicament as the man was all of three yards from solid ground how to get to him was a question but it was solved by chet as he brought a bit of stout cord from his pocket  tie the two stocks of the guns together he said this way let me show you  he held the two stocks side by side so that they overlapped each other about eight or ten inches the cord was hastily wound about them and tied and it was chet who thrust one of the gun barrels toward the sinking man while he firmly grasped the other  catch hold he said paul help me land him  illustration the man caught the end of the gun  the man caught the end of the gun and paul took hold of chets hand two efforts were made the first time the man letting the gun slip and sinking deeper than ever but the second effort was successful and panting from his unusual exertion the man reached the solid ground and fell exhausted     chapter v  good cause for alarm   it was several minutes before the man who had been rescued from the sink hole could sit up and talk his hat was gone and with a dirty face and tangled muddy hair he presented a sorry spectacle  im very thankful to you for what you have done were his first words accompanied by a look that told plainly he felt what he said i thought i was at the end of my string sure as they say in these parts  i allow thats a bad hole to get into returned chet i wouldnt want to get into it myself  and may i ask to whom am i indebted for my life continued the man  my name is chetwood winthrop and this is my brother paul  i am exceedingly glad to know you boys my name is noel urner and i am from new york i am a stranger in idaho and i know nothing of such treacherous places as thisat least i did not know of them until a short while ago and the man shuddered as the memory of his fearful experience flashed over him  its one of the unpleasant things of the country responded paul with a little laugh but how came you in it with a glance down at the spurs on the mans boots  i see you are looking at my spurs yes i had a horse but he is gone now  gone in the sink hole ejaculated chet  no he was stolen from me  stolen both boys uttered the word simultaneously  yes i was riding along when i came to a spot where i saw some flora which particularly interested me for i am a botanist although for pleasure only i dismounted and tied my horse to a tree and climbed up to secure the specimens which were on a shelf of rock some thirty feet over my head soon i heard a clatter of horses hoofs as they passed along the road i came down with my specimens to see who the riders were but they had already passed on taking my horse with them  the horse thieves cried chet  and he told the man of the raid made on the ranch and how allen had gone off in pursuit of the thieves the reader can well imagine with what interest noel urner listened to the tale  one would not believe it possible he exclaimed when chet had wound up by saying he wished allen would lay every one of the rascals low i fancied horse thievery was a thing only permitted in the wildest portions of the territories  there are horse thieves everywhere said paul every one living for a hundred miles around has suffered during the past ten years sometimes we think them wiped out and then all of a sudden they start up again  well i trust your brother gets your horses back said noel urner its a pity he wont know enough to take mine away from the thieves too  hell collar the thieves and all they have if he gets half a chance you can depend on that said chet but wont you come to our ranch with us you can clean up there and have something to eat if you are hungry  thank you i will go gladly possibly you can sell me a headgear of some sort too  we can fit you out all right enough sir  it did not take the boys long to chase the cattle away from the sink hole and this accomplished they set off for the ranch with noel urner between them  they found the young man an exceedingly bright and pleasant chap he said he had come west two months before and had been spending over a month in san francisco  i came out at the invitation of an old prospector he said we were to meet in san francisco but when i arrived there i could not find my man he belongs somewhere in this neighborhood his name is barnaby winthrop perhaps you have heard of him  heard of him cried chet  he is our uncle added paul  your uncle and now it was noel urners turn to be surprised  yes our uncle and he has been missing for several months continued paul oh tell us what you know of him at once for we are dying to know  the barnaby winthrop i mean had an undeveloped gold and silver mine he wished to open up  it was our uncle beyond the shadow of a doubt said chet our name is winthrop and uncle barnaby is our guardian we can prove it to you by the papers if you wish  i am willing to take your word boys but you understand one must be careful about speaking of mines in this section at least i have been told so  yes we know about that returned paul many a man has lost the chance of his life by advertising his knowledge too broadly others would gain a clew of a mine hunt it up and put in a claim before the original discoverer knew what was up  exactly and that is why i was slow in saying anything but when you ask me to tell you about your uncle i am sorry to say i know but very little although i suspect much now you say he has been missing so long  by this time the little party had reached the ranch house they went inside and despite the fact that the boys were impatient to hear what noel urner might have to say they gave the young man time to wash up and make himself otherwise presentable chet in the meanwhile frying another fish and preparing a pot of coffee  this is just what i wished and no mistake said noel urner as he set to with a hearty good will but i am sure you are impatient to learn something of your uncle so i will not keep you waiting to make my story plain i will have to tell you something of myself also  in the first place i am a broker and speculator from new york city i make a specialty of mining stocks and own shares myself in half a dozen mines  about ten weeks or so ago i heard through a friend in san francisco that barnaby winthrop was trying to form a company to develop a new strike in this vicinity i wrote to him and he sent word back that if i would come on he would prove to me that he had a big thing well worth looking into  i had other business west and so at once started for san francisco your uncle had given his address as the golden nugget house a place i afterward learned was frequented by oldtime miners and prospectors  i made inquiries at the nugget house for your uncle and to my astonishment learned that he had disappeared very mysteriously one night leaving no trace behind him  what cried paul springing to his feet and chet was too astonished to speak  i do not wonder that you are astonished yes he had disappeared leaving his valise and overcoat behind him  i thought the matter so queer that i was on the point of notifying the police but on calling at the post office for letters i received one from him stating that he was sorry but he had come back to the place in question and found it not what he had anticipated so he wouldnt bother me any more  i dont believe he came back ejaculated chet if he had he would have stopped at the ranch  i agree with you  have you that letter asked paul his voice trembling with excitement  i have  i would like to see it please  certainly and noel urner brought forth a large flat pocketbook from which he extracted the communication in question  paul took it to the light and examined it closely  this is a forgery uncle barnaby never wrote it  let me see paul ejaculated chet  he also examined the letter with as much care as his brother had displayed there was not the slightest doubt of it the letter was not genuine  its certainly a bad state of affairs said noel urner it makes the disappearance of your uncle look decidedly bad  it looks like foul play cried paul why should uncle barnaby leave the hotel in that fashion if all was perfectly straight  its like as not some mining town rascals got hold of his secret and then put him out of the way so that they might profit by it said chet there are plenty of fellows mean enough for that  at first i was satisfied by the receipt of the letter continued noel urner but the more i thought over the matter the more i became convinced that something was wrong but in a different way from what you think i imagined your uncle had found other speculators to go in with him and they had persuaded him to cut me off that is why i started off after settling my other business in california to find your uncle and learn the truth i was willing to lose a few weeks time out here looking around even if it didnt pay  we are very glad you came and that we found you answered paul i am sorry for only one thing that allen is not here to meet you  i am in no hurry to continue my journey indeed i do not see how i can without a horse if you wish i will remain here until your brother returns  you are right welcome to do that cried chet as for not having a horse you are no worse off than ourselves for we are without an animal of any kind outside of the cattle  then being equally bad off we ought to make good friends smiled noel urner i shall like staying on a ranch for a few days first rate and you can rely on my giving you all the assistance in my power when it comes to finding out the fate of your uncle  we cant do anything until allen returns sighed paul  then we will hope that your brother returns speedily and with good news  the best news will be his return with all our horses returned chet we can do nothing without our animals  alas how little did both chet and paul dream of the terrible ordeal through which allen was at that moment passing     chapter vi  from one peril to another   i am lost nothing can save me  such was the agonizing thought which rushed into allen winthrops mind as he felt himself plunging madly downward to the glittering waters far beneath him  it must be confessed that the otherwise brave young ranchman was fearfully frightened at the dreadful peril which confronted him he and his faithful mare were going down and certain death seemed inevitable  heaven help me he murmured to himself and shutting his teeth hard clung grimly to the saddle  out of the sunlight into the gloom and mist below descended horse and rider  scarcely two seconds passed and then with a resounding splash the animal and its living burden disappeared beneath the surface of the river and out of the sight of the rascals on the opposite side of the canyon  that settles him cried one of the horse thieves grimly he was a fool to follow us  maybe hell escape ventured a second  wot arfter sech a plunge returned the first speaker sarcastically wall hardly ter my reckonin  they shifted their positions on the brink of the opening but try their best could see nothing more of the young man or the mare  it was now growing darker rapidly and fifteen minutes later satisfied that allen had really taken a fall to his death they continued on their way  and poor allen  down down down sank the mare and her hapless rider until the very bottom of the river was struck  the swiftly flowing tide caught both in its grasp tumbled them over and over and sent them spinning onward allens grasp on the saddle relaxed and as it did so the young man lost consciousness  how long he remained in this state allen never knew when he came to he was lying among brush partly in the water and partly out  he attempted to sit up and in doing so slipped back beyond his depth but the instinct of selfpreservation still remained with him and he made a frantic clutch at the brush and succeeded in pulling himself high and dry upon a grassy bank  here he lay for several minutes exhausted he could not think for his head felt as if it was swimming around in a balloon  at last he began to come to himself and after a bit sat up to gaze about him but all was dark and he could see little or nothing  he remembered the great plunge he had taken and wondered what had become of lilly he called her with all the strength of his enfeebled lungs but received no response  she must have been killed he thought poor lilly but had it not been for the protection her body gave me it is more than likely that my life would have been ended too and he shuddered to think of his narrow escape  it was nearly half an hour before allen felt strong enough to rise up his head felt light and for a while he staggered like an intoxicated man  he knew he was down in the canyon and some distance below where the bridge had been he wondered how he could ascend to the top of the rocks which presented themselves on the two sides  i cant climb up in this darkness he said half aloud i might slip and break my neck i had better walk along and hunt for some natural upward slope  he started off along the river side the top of the canyon towering nearly a hundred feet above his head as he proceeded the opening gradually grew narrower and with this the distance between the rocks and the water decreased until there was hardly room left for allen to walk  i must have made a mistake was the mental conclusion which he arrived at i should have gone up the river instead of down the chances are that i cant go over a hundred feet further if as far  soon allen came to a halt the ground between the wall of the canyon and the water ceased just before him beyond the steep and bare rocks ran directly downward into the stream  that settles it he muttered in great disappointment all this traveling for nothing and its getting night over head too its a shame  allen paused to rest for in his weak condition the walk had tired him greatly then he started to retrace his steps  hardly had he taken a yards advance when his left foot slipped upon a round stone he was thrown over on his side and before he could save himself went plunging headlong into the stream  he essayed by every means in his power to regain the bank but in vain the current of the river was extra strong at this pointthe width of the course having narrowed downand before he could clutch the first thing he was carried to where nothing but the steep and slippery rocks presented themselves  vainly he put out his hands to stay his progress vainly he tried by every means in his power to obtain some sort of hold on the rocks  illustration vainly he put out his hands to stay his progress  and now the surface of the river grew blacker as the rocks on both sides began seemingly to close in over his head  he was almost tempted to cry out for help and took a breath for that purpose but the sound was not uttered what would be the use not a soul would hear him  on and on went the young ranchman the waters growing more cold each instant and the prospects more gloomy he was half tempted to give himself up for lost  it was an easy matter to keep himself on the surface for he was really a good swimmer but now the current was so strong that he could scarcely touch either side of its rocky confines as he was swept along he knew not where allen had never explored this stream and this to him made the immediate future look blacker than ever  if it ends in some sort of a sink hole im a goner sure he thought but i never heard of such a hole up here among the mountains so i wont give up just yet  hardly had the thought occupied his mind when on looking up he saw the last trace of evening fade from sight the river had entered a cavern he was now underground  it may well be imagined with what dismay allen stouthearted as he was viewed the turn of the situation here he was being borne swiftly along on an underground river he knew not where it was a situation calculated to chill the bravest of hearts  all was pitch black around and overhead beneath was the silent and cold water and the only sound that fell upon his ears was the rushing along of the stream  as well as he was able allen put out his hands before him to ward off the shock of a sudden contact of any sort for he did not know but that he might be dashed upon a jagged rock at any instant then he prayed earnestly for deliverance  on and on he swept the stream several times making turns first to one side and then to the other once his hand came brushing up to a series of rocks but before he could grasp them he was hurled onward in an awful blackness  a quarter of an hour went bya time that to the young man seemed like an ageand during that period he surmised that he must have traveled a mile or more  then the current appeared to slacken up and he had a feeling come over him as if the space overhead had become larger  this must be an underground lake he thought now if iah bottom  his thought came to a sudden termination for his feet had touched upon a sloping rock but a few feet below the surface of the stream the rock sloped to his right and moving in that direction allen to his great joy soon emerged upon a stony shore  he took several cautious steps in as many different directions and felt nothing he was truly high and dry at last  this fact was a cheering one but there was still a dismal enough outlook where was he and how would he ever be able to gain the outer world once more     chapter vii  the cave in the mountain   allen was too exhausted to do more than move about cautiously he felt for the edge of the stream and then moved away from it for several yards  his hand came in contact with a dried bush and several sticks of wood all of which had probably floated in at one time on the stream and these at once made him think of a fire what a relief a bit of light would be  in his life on the long range allen had found a watertight matchbox very useful he felt in his pocket and found the article still safe he opened it with fingers that trembled a little but the matches were still dry and in a trice one was struck and lit  he held the match under some of the driest of the brush and had the satisfaction of seeing it blaze up he piled the stuff up and on top placed several heavy sticks soon he had a fire which blazed merrily  the light illumined the cavern casting a ruddy glare on the rocks and the rippling water it was a weird and uncanny scene and he shivered involuntarily he would have given a good deal to have been in the outer world once more  allen saw that the river had simply widened at the spot and that a hundred yards further on it flowed into a narrow channel as before only on the side which he occupied was there anything in the shape of a shore opposite the rocks stood straight up and were covered with moss and slime  if i am to get out it must be from this shore upward allen thought as he surveyed the situation i can never get back on the river one could never row even a boat against that current  the shore was not more than thirty or forty feet wide it was backed up by rocks but allen was glad to see that they did not present an unbroken surface there were numerous fissures and in one place the opening was a dozen feet in width  selecting the brightest of the firebrands allen left the vicinity of the stream and started to explore this opening he was in great hopes that it would lead upward and that he would thus be enabled to climb out of his prisonfor to him that damp dark place was nothing less  the opening was filled with loose stones and allen had to be careful for fear of spraining an ankle or worse he moved along slowly halting every few steps to survey the scene ahead  twenty yards distant from the entrance to the fissure allen came to a turn to the left here was a narrow opening just large enough for him to pass through beyond was another cavernlike spot not over ten yards in width and height and of interminable length  fearful of losing his way allen hesitated about advancing but presently he plucked up courage and holding down his firebrand he allowed it to burn up again and then proceeded along the chamber  the flooring was uneven and covered with loose rocks and stones huge stalactites hung down from overhead and in several spots the moisture dripped down with weird hollow sounds  i would like to know how far underground i really am was allens earnest mental speculation as he came to a halt beside a tiny stream which flowed from one side of the cavern to the other if there was only some slope which led upward it would be more encouraging but its about as flat as a bit of prairie land  allen hopped over the stream and assured that he could easily retrace his steps if necessary continued on his search his firebrand held over his head  it was a discouraging journey when the end was reached before him arose a solid wall not less than twenty feet in height at which elevation the cavern appeared to continue allen gazed up at the wall with a hopeless look on his face  humph how in the name of creation am i to climb up there he muttered its as steep as the side of a house and twice as slippery if i cant find some sort of stepping places i reckon im beaten and booked to go back to where i started from  waving the firebrand to make it burn the brighter allen began to scrutinize the face of the wall before him he started at one end resolved that not a foot of the surface should escape him  he had traveled along some fifteen feet when he came to something that made him start back in astonishment  great caesar  before him were a number of letters cut in smooth rock which was apparently quite soft the letters read  barnaby winthrops mine  allen stared at the letters on the rock as if he had not spelled out the words aright but there was no mistake they really read barnaby winthrops mine  well if this isnt the most wonderful discovery ever made ejaculated the young man finally so this is the place that uncle barnaby talked of as being the richest claim in idaho i wonder how he ever found it  while allen stood close to the rocky wall he reached the conclusion that his uncle must have come there by the river but whether a voluntary or involuntary passenger he could not decide he knew uncle barnaby was exceedingly fearless but was there any human being who would take the awful risk of a journey on that underground river not knowing to where it led  he must have been caught just as i was said allen to himself at last and that being so the question is how did he manage after he was once here to get out  while allen was debating this question he cast his eyes about for some means of scaling the wall he walked along its face until the very end was reached and there to his joy discovered a dozen rudely cut niches some of them were close together and others nearly a yard apart but with the end of the firebrand between his teeth he had no great difficulty in pulling himself up to the level of the flooring of the cavern above  allen now found himself in an opening not over fifty yards square the roofing was hardly out of reach and the young man saw at a glance that the quartz rock was full of virgin gold and silver it was a veritable bonanza  a million dollars or more he cried enthusiastically uncle barnaby struck it rich for once i wonder why he dont come back and begin operations its queer i didnt get word from him  allen could not help but spend some time in looking around so fascinating was the sight of the precious metal as it shimmered here and there in the ruddy glare of the torch his uncle would be rich indeed and he knew that he and his brothers would not be forgotten by their generous guardian  but soon the thought of escape came back to him was there an opening to the outer world or was he entombed alive  at the far end of the chamber after a long search allen came to a narrow passageway which he was compelled to enter on hands and knees it led upward and he had great hopes that ere long he would emerge into the outer air once more  but he was doomed to disappointment the passageway led around numerous curves and long before the end was reached his torch went out and he was left in total darkness he crawled on and on until finally he brought up against a solid wall  much frightened he lit a match to survey the situation saving in his rear the rocks arose on all sides but overhead was open and up he went very much as a sweep might climb a halfchoked up chimney up through weeds and brush and dirt  he was half smothered by the dust which filled his nose and mouth and he was forced to keep his eyes closed for fear of being blinded  at last after he was nearly ready to give up in despair he felt a breath of cooling air blow over him this was encouraging and he commenced to climb harder than ever up and up he went until suddenly opening his eyes he found himself at the top of the hole and looking almost directly into the face of the rising sun     chapter viii  into a snakes nest   all night underground murmured allen to himself as he surveyed the scene before him in intense surprise heaven be thanked for my escape  his climb had so exhausted him that for a long while he sat on the ground unable to move he felt both cold and hungry but paid no heed it was blessing enough for the time being to be safe  when he felt stronger he began to speculate upon where he was and how far he would have to travel to reach the ranch the face of the country looked new and strange to him  i must mark this spot so i can find the mine again he thought uncle barnaby may not know of this opening  close at hand was a tall tree and upon this allen cut his initials in large letters then he walked to all the trees in the vicinity and cut hands on them pointing to the first tree  now i reckon its all right he said to himself and the next best thing is to strike out for home  climbing the tree allen took his bearings as well as he was able and then struck off as rapidly as his tired legs and sore feet would permit  he had covered perhaps half a mile when he came to a steep decline he tried to proceed down this with care but slipped and rolled with a crash through the brush to the bottom  it was a bad fall and hurt him not a little but that was not the worst of it  the passage through the brush aroused half a score of snakes some small and others a yard and over in length and now they came after him hissing angrily and several preparing to dart at him  it was small wonder that allen gave a yell he knew the reptiles were many of them poisonous and he had not the first thing with which to defend himself he leaped back to retreat but only to find himself surrounded  no one who has never been surrounded by snakes can realize the terrible feeling which awakens in ones breast at such an experience it is a feeling that once realized is never forgotten allen said afterward he felt as if his hair had lifted from his head and his heart had had a bath in ice water  great scott were the words which escaped from his lips this is the worst yet  he had no time to say more for at that moment one of the snakes leaped through the air directly for his hand he threw his hand up caught the reptile by the tail and flung it hissing among its fellows  then he essayed to leap over those in front of him but before he could do so one wound itself around the instep of his boot it was a poisonous snake allen saw that at a glance he tried to kick it off but missed it  then out darted the terrible fang and up came that ugly head with diamondlike eyes toward the young mans knee  for one brief second allen fancied his last hour on earth had come a single bite from that snake and all would be over for it would be all out of the question to get rid of the poison  but with a strength and courage born of despair he bent down and reaching out caught the reptile around the neck the bright eyes almost paralyzed his nerve and he was compelled to turn from them in order to accomplish his purpose  holding the snake with a grasp of iron he leaped out of the circle of reptiles then he bent down and forcing the snakes head against a rock ground it to pieces under his heel  illustration holding the snake he leaped out of the circle of reptiles  it was a highly dangerous bit of work and when it was over the great beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead to him it was as if the last few seconds had been an age  the other snakes had not followed him but nevertheless he lost no time in leaving the spot on a run five minutes later he was nearly a quarter of a mile from the vicinity  he had gone at right angles to the course he imagined would take him back to the ranch and now he found he must make a detour around a hill covered with cactus and other prickly plants  by this time allen was thoroughly worn out and hungry to the last degree bitterly he regretted the loss of his favorite mare lilly  if i had her i imagine i could strike home inside of a couple of hours he said to himself but on foot it will take me until noon or longer  but there was no use to grumble and after resting a spell the young man again started on his weary tramp through thicket and brush over hills and through hollows more than once he stumbled and fell and it was all he could do at times to regain his feet  its no fun to be afoot on the long range he soliloquized a mile seems three times as long as when on horseback  but there was no help for it he must go on and on he went his feet now so sore in his wet boots that he could hardly take a regular step  as he proceeded he looked about for something to eat but outside of a few halfgreen berries found nothing birds were numerous but without firearms they were out of his reach  a less experienced person than allen would have been much frightened by the solitude and loneliness but the young ranchman was accustomed to being out alone for days at a time and he did not mind it he wished to get home more for bodily comforts than aught else  at last when allen was beginning to congratulate himself that the roughest portion of the journey would soon be over he came face to face with a most unexpected difficulty emerging from a thicket he found himself at the very brink of a gully all of ten feet wide and of great depth  humph he muttered as he came to a halt i cant jump that how am i to get over  this question was not easy to answer  looking up and down the opening no bridge either natural or artificial was presented to view  ill have to cut a pole and use that he thought there is no use to tramp up and down looking for a spot to cross  his pocketknife was still safe and he drew it out and went to work with a will on a sapling growing some distance from the gullys edge  the sapling had just been laid low and allen was on the point of dragging it away when sounds broke upon his ear that filled him with surprise he heard human voices and one of them was that of a man he had encountered on the road the fellow who had been riding chets horse  i reckon you have missed the road saul said the man in a disgusted tone  no i aint missed nuthin was the reply so dont you go for to croak so much darry  well we dont appear to be makin much headway growled the fellow addressed as darry  well come out all right never fear its this yere blamed gully bothers me we might git over afoot but we cant cross it on the hosses  allen crouched back behind a bush and a moment later the two men appeared in the opening near the gully the fellow called darry still rode chets horse while he addressed as saul was astride of pauls animal behind the pair came a tall negro riding a mustang and leading two others little animals looking much the worse for constant and hard usage  dis yere ditch doan seem ter git no narrower nohow said the colored man with a goodnatured grin i dun racken we might as well build a bridge an done with it  by the boots but i reckon jeff is about half right cried darry this split may last clear across the hill  its not so easy to build a bridge grumbled he called saul who appeared to be the leader of the trio we aint got no axes  well i move we take a rest anyway said darry im tired of riding a strange hoss over these yere hills  all right well lay off and have a bite of the stuff in jeffs haversack replied the leader of the crowd  they dismounted not over two rods from where allen lay hidden in the brush hardly daring to breathe being unarmed and knowing the temper of the rascals only too well the young man kept himself covered and made not the slightest sound  the negro brought forth an old army haversack and from it produced some crackers jerked meat and several other articles soon the trio were eating voraciously  the horses had been tied to several trees in the vicinity and while the men were eating and talking in low tones allen conceived the idea of gaining possession of one of the animals and riding off with it he knew it would do no good to confront the thieves unarmed  ill get on pauls horse he thought and if i can ill take chets animal with me then ill have their horses back even if i wont have my own  watching for a chance when the backs of the men were turned allen crept from his cover and wormed his way toward pauls horse his knife was in his hand and noiselessly he cut the halter another cut and chets animal was also free  the horses stamped as they recognized allen who always made pets of all in the stable then jasper let out a loud neigh of welcome  the sound reached the ears of the leader of the horse thieves he sprang to his feet and a second later allen was discovered     chapter ix  a visitor at the ranch   let us once more go back to the ranch where chet and paul as well as the newcomer noel urner anxiously awaited allens return  the night had been a long one to the two boys neither of whom had slept a whole hour at a time as chet expressed it they felt it in their bones that something was wrong  at daybreak both rushed up to the roof of the ranch house and with a field glass which mr winthrop had left them scanned eagerly in all directions  not a man or horse in sight said chet in deep disappointment the chase must have been a long one indeed  like as not allen has gone on to some town rejoined paul but he ought to be back by noon he knows we will be anxious to hear how he made out  the two went below to meet noel who had just finished dressing they set to work and a smoking hot breakfast was soon on the table  well i see nothing for me to do but to calmly wait for your brothers return said the young man from new york i dont want to start out anywhere on foot especially as i know nothing of the roads  yes dont go anywhere till allen gets back said paul i want you to tell him yourself all you know concerning uncle barnaby  the morning dragged by slowly and at the passage of each hour the boys grew more anxious  its a dangerous proceeding this chasing horse thieves explained chet to noel urner a fellow is apt to get shot unless he is careful that is what worries us so  unless something turns up right after dinner im going off on foot with my rifle put in paul i may not discover anything but it will ease my mind trying to do something  it lacked half an hour of noon when the boys heard a cheery voice from the road hail them they looked out and beheld ike watson the hunter from gold fork resting in the saddle just outside of the semistockade  whoop hullo thar cried the old fellow who was hearty in both mind and body and full of fun wots the meanin o two healthy boys abummin around the ranch sech an allfired fine day as this yere  o ike im so glad you happened along cried paul as he ran out to meet him we were hoping some friend would come  thet so ike watsons face grew sober on the instant wots the trouble  our horses have been stolen  gee shoo hoss thieves agin wall ill be eternally blowed exclaimed ike watson in a rage who be they paul  we dont know allen has gone after them  how many animiles did they git  only twothat is herechets and mine but they also stole the horse belonging to this gentleman mr noel urner mr urner this is our friend ike watson  hoss thieves is worse n pizen growled watson as he sprang down and gave noel urner a hearty shake of the hand thar ought ter be a law to hang every one o em say i  allen went off yesterday afternoon and as we have not heard from him since we are getting anxious put in chet we would have followed but we havent a single beast left in the barn  i see which way did the thieves go  allen took the trail over the brook replied paul  humph ike watson scratched his head for a moment wots ter prevent me goin after him boys  will you asked paul eagerly  sartin i aint got nuthin ter do an if i had i reckon i could drop it putty quick ter do a favor fer granville winthrops orphans give me a bite ter eat an ill be off ter onct  are you sufficiently armed questioned noel urner  armed well i reckon and from his belt ike watson produced an old 49 horse pistol nearly two feet long thet airs my best friend barrin the rifle  chet soon had dinner for the hunter which was as quickly devoured and then after receiving some of the particulars of the case on hand ike watson started off  youll hear from me before another sun smiles on ye he called back an dont ye worry too much in the between time and he then disappeared  the boys felt much more comfortable after watson had started off to hunt up allen they knew the old man would do all in his power to help their elder brother no matter in what difficulty he might find him  a rather odd character truly observed noel as they again passed into the house  yes but with a heart of steel and gold returned chet idaho does not contain a braver or better hunter than old ike watson  shortly after this chet and paul went out to care for the cattle about the place for quite a few head had already been penned up ready for the early fall drive the ranch did not boast of many cattle and such as there was they desired to keep in the best possible condition  noel urner accompanied them and was much interested in all to be seen and what was done  such a difference between life out here and in the city he remarked actually it is like another world  youre right there replied paul and when you size it up all around its hard to tell which is the bestproviding of course you can get a comfortable living at either place  just as the three were walking back to the ranch the sounds of a horses hoofs broke upon their ears  can it be allen burst out chet but then his face fell no its not his style of riding  oh pshaw whispered paul a second later if it isnt captain grady  and who is he queried noel  an old prospector who wants to get possession of this ranch he claims that our title to it is defective or not good at all i wonder what he wants now  perhaps hes got more evidence to prove his claim to the place groaned chet oh dear troubles never come singly true enough  with anxious hearts the two brothers walked forward to meet the new arrival whose face bore a look of insolence and selfsatisfaction  captain hank grady was a tall evillooking man of forty years of age his title was merely one of favor for he had neither served in the army nor the navy but little was known of his past by the people of the section and he never took the pains to enlighten those who were curious enough to know  for years he had wanted the big bear ranch as the winthrop homestead was called for neither by fair means nor foul had he heretofore been able to obtain possession of the property but now he had been working in secret for a long while and he came prepared to make an announcement that was designed to trouble the boys not a little  hullo there young fellers he called out roughly as he dismounted i reckon you didnt expect to see me quite so soon again did you  we did not rejoined paul coldly  well i confess i fixed matters up quicker than i first calculated to do went on the captain i thought i was going to have a good bit more trouble to establish my claim  as far as i know you have no claim here to establish put in chet sharply you may pretend  see here i aint talking to you retorted captain grady cutting him short your big brother is the feller i want to seehim or barnaby winthrop  both of them are away replied paul and chet and i are running the ranch just now  and if you do not like my manner of speech you need not stay here cried chet warmly his temper rising at the newcomers aggressive manner  ho you young savage dont you speak that way to me roared captain grady i didnt come here to deal with a kid  i may be young but i have my rights here just the same retorted chet  my brother is right added paul if you wish to talk business you must do so with both of us  the captain growled out something under his breath he was about to speak when he caught sight of noel urner  he started back as though a ghost had confronted him and the words died on his lips the young man from new york saw the action but could not in the least account for it     chapter x  the captains setback   captain grady recovered in a few seconds he glanced suspiciously about to see if there were others with noel seeing the young man was alone he plucked up fresh courage  all right ill talk business with both he said who is this and he jerked his thumb toward noel  a friend of ours from new york replied paul  humph didnt know you had friends so far off  we dont know everything in this world retorted chet pointedly  youre right we dont replied the captain with equal emphasis  he tied his horse fast to the doorpost and strode into the house paul motioned chet to follow and then buttonholed noel urner  this is captain grady he whispered we have told you a little about him he is trying to get this ranch away from us  and he has no real claim to it  i do not believe he has but he is so slippery a customer he will swindle us if he can will you give us some advice how best to proceed you know more about claims and legal papers than we do  certainly ill do what i can for you and then both entered the ranch home  im sorry i aint got your older brother to deal with began the captain i reckon he is the one who will understand my talk best  then perhaps you had best wait till he gets back said chet quickly  and when will that be  i cannot say exactly  im not in the humor to wait ive waited too long already the captain paused and cleared his throat i believe you said you had the original title papers to the ranch didnt you he went on  yes we did say that  i would like to see em  chet and paul looked at each other they had expected and dreaded this request  supposing we dont care to show them to you said paul cautiously  whats the reason you dont care retorted the captain angrily  we are not called on to explain all our actions to you said chet  see here i dont want to quarrel but im agoin to see them ere papers blustered captain grady with a decided shake of his head i came all the way from deadwood to see em  well you wont see them returned paul boldly it would never do in the wide world to acknowledge that they had been burned up  well then i reckon im free to speak whats on my mind roared the captain an that is that you never had no papers at all  you can say what you please said chet as calmly as he could  an that aint all ive got to say went on the captain ive got more to say to you this ere claim o land originally belonged to sam slater o deadwood  we know that  slater died an left no will  that may all be true too  an he left this land  no he didnt it was sold to my father before that cried paul  no such thing old slater left it as part o his estate  he did not  he did an i can take my affidavy to it if its necessary exclaimed captain grady but that aint all yet wot i hev got to tell slater left it to his heirs an i bought it from them only last week  it cant be true gasped chet faintly  it is true an i hev the papers to prove it this here ranch belongs to me an the sooner you boys pack up your duds an git out the better it will please me and captain grady smiled maliciously at the blow his news had brought to the boys  both paul and chet were much dismayed by the unexpected announcement captain grady had made  for the moment they stared at the speaker as if they had not heard aright  it was paul who spoke first  you bought the ranch and have the papers to prove it he gasped  thats just wot i said boy  your claim will not hold water put in chet faintly  well i reckon it will retorted captain grady i allow as how i know wot im adoin  my father bought this ranch and that settles it said paul we will not give up our rights here just on what you say  perhaps you had better look at his papers suggested noel urner who had thus far remained silent  it wont be necessary for them to look at em returned the captain doggedly i have em and thats enough i aint got to show my papers no more than they hev got to show theirs  what shall we do whispered paul to the young man from new york as he led him a little to one side  stick to your resolve to stand up for your rights was noels reply remember possession is nine points of the law he cannot dispossess you unless he starts a lawsuit to recover the property he claims  i aint agoin to wait for your uncle barnaby or allen to return went on captain grady sullenly i want you to leave at once bag and baggage  indeed returned paul coldly  yes indeed ive been kept out of this place long enoughseeing as how the original owner gave me a half hold on it long before he died  what makes you so anxious for the place asked noel urner with sudden interest  thats my business growled the captain  is there any concealed wealth upon it  no there aint exclaimed captain grady almost so quick that it did not sound natural  you seem to be awfully anxious  i own the next ranch thats why i want to turn my cattle an sech in the two besides that it aint natural for a man to stand by an see others ausin of his things  you talk very positively captain grady said paul but it will do you no good we shall not budge for the present  you wont  not a step we claim this property and you will have to get the law to put us out if we are to be put out  you young highflyers growled the captain he had a dread of the law and would do anything to keep out of court do you think ill stand sech talk  you will have to stand it put in chet i agree with paul we wont budge until the sheriff or a constable puts us out  for the moment captain grady was speechless his face grew dark with gathering wrath and he looked as if he wanted to eat some one up  you wont budge hey he roared at last  no  ill put ye out  i dont think you will retorted paul  not without a big fight added chet  the boys have a right to stay here until put out said noel urner the property is in dispute and the only way to settle the matter is by going to law  i didnt ask for your advice growled the captain fiercely i own this ranch an im agoin to have it an putty quick too  and without another word he turned on his heel strode out of the house sprang on his horse and rode away at top speed  phew but isnt he mad exclaimed chet as the rider disappeared up the river trail  you bet returned paul dropping into a bit of slang but he can stay mad as long as he pleases he cant bulldoze us  he is not so sure of his rights as he pretends to be remarked noel urner who in the course of his city life had met many men similar to captain grady if he knew all was right he wouldnt bluster so much  thats my idea of it too rejoined chet i am half inclined to think he never bought the landthat is paid for what he supposed was a title to itfor he couldnt really buy it except it was sold by uncle barnaby  well by the time he pays another visit your brother will be back most likely it is a pity that your uncle should just now be missing  the afternoon wore away and anxiously the two boys awaited the coming of allen several times they went up to the roof of the house and swept all points of the compass with their field glass  at last the shades of night began to fall and with heavy hearts the two began the round of evening work feeding the chickens and pigs and seeing that everything was secure for the night there were also a couple of cows to milk and a dozen or more of eggs to gather  noel urner went around with them as before and he was greatly interested when they returned to the house he began to question them as to the extent of the ranch  oh its pretty big replied paul it runs up and down the river nearly half a mile and as far back as what we call the second foothills if we had horses i could ride you around and show you  are there any mines in the foothills was the young mans next question  there used to be a few but they have all been abandoned because they did not pay  perhaps this captain grady has struck something that will pay  hardly my father and uncle barnaby went over every foot of the ground half a dozen times and they were both better prospectors than the captain  noel urner was about to ask more questions but a sound outside of the stockade caused him to pause they all listened and then chet gave a shout  somebody is coming it must be allen or ike watson come on out and see     chapter xi  ike watsons arrival   let us go back to allen  we left him just as the sound made by pauls horse aroused the leader of the horse thieves whose full name was saul mangle  the feller that went over into the river as sure as fate burst from the lips of mangle and he started back in astonishment  impossible cried darry the second man that feller must have been killed  see for yourself  with these words saul mangle sprang forward to stop allen who was about to mount jasper he reached the young mans side as allen gained the saddle  come down out of that he cried roughly  not much returned the young man clear the track unless you want to be run down  he urged the horse forward jasper started but ere he had taken three steps mangle caught him by the bridle  whoa he cried whoa i say  let the horse go do you hear ejaculated allen sharply  i wont do it darry jeff come here why dont you  the others leaped into the brush allen saw that affairs were turning against him he leaned forward to jaspers neck  smack mangle caught a sharp blow full across his mouth it came so quickly that he staggered back and his hold was loosened  on jasper on my boy cried allen slapping the animal with his palm come rush come rush he added to chets horse which stood close beside  off went jasper with a bound and rush followed at his heels  stop him hang the measly luck roared saul mangle darry jeff what are you at  as he cried out the leader of the horse thieves felt for his pistol but before the weapon could be drawn both horses and allen had disappeared behind a clump of cottonwoods  we had bettah follow him on de mustangs suggested the negro he cant ride  of course well follow him growled mangle dont stand and talk about it come on hell be out of hearing in another minute this is the worst luck yet  he leaped for one of the mustangs in another second all three of the men were mounted and riding after allen as rapidly as the nature of the land and growth would allow  how do you think he escaped asked darry as they pushed on  cant make it out replied mangle well make him tell the story when we catch him ha what was that  a sudden crash ahead had arrested their attention he listened a dead silence followed  the hosses and young feller have gone into some sort of a hole cried darry well have him now all right enough  on they went through the brush mangle leading the way suddenly the leader came to a halt before him was a sheer descent of eight or ten feet  heres where he and the hosses went down he said to his followers  but where is he questioned darry  not far off ill warrant ye come on  dis yere mustang wont take dat leap put in jeff drawing back  and i wont venture it added darry i dont want to land on my head  cowards howled saul mangle well then there is a trail to the right take that here goes  he spoke to his animal and an instant later rider and mustang went down in a graceful curve they landed in a bunch of brush none the worse for the leap  darry and jeff followed by way of the trail they could hear allen pushing through the brush not over a hundred yards ahead  the young man was having a hard time of it he was going it blindly and was so faint from want of sleep and something to eat that he could hardly sit up in the saddle  yet he realized his peril and clung on desperately meanwhile urging the horse and his mate to do their best to place distance between them and their pursuers  but now the slight trail he was pursuing became rougher and it was with difficulty that any progress could be made the horses labored along bravely but were no match on such ground for the nimblefooted mustangs  halt do you hear were the first unpleasant words which greeted allens ears and looking back he saw that saul mangle was in plain sight  allen attempted to dodge out of sight to frighten him mangle fired off his pistol the bullet cutting through the brush under jaspers feet  will you stop now yelled mangle  allen was in a quandary he did not wish to be shot and yet  but the young man was not called on to solve the dreadful question while he hesitated there was a loud shout from some distance to his right and looking up the rocks he saw to his great joy ike watson the hunter sitting astride of his horse rifle in hand  wall wall shouted the old man and whats the row allen i want to know  horse thieves ike save me was the quick reply there are three of them after me  saul mangle as im a nateral born sinner and darry nodley and jeff jones wall wall wall turn about before it is too late ye sarpints  the loud cry from ike watson caused the gang of horse thieves to come to a sudden halt every one of them knew old ike watson only too wellknew him for a man of quaint humor but with a sense of justice that no one dared to question  hang the measly luck muttered saul mangle theres ike watson  then the jigs up for the present and we had better vamoose returned nodley  clar out do ye hear me yelled ike watson to the crowd of three dont wait for me to git riled up  come on whispered saul mangle with a scowl and like magic the trio of villains turned about and disappeared down a side trail leaving poor exhausted allen safe in friendly hands at last  by the grasshoppers of kansas but ye look fagged out allen exclaimed old ike watson as he sprang down and caught allen in his arms whats the matter with ye boy  ive had an awful experience ike replied the young ranchman as soon as he could recover sufficiently to speak ive been underground several miles and i havent had a mouthful to eat since yesterday morning  gee shoo allen wall wall wall if i didnt know ye so well id be apt ter think ye war tellin me a fairy tale but i allow as how granville winthrops son couldnt lie if he tried  i speak the truth ike but where are those villains  gone boy gone they knowed better nor to stay whar ike watson was ho ho  they are horse thieves and ought to be locked up  thet saul mangle ought to be strung up ye mean and darry nodley and that coon jeff jones aint much better but they are gone now  well i have pauls horse and chets too anyway returned allen with a slight smile of satisfaction  whars your own horse  dead i reckon we went off the upas pass bridge together into the river and i suppose she was drowned poor lilly  off the bridge gee shoo then ye war carried down the black rock river  yes allen gave a shudder it was fearful ike but come let us get to the ranch and i can tell my story to all at once  thats the best way sure but down that air stream great snakes and turkey buzzards  i know it hardly can be believed but that is not the worst or most wonderful part of it but come i am nearly famished  heres a bite i have in my pouch eat that returned ike watson and he passed over some crackers and meat which allen devoured with keen relish     chapter xii  the boys talk it over   allen and ike watson were soon on the way back to the ranch fortunately ike watson knew every foot of the ground and led by the most direct route  as the reader knows paul and chet heard them approaching and received their elder brother with open arms  you look like a ghost declared chet starting back on catching sight of allens pale face  and i feel like a shadow responded allen with a weary laugh but a good dinner and a nap will make me as bright as a dollar again  he has our horses cried paul  yes but not my own returned allen  he walked into the house and was here introduced to noel urner the table was at once spread and soon both allen and ike watson were regaling themselves to their hearts content  during the progress of the meal allen related all of his wonderful story of the fall from the bridge the journey on the underground river and of his struggle to reach the open air once more he said nothing about the wealth which lay exposed in the cavern or of the fact that it was uncle barnabys mine for he felt he had no right to mention those matters before ike watson and noel urner friends though they might be uncle barnaby had guarded his secret well and he would do the same  all listened with deep interest to what he had to say  it was a wonder the fall into the water didnt kill you said paul such a distance as it was  lilly saved my lifebut it cost her her own returned allen and he sighed for lilly had been his favorite for several years  chet and paul were eager that allen should hear noel urners story and the young man from new york related it without delay allen was as much surprised as his brothers had been and so was ike watson  illustration the three young ranchmen talked it over  i am afraid somebody has played uncle barnaby foul cried allen his face full of anxiety if he had left of his own accord we would have heard from him  thats just my idea of it said paul but the thing of it is who met him in san francisco and what did they do  to that question allen could only shake his head  i am too tired to say much about it tonight he said at last i must sleep on it  allen wished to retire early but before he did so chet told him of captain gradys visit  we wont stir said allen briefly let him sue uncle barnaby we have nothing to do with it our first duty is to find uncle  and both paul and chet agreed with him on this point  ike watson was on his way up the salmon river to visit a new gold diggings he refused to stay all night and set off in the dark with allens thanks ringing in his ears for what he had done  despite the excitement through which he had passed allen slept like a log that night and did not awaken until long after the others were up and chet and paul had the morning chores done  now i feel like myself once more he said when he came down and i am ready for business  so am i laughed noel urner but the trouble is i do not know how to turn without horse or conveyance i am not used to tramping about on foot  if we had horses we might lend you one said allen but two nags for four people are two short and he laughed  during the morning paul went out on horseback accompanied by noel to see if the cattle were safe while they were gone allen told chet of the hidden mine  it is worth a million he said but it is uncle barnabys secret remember  i will remember said chet but we must tell paul  certainly tell him after i am gone  gone why allen what do you mean  i am going to leave home this afternoon chet  you are fooling remarked the younger brother  never more serious in my life chet  and you are going chet hesitated  direct to san francisco to hunt up tidings of uncle barnaby  of course chet was taken completely back by allens announcement  to san francisco he ejaculated  yes chet i feel that it is my duty to discover what has become of uncle if possible at once  i know but its such a journey  i am not afraid to take it i will ride to the nearest station on the railroad which is not over a hundred and forty miles and then take the train the journey on the cars will not take over a couple of days all told  and the cost  i will have to take what we have saved from the thieves but surely chet you do not regret taking that for such a purpose  no no take it all i was thinking if it would be enough  i will make it do i will buy a cutrate ticket from ogden if i can  and what shall paul and i do in the meantime questioned chet in some dismay  do nothing but guard the cattle and the place generally i will be back or let you hear from me just as soon as i can  paul was equally astonished at allens sudden determination it was however what noel urner had expected  yes i would go if i were you said the latter and if you want me to i will go with you he added i must confess i am deeply interested in this strange case  i would like you to go with me first rate returned allen and whether uncle is found or not i will promise that you shall be well paid for all the trouble you will be put to  i want no pay for helping you i will enjoy the bit of detective work as one might call it but how am i to get to the railroad station without a horse  you can take both horses if necessary suggested chet  thats so although we ought to have at least one animal on the ranch added paul  we can both ride one animal as far as dotterys ranch said allen and there we can either borrow or hire another animal  how far is dotterys  only about twentyfive miles we ought to reach it by dark if we start shortly  we can start at once as far as i am concerned laughed noel  so it was decided to lose no time and chet at once set to work to prepare dinner and also some food to be carried along     chapter xiii  caught in a cyclone   less than an hour later jasper was brought out and noel urner sprang into the saddle with allen behind him on the blanket  keep a close watch for more thieves while i am gone cried allen  we will shouted paul and you take care for more doctored bridges  a parting wave of the hand and the ranch was left behind and allen was off on a journey that was to be filled with adventures and excitement from start to finish  chet and paul watched the horse and his two riders out of sight and then with rather heavy hearts returned to the house the place seemed more lonely than ever with both allen and noel urner gone  its going to be a long time waiting for allens return sighed paul  perhaps not returned chet he left me with a secret to tell you paul  and chet lost no time in relating allens story of the hidden mine of great wealth  and perhaps we can explore the place during his absence paul said after he had expressed his astonishment and asked half a dozen questions  i dont know about that paul we may not be able to find the opening allen mentioned and then again he may not wish us to do so  why should he object  i dont know  well have ten days or two weeks on our hands at the very least we might as well take a look at that wealth as not  supposing somebody followed us and found out the secret they would locate a claim before we could turn a hand  we will make sure that we are not followed said paul who was anxious to see if all allen had told could really be true  chet continued to demur but after allen and noel had been gone the whole of the next day he gave in and seemed as anxious as paul to do something which would make it less lonely apparently the horse thieves had left the vicinity so there was nothing to be feared in that direction during an absence that they meant should not last more than one whole day  sunday came between and on monday morning they arose early and had breakfast ere it was yet daylight they decided to take rush both to ride when on a level and each to take a turn at walking when on the uphill trails  allen had left chet minute directions as to how the opening to the hidden mine could be located he having fixed the locality well in his mind before leaving it  it was rather a gloomy day but this the two boys did not mind  its better than being so raging hot said paul it makes my head ache to ride when its so fearfully hot  if it only dont rain returned chet we need it bad enough goodness knows but it has held off so long it might as well hold off twentyfour hours longer  i doubt if we get rain just yet it hasnt threatened long enough replied his brother  before the two left the ranch they saw to it that every building was locked up tight and an alarm in the shape of a loaded gun set to the doors and windows  that ought to scare wouldbe thieves away said chet theyll imagine somebody is firing at them  the rest for a couple of days had done rush much good and he made no work of carrying the two boys along the trail that led to the second foothills  long before noon they reached the hills and here stopped for lunch  and now for the wonderful mine cried chet then happening to glance across the plains below he added gracious paul what is that  the attention of both young ranchmen was at once drawn to a round black cloud on the horizon to the east it was hardly a yard in diameter apparently when first seen but it increased in size with great rapidity  it was moving directly toward them and in less than two minutes from the time chet uttered his cry it had covered fully a third of the distance  from what i have heard i should say that was a cyclone cloud exclaimed paul and still  who ever heard of a cyclone up here among the foothills returned chet i dont believe they ever strike this territory  i certainly never heard of their doing so returned paul but still you must remember that cyclones are erratic things at the best  it looks as if it were coming directly this way  so it does and i reckon the best thing we can do is to make tracks for some place of safety  that is true come on  both boys sprang into the saddle and started up the trail hardly had a hundred feet of the way been covered than a strange rush and roar of wind filled the air  its coming shouted paul quick chet down into that hollow before it strikes us  he plunged into the basin he had designated which was six or eight feet below the level of the trail and not over ten yards in diameter chet followed ducking low as he did so for already was the air filled with flying branches  none too soon ejaculated paul down rush  between them they managed to get the horse to lie down close to a wall of dirt and rocks they lay near waiting almost breathlessly for that awful time of peril to pass  no one who has not experienced the dreadful effects of a cyclone can imagine it be the description of it ever so fine that strange rush and roar that density of the air accompanied by a feeling as if the very breath was about to be drawn from ones lungs the flying débris all unite to chill the stoutest heart and make one wonder if the next moment will not be the last  the cyclone was short and sharp from the time it first struck the foothills until the time it spent itself in the distance was barely four minutes yet what an effect did it leave behind  on all sides of them many trees were literally torn up by the roots brush was leveled as if cut by a mowing machine and dirt and pebbles which had been perhaps carried for miles were deposited here there and everywhere ranch boys though they were and accustomed to many things strange and wonderful chet and paul could only gaze at the work of destruction in awe and silently thank heaven that their lives had been spared  they had escaped with slight injury several sharp sticks and stones had scratched chets neck as he lay prostrate and pauls arm was greatly lamed by a blow from the branch of a tree which fell directly across the opening pinning the horse down in such a fashion that he could not rise  we must liberate rush first of all cried chet poor fellow whoa rush well soon help you he added and patted the animal on the neck to soothe him  evidently rush understood for he lay quiet then chet and paul using all of their strength raised up one end of the tree which fortunately was not large as soon as he felt himself free rush scrambled up out of harms way and they let the tree fall back again  that is the kind of an adventure i never want to experience again said paul when he had somewhat recovered his breath my how the wind did tear things  it was a fullfledged cyclone and no mistake returned his brother had that struck a town it would have razed every building in it  thats true and oh went on paul suddenly i wonder if it has destroyed the marks allen left whereby the mine is to be found  chet stared at him speechless  perhaps he gasped at last come let us go on and see  there was considerable difficulty in getting out of the hollow into which they had so unceremoniously thrust themselves rush was somewhat frightened still and instead of riding him they led him out by a circuitous way which took them nearly a hundred yards out of their path  they found the trail almost impassable in spots and more than once were compelled to make a wide detour in order to avoid fallen trees and gathered brush  a cyclone like that can do more damage than can be repaired in ten years observed chet as they labored along on foot i wonder where it started from  somewhere out on the flat lands near the river i reckon returned paul  on they went around trees and rocks and brush until the way grew so bad that both came to an involuntary halt  it looks as if the very trail had been swept away said paul i cant see anything of it ahead  nor i whoever would have thought of such a thing when we left home  we cant go on in this direction thats sure whats best to be done  both looked around for several minutes and then decided to cross a rocky stretch to the right they had to do this with great care as the road was full of sink holes and crevices and they did not want to break a leg or have the horse injured  the stretch crossed they found themselves on a little hill all about them could be seen the effects of the cyclone not a tree or bush had escaped its ravages  it looks as if the landmarks allen had mentioned had been swept away said paul as he gazed around hopelessly i cant see the first of them  it would certainly seem so rejoined chet if they are they wont be able to locate the mine again excepting to sail down the underground river  that is soexcepting uncle barnaby turns up with another and better way of locating it replied paul very seriously     chapter xiv  another surprise   the desolation on all sides of them and the failure to locate the marks allen had mentioned caused paul and chet to become much downcast they had had their long and tedious journey from the ranch home for nothing  i suppose there isnt anything to do but to go back remarked chet dismally as he thrashed around in the brush with a stick he had picked up we are as far away from the mine as we were when we started  let us be in no hurry to return rejoined paul well give rush a chance to get back his wind  leaving the trusty animal to roam about as pleased him the two boys threw themselves on the grass and gave themselves up to their reflections  ill tell you what i would like to do remarked chet i would like to find the chap who cleaned us out of that seven hundred dollars  i wonder that allen didnt get watson to stop the horse thieves and search them mused paul he must have known they had the money  he was too played out to think of much just then i reckon it was a good deal to escape with the horses without getting shot  the cross we found in the barn belonged to that saul mangle beyond a doubt the initials prove that  i believe you  we must watch out for that mangle and if we can ever get our hands on him make him give up our money and then have him locked up  it is not so easy to lock up a man when you are miles and miles away from a jail  an hour went by and the boys thought it time to start on the return rush was called back from a thicket into which he had wandered and both mounted for the trail now lead almost entirely down hill  after the cyclone the sun had come out strong and hot and halfway back to the ranch the brothers were glad enough to stop beside the bank of a tiny mountain stream and obtain a drink and water the horse  they were about to depart when rush pricked up his ears and gave a peculiar whinny  hush what does that mean paul asked in quick alarm  draw behind the brush and see replied chet cautiously those horse thieves may be still in the vicinity  oh they would not remain here said paul  yet he followed his brother behind the brush they tried to make rush come too but for once the animal would not obey  come rush come whispered chet why he never acted this way before  the cyclone upset his mind i reckon said paul with a faint show of humor make him come  but the more chet tried the more obstinate did the animal become finally he broke away altogether and ran off kicking up his heels behind him  well i never gasped chet  quick after him i believe he means to run away cried paul  rush run away said chet reproachfully it hurt him a good deal to have paul speak in that fashion of the horse he so loved  both boys leaped from the thicket and after rush who was now running up the bank of the stream at top speed a turn was made and the brothers burst out into a loud and joyous shout  there not fifty feet away was lilly the faithful mare allen had fancied was drowned in the black rock river rush stood beside her licking her neck affectionately  allens horse cried chet  and as well as ever almost added paul as he rushed up and began an examination  the mare was evidently glad to see both the boys and her mate she stood trembling as chet and paul examined her  a few slight bruises that is all said paul wont allen be glad when he hears of it  indeed he will be he loves lilly as if she was his best girl its a good thing for us too paul he went on now each can have a mount home  right you areif lilly can carry me  paul was speedily on the mares back she seemed willing enough to carry him in fact glad to be in the keeping of a human being she knew  if she could only talk what a tale she would have to tell observed paul as they rode homeward i wonder how she got out of the river  i reckon well never know unless allen makes her talk he can make her do most everything laughed chet  on they went over the rocks and the level prairie beyond the sun was now sinking in the west and ere long the evening shadows would be upon them  well we found a horse even if we didnt find a mine and thats something said paul as they reached the trail beside the river  but i hope that the mine isnt lost for good replied chet quickly the mine is worth a good deal more than even lilly  maybe you cant tell that to allen  oh yes i can for he saw the wealth there you know  if only he finds uncle barnaby sighed paul do you know the more i think of it the more i become convinced that something dreadful has happened to him  and that is the way i look at it too paul if we could  chet stopped short and stared ahead they had come in sight of the semistockade around their ranch house  our furniture and trunks gasped paul following the direction of chets stare what on earth does it mean  there on the grass lay their furniture in a confused masstables chairs trunks clothing one on top of another and in another heap were the farming implements from the barn  captain gradys dirty work cried paul he has come here and taken possession during our absence  paul was right for at that moment captain grady appeared at the stockade gate gun in hand  the sarcastic smile on the captains face told plainly that he rather enjoyed the situation he gazed at the boys without saying a word  his left hand was tied up in a bandage showing that he had not entirely escaped the gun traps which had been set as a matter of fact half a dozen bird shot still remained in the fleshy part of his thumb  what does this mean demanded paul at length he spoke as calmly as he could although tremendously excited  reckon you have eyes an can see growled captain grady i told you that you hadnt seen the end of this an that i would have this place in my possession putty quick  you had no right to break into our house and fire our things out cried chet  i deny as how its your house youngster it belongs to me as does the whole ranch property there be your traps an the quicker you git them off this ground the better it will suit me  we wont move a thing until we put them back into that house retorted chet hotheadedly this is no way to gain possession and you know it  halt where you are captain grady raised his gun and pointed it at chet who was in advance youll not come near this gate mind that  im going in and you wont stop me retorted chet  dont be rash chet whispered paul riding up and plucking his younger brother by the sleeve  you try and cross this gateway and ill fire on you sure as fate went on the captain  urged by paul chet brought rush to a stand the boys were about thirty feet from where captain grady stood on guard  now the best thing you fellers can do said the captain sharply is to ride over to dotterys ranch an git a wagon an tote these traps away if they are left more n a week ill pitch them into the river mind you if you aint satisfied at the way matters have turned you can go to law just as you advised me to do and again the man smiled sarcastically  we certainly will go to law replied paul are you alone here  thats not for you to ask  i presume you hung around here and saw my brother go off first and then waited for us to go away  i aint standing here as a target for questions growled captain grady  you are a sneak and worse captain grady burst out chet if there is any law in idaho you shall have your full dose of it mark my word  hi you young bantam dont talk to me in that fashion roared the man in a rage come ive told you what is best to do now clear out i shall keep watch an if you attempt to play any trick in the dark on me youll find yourself running up against a charge of buckshot  that captain grady was in dead earnest was very evident he scowled viciously and walked a step forward  yet the boys were not daunted they held their ground and paul even took a slight move forward on lillys back  supposing we go to dotterys ranch said the youth if we tell our story dont you imagine dottery will turn in and help us bounce you out of here  no youll get no help at dotterys  he is our friend and he will not stand up for your doings even if you do own the ranch over the river  well why dont you go an see dottery snapped captain grady  we willand some other people too cried chet  and in the meantime if any of our stuff is lost youll pay for it added paul  i wont be responsible for anything now clear out an leave me alone  the two brothers looked at each other neither knew exactly what to do paul finally made a sign to withdraw and they turned and rode down the river trail to the belt of cottonwoods  captain grady remained at the gateway his baneful eyes on them until the trees hid them from view then he shut the heavy gate and walked slowly toward the house rubbing his grizzled chin reflectively  they wont come back tonight im pretty certain of that he said to himself an by tomorrow ill be better fixed to hold my own     chapter xv  at dotterys ranch   its a shame paul ejaculated chet almost crying with rage we ought to have shot him where he stood  i suppose many a man would have done it returned paul somewhat moodily but we must get him out  he wont go out without a fight  i think he willwhen we get enough of a crowd against him i more than half believe he is totally alone although the furniture and other stuff look as if he had had somebody to help him  hes been hanging around watching his chance went on chet who knows but what he has been spying on us ever since his last visit  oh i trust not chet paul looked much disturbed he may have overheard some of our talk about uncle barnabys mine you know  thats so what if he did he is rascal enough to try to locate it and set up a claim eh  undoubtedly come on the best we can do is to ride to dotterys and try to obtain help its a long journey by night but theres nothing else to do  i wont mind itif only dottery will turn in and help us he ought to but he always was a peculiar fellow he may not want to make an enemy of captain grady seeing as the ranches adjoin but come on while daylight lasts  and off the two brothers struck along the river trail and then down the road allen and noel urner had pursued on their way to the faraway railroad station they realized that in another hour darkness would be upon them  the boys knew the way well having traveled it a dozen times in search of stray cattle they rode on side by side urging on the tired horses and discussing the situation in all its various phases  slowly the sun faded from view behind the distant mountains casting long shadows over the foothills and the level stretches beyond the night birds sang their parting song and then came the almost utter silence of the night  when do you suppose well reach dotterys questioned chet after several miles had been covered  if all goes well well get there by one or two oclock returned his brother you must remember we have demon hollow to cross and thats no fool of a job in the dark  especially if the demon is abroad laughed chet he was only joking and did not believe in the old trappers stories about the ghost in hiding at the bottom of the rocky pass  when darkness fell the hoofstrokes of the horses sounded out doubly loud on the semistony road yet to the boys even this was better than that intense stillness which made one feel as chet expressed it a hundred miles from nowhere at all  so tired were the horses that the boys had their hands full making them keep their gait they would trot a few steps and then drop into a stolid walk  i dont blame them much said chet sympathetically its doing two days work in one but never mind they shall have a good rest when its all over  by ten oclock it was pitch dark to be sure the stars were shining but they gave forth but a feeble light the boys had to hold their animals at a tight rein to keep them from stumbling into unexpected holes  it will be nearer three oclock than two before we get there at this rate grumbled paul just look ahead and see how dark and forbidding the hollow looks  not the most cheerful spot in the world truly rejoined chet as he strained his eyes to pierce the heavy shadows let us get past it as soon as we can  afraid chet  oh no only ii would rather be on the level trail beyond the pass  paul said no more having no desire to hurt his younger brothers feelings to tell the exact truth he himself felt a bit off it was growing toward midnight  down and down led the road between two rocky crags soon the last trace of light was left behind and they had to let the horses pick their own way as best they might  suddenly chet gave a start and a cry  o paul what is that  where  over to the left  paul turned in his saddle as he did so an object not over two feet in length and of a gray and white color with some black swept to one side of them  can it be a pig gasped chet  a pig no its a badger out on the forage dont you smell him  chet recovered and unslung his gun he tried to take aim in the gloom  dont fire said paul what is the use its only a waste of ammunition the badger isnt hurting anything and hes a good distance from the ranch let him go  by the time chet had listened to all this the badger had disappeared the animal was not used to being aroused and was more frightened than any one  they passed on the very bottom of the hollow was at hand the horses proceeded slowly realizing the peril of the place  once rush went down into a hole nearly throwing chet over his head but the youth held on and rush arose all right with nothing but a slight scrape on his left foreleg  they peered with watchful eyes up and down the silent pass not a sign of any life was there the water flowed on with a muffled murmur and the wind sighed through the deep opening and that was all in another five minutes the pass was left behind  for some reason both boys drew a long breath of relief when the high ground beyond was reached the strain was gone and now by contrast the road looked as bright to them as if the sun was about to rise  come to think of it we may as well take it easy remarked paul it isnt likely that dottery will care to make a move before daylight  yes but if we get there sooner well have a chance to rest up a bit and we need that and so do the horses  i didnt think of that well forward we go  an hour passed and then another soon after chet gave a joyous cry  there are dotterys outbuildings well soon be there now  right you are chet i wonder paul stopped short oh look over there he cried  he pointed to a barn not a great distance back from the road  the door of the structure was open and within flashed the light of a lantern  dottery must be up or else began chet  horse thieves  both boys uttered the word simultaneously could it be possible that the thieves were raiding their nearest neighbor  wait let us dismount and investigate whispered paul dont do anything rash this as chet started to run toward the barn  thus cautioned the younger boy paused the horses were tied up behind some brush and guns in hand the pair crept across the road and over a wire fence into the field  hardly had they advanced a dozen steps when three men came out of the barn leading four horses they made for an opening in the fence not a rod from where the boys flung themselves flat on the grass  from the description they had received the lads made up their minds that the men were saul mangle darry nodley and jeff jones     chapter xvi  an encounter in the dark   chet and paul could hardly suppress their excitement as they saw the horse thieves move toward the opening in the fence chet drew up his gun and pointed it at the leader  dont fire wait cautioned paul there are three of them remember  i wonder where dottery is questioned the younger boy with his hand still on the trigger  asleep most likely  we ought to arouse him run paul while i keep watch  i will but dont do anything rash during my absence replied paul winthrop  he sneaked along in the tall grass until the outbuildings were left a hundred feet and sped like a deer toward the ranch home showing dimly in the grim shadows ahead  less than sixty seconds passed and he was pounding vigorously on the front door of the heavy log building not content with using his fist he banged away with the toe of his cowhide boot  whos thar came from within presently  mr dottery  thats me stranger  come out its paul winthrop there are horse thieves at your barn  what roared dottery he was a heavybuilt man with a voice like a giant the same chaps ez robbed you  he unbarred the door and came out on a run gun in hand and a long pistol in his belt he was an old settler and rarely took the trouble to undress when he went to rest for the night  yes the same unless i am very much mistaken my brother chet is down there now on the watch  ill fix em go back and call jack my man  paul hesitated and then did as directed it took some time to arouse the cowboy jack blowfen but once aroused the man quickly took in the situation and arming himself joined the boy in a rush after dottery  the pesky rascals he muttered yer brother told us about em when he stopped here on his way to the railroad station its a pity ike watson didnt plug every one of em when he had the chance next thing yer know theyll be runnin off with a bunch o cattle  be careful when you shoot my brother chet is there continued paul not wishing chet to be mistaken for a horse thief in the dark  i know the lad and i also know this saul mangle and his crowd returned jack blowfen i owe mangle one for the way he treated me in deadwood one day  he ran so swiftly that paul had hard work to keep up with him dottery had already disappeared in the darkness of the night  bang bang the shots came from behind the barn while paul was some distance away it was dottery firing at the thieves jack blowfen was chasing them down by the wire fence  paul paul hold on  it was chets voice as he cried out the lad arose from the grass and caught his brother by the sleeve paul had passed so close that he had almost trodden on chet  come on chet  im coming but hadnt we better look to our horses  in a minute let us find out what that firing means  paul led the way in the direction of the barn there in the gloom they saw two men struggling violently they were dottery and the negro jeff jones the other horse thieves and jack blowfen were nowhere in sight  two horses were running about wildly alarmed by the shots in the dark both were bridled but had no saddles  catch the hosses yelled dottery as he made out the forms of the boys dont let em get out of that break in the fence  have you that man cried paul  i will have in a second  the brothers ran for the animals as directed it was no light work to secure them when it was accomplished they ran the horses into the barn and closed the doors as they came out panting from their exertions they heard a gunshot from the brush on the opposite side of the road and then the voice of jack blowfen calling out  let them hosses go you rascals take that saul mangle fer the trick yer played me in deadwood  rush and lilly gasped chet he said no more but started in the direction of the encounter he was determined his horse should not be taken again paul came on his heels both boys were now sufficiently aroused to fight even with their firearms the wire fence was cleared at a single bound and into the brush they dove pellmell  that jack blowfen was having a fierce handtohand contest with his antagonist was plain the boys could hear both men thrashing around at a lively rate  youve hit me in the leg and ill never forgive you for it they heard saul mangle exclaim how do you like that you milkandwater cow puncher  i dont like it and aint going ter stand it yer low down hoss thief and gambler returned jack blowfen and then came the fall of one body over another just as paul and chet leaped into the little opening where the battle was taking place  they saw jack blowfen on his back with saul mangle on top of him the horse thief had the butt of a heavy pistol raised threateningly he looked alarmed at the unexpected appearance of the boys  let up there sang out paul let up at once  the cry and the glint of the boys weapons decided mangle with a low muttering he gave jack blowfens body a kick and sprang for the bushes  chet and paul went after him leaving the cowboy to stagger to his feet and regain his pistols  the boys followed mangle not over a dozen feet then they came upon darry nodley who had several horses in a bunch among them rush and lilly the man had been waiting for the leader of the gang to finish his row with blowfen  saul mangle was ahead of the two boys but ere he could leap upon the back of the nearest animal paul ran up to him and seized him by the arm  stop he ordered you cannot take those horses we will shoot you both if you attempt it  the winthrop youngsters muttered darry nodley how did they find their way here  he attempted to move on thinking mangle would follow but now chet barred the way  the ranch boy had his gun up to his shoulder and there was a determined look on his sunburnt face he was fighting for rush as much as for anything else  get down was all he said but the tone in which the words were uttered left no room for argument  darry nodley hesitated and thought at first to feel for his own gun but then he changed his mind he saw that chet was thoroughly aroused and saw too that jack blowfen was coming up  well have to make tracks he cried to saul mangle and leaped to the ground putting the horse between himself and chet and ran for the bushes  in the meantime paul and saul mangle were having a handtohand fight the boy fought well and the wounded man had all he could do to defend himself finally he went limping after nodley but not before paul had relieved him of his gun the brave lad could have shot the thief with ease but could not bring himself to take the risk of killing his antagonist  where are they roared jack blowfen coming up which way did they go  paul pointed in the direction at once blowfen ran off in another second chet and paul were left alone with the horses the sounds from the distance told them that saul mangle and darry nodley were doing their best to escape from the neighborhood  our money cried chet we ought to have made an effort to get that seven hundred dollars  thats sobut its too late now unless we go after the pair on horseback  let us return dotterys horses to the barn first and see how he has made out with the negro  they took the horses in charge and passed with them across the road and through the break in the wire fence at the barn they found the ranch owner in the act of making jeff jones a close prisoner by tying his hands and legs with odd bits of harness straps  got this one anyway growled dottery whar are the others  jack blowfen has gone after them replied paul here are your horses  good enough say will you watch this man if i follow jack went on the ranch owner anxiously  of course exclaimed chet if you can capture saul mangle do so we believe he has seven hundred dollars belonging to us  so allen told me  the boys took charge of the negro and mounting one of the horses caleb dottery rode out of the inclosure he took the lantern with him thus leaving those behind in darkness  strike a light chet and see if you cant find another lantern in the barn said paul ill watch jones so he dont get away  dis am werry hard on a poah man moaned the negro he was fearfully frightened for he knew full well how stern was the justice usually meted out to horse thieves in that section of the country  you ought to have thought of that before you started in this business replied paul  it was mangle coaxed me into de work sah he said as how he had a right to de hosses  indeed i suppose he said he had a right to our horses too went on the youth with a sarcasm that was entirely lost on the prisoner  yes sah  in that case you will have to suffer for your simpleness was pauls short response he did not believe the colored man  no lantern in the barn so far as i can see called out chet better march the fellow up to the house  he cant march with his legs tied  i reckon he can hobble a bit  jeff jones was unwilling to move thinking he had a better chance of escape while out in the open but chet and paul each caught him by the arm and groaning and trembling the colored man was forced to move slowly toward the ranch home  before moving to the house chet had driven the horses into the barn and locked the door so now the animals were safe at least for the time being  it was found that jeff jones had received an ugly wound in the shoulder this paul set to work to dress taking good care however that the prisoner should be allowed no chance of escape  wot is yo gwine to do wid me asked jeff jones as the work progressed aint gwine ter tote me ter town is yo  that depends upon what mr dottery says replied chet hes the boss of this ranch  better let me go urged the colored man if yo dont dar will be big trouble ahead  dont imagine we are to be scared so easily returned chet smartly we have a bigger rascal to deal with even than you he added  yo mean saul mangle  no i mean captain hank grady replied the boy without stopping to think  captain hank grady wot yo know ob him ejaculated jeff jones did yo know about him and yo uncle barnaby the colored man broke off short  my uncle barnaby exclaimed chet what made you think of him in connection with captain grady  oh i know a lot about him an de captain said jeff jones suggestively a heap dat maybe yo boys would gib a lot ter know about     chapter xvii  something about a letter   allen winthrop knew full well that he had a long journey before him and one that would perhaps be full of peril yet his heart did not fail him as he and noel urner rode away bound first for dotterys ranch and then for the railroad station over a hundred miles away  you must keep up a stout heart allen said the young man from the east perhaps all is well with your uncle in spite of appearances  i am not daunted by what lies ahead said the young ranchman but i am convinced that uncle barnaby has been led into some great trouble were it otherwise we would surely have heard from him ere this  at dotterys they put up over night and set off at sunrise in the morning allen riding the animal from the ranch and noel using a large and powerful beast hired to him by dottery  thirtyfive miles today observed allen as they pushed on along a somewhat hilly trail lined on either side by cactus and other low plants  is that the distance to daddy wampoles hotel as you call it  yesby the roads the direct route would not make it over thirty miles but we cant fly as the birds do  we ought to make thirtyfive miles easily enough  we could on a level but you must remember we have several hills to climb and half a dozen water courses to ford i imagine too you will get tired of the saddle before nightfall  oh i can stand it laughed noel urner thanks to my experience in the riding schools in new york and my frequent exercises in central park  a big difference between central park and this eh i would like to see the park some time returned allen  on they went taking advantage of the early morning while the sun was still low the level stretch was passed and then they came to a goodsized brook beyond was a belt of timber and the first of the hills  they watered the horses and took a drink themselves and pushed on without stopping further allen knew they must keep on the move if they expected to reach daddy wampoles crossroads ranch before the evening shadows fell  on through the forest of spruce and hemlock with here and there a tall cottonwood they spurred their horses the foot of the hill was soon reached and up they toiled  a grand country murmured noel urner  and big room for improvements returned allen grimly it will take a deal of labor to put this land in shape for use  we never realize what the pioneers had to contend with when they first settled this country until we see things as they are here to cut down forests level the land build houses and barns and fix roadsits an immense amount of labor truly  at noon they halted near the top of a second hill and here started up just enough of a fire to boil themselves a pot of coffee they had brought jerked meat and crackers from home and made a comfortable if not luxurious meal in twenty minutes they were again on the way the horses in the meantime having also been fed  daddy wampoles ranch is our post office explained allen as they rode along side by side the mail comes down from deadwood once a week its not very extensive and wampole usually puts everything in a soap box and lets every comer pick out whatever belongs to him  noel laughed ive heard of such doings before he said i suppose he has another box of letters to be mailed  exactly  its not a very safe way to do letters might easily be stolen or taken by mistake who knows but what some communication from your uncle was carried off by another  allens face grew serious i never thought of that but who would be mean enough to do it  the man who sent that forged letter to me would be mean enough  so he would i must ask wampole if he remembers any letter addressed to us  it was now the hottest part of the day the road was dry and dusty and the horses hung out their tongues as they toiled onward all were glad when they reached a portion of the road overhung by huge rocks a hundred feet or more in height  a day in the saddle seems a long while said noel urner  and we have four more days to follow smiled allen i was afraid it would tire you  oh i am all right yet allen but look what is that ahead a building  thats the crossroads hotel come we have less than a mile more to go  the sight of the rude building ahead raised noel urners spirits off he went on a gallop with allen close at his heels in ten minutes they drew up at the rude horse block and dismounted  old daddy wampole then a wellknown character throughout idaho came out on the porch of his ranch to greet them  back agin hey he called out to allen wall thar aint no new mail in sense ye war here afore  i know that daddy replied the young man i didnt come for the mail exactly my friend and i are bound for the railroad station  goin ter san francisco  yes we want to stop here tonight  ye air welcome ter do thet and daddy wampole gave noel a friendly nod  the young man was introduced and all three entered the ranch one room of which did duty as a general store barroom and post office before anything else could be spoken of allen questioned wampole concerning the letters which had been in the box for several weeks back and the people who had called for them  i dont remember much about the letters but i recerlect thet capn grady took most all ez came in was the suggestive reply from the sostyled postmaster  so he took most of the letters did he said allen slowly how many of them on a rough guess  seven or eight  and you cant remember if any of them were addressed to me  no i dont recerlect thet allen but hold ondo ye suspect the capn o tamperin with yer mail  i dont believe he is above such an action replied the young man bluntly  wall neither do i privately speakin i was goin ter say went on the ranch owner slowly when the capn got the letters he walked over there to the old place and tore em open maybe  there was no need for the man to go on allen had already left the apartment and was hurrying across the road to what had in former days been the only house in the section  it was a rude affair now half fallen into decay outside under the overhanging logs of the roof was situated a bench sometimes used by travelers as a resting place here many a yarn had been told and many a hoss deal talked over and closed  straight to the bench went allen and in the fading light looked eagerly on all sides for bits of paper of any kind he found a great number and gathered them all into his empty dinner pouch when he was sure there were no more scraps in the vicinity he returned to the house  well what have you asked noel urner with interest  i have nearly fifty scraps of letters said allen i must look them over at once  a lamp was lit and spreading out the scraps on a large flat board allen set to work to sort out the various pieces it was tedious work and noel urner assisted him  suddenly the young ranchman uttered a low cry  look here is part of a letter that was addressed to me he said  and he held up a scrap which bore the words you and chet can meet me and paul  is it in your uncles handwriting questioned the young man from the east  yes  then it would seem as if some one had stolen your letter certainly  thats just what was done ejaculated allen i wonder he stopped short  what do you wonder  i wonder if captain grady had anything to do with uncle barnabys disappearance  the capn air a slick one put in daddy wampole i never liked him from the day i fust sot eyes onto him an seem as how hes achin ter git thet ranch from ye boys why it aint surprisin he took thet letter and would do more if twas fer his own benefit  it wont be for his benefit if i find he is playing such an underhand game rejoined allen grimly the thought that captain grady had stolen his letter angered him thoroughly he fancies that we are only three boys but hell find out that even boys can do something when they are put to it  its a pity you didnt find the rest of the letter observed noel urner no doubt that letter was of great importance it might be best to hunt up this captain grady and learn the truth from him before we push further for the railroad station  the trouble is the capn air hard to find said daddy wampole he aint on his ranch more n a quarter o his time ye know hes as much interested in mines ez he is in cattle  the mention of mines gave a new turn to allens thoughts had that communication from uncle barnaby contained any reference to the valuable claim over by the black rock river  if it did then captain grady will rob uncle barnaby as sure as fate thought the young ranchman with an inward groan     chapter xviii  allen changes his plans   a moment later a clatter of horses hoofs on the road outside betokened another arrival catching up his gun daddy wampole strode out to see who it was  ike watson wot brings ye here allen heard him cry and then ran out to greet the old hunter  allen by all the good fortunes o the rockies ejaculated ike watson jes the boy im pinin ter see  and im mighty glad to see you too ike returned the young ranchman i want a bit of advice and you are just the man to give it to me  advice im ready to give ye bushels o it if it will do ye the least bit o good lad but wot are ye doin here why aint ye hum  i came here on my way to the railroad station i am bound for san francisco to hunt up uncle barnaby  gee whiz now thets what i call fortunate if i hadnt a cotched ye ye would be goin off on a wild goose chase with no end to the trail  a wild goose chase o ike have you word from my uncle  no i aint got no word from him but i got word in a way thet two rascals didnt dream on  but what do you know questioned allen impatiently  not much ter tell the truth an yet a good deal it happened this mornin when i wuz down to caseys fork i wuz ridin along the old bar trail when along comes a couple o the worst lookin bad men ye ever seed sez one to tudder if we can make him tell us whar the mine is we will all become millionaires then sez tudder well make him speak we didnt trap barnaby winthrop inter leavin san francisco fer nuthin the fellers wuz on the bottom trail while i wuz up on the rocks i tried to git to em to make em tell me wot wuz the meanin of it all when they spied me comin down an by the grasshoppers o kansas ye ought ter hev seed em put an scoot they got out o sight in a jiffy an i couldnt locate em try my best i hung around an hour an then i made up my mind ter ride over an tell ye wot i hed heard  not only allen but also noel urner and daddy wampole were astonished by the revelation ike watson made  uncle barnaby trapped into leaving san francisco gasped allen did they say where they had taken him  didnt say nuthin moren i told ye responded the hunter from gold fork leaswise didnt say nuthin ez i could hear  who were the men  i dont know ceptin i seed em hangin around jordan creek about six months ago like ez not they belong to the old sol davids gang nearly every one up thet water course belonged to thet gang  would you know them if you saw them again  sartinlyim powerful good at recerlectin faces onct i see em  where do you suppose the men went to  rode off in the direction o black rock river canyon  allen started could it be possible they suspected the claim was up in that neighborhood it was more than possible  the young ranchman turned to noel urner noel im going to change my plans i am going after those two men instead of going to san francisco  it would certainly seem a useless trip now replied the young man from new york slowly there is not the slightest doubt but what your uncle was decoyed away from san francisco where he is now is a mystery which those two men must solve for youthey or  captain grady finished allen impulsively i feel it in my bones that he is in this plot against uncle barnaby  it would seem so  how do ye make that out asked ike watson  in a few words allen told the old hunter about the missing letter  gee shoo he are one o the gang sartin cried ike watson the best ye can do is to start in an round em all up  thets the talk put in daddy wampole the state would be a hundred per cent better off with em fellers out o it  allen gazed at ike watson earnestly  will you help me in this work he asked you know more about these bad men than i do  will i help ye allen ye ought ter know better than ter axt sech a question o course ill help ye i aint got much ter do them new claims up the salmon kin wait well enough  i would help ye too if i could git away said daddy wampole thet gang worried me enough for six years goodness knows  and what of you allen turned to noel you see how matters stand i dont want to ask you to go for we may have some rough times and  i came out to see rough times interrupted the young man from the east so unless you think ill be too much of a hindrance i would like greatly to accompany you wherever you go you must remember that i too am anxious to find your uncle  then thets settled said ike watson he did not much fancy having the company of a tenderfoot but noels manner pleased him  a long discussion followed while it was in progress mrs wampole prepared a hot supper to which later on allen and the others did full justice  it was decided to remain at the crossroads hotel all night and the three retired early that they might make a start before sunrise  it must be confessed that the young ranchman slept but little his mind was in a whirl over all he had discovered and he shuddered whenever he thought that his uncle might possibly be in peril of his life  those men would indeed dare all for gold as those initials on the cross imply he said to himself what a pity they were not exterminated the time old sol davids was lynched  toward morning allen dropped off into a troubled slumber to be awakened with a start by a touch from ike watsons hand an hour later  time ter climb below an feed up allen cried the old hunter we hev a long ride afore us ez ye know  thats true cried the young ranchman springing to his feet and ike went off to arouse noel urner  the young man from new york felt rather stiff from his ride of the day previous yet he did not complain and did all he could to make the others believe he felt in perfect trim for another day in the saddle  after a substantial but hasty breakfast the horses were saddled and they were off daddy wampole waving his hand after them and wishing them the best of luck  well make for caseys fork fust o all said ike watson perhaps i can pick up the trail thar if i cant we kin push on toward the salmon an trust ter luck  allen was doubtful if the old hunter could pick up the trail after having once lost it but in lieu of something better he agreed to watsons plan noel of course was willing to go wherever the others led  it was high noon when caseys fork a rough lot of rocks in a bend of the umihalo creek was reached allen and noel were glad enough to dismount in the shadow of the rocks while ike watson went off on a tour of inspection  the old hunter was gone so long that allen at last grew alarmed  something is wrong or he would be back ere this he said let us go after him  but hardly had they mounted when they heard a shout ahead looking beyond a belt of bushes they saw ike watson waving his hand to them  found it he cried as they came up they took the creek road over ter the forest trail the marks are fresh showin they didnt move on until dark last night  then they cant be many miles ahead cried allen oh if we can only keep the trail till we catch up to them  no time ter lose said ike watson and once more they continued the pursuit this time faster than before  yet at the end of two miles they came to a sudden halt the trail led down to the bank of a shallow stream and there disappeared from view     chapter xix  along the water course   gone burst from allens lips  whats to do now asked noel urner  ike watson halted in perplexity for fully a minute then he dismounted and waded into the stream which was scarcely a foot to a foot and a half in depth  ho ho ho he laughed suddenly i thought so no ye cant play thet game hyer  what now ike questioned the young ranchman  they went up in the middle o this yere stream thinkin they could throw me off the trail see hyer are the marks ez plain ez the nose on capn gradys face and the old hunter pointed into the clear water  leaving allen to bring his horse watson walked slowly along the bed of the stream taking good care not to step into any deep holes in this manner half a mile was covered when at a point where the brush along the bank was thin the trail led out once more on the dirt and rocks  an old trick but it didnt work this trip chuckled ike watson to himself as he once more resumed his seat in the saddle  what i am thinking of is what made them suspicious after they were so far from caseys forks said allen  perhaps their guilty consciences laughed noel  thet an because they thought i might be follerin em added ike watson hullo what does this mean  he had followed the trail around a belt of timber beyond was a wall of rocks and here were traces of a recent campa smoldering fire and some odds and ends of crackers and meat  we aint far behind em boys he went on this fire wuz tended ter less than a couple o hours ago  then let us push on by all means returned allen if we can catch those two men before they have a chance to join any of their evil companions so much the better  the trail leads along the rocks observed noel have you any idea where we are going  idee i know this yere country like a book said ike watson dont ye git feered o bein lost so long ez ye stay nigh me  i dont mean that i mean do you know where the men went from here  up to grizzly pass most likely an then along over ter the black rock canyon eh allen  it would seem so responded allen seriously  grizzly pass rather a suggestive name said noel  yeas especially when a big grizzly shows hisself drawled watson and there the conversation dropped  despite the fierce sunshine it was deliciously cool along the base of the rocky wall and the horses made good progress over the hard but level trail here and there immense brier bushes overhung the way but these were easily avoided by the animals who were more afraid of them than were their riders  presently the trail took an upward course leading between a split in the rocks  ye want ter be careful hyer cautioned ike watson its a mighty slippery spot fer the best o hoss flesh  scarcely had he spoken when noel urner gave a cry of alarm  he was in the rear and both the old hunter and allen turned quickly to see what was the matter  they found noels horse on his knees having slipped to one side of the trail  the young man was on the ground one foot caught in the stirrup  stop the hoss cried watson if ye dont hell bang the young mans head off  before he had ceased speaking allen was on the ground he ran back and caught noels horse by the bridle the young man from the east was partly stunned and it was several seconds before he could recover sufficiently to disengage his foot and arise from his dangerous position  good for you allen he cried as he stood by while the young ranchman assisted the horse to a safe spot in the trail i was afraid i was in for it  ye did jes the right thing allen put in ike watson dunno but wot ye hed better walk a brief spell he went on to noel who was only too glad to do so  half an hour later the top of the rocks was reached and they moved back to where the way was smooth and safe a lunch was had from the pouches and on they went as fast as the fatigued horses would carry them  i can see no trail said noel as he rode abreast of his companions  there aint no need ter see a trail hyer replied ike watson this yere way is a blind pocket fer all o these three miles ye couldnt go no different if ye tried bymeby when we come out on sampsons flats well look for the trail agin  we ought to catch up to those men before we reach the flats remarked allen they must be tired out by that climb  we aint fur off rejoined watson jes keep silent half an hour longer an well  he broke off short reigned in his steed and pointed ahead  allen looked eagerly in the direction under the spreading branches of a giant pine rested two men not far from them two horses were hoppled the men looked thoroughly tired both were smoking pipes and leaning against the tree with their eyes closed  let us dismount and tiptoe our way to them whispered allen if we secure their horses first they will have no chance to get away from us  a good plan lad returned watson in an equally low tone supposin ye an i leave our nags with mr urner  this was agreed upon and after dismounting the horses were led behind some heavy brush by the young man from the east  then with their weapons ready for use allen and old ike watson stole cautiously forward to where were grazing the animals belonging to the two bad men from jordan creek  allen and the old hunter from gold fork went about their work as silently as possible the horses were somewhat in the rear and so they made a detour coming up behind the dozing men as softly as twin shadows  the animals reached the next thing was to release them this was speedly accomplished and it was allen who led them off while ike watson still remained on guard with his trusty gun ready should the occasion arise to make use of the firearm  in less than three minutes the young ranchman was back having left the captured animals in noels care  now whats to do he questioned  maybe we hed better git a few ropes ready in case we want ter bind em began ike watson but ere this idea could be put into execution one of the men dropped his pipe and the hot tobacco falling on his hand brought him upright with a start he opened his eyes and with a loud exclamation which awoke his companion leaped to his feet  what does this mea he began  hands up ye rascal ordered ike watson so sternly that instantly both arms were raised high overhead the horse thief for the man was nothing less if not much worse fully understood that his opponent had the drop on him and would not stop to parley unless the order to elevate his hands was obeyed  the second rascal in his sitting position attempted to draw a pistol but allen producing his own weapon forced the man to remain stationary  we hev ye stranger remarked watson after a second of silence do ye acknowledge the corn  whats the meaning of this outrage growled the fellow who was standing and he scowled fiercely first at the old hunter and then at the young ranchman  it means firstly that ye are in our power chuckled watson it was evident that he thoroughly enjoyed the situation  well  then ye acknowledge thet do ye  i suppose well have to  its ike watson from gold fork put in the man who was sitting  ike watson the face of the speaker grew quite disturbed it was plain he had heard of watson before and did not relish being held up by the wellknown old man  yeas im ike watson drawled the old hunter now strangers give me yer handles and let me have em straight  my name is roe bluckburn came from the standing man  mine is lou slavin and im not ashamed of it came from the other  jes so mused watson ive heard o both o yeez belongin to the old sol davids gang o hoss thieves  you are mistaken we are not thieves of any sort said bluckburn who appeared the leader of the pair  well we wont quarrel about that seein ez how we are on another trail ter day we want ye ter up an tell us ter onct whar barnaby winthrop is  yes and tell us the truth put in allen sternly  the men were both taken aback by the request they exchanged glances and each waited for the other to speak  come out with it bluckburn cried watson  dunno the man you are talking about  ye cant come it thet way didnt i hear ye talkin it over down ter caseys forks only yesterday come out with the truth or take the consequences and to scare the horse thief ike watson tapped his gun barrel suggestively  must be some mistake we wasnt near caseys fork in a month eh lou  nixy  ye tell it so smooth i would most believe ye if i hadnt follered ye up growled watson but we know ye air in the deal agin barnaby winthrop an i am hyer ter help his nevvy thar allen winthrop so ye hed better ease yer mind ter onct understand  the two men turned their attention to allen curiously they wished to hold a consultation but watson would not permit it  at that moment noel urner came forward having succeeded in tying all of the horses in a little grove not far distant  he eyed both of the prisoners keenly and then gave a start  i saw that man in san francisco he ejaculated pointing to roe bluckburn he was hanging around the very hotel at which mr barnaby winthrop stopped  it aint so growled bluckburn but his face proclaimed that noel urner had spoken the truth  if that is the case then he is the one who decoyed my uncle away put in allen for there is no longer any doubt in my mind that he was spirited away in some fashion  air ye fellers goin ter speak roared ike watson impatiently ye cant expect me ter stand hyer with a gun the rest o the day  unless you do speak we shall bind you and hand you over to the sheriff said allen we believe we have a good case against youand will have a better after captain grady is placed under arrest he added struck with a sudden thought  captain grady groaned the man named lou slavin i reckon the jig is up roe  shut up growled bluckburn  but if the captain is known wot show have we got grumbled slavin say he continued eagerly i went into this thing agin my will an i wish i was out of it supposin i tell yer the truth about the hull gang does that save me  dont you say a word lou shouted bluckburn warningly but ere he could speak further the muzzle of ike watsons gun caused him to retreat up to the tree where he stood not daring to say another word  go on and have yer say cried the old hunter to lou slavin and ez i said before give it ter us straight whar is barnaby winthrop  he is a prisoner about ten miles from here was slavins flat and sudden confession     chapter xx  moving against captain grady   both paul and chet winthrop were deeply interested in the words uttered by jeff jones the colored member of the horse thieves gang  so you know something of captain grady and our uncle barnaby winthrop cried chet excitedly what do you know  dats fer you two fellers ter find outonless yer lets me go replied jeff jones suggestively  you mean you wont speak unless we grant you your liberty put in paul  dats de way to figure it  paul looked at chet inquiringly  we cant promise anything until mr dottery gets back said chet but if you know anything about our uncle you had better speak out if you wish us to do anything at all for you  i wont say a word growled the colored man  chet bit his lip in vexation  dont you know what it is to have us able to speak a word for you said paul supposing we let jack blowfen take you over to the next camp and tell the men that you are a downright horse thief would you fancy that  jeff jones began to tremble he knew what paul meantthat he would be lynched inside the hour in that section of the country at that time horse stealing was considered almost as bad as murder  no no doan let him take me down ter de fork howled jeff jones anyting but dat boys  well you had better talk then returned paul severely  i doan know much but ill tell yo all i do know said the prisoner after a short pause and yo is ter do de best yo can fo me promise me dat  we will said chet he was very impatient for jeff jones to proceed  well den captain grady has been aspottin yo uncle fer seberal weekseber sence he got massah winthrop ter leave san francisco  got him to leave san francisco queried paul  yes i doan know how de ting was done but he got yo uncle ter leave de city an now hes tryin ter make him gib up de secret ob a mine or sumfin like dat  gracious burst from chets lips that explains it all uncle barnaby must be in captain gradys power  and by getting us out of the ranch he thought to make us leave the neighborhood added paul do you know he went on i believe he is at the head of a band who wish to obtain entire control of this section  i dont doubt it paul chet turned to the prisoner where is our uncle now  dat i cant say  captain grady must know  suah he does  then well make him tell never fear chet began to walk up and down i wish mr dottery would come back  i hear somebody down the road said paul as he walked to the door it must be the two coming back now  paul was right there was a clatter beyond in the dark and a moment later caleb dottery appeared followed by jack blowfen  couldnt catch em in the dark said dottery as he strode into the house and dropped into a rude but comfortable chair but thank fortune the stock is safe  slick rascals mangle and nodley continued jack blowfen but well round em up some day ill bet my sombrero on it  we have just heard important news said paul and he instantly proceeded to repeat what jeff jones had said  caleb dottery and his cowboy helper listened with interest the former gave a long low whistle of astonishment  must say i didnt quite think it of captain grady though i allow as how hes a slick one he remarked wots ter do about it  we came here to obtain your aid said chet captain grady has taken possession of our ranch you know he sets up some sort of a claim to it  got yer papers aint ye  no they were burned up when we had our little fire  humph thets bad  but the place is oursfather bought and paid for it added paul warmly and we intend to get captain grady out even if we have to fight him  good fer ye shouted jack blowfen thets the way ter talk im right hyer ter help ye i love grit i do and he held out his big brown hand to paul as if to bind a bargain  ill certainly help ye too said dottery ye have done a good turn this night which im not likely to forgit in a hurry  this colored man told us about our uncle and captain grady of his own free will said paul so if you can be a little easy on him on that account i wish you would be  stealin hosses aint no light crime growled dottery  an it dont improve a mans reputation to become a sneak added jack blowfen  yet after some talk it was agreed to hold jeff jones merely as a prisoner for the present instead of carrying him to the nearest camp to be turned over to the vigilance committee  it was now so near morning that to think of retiring was out of the question the men began to smoke and blowfen stirred about getting breakfast at six oclock they dined  ill chain jones up as a prisoner in the house till we git back observed dottery when the meal was finished hell keep quiet if he knows when he is well off  this was done and then both house and outbuildings were made as secure as possible  ten minutes later paul chet and the two men were on their way on horseback to the winthrop ranch all were armed and ready for anything that might turn up  but not one of the number dreamed of the several surprises in store for them     chapter xxi  shooting a grizzly bear   i wonder if captain grady is alone or if he has a number of the gang with him observed paul as he rode alongside of his younger brother and just in front of the two men  most likely he is expecting trouble and has help at hand returned chet he knows well enough we wont give up our claim without a fight  its possible he thought to frighten us off until allen got back from san francisco  dont make any difference how much help he has broke in jack blowfen he aint no right to put ye out like a couple o dogs an he knows it  in this manner the talk went on until a little after noon when the locality known as demon hollow was reached  do you remember the badger paul laughed chet the hollow looks different in the daylight doesnt it  yes indeed but stillwhat was that  jumpin june bugs cried jack blowfen dottery did ye hear that  i did replied the old ranch owner and he clutched his gun apprehensively  i heard something said chet what was it  a bar boy sure ez ye are borna grizzly  oh  at once the little party came to a halt to the right of them was a tall overhanging rock to the left a number of prickly bushes ahead and behind was the winding and uneven road along which their animals had come on a walk  do ye see old ephraim asked jack blowfen as he too got his gun in readiness  i dont see anything declared paul  bang it was chets gun which spoke he fired up toward the top of the overhanging rock scarcely had the shot rung out than a fearful roar of mingled pain and rage rent the air  shot him by jupiter cried caleb dottery stand from under quick  hardly had the word been given than there was another roar then a heavy weight filled the air and down into the road leaped a big brown and gray grizzly weighing all of eight hundred pounds  he came down between the boys and the two men and no sooner had he landed than dottery and blowfen opened fire on him both striking the beast in the shoulder and consequently doing but little damage for a grizzly bear is tough and can stand many shots which do not touch his vital parts  the horses much scared backed in all directions some going into the bushes and others up against the rocks  more angry than before the grizzly half turned and then without warning raised up on his hind legs and made for chet whose horse was now flat upon the rocks having stumbled in his hasty retreat chet himself was partly in and partly out of the saddle when the charge was made  run chet run yelled paul he is coming for you  in alarm he came up on foot his horse refusing to budge in the direction of the bear  the bear heard pauls voice and for the second paused and turned as if to make sure he was in no immediate danger from that quarter then he continued to advance upon chet  almost overcome with fear paul raised his gun and fired at the bears head it was a chance shot but luckily it hit the huge beast in the ear the bear howled with pain staggered forward a few feet and rolled over on his side  by this time dottery and blowfen had their pistols out leaping to the roadway they ran forward and in less than a minute the bear had received six pistol balls and was kicking in his death agony  it was paul who helped chet to his feet the boy was as white as a sheet and trembled so he could scarcely stand  ii thought i was a goner he stammered what a big fellow he is  the bar we war arfter last spring said jack blowfen to dottery as they examined the brute see those marks on his side where we tipped him a good job that he is out of the way  it was the second grizzly bear the boys had seen since they had lived in that section and they gazed at him curiously what white teeth he had and how powerful he looked even now that he was still and all was over chet hardly cared to touch him  i want to see no more of him he said  well i reckon hes the last in this neighborhood said caleb dottery hes the only one ive seen around in nigh on six years  it was decided to leave the bear where he was until they returned of course it was possible some wild animal might come up and make a feast in the meanwhile but this could not be helped to skin the animal and hang up the meat would take too long  leaving demon hollow they pushed along as rapidly as the horses would carry them  at the creek they stopped to water the animals and here also partook of the lunch which blowfen had packed up before starting  it was nightfall when they at last came in sight of the ranch home all seemed deserted every building was tightly closed and so was the gate to the stockade  maybe he has thought better of it and skipped out said chet  there is our stuff still in the road returned paul pointing ahead  in a moment more they had reached the stockade all four rode straight up to the heavy wooden gate  ill have to jump over and unbar it said paul  be careful was caleb dotterys caution this may be a trap and  he had no need to say more  halt came from the yard behind the stockade stop where you are or ill fire on you  it was captain grady himself who spoke     chapter xxii  an important capture   of course paul made a prompt retreat it would have been worse than useless just then to have remained where he was with his hands on the stockade gate  the party outside could not see captain grady but from the direction of his voice they knew he was on the other side of the stockade at a point where several peep and gun holes covered the entrance  thats right you better git back went on the captain as paul retreated  see here grady what does this mean demanded caleb dottery as he advanced in the direction of the guard openings  it means that i have got possession of this ranch which rightfully belongs to me and i mean to keep it was the grim reply delivered with great force and distinctness  the winthrop boys deny yer rights  that makes no difference i know whats what  open the gate and let us talk it over quietly went on dottery who was naturally a peaceably inclined individual  im not opening the gate just now those boys can go away i dont mind you coming around but i dont want those boys here  well youll have to put up with us cried chet angrily now open the gate or well smash it down  dont be rash chet whispered paul  you monkey roared captain grady fall back before i let you have a dose of buckshot  there will be no shooting here captain unless ye want ter get wiped out broke in jack blowfen open the gate fer yer neighbors and let us hev a powwow  ive told you wot ill doopen up when the boys go away  come on chet whispered paul to his younger brother  yes but paul  come on i say and paul whispered something into chets ear  at once with a wink at jack blowfen the two boys started off on a gallop toward the river  do you think we can do it asked chet anxiously  i think so we can try anyway  dismounting the brothers made their way to where a deep ditch drained from the ranch home under the stockade into the river the ditch was almost dry and was all but choked up with weeds and brush  now chet it is a serious undertaking but you know we must take some chances went on paul as they let themselves down into the ditch the captain may really shoot at us although i think he will hardly dare do it with blowfen and mr dottery at hand to see that justice is done  if he shoots well shoot back replied chet he has no right on our land and besides we must do something for uncle barnabys sake  full of determination and realizing that a crisis was at hand the two boys wormed their way along the ditch until the stockade was reached  here a few wooden bars blocked the way but one of the bars was loose and was wrenched aside and they went on  we must be careful in case any one is in the house said paul in a whisper  the ditch led around to the rear of the ranch home but here it went underground and they were compelled to leave it and take to the grass  they gave a brief look and saw captain grady down by the opening in the stockade still arguing with dottery and blowfen he looked anxious  he dont see us whispered diet come the front door is open and he made a quick dash for the house followed closely by paul  the door was closing on the pair when captain grady started around and beheld pauls form from the rear he gave a quick cry of alarm  stop come out  too late captain grady called back paul facing about and aiming at the man with his gun now just you go and open the stockade gate  thar aint no need o thet cried the voice of jack blowfen well done boys i give ye credit  and over the stockade vaulted the cowboy leaping from his saddle to the grass on the other side  captain grady knew not which way to turn and before he could decide the gate was unbarred and caleb dottery rode in  in the meantime chet had taken a hasty glance through the house and satisfied himself that captain grady was really alone there was evidence that several visitors had been there but recentlya number of unwashed dishes and drinking glasses  chet returned to the doorway and beheld captain grady in jack blowfens strong grasp the firearm had been wrenched from the captain and hurled a dozen feet away  thisthis is an outrage puffed the captain in a great rage  so is the way ye set up to treat neighbors replied the cow puncher coolly why didnt ye leave us in like gentlemen an thus avoid all trouble  the captain glared at him  what does this mean he demanded sullenly after a pause  can you hold him blowfen asked paul anxiously  i reckon paul but maybe ye might better keep him covered with yer gun  this means that we have come to take possession of our own put in chet we told you that we would be back  its aginst the law and ill have the sheriff on you shouted captain grady wrathfully  well chance that said paul march into the house please we want to question you a bit on another matter he continued  captain grady started what matter he asked in a lower tone of voice  about our uncle barnaby winthrop  dont know nothing of him was the reply and as he spoke captain gradys hand moved up to his inside breast pocket  instantly jack blowfen leaped upon the rascal and bore him to the earth     chapter xxiii  news of importance   dont be alarmed he is not going to shoot cried paul  dont ye make too shure o thet ejaculated the cowboy wots he puttin his hand into his pocket fer  he has something there i fancy he wishes to conceal went on paul empty the pocket please  let me go this is highway robbery stormed captain grady  he struggled fiercely to regain his feet but blowfen was the stronger of the pair and he easily held the rascal down with one hand while with the other he brought several letters from his inside pocket  paul eagerly snatched the letters in spite of the captains protest he glanced at them with chet looking over his shoulder  well what do you make out asked caleb dottery he didnt quite like the way matters were turning  i think we will be safe in making captain grady a prisoner replied paul slowly  yes make him a prisoner by all means put in chet he is a villain if ever there was one if we cant prove it i think my uncle barnaby can  at the reference to barnaby winthrop captain grady grew pale it was evident that his sins were at last finding him out  it did not take jack blowfen long to act upon pauls suggestion he disarmed the captain and made him march into the house where he bound the fellow in very much the same manner as dottery had bound jeff jones  while he was doing so paul showed the letters taken from the prisoner to caleb dottery chet while a second reading was going on commenced to ransack the house  the captain had moved but a few things into the ranch homea couple of chairs a table a bed and an old hair trunk the trunk chet opened without ceremony  more letters were found theredocuments which told only too plainly what manner of man the captain was chet smiled to himself to think how foolish the rascal had been not to have destroyed the epistles  but the greatest of villains occasionally overreach themselves he said to paul i fancy this is proof enough to show what an awfully bad man captain grady is  you are right chet said dottery after a careful examination he is a hoss thief as great as was old sol davids and he is trying to rob yer uncle out of a mine claim as well  not only that but as jeff jones said he is with the crowd who holds my uncle a prisoner sir that to me is the worst part of it  i dont know but what ye are right  the captain was raising such a row that to quiet him jack blowfen threw him bodily into a dark closet and turned the key on him  now if ye dont quit yer noise ill gag ye in the bargain said the cowboy and thereupon the captain became quiet at once  it was now quite in line to hold a council of war as paul termed it but before this was done all hands went to work to move the winthrop household effects back to where they belonged  this was accomplished in a short space of time and was productive of an accident which while not excessively serious was still of sufficient importance to cause a decided change in their plans  in moving in an old heavy bedstead caleb dottery allowed the end he held to slip from his grasp a sharp corner came down on his ankle twisting it severely he cried with pain and work was at once suspended  the ankle was bandaged but it was found the old ranch owner could not walk nor could he move about with any degree of comfort he was placed on a couch and there he remained  the four talked matters over for a long while in one of captain gradys letters was mentioned a certain cave in the vicinity of what was then known as the albany claim the boys fancied that their uncle might be a prisoner in that cave  well i dunno but what ye are right mused jack blowfen its sartinly wuth going to see  then you advise us to go asked paul eagerly  yes and ill go with ye  but mr dottery began chet  ill stay whar i am an watch the captain groaned the old ranch owner its about all im good for jes now  the old albany claim is a good stiff forty miles an more from hyer said jack blowfen but i know the road over the second foothills perfectly so if ye say the word any time well start  it looks like rain just now said paul  an yell catch it heavy too put in dottery  well have to look after the cattle too added chet like as not half of them are in the sink hole  ill help ye with the stock said blowfen  that evening it rained in torrents but only for a short while by midnight it was as clear as it could be long before sunrise the boys and blowfen were out on the range looking up the heads belonging to the winthrops  they were gratified to find that all the stock was safe with a single exception that was an old cow who had been caught in the cyclone and killed not one of the fourfooted beasts had gone anywhere near the sink hole  when let out of the closet captain grady begged hard for his liberty but the boys were obdurate and caleb dottery backed them up as did jack blowfen  ye have done wrong an must suffer said the latter and there the matter rested  by nine oclock the two boys and blowfen were off they took with them enough provisions to last several days as the journey upon which they were about to enter would be for the greater part through a dry and unproductive section this same section has now been made by a system of irrigation very productive  and now to find uncle barnaby and bring our enemies to terms cried paul as they rode out of the stockade  so say i and may uncle be found well added chet  amen murmured jack blowfen     chapter xxiv  something about barnaby winthrop   my uncle a prisoner about ten miles from here repeated allen winthrop after lou slavin had made his confession  will you shut up howled bluckburn savagely youll spoil everything  an hell save hisself from bein lynched added old ike watson suggestively  we havent done anythingyou cant hold us spluttered bluckburn he found himself in a bad corner  holding a man a prisoner is nothing i presume said allen in deep anger go on he continued to slavin where is my uncle  thus urged lou slavin blurted out a full confession telling how barnaby winthrop had been followed to san francisco by bluckburn who wanted to learn the secret of the new claim which bluckburn realized must be valuable  slavin said it was bluckburn who had sent to barnaby winthrop a forged letter calling the old prospector back to the ranch the rascal had also forged the note received by noel urner  word had been sent by telegraph to the other members of the thieving band and when barnaby winthrop got off at the nearest railroad station to the ranch he was followed and waylaid  the crowd had a mighty hard time o it with him he fit so went on slavin onct he nearly got away but captain grady tripped him up an then he war bound tight  captain grady ejaculated allen  thets his size cried old watson i allers allowed as how he war one o the shady class  hehe led the whole business put in bluckburn he began to think it time to clear himself i only acted under his orders  its too late fer ye ter open yer mouth was the way ike watson cut him short go on slavin whars barnaby winthrop straight now remember  thus admonished slavin told the location of the cave in which the old prospector was held as well as he was able  i dont know the lay o the land exactly but im comin purty nigh it  would you know the spot if you were in the vicinity asked allen eagerly  i think i would  then we must take him along said the young ranchman to ike watson but what shall we do with bluckburn  he ought ter be lynched right now was the old hunters stern reply during his days among the rough characters of the mountains he and his companions had had small use for jails and lockups the law of the land so called was administered on the spot  a long discussion followed which ended in a determination to take bluckburn back to daddy wampoles place they would leave him there a prisoner and then take slavin along with them that he might locate barnaby winthrops place of confinement  bluckburn was secured on his horses back and slavin was disarmed and in less than half an hour the return to the crossroads hotel was begun  it was a long and tedious ride to allen who was impatient to be off to find his uncle but it could not be helped and allen bore it as patiently as he was able  daddy wampole was as much surprised as he well could be to see them ride up with their prisoner he listened with deep interest to the tale allen watson and noel urner had to tell  yes ill keep him a prisoner he said at the conclusion an take my word on it he shant escape  and it wont be long before we have captain grady too said allen never dreaming of what was taking place at home in the meanwhile  bluckburn was exceedingly downcast over his turn of fortune he insisted that captain grady was totally to blame but this statement no one felt inclined to believe  slavin showed himself more than willing now to do all in his power to redeem himself and his reputation yet neither ike watson nor allen could trust him with so much as a pistol  you jes ride on ahead an if thars any trouble well look out fer ye was the way watson put it and with this slavin had to be content  a long and exceedingly rough journey now lay before the three a journey destined to try their patience to the utmost  but we will have to make the best of it said allen and i dont care what we have to put up with so long as we find my uncle safe and sound  thets the talk answered watson cant expect ter have every comfort out in these yere parts nohow  the sun had been shining brightly but presently the sky became overcast  unless i am mistaken we are close to a storm observed noel as he surveyed the heavens anxiously  thets wot came from watson an i allow as how it will be a putty heavy one when it comes  weve had storms enough lately said allen i want no more of them  they continued on their way as rapidly as the nature of the ground to be covered permitted occasionally slavin grumbled at being pushed on so fast but watson soon put a stop to his mutterings  no ust ter grumble slavin he said ye kin be thankful thet ye wasnt shot down like a dog  but im not feelin well pleaded the evil doer  aint ye wall what ye want is exercise was watsons sarcastic rejoinder so trot along an no more parley about it and slavin went along but with a face that looked far from pleasant  half an hour later the raindrops began to fall at first scatteringly and then in a steady downpour it was a cold rain and made one and another of the little party shiver  i must say i dont like this said allen when he was more than half soaked through i wonder if we cant find shelter until the worst of this is over  perhaps we can said noel although i dont see many large trees handy  might be as hows thars a cave around said watson anyway well keep our eyes peeled fer one  this they did and a quarter of a mile further on came to something of a cliff overlooking a rocky valley at the base of the cliff were a number of rough openings and one of these openings led to a cave of no mean size  jes the ticket cried watson as he dismounted and entered the opening we can stay here all night an by thet time the storm will be a thing o the past we aint none too soon either he added  watson was right for scarcely had all of the party entered the cavern than the storm let down in all of its fury the landscape was blotted out and all became darker than ever  ye set down on thet rock commanded watson to slavin an dont ye dare ter stir if ye know when yer well off  i aint stirrin growled the prisoner  nevertheless although he spoke thus slavin had his eyes wide open he intended to escape if it were possible to do so fearing that all would not go well with him even though he had confessed to his captors     chapter xxv  fighting a wolverine   i think we had better make a fire suggested allen after the horses had been tied up in a place that was comparatively dry  right ye air allen returned watson pervidin we can find some firewood  here is a tree branch said noel pointing it out in a dark corner of the cavern but we may have some trouble in breaking it up  ho ho laughed watson its easy ter see ye aint very strong well break thet up in a jiffy eh slavin  what do ye want growled the prisoner  want ye ter help break up some firewood  me  persackly slavin reckon as how ye want ter git as warm as anybody wall ye kin start in by doin some work  slavin demurred but his protest was unavailing and soon he and watson were breaking up the large part of the tree branch noel looking on in wonder and allen assisting on the smaller portions  my but you are strong said noel in open admiration id give a good deal for your muscles  yell get the same if ye stay out hyer long enough answered watson its the mountain air as does it  oh come watson you know you are extra strong put in allen why he can do some wonderful things when he wants to to this watson made no reply but the grin on his face showed that he appreciated the compliment  soon they had a roaring fire which threw grotesque shadows on the cavern walls all drew closer to enjoy the warmth and they prepared a meal to which even slavin did full justice  they questioned the prisoner closely and he said he felt certain he was on the right trail but he was shy about saying more he was wondering if the coming night would offer any opportunity of escaping  ill get away if i can he thought and if so i must lose no time in warning mangle and nodley if i dont theyll be running into a trap and my share of that stolen money will be lost  after the meal allen and watson remained near the entrance to the cave to talk over the situation and speculate upon what the day following would bring forth  slavin wanted to join them but allen ordered him back  you go back to the fire he said if you want to go to sleep you may do so  dont trust me even yet do ye muttered the prisoner  i do not  yere rather hard on a chap wot is trying ter do ye a good turn  it remains to be seen if it is a good turn or not slavin you may be putting up a job on us  no i swear its all right winthrop yell find everything jest as i told ye  perhaps but you go back to the fire and slavin went back but with a look on his face that rivaled the black clouds in the heavens outside  soon the prisoner was curled up close to the fire and he closed his eyes as if in slumber but he kept as wide awake as before  while allen and watson were talking at the entrance to the cavern noel out of idle curiosity procured a torch from the camp fire and went on a tour of observation  the cavern proved to be a narrow and rambling affair being nothing more or less than a split in the mountain side the floor was uneven and back from the entrance arose in a series of rough steps  up these steps climbed the young man until he had gained a position fully fifty feet above the mouth of the cavern  at a great distance he heard the falling of water as the rain swept over some rocks at a rear entrance to the cavern  curious to see where the cavern led to be continued his climbing until the light of the camp fire was left far behind  his torch was burning low but he whirled it into a blaze and went on once more  occasionally he slipped for the rocks were now wet but this did not daunt him  at last he reached a spot where the water was flowing in a miniature waterfall there was an opening over his head but it was out of reach  this must be a pretty place in the daylight he mused what grand scenery on every hand throughout this state  of a sudden more than the usual amount of water came down and some of it hit the torch extinguishing it instantly  confound the luck he murmured and felt in his pocket for a match  while he was searching for the article he heard a strange noise overhead close to the waterfall  he listened and the noise was followed by the unmistakable growl of a wild beast  a wolverine had strayed close to the waterfall and had slipped on the rocks to a shelf below  for a few seconds the ferocious beast clung to the ledge then slipped again and landed at noels feet  the wolverine is one of the most ferocious beasts to be met with anywhere it is not unlike the bear in general makeup but has a more pointed head and a bushy tail it is said that generally speaking a wolverine will not eat anything else if it can get meat  as soon as the wolverine smelled the presence of a human being he let out a growl that seemed to strike to noels very backbone  letting the match he had pulled from his pocket drop the young man felt for his pistol and brought forth the weapon with all possible speed  bang the weapon was discharged and the bullet clipped the wolverine on the left side of the head then with a snarl that was almost a scream the ferocious animal hurled itself upon noel  help help cried the young man  he felt that he was in an exceedingly perilous position and that assistance was absolutely necessary in the darkness he thought he had been attacked by a mountain bear  the wolverine managed to reach his shoulder but noel made a quick twist and freed himself then the young man fired a second shot  the wolverine was now hit in the side but the wound was far from fatal or even serious and it only made the creature scream louder with blazing eyes and gleaming teeth it crouched low and prepared to spring for noels throat  the young man knew that almost all wild beasts are fearful of fire but he did not know how the beast before him regarded water yet as he fired a third shot he stepped close up to the rocks so that the water from the fall might pour over his person  the third report echoed throughout the cavern as loudly as had the others while the bullet flew a foot over the wolverines head then the savage beast made a second leap at noel and caught the young man by the arm the weight of the animal made noel lose his balance and man and wolverine rolled over on the cavern floor together     chapter xxvi  disappearance of slavin   whats that  the exclamation came from allen as he broke off short in his conversation with watson  the cry from noel had reached his ears and the cry was quickly followed by the first of the pistol shots  hes in trouble thets wot cried the old hunter hark thars another shot  he bounded back to the camp fire but quick as was his movement allen was ahead of him both felt that noels peril must be extreme  get a torch cried watson and caught up a burning brand  what of slavin questioned allen but then as the second shot rang out he waited no longer but with a torch in one hand and his gun in the other he darted up the rocky steps as fast as he could watson was beside him with pistol drawn his gun resting on the side of the cave below  it took but a few seconds to gain the vicinity of the little waterfall but before they came up they heard the third shot and another yell from noel  my gracious burst from allens throat as he beheld the awful scene  noel was lying partly on his back with one foot pressed against the wolverines stomach the wild beast still held the young man by the arm  allen realized that whatever good was to be done must be done instantly and without stopping to think twice he blazed away at the wolverine twice in quick succession watson likewise fired and the creature was struck each time with a yelp that was almost human the wolverine turned let go his hold on noel and leaped for allen  take care yelled watson and then fired another shot just as the wolverine unable to reach allens throat made a clutch at his left leg the shot from the old hunter took the beast directly in the right eye piercing his brain and he fell over like a lump of lead to move no more  a close shave fer ye remarked watson when he saw that allen was uninjured a big one too he went on shoving the wolverine with his foot how are ye urner  ii guess i am not much hurt gasped noel when he felt able to speak the beast bit me in the arm though  its lucky he wasnt after gittin at yer throat i knowed a man onct as got a nip in the throat from a wolverine that made him pass in his checks then an thar  it was a terrible encounter i thought i was a goner sure  didnt you have a torch questioned allen  i did but the water struck it and put it out  the darkness was what made the critter so bold remarked watson theyre afeered o fire jes like most o wild beasts  oh my we forgot slavin burst suddenly from allens lips ill wager a horse he has dusted out  yere right returned watson and began to make his way back to the camp fire with all speed and with allen close beside him noel was too weak to run and had to walk he was still very white and his limbs trembled under him because of the unusual excitement  the camp fire gained it needed but a single glance around to convince them that slavin had indeed gone  took my shootin iron too consarn him ejaculated ike watson what fools we wuz ter leave him yere alone  we saved noels life by the operation answered allen  thets so too but  you hate to see him get away so do i andlook  what now  he has taken one of the horses too  allen was right the best of the horses was gone  he aint got much o a start said watson so let us git arfter him hotfooted  i am with you on that watson he must not get away under any circumstances if he does  we wont be able to git on the trail o yer uncle  thats it  both were soon in the saddle and shouted back to noel to keep the fire burning and wait for their return then away they dashed into the midnight darkness  the storm still continued and the rain poured down with a steadiness that was dismal enough to contemplate but to the discomfort allen gave scant heed  he must not get away he said to himself over and over again we must capture him and make him take us to where the gang have uncle barnaby a prisoner  right ye air allen  to follow a trail under such circumstances was not easy yet they found some tracks in the soft dirt directly in front of the cliff and these led on the back trail and then to where there was a deep ravine between the rocky slopes of the mountains  half a mile was covered and watson called a halt  ye want ter go slow yere he cautioned i dont like the looks o this territory nohow  what is wrong with it  full o holes fer one thing and water under the surface well go slow and they did  occasionally it lightened and by the flashes of light they made out a fringe of woods skirting the hollow the wind was coming up and this swept through the trees with a mournful sound  they were moving with care when they heard a sudden yell ahead it was slavin calling to his horse  back up they heard him cry back hang ye de ye want ter pitch me in a hole and then followed a savage muttering they could not make out  weve got him cried watson comebut be careful be careful  im going to dismount said allen and did so and led his steed forward along the trail which the rain had made slippery and treacherous  watson likewise got down and they now had to wait for another flash of lightning to show them just where they were as the flash came allen gave a look ahead  well i never he ejaculated  wot did ye see came quickly from the old hunter  slavin has tumbled down and the horse with him  then weve got the rascal sure  they plunged forward again the trail was narrower than ever and the gully or hollow was on one side and a fringe of mountain brush on the other  presently they heard something which served to increase their surprise slavin was groaning as if in extreme pain  the fall hurt him said allen look after my horse will you i am going ahead  he hurried on around a slight turn of the trail and through a clump of bushes and trees growing close to the edge of the hollow as he emerged from the bushes a sight met his gaze that thrilled him to the backbone  slavin had fallen over the edge of the trail at a point where lay a huge halfrotted trunk of a tree the trunk of the tree had slipped in the wet rolled partly over the man and was slowly but surely crushing the life out of him     chapter xxvii  allen shows his bravery   slavin  helhelp gasped the poor wretch help for the love of heaven help me  how did you get under the tree trunk  my horse kicked me and i fell i tried to save myself from going into the hollow please help me  thets wot ye git fer runnin away put in watson who had appeared on the scene  dontdont talk save me was slavins only answer  well do what we can for you returned allen  yet even as he spoke he realized how difficult not to say dangerous was the task which lay before him  should he attempt to roll the log over it might catch him just as it had caught the suffering wretch now under it  take care allen warned watson the bank here is mighty slippery  i know it was the answer watson can you hold yonder branch  wait till i tether the hosses  this was done as quickly as possible and then the old hunter caught hold of the branch allen had mentioned  allen got down under the lower end of the fallen tree and caught slavin by the arm  cant you turn over he asked  iicant budge was the low answer and then with a groan the prisoner became insensible  he has fainted cried allen to watson pull on that branch for all you are worth  im apullin  still the tree trunk did not budge for one end was embedded in the mud lying on the edge of the bank  allen was determined to save the poor wretch who was slowly but surely having his chest crushed in by the sinking tree finding he could not move the tree he called on watson to hold fast as before  ye cant do nothin allen protested the old hunter come away afore the tree rolls over an crushes ye too  it wont roll if you hold fast allen answered  yes it will when it starts i cant git nothin ter brace agin here  well im going to do my best and you must hold back as long as you can was the answer  getting down on his knees allen began to scoop away the loose dirt with his hands working directly under slavins body it was hard work and broke his finger nails but he kept on and at last had quite a hole made  now hold hard im going to pull he shouted to watson and the old hunter held as hard as he could then allen pulled with might and main and at last had the satisfaction of getting the senseless body of slavin free from its awful pressure  quick the tree is agoin came from watson give me yer hand  he reached forth and at the same time the tree began to slide down the hollow directly in allens pathway allen had slavin in his arms by this time he made a leap and got on top of the tree and just as the trunk went down watson caught him and held tight  a close call an no error cried watson when allen was safe on the trail once more ye came within an ace o goin into the hollow with the tree on top o ye  i guess slavins pretty badly hurt said allen when he could get back his breath that trunk had him pinned down for fair he would have been crushed in another minute or two what shall we do with him  wait till i catch his hoss an well take him back to the cave answered watson  to catch the animal was not difficult and close at hand they found the gun slavin had stolen then while allen carried the firearms and led one horse and rode another watson took up the unconscious man in his arms and followed on his own steed to the cave  they found noel sitting by the fire nursing his lacerated arm the wound was an ugly affair but by no means dangerous and after it was washed and bandaged it felt a great deal better although the arm was bound to be stiff for several weeks to come and sore in the bargain  got him i see remarked the young man as he glanced at slavin whats the trouble did you have to shoot him  no he got under a fallen tree answered allen  the unconscious man was placed in a comfortable position near the fire which was heaped up with fresh wood that all might dry themselves and watson went to work to restore slavin  this was no mean task and it was a good half hour before the man opened his eyes to stare about him  iiwhere am i he stammered  yer safe answered watson laconically  that treedid i go over into the hollow  no  how did i escape  allen winthrop saved ye  he did  yes slavin hes yer best friend if ye only know it went on the old hunter warmly  but idontdont understand  in a few words watson explained the situation to which slavin listened with much interest then his eyes rested on allen  im much erbliged ter ye he said slowly and his manner showed he meant it  you were a fool ter try ter git away went on watson  i know thetnow muttered the hurt one  dont ye know i would have plugged ye on sight  would ye  sartain shur slavin  wall i wont give ye another chance responded slavin with a heavy sigh  ye wont git the chance ye mean said the old hunter significantly  all right jes as ye please watson but if thet young feller saved my life why im  what  im going to make it up ter him thets all  do you mean that you will lead us without any further trouble questioned allen eagerly  thets wot i do mean an ill swear ter it if ye want me ter added slavin solemnly  you neednt swear slavin  but i mean it winthrop i may be a bad man but i aint so allfired bad as ter forgit a man when he does me a good turn went on the sufferer with increased earnestness  well i will take you at your word  but i cant go on just yet ive got a terrible pain in my breast here  i suppose you have we shant move tonight and maybe not tomorrow it will depend upon how noel urner feels  oh ill go on said noel but i think a little rest here will do us all good he added thoughtfully  yes ye all need it put in watson an now i want all o ye to turn in an git some sleep ill stay on guard  but not all night insisted allen wake me at two or three oclock  and so it was arranged     chapter xxviii  a buffalo stampede   allen went on duty at three oclock and remained on guard until six when the others awoke  the sun was showing itself in the east and all that remained of the storm were a few scattering drops  how do you feel asked allen of noel  fairly well although the arm is stiff allen and the young man continued what shall we do with the wolverine  nothing unless you want the pelt  i never want to see the beast again said noel with a shudder for which allen could not blame him  then let him lie for the other wild beasts to feed upon  when watson arose allen had breakfast ready and all ate without delay even slavin got around but it was plain to see that he was suffering  i want ter show ye i mean ter do what i said he told allen ill go on if i drop in my tracks  we wont start just yet slavin answered allen and when we do well take it rather easy both for your benefit and for mr urners  it was past ten oclock when they left the cave their horses were much refreshed by the rest taken and despite slavins hurts fair progress was made along the foothills  it was a lonely section of the state through which they were traveling and allen could not help mentioning this fact to ike watson but at his words the old hunter merely laughed  lonely he snorted gosh all hemlock allen it aint half as lonely as it used ter be not by a jugful why i remember the time ye could ride fer days an days an see nuthin but buffalo or some other wild critters  the buffalo are almost all gone now arent they  putty much an its a great shame too fer they were fine game but them sports used ter come out west an kill em off by the score worse luck didnt want em fer nuthin either and watson shook his head sorrowfully  were you ever caught in a buffalo stampede ike  onct allen onct an its an experience ill never fergit as long as i live  i should like to hear the particulars  thet aint really much ter tell allen i wuz out on crazy tom mountain at the time reckon ye know the place  fairly well  well it wuz while the buffalo had been over to the fork grazin wuznt very good thet season an the critters wuz rather ugly in consequence  yes ive heard they get bad when their feed is cut short  as i wuz sayin i wuz up alongside o crazy tom mountain looking fer bar an i had jes struck a fine trail when i heered a curious sound on the tudder side o the hill i couldnt make it out nohow at fust but bymeby i thought it must be buffalo an i wuz right  did they come right down on you  no worse luck they didnt if they hed i might have scooted to one side or tudder but instead o comin straight over the mountaintains high ye rememberthey came around on both sides an afore i knowed it i wuz right in the middle o em  what did you do asked allen as watson paused reflectively  at fust i didnt know what ter do persackly i shot one of em but bless ye thet wuznt nuthin and i calkerlated as how id have ter ride fer it then of a sudden my hoss got scared and shot me over his head into a big thorn bush and made off like a streak o greased lightnin leaving me alone  with the buffalo all around you  jes so moren twenty o em an moren a hundred others comin up fast as they could leg it i kin tell ye i wuz in a fix an no error  it must have hurt you to land in the thorn bush  hurt wall say it wuz like bein dumped into a pit full o daggers that wuz haint fergot the awful stickin pain yit an never will but bein chucked into thet thorn bush saved my life  didnt the buffalo touch the bush  nary a one they would come up close on a dead run an then shy like a skittish hoss afore a bit o white paper time an agin i thought one would heave hisself atop o me an squash me but the time didnt come say but it wuz a sight that wuz went on watson earnestly them buffalo was mad clean stark mad and trampled all over each other the stampede at thet pint didnt last more n three minutes an arfter it wuz over thar wuz five buffalo dead less than four yards away from me  tramped to death by the others  yes smashed up too ye never saw sech a sight arfter thet ye can calkerlate i keep clear o all other stampedes concluded the old hunter  talking over one thing and another the party moved along until about one oclock when a halt was made for dinner  allen found that noel was suffering but little but his arm was well bandaged slavin however was pale  you need a rest slavin he said kindly  i reckon ye air right was the faint response didnt calkerlate ter git sech an allgone feelin  well rest until the worst of the heat is over eh ike  jes as ye say answered the old hunter  they found an inviting spot in a small grove of trees close to a spring and a brook and proceeded to make themselves comfortable slavin was glad enough to drop into a light doze  hes a changed man unless i miss my guess said allen to noel  i think you are right allen that adventure took him so close to death i fancy it rather awakened his conscience  i hope he does turn over a new leaf he doesnt appear such a bad fellow at heart  you are right i suppose some men get bad out here simply because they havent any good example to follow they cut loose from their old associates and fall in with the wrong sort  thats just it and its so much easier to find the wrong sort than the right sort some men think life altogether too slow unless they are doing something against the law  allen as he rested could not help but think of his two brothers what were chet and paul doing he sincerely trusted all was going well with them  they ought to be old enough to take care of themselves said noel you mustnt worry too much on their account  well we have to be on guard out here night and day noel you really dont know who to trust  oh i know that  just think of what my uncle has suffered and of what he may be suffering this minute it is enough to make ones blood boil  it may not be as bad as you imagine allen your uncle must know a thing or two  of course but one man cant do much against three or four or half a dozen those rascals will do all in their power to bring him to terms rest assured of that  well i am willing to push on at any time you say  ill push on as fast as slavin can travel i cant do more than that if he caves in on our hands well have no means of finding out anything more about my uncles whereabouts  he cant be shamming can he  not a bit of it he was caught under the tree and i wouldnt have been in his position for a thousand dollars  then dont push him any harder than you dare to me he looks like a fellow who might be getting a fever  i noticed that but i hope he doesnt concluded allen  but the fever was coming and by nightfall all of the others saw that slavin was in a bad way he sat up and began to talk wildly  let me go take the tree from me he cried i havent got the money oh how do ye do mr winthrop glad to see me eh and how is that new mine an what kind of a trade are ye goin to make with captain grady eh ha ha the cave by the seven pines a good hiding place the seven pines let me go the tree is crushing me and then he fell back almost exhausted  he wont travel any more not jes yet said watson soberly hes up agin a long spell o sickness  did you hear what he said about captain grady asked allen  i did he must be in this game too an the seven pines  the cave must be at a place called the seven pines said noel  if it is i think i know the spot answered ike watson i ran across em seven pines two years ago they air about two miles from here on the other side o the mountain well have ter go around ter git ter em  an hour later allen and watson left slavin in noel urners care and struck out for the place on the other side of the mountain which the old hunter had mentioned     chapter xxix  the long lost found   before leaving camp both allen and ike watson saw to it that their weapons were in good condition and ready for immediate use  no tellin what we may run up aginst said the old hunter  well i am ready to fight if it comes to that returned allen grimly but i would rather take the enemy by surprise  thet would be the best way allen but fust we must locate thet cave  the ride around the mountain was a rather trying one and from a gallop they had to slow down to a walk in some spots the trail was much cut up and the mud was deep while in others they had to pick their way over rocks which were as smooth as they were dangerous  look thar said watson as he paused on a spur of the rocks thars a tumble fer ye  he pointed to a canyon all of five hundred feet deep and allen had to draw back after looking into the awful depth  if a fellow should tumble here he would never live to tell it said the young ranchman this would be a bad trail to follow in the dark  moving away from the spur of rocks overlooking the canyon they turned to the northwest and plunged through a forest of cedar and hemlock here the wild birds were numerous and allen was tempted to bring some of them down with his gun but watson demurred  no use o makin too much noise he explained remember somebody may be on guard up at thet cave  slavin said he thought only an old woman had been left in chargea woman who claimed to be darry nodleys wife  didnt know as how thet rascal hed a wife  that is what slavin said  it might be the truth and then agin it might not we dont want ter believe too much allen  i agree with you ike but i think slavin was really anxious to help us after we did him that good turn  the old hunter shrugged his shoulders perhaps but ive seen too much foul play in my time ter trust everybody thar may be a woman up thar an thar may be some menfolks too  so the talk ran on and they gradually drew closer to where the old hunter had once seen the seven pine trees to one not used to a life in the open to remember such a locality after two years absence would have been difficult but it was not so with ike watson  cant fool me on a thing like this he said flatly onct i see a place it hangs in my mind forever same way with a trail why onct i struck a trail in the south o the state kind o a mixed trail too i didnt see thet trail fer nigh onto six years but when i did see it agin i knew it jes as quick as i clapped eyes on it  i believe you replied the young ranchman you have an eye like a hawk and in that allen was right  the sun was sinking low in the west when they came out of a defile in the rocks and the old hunter pointed to a valley on the opposite side of the foothills below them  do ye see them over thar he questioned  allen gave a long look  i doseven pines sure enough  told ye id remember the spot cried watson triumphantly  but where is the cave went on the young ranchman  like as not its close by come before the sun goes down an it gits too dark  soon they were making their way along the foothills at the lower side of the mountain they had to pass through considerable brush and while they were doing this watson suddenly halted and pointed to his side  what is it asked allen as he also halted  if thet aint a putty fresh trail then i miss my guess  it does look fresh ike  aint over twentyfour hours old nohow went on the old hunter allen i reckon we have struck it about right  but i see nothing of a cave  let us follow the trail the cave may not be persackly by the pines but in sight o them do ye see  i do  thet trail is almost in the direction i wuz goin continued watson so we wont miss much if we go wrong forward it is  and again they struck out this time with increased confidence as they progressed the old hunter examined the hoof marks from time to time and said he was certain two horsemen had passed that way  but just as they were coming to the end of the foothills they reached a mountain water course and here the trail came to an abrupt end  we are stumped now said allen after both had crossed to the other side of the stream  i aint agivin up jes yet answered watson  oh neither am i but where has the trail gone to  let us move down the stream a bit suggested the old hunter i dont think the hossmen who made thet trail would stick ter the water very long  on they went once more and now in silence for both felt that the cave might be close at hand the seven pines were still in view standing upon a hillock by themselves  at last they came to a spot where the water course broadened out into a tiny lake at this point there was another brook coming down from a spring upon the hillside  the trail cried allen presently and pointed it out  right ye air allen returned watson an i reckon we air gittin close ter the end on it too he added suggestively  but little more was said and they quickly followed the trail up to where a wall of rocks arose standing boldly out from the foothills and facing the seven pines  if i aint mistaken thars a cave over yonder whispered watson pointing with his hand  forward we go cried allen and dashed ahead with his weapon ready for use two minutes later a turn of the trail brought them into plain view of a large cave in the cliff side  eureka began watson when allen checked his speech  somebody is coming he whispered a woman get behind the brush  he led the way and watson followed and both waited with bated breath presently a woman passed them carrying an empty water bucket she was bound for the spring just mentioned  that must be the woman slavin mentioned went on allen in a low voice  like as not whispered the old hunter in return shall we capture her  nowait  they waited and presently the woman came back with the bucket full of water she entered the cavern without looking around her  let us follow her on foot suggested allen and they tied up their horses soon the entrance to the cave was gained and they peered inside  for the moment they could see but little for there was only a low fire burning in the cavern then of a sudden allen let out a wild cry  look look there is my uncle barnaby tied fast to the rear wall     chapter xxx  together at lastconclusion   allen spoke the truth there tied by strong ropes to a projecting rock was the uncle of the winthrop boys  his face was pale and haggard showing he had suffered much since his confinement  forgetting the woman allen dashed forward  uncle barnaby how glad i am that we have found you he cried loudly  who is that the prisoner sprang up from where he was resting allen  yes uncle are you not glad to see me  glad is not a strong enough word my boy was the reply from barnaby winthrop and as soon as allen had released him he caught his nephew in his arms i was praying to be rescued  they have not treated you well i can see that uncle  they have used me worse than a dog they wanted to get my secret from me and used every means in their power to accomplish their purpose  but they did not succeed did they  no i told them i would die rather than allow the scoundrels to get rich through my instrumentality  a scuffle behind them stopped the conversation ike watson was trying to secure the woman who was struggling desperately to get away  by biting and scratching the desperate female at last freed herself from the old hunters grasp then she bounded for the cave entrance watson aimed his gun at her and then lowered the weapon  reckon i wont he drawled never did shoot at a woman an im too old ter begin now she dont count anyhow  and thus the woman was allowed to escape she lost no time in quitting the vicinity  the old hunter shook hands warmly with barnaby winthrop who was profuse in his thanks to watson for what he had accomplished  you shall lose nothing by what you have done ike he said just wait till i open up that new claim  speaking of the claim there is somebody else to see you began allen when the talk was interrupted by the clattering of horses hoofs on the rocks outside  saul mangle and darry nodley exclaimed allen as he glanced down the stony trail they are coming here too  they belong to the gang said barnaby winthrop  reckon ez how we can receive em all right put in ike watson dryly  as quickly as possible barnaby winthrop was provided with firearms  my gracious  it was allen who let out the cry loud enough for those who were approaching to hear  whats up asked his uncle  look back of them  all did so and then a shout went up there only a few hundred yards to the rear were chet and paul trying their best to run down the horse thieves whom they had discovered but a short five minutes before  weve got em corralled said watson grimly  look there is jack blowfen too ejaculated allen as the cowboy also came into view  halt  ike watson uttered the command  he ran into the open followed by the others  a shout went up from saul mangle and darry nodley and then another from those in the rear  there is allen  there is uncle barnaby  capture the horse thieves  the two rascals were bewildered and paused not knowing which way to turn  they were quickly surrounded and it was old ike watson who commanded them to throw down their weapons  at first they felt inclined to refuse but a glance at the stern faces about them caused them to comply  the jig is up muttered saul mangle and nodley groaned inwardly  there was another joyous greeting between uncle and nephews when paul and chet rode up  in the meanwhile jack blowfen assisted ike watson in making prisoners of mangle and nodley the latter asked for his wife and seemed disappointed to learn she could not share his captivity  allen and barnaby winthrop were glad to learn that captain grady was a prisoner  when i am done with him i warrant hell not give any of us further trouble said the uncle of the boys  before the party left the vicinity saul mangle and nodley were searched and from them were taken the seven hundred dollars which had been stolen from the ranch home as related at the beginning of this story  the prisoners were removed to daddy wampoles hotel and later on were placed in the hands of the sheriff the sheriff also took into custody captain hank grady and lou bluckburn the colored man jeff jones was by the advice of chet and paul allowed to go his own way on promise to turn over a new leaf slavin was taken to a hospital and later on let go  several years have passed since the events above recorded took place in that period of time many important changes have occurred  the horse thieves and wouldbe claim stealers were all duly tried according to law and are now serving various terms of imprisonment the ranch belonging to captain grady was confiscated by creditors from deadwood and sold to barnaby winthrop who turned it over to the three boys to add to the ranch already belonging to them  the winthrop mine is now in operation and is paying very well it is managed by barnaby winthrop himself and noel urner owns a large block of stock which he considers the best investment he ever made  caleb dottery and jack blowfen manage the ranch jointly in connection with their former work doing this on shares for the winthrop boys as for old ike watson he still roams the hills and mountains he can have a good home with barnaby winthrop any time he wishes but says he is not yet ready to settle down  and allen paul and chet the three boys are all in san francisco allen is in college and his two brothers are
