38592640	beechcroft at rockstone  by  charlotte m yonge     chapter i  a dispersion    a telegram  make haste and open it jane they always make me so nervous  i believe that is the reason reginald always will telegraph when he is coming said miss adeline mohun a very pretty well preserved though delicatelooking lady of some age about forty as her elder sister brisk and lively and some years older came into the room  no it is not reggie  it is from lily  poor lily  jasper accidentcome  poor dear lily  is it young jasper or old jasper i wonder  if it were young jasper she would have put japs  i am afraid it is her husband  if so she will be going off to him  i must catch the 1120 train  will you come ada  oh no i should be knocked up and on your hands  the suspense is bad enough at home  if it is old jasper we shall see in the paper today  i will send it down to you from the station  supposing it is sir jasper and she wants to go out to him we must take in some of the children  oh  dear little primrose would be nice enough but what should we do with that halfpenny woman  if we had the other girls i suppose they would be at school all day but surely some might go to beechcroft  and mind jane i will not have you overtasking yourself  do not take any of them without having gillian to help you  that i stipulate  jane mohun seemed as if she did not hear as these sentences were uttered at intervals while she stood dashing off postcards at her davenport  then she said on her way to the door  dont expect me tonight  i will send fanny to ask one of the wellands to come in to you and telegraph if i bring any one home with me  but jane dear  however the door was shut and by the time miss adeline had reached her sisters room the everready bag was nearly packed  i only wanted to say dear jane that you must give my love to dear lily  i am grievedgrieved for her but indeed you must not undertake anything rash  a shake of the head as the shoes went into their neat bag  do not let her persuade you to stay at silverfold in her absence  you cannot give up everything here  yes yes ada i know it does not suit you  never fear  it is not that but you are much too useful here to drop everything especially now every one is away  i would willingly sacrifice myself but  yes i know ada dear  now goodbye and take care of yourself and dont be nervous  it may mean only that young japs has twisted his little finger  and with a kiss miss mohun ran downstairs as fast and lightly as if her years had been half their amount and accomplished her orders to fannyotherwise mrs mounta beechcroft native who on being left a widow had returned to her former mistresses bringing with her a daughter who had grown up into an efficient housemaid  after a few words with her miss mohun sped on finding time at the station to purchase a morning paper just come down and to read among the telegrams                                              colombo sept 3rd lieutenantgeneral sir jasper merrifield gcb has been thrown from his horse and received severe injuries   she despatched this paper to her sister by a special messenger whom she had captured by the way and was soon after in the train knitting and pondering  at silverton station she saw the pony carriage and in it her niece gillian a girl not quite seventeen with brown eyes showing traces of tears  mamma knew you would come she said  you have heard direct of course  yes claude telegraphed  the horse fell over a precipice  papas leg and three ribs are broken  not dangerous  that is all it says and mamma is going out to him directly  i was quite sure she would  well gillian we must do the best we can  has she any plans  i think she waited for you to settle them  hal is come he wanted to go with her but she says it will cost too much and besides there is his ordination in advent  has she telegraphed to your uncles  to beechcroft and to stokesley but we dont quite know where uncle reginald is  perhaps he will see the paper  gillians tears were flowing again and her aunt said  come my dear you must not give way you must do all you can to make it better for your mother  i know she answered  indeed i didnt cry till i sat waiting and it all came over me  poor papa and what a journey mamma will have and how dreadful it will be without her  but i know that it is horrid of me when papa and my sisters must want her so much more  thats rightquite right to keep up before her  it does not sound to me so bad after all perhaps they will telegraph again to stop her  did claude ask her to come out  oh no  there were only those few words  no more could be learnt till the pony stopped at the door and hal ran out to hand out his aunt and beg her privately to persuade his mother to take him or if she would not consent to that at least to have macrae the old soldierservant with herit was not fit for her to travel alone  lady merrifield looked very pale and squeezed her sister close in her arms as she said  you are my great help jenny  and must you go  yes certainly  without waiting to hear more  there is no use in losing time  i cannot cross from folkestone till the day after tomorrow at night  i must go to london tomorrow and sleep at mrs merrifields  but this does not seem to me so very bad  oh no no but when i get there in three weeks time it will be just when i shall be most wanted  the nursing will have told on the girls and jasper will be feeling weary of being laid up and wanting to take liberties  and what will you be after such a journey  just up to keeping him in order  come you have too much sense to expostulate jenny  no you would wear yourself to fiddlestrings if you stayed at home i only want you to take hal or macrae  hal is out of the question i would not interfere with his preparation on any account  macrae would be a very costly article and moreover i want him to act majordomo here unless you would and that i dont dare to hope for  no you must not lily ada never feels well here nor always at brighton and emily would be too nervous to have her without me but we will take as many children as you please or we have room for  that is like you jenny  i know william will offer to take them in at home but i cannot send them without miss vincent and she cannot leave her mother who has had a sort of stroke  otherwise i should try leaving them here while i am away but the poor old lady is in no state for itin fact i doubt her living long  i know you have been governess by yourself these last weeks it will be well to relieve her  the best way will be for us to take mysie and valetta and let them go to the high school and there is a capital dayschool for little boys close to st andrews for fergus and gillian can go there too or join classes in whatever she pleases  my brownie  have you really room for all those  oh yes  the three girls in the spare room and dressingroom and fergus in the little room over the porch  i will write to fanny i gave her a hint  and i have no doubt that primrose will be a delight to her aunt alethea poor little dear  yes that makes it all easy for in the holidays i know the boys are sure of a welcome at the dear old home or hal might have one or two of them at his curacy  the gong sounded for the melancholy dinner that had to go on all the same and in the midst all were startled by the arrival of a telegram which macrae looking awestruck actually delivered to harry instead of to his mistress but it was not from ceylon  it was from colonel mohun from beechcroft coming 630  going with you send children here  never were twenty words including addresses more satisfactory  the tears came for the first time to lady merrifields eyes at the kindness of her brothers and harry was quite satisfied that his uncle would be a far better escort than himself or macrae  aunt jane went off to send her telegram home and write some needful letters and lady merrifield announced her arrangements to those whom they concerned  oh mamma dont exclaimed valetta all the guineapigs will die  i thought said gillian that we might stay here with miss vincent to look after us  that will not do in her mothers state  mrs vincent cannot be moved up here and i could not lay such a burthen on them  we would be very good said val  that i hope you will be any way but i think it will be easier at rockstone and i am quite sure that papa and i shall be better satisfied about you  maynt we take quiz asked fergus  and rigdum funnidos cried valetta  and ruff and ring chimed in mysie  my dear children i dont see how aunt jane can be troubled with any more animals than your four selves  you must ask her only do not be surprised or put out if she refuses for i dont believe you can keep anything there  off the three younger ones went gillian observing i dont see how they can unless it was quiz but mamma dont you think i might go to beechcroft with primrose  i should be so much quieter working for the examination there and i could send my exercises to miss vincent and then i should keep up prims lessons  your aunt alethea will i know like doing that my dear and i am afraid to turn those creatures loose on the aunts without some one to look after them and their clothes  fanny will be very helpful but it will not do to throw too much on her  oh  i thought they would have lois  there would not be room for her besides that i dont think it would suit your aunts  you and mysie ought to do all the mending for yourselves and fergus and what valetta cannot manage  i know you would rather be at beechcroft my dear but in this distress and difficulty some individual likings must be given up  yes mamma  lady merrifield looked rather dubiously at her daughter  she had very little time and did not want to have an argument nor to elicit murmurs yet it might be better to see what was in gillians mind before it was too late  mothers very fond of their own sisters cannot always understand why it is not the same with their daughters who inherit another element of inherited character and of another generation and who have not been welded together with the aunts in childhood  my dear she said you know i am quite ready to hear if you have any real reasonable objection to this arrangement  no mamma i dont think i have said gillian thoughtfully  the not liking always meeting a lot of strangers nor the general bustle is all nonsense i know quite well  i see it is best for the children but i should like to know exactly who is to be in authority over them  certainly aunt jane replied lady merrifield  she must be the ultimate authority  of course you will check the younger ones in anything going wrong as you would here and very likely there will be more restrictions  aunt ada has to be considered and it will be a town life but remember that your aunt is mistress of the house and that even if you do think her arrangements uncalled for it is your duty to help the others to submit cheerfully  say anything you please fully and freely in your letters to me but dont let there be any collisions of authority  jane will listen kindly i know in private to any representation you may like to make but to say before the children mamma always lets them would be most mischievous  i see said gillian  indeed i will do my best mamma and it will not be for very long  i hope and trust not my dear child  perhaps we shall all meet by easterpapa and all but you must not make too sure  there may be delays  now i must see halfpenny  i cannot talk to you any more my gillyflower though i am leaving volumes unsaid  gillian found aunt jane emerging from her room and beset by her three future guests  aunt jane may we bring quiz  and rigdum funnidos and lady rigdum  and ruff and ring  they are the sweetest doves in the world  doves  oh mysie they would drive your aunt ada distracted with coorooroo at four oclock in the morning just as she goes off to sleep  the rigdums make no noise but a dear little chirp triumphantly exclaimed valetta  do you mean the kittens  we have a vacancy for one cat you know  oh yes we want you to choose between artaxerxes and the sofy  but the rigdums are the eldest pair of guineapigs  they are so fond of me that i know poor old funnidos will die of grief if i go away and leave him  i sincerely hope not valetta for indeed there is no place to put him in  i dont think he would mind living in the cellar if he only saw me once a day piteously pleaded valetta  indeed val the dark and damp would surely kill the poor thing in spite of your attentions  you must make up your mind to separation from your pets excepting the kitten  valetta burst out crying at this last drop that made the bucket overflow but fergus exclaimed  quiz  aunt jane  he always goes about with us and always behaves like a gentleman dont you quizzy and the little maltese who perfectly well understood that there was trouble in the air sat straight up crossed his paws and looked touchingly wistful  poor dear little fellow said aunt jane yes i knew he would be good but kunz would be horribly jealous you see he is an only dog and cant bear to have his premises invaded  he ought to be taught better said fergus gravely  so he ought aunt jane confessed but he is too old to begin learning and aunt ada and mrs mount would never bear to see him disturbed  besides i really do not think quiz would be half so well off there as among his own friends and places here with macrae to take care of him  then as fergus began to pucker his face she added i am really very sorry to be so disagreeable  the children must not be unreasonable said gillian sagely as she came up  and i am to choose between xerxes and artaxerxes is it said aunt jane  no the sofy said mysie  a sofy is a persian philosopher and this kitten has got the wisest face  run and fetch them suggested her aunt and then we can choose oh she added with some relief at the thought if it is an object to dispose of cockie we could manage him  the two younger ones were gratified but gillian and mysie both exclaimed that cockies exclusive affections were devoted to macrae and that they could not answer for his temper under the separation to break up such a household was decidedly the goose fox and cabbage problem  as mysie observed in the course of the search for the kittens in the makethebestofit tone it was not so bad as the former moves when they were leaving a place for good and all  ah but no place was ever so good as this said poor valetta  dont be such a little donkey said fergus consequentially  dont you know we are going to school and i am three years younger than wilfred was  it is only a petticoat school said val kept by ladies  it isnt  it is i heard harry say so  and yours is all butchers and bakers and candlestick makers  on which they fell on each other each with a howl of defiance fergus grabbed at vals pigtail and she was buffeting him vehemently when harry came out held them apart and demanded if this were the way to make their mother easy in leaving them  she said it was a petpetpetticoat school sobbed fergus  and so it ought to be for boys that fight with girls  and he said mine was all butchers and bakers and candlestick makers whined valetta  then youd better learn manners or theyll take you for a tramp observed harry but at that moment mysie broke in with a shout at having discovered the kittens making a plaything of the best library penwiper their mother the sleek begum abetting them and they were borne off to display the coming glories of their deep fur to aunt jane  her choice fell upon the sofy as much because of the convenience of the name as because of the preternatural wisdom of expression imparted by the sweep of the black lines on the gray visage  mr pollocks landlady was to be the happy possessor of artaxerxes and the turbulent portion of the household was disposed of to bear him thither and to beg miss hacket to give buff and ring the run of her cage whence they had originally come also to deliver various messages and notes  by the time they returned colonel mohun was met in the hall by his sister  oh reggie it is too good in you were the words that came with her fervent kiss  remember how many years i have been seasoned to being cockit up on a baggage waggon  ought not such an old soldier as i to be able to take care of myself  and what would your husband say to you when you got there  and should not i catch it from william  well are you packing up the youthful family for beechcroft except that at rotherwood they are shrieking for mysie  i know how good william and alethea would be  this child pointing to primrose who had been hanging on her all day in silence is to go to them but as i cant send miss vincent educational advantages as the advertisements say lie on the side of rockstone so jenny here undertakes to be troubled with the rabble  but mysie  rotherwood met me at the station and begged me to obtain her from you  they really wish it  he does i have no doubt  so does madame la marquise  they have been anxious about little phyllis all the summer  she was languid and off her feed in london and did not pick up at home as they expected  my belief is that it is too much governess and too little play and that a fortnight here would set her up again  rotherwood himself thinks so and victoria has some such inkling  at any rate they are urgent to have mysie with the child as the next best thing  poor dear little fly ejaculated lady merrifield but i am afraid mysie was not very happy there last year  and what would be the effect of all the overdoing said miss mohun  mysie is tougher than that sprite and i suppose there is some relaxation said lady merrifield  yes the doctors have frightened them sufficiently for the present  i suppose mysie is a prescription poor child said her aunt in a tone that evoked from her brother  jealous jenny  well jane said lady merrifield you know how thankful i am to you and ada but i am inclined to let it depend on the letters i get tomorrow and the way victoria takes it  if it is really an earnest wish on that dear little flys account i could not withstand old rotherwood and though mysie might be less happy than she would be with you i do not think any harm will be done  everything there is sound and conscientious and if she picks up a little polish it wont hurt her  shall you give her the choice  i see no good in rending the poor childs mind between two affections especially as there will be a very short time to decide in for i shall certainly not send her if victorias is a mere duty letter  you are quite right there lily said the colonel  the less choice the greater comfort  well done sir soldier said his sister jane  i say quite right too only for my own sake i wish it had been valetta  so no doubt does she said the mother but unluckily it isnt and indeed i dont think i wish it  val is safer with you  as gillian expressed it the other day val does right when she likes it mysie does right when she knows it  you have the compliment after all jane said the colonel  lily trusts you with the child she doesnt trust  there was no doubt the next morning for lady rotherwood wrote an earnest affectionate letter begging for mysie who she said had won such golden opinions in her former visit that it would be a real benefit to phyllis as much morally as physically to have her companionship  it was the tenderest letter that either of the sisters had ever seen from the judicious and excellent marchioness full of warm sympathy for lady merrifields anxiety for her husband and betraying much solicitude for her little girl  it has done her good said jane mohun  i did not think she had such a soft spot  poor victoria said lady merrifield that is a shame  you know she is an excellent mother  too excellent thats the very thing muttered aunt jane  well mysies fate is settled and i dare say it will turn out for the best  so mysie was to go with mrs halfpenny and primrose to beechcroft whence the rotherwoods would fetch her  if the ladys letter had been much less urgent who could have withstood her lords postscript if you could see the little pale face light up at the bare notion of seeing mysie you would know how grateful we shall be for her  mysie herself heard her destiny without much elation though she was very fond of lady phyllis and the tears came into her eyes at the thought of her being unwell and wanting her  mamma said we must not grumble she said to gillian but i shall feel so lost without you and val  it is so unhomish and theres that dreadful german fraulein who was not at home last time  if you told mamma perhaps she would let you stay returned gillian  i know i should hate it worse than i do going to rockstone and without you  that would be unkind to poor fly said mysie  besides mamma said she could not have settling and unsettling for ever  and i shall see primrose sometimes besides i do love fly  its marching orders you know  it was valetta who made the most objection  she declared that it was not fair that mysie who had been to the ball at rotherwood should go again to live with lords and ladies while she went to a nasty dayschool with butchers and bakers daughters  she hoped she should grow horridly vulgar and if mamma did not like it it would be her own fault  mrs halfpenny who did not like to have to separate mysies clothes from the rest after they were packed rather favoured this naughtiness by observing the old blue merino might stay at home miss mysie would be too set up to wear that among her fine folk  set her up that she should have all the treats while her own miss gillian was turned over to the auld aunties  nonsense nurse said gillian  im much better pleased to go and be of some use  val you naughty child how dare you make such a fuss for valetta was crying again  i hate school and i hate rockstone and i dont see why mysie should always go everywhere and wear new frocks and i go to the butchers and bakers and wear horrid old ones  i wish you could come too said mysie but indeed old frocks are the nicest because one is not bothered to take so much care of them and lords and ladies arent a bit better to play with than other people  in fact ivy is what japs calls a muff and a stick  valetta however cried on and mysie went the length of repairing to her mother in the midst of her last notes and packings to entreat to change with val who followed on tiptoe  certainly not was the answer from lady merrifield who was being worried on all sides valetta is not asked and she is not behaving so that i could accept for her if she were  and val had to turn away in floods of tears which redoubled on being told by the united voices of her brothers and sisters that they were ashamed of her for being so selfish as to cry for herself when all were in so much trouble about papa  lady merrifield caught some of the last words  no my dear she said  that is not quite just or kind  it is being unhappy that makes poor val so ready to cry about her own grievances  only val come here and remember that fretting is not the way to meet such things  there is a better way my child and i think you know what i mean  now to help you through the time in an outer way suppose you each set yourself some one thing to improve in while i am away dont tell me what it is but let me find out when i come home with that she obeyed an urgent summons to speak to the gardener  i shall  i shall cried little primrose write a whole copybook in single lines  and wont mamma be pleased  what shall you do fergus and val and mysie  i shall get to spin my pegtop so as it will never tumble down and will turn an engine for drawing water was the prompt answer of fergus  what nonsense said val youd better settle to get your long division sums right  that s girls stuff replied fergus youd better settle to leave off crying for nothing  that you had said several voices and val very nearly cried again as she exclaimed dont be all so tiresome  i shall make mamma a beautiful crewel cushion with all the battles in history on it  and wont she be surprised  i think mamma meant more than that said mysie  oh mysie what shall you do asked primrose  i did think of getting to translate one of mammas favourite german stories quite through to her without wanting the dictionary or stumbling one bit said mysie but i am sure she meant something better and better and im thinking what it isperhaps it is making all little flossie maddins clothes a whole suit all oneselfor perhaps it is manners  what do you think gill  i should say most likely it was manners for you volunteered harry and the extra you are most likely to acquire at rotherwood  im so glad said mysie  and you gill inquired primrose what will you do  mine is a copybook and ferguss is the spinningtopengines and rule of three and vals is a crewel battle cushion and not crying and mysies is german stories and manners and whats yours gill  gill is so grown up she is too good to want an inside thing announced primrose  oh prim you dear little thing cried both elder brother and sister as they thought with a sort of pang of the childs opinion of grownup impeccability  harry is grown up more put in fergus why dont you ask him  because i know said primrose with a pretty shyness and as they pressed her she whispered he is going to be a clergyman  there was a call for mysie and val from upstairs and as the younger population scampered off gillian said to her brother  is not it like occupy till i come  so i was thinking said harry gravely  but one must be as young as mysie to throw ones inside things into the general stock of resolutions  yes said gillian with uplifted eyes  i doi do hope to do something  some great thing was her unspoken thoughtsome great and excellent achievement to be laid before her mother on her return  there was a tale begun in imitation of bessie merrifield called hildas experiences  suppose that was finished printed published splendidly reviewed  would not that be a great thing  but alas she was under a tacit engagement never to touch it in the hours of study     chapter ii  rockquay    the actual moment of a parting is often softened by the confusion of departure  that of the merrifield family took place at the junction where lady merrifield with her brother remained in the train to be carried on to london  gillian valetta and fergus with their aunt changed into a train for rockstone and harry was to return to his theological college after seeing mysie and primrose off with nurse on their way to the ancestral beechcroft whence mysie was to be fetched to rotherwood the last thing that met lady merrifields eyes was mrs halfpenny gesticulating wildly under the impression that mysies box was going off to london  and gillians tears were choked in the scurry to avoid a smoking carriage while harry could not help thinkinghalf blaming himself for so doingthat mysie expended more feeling in parting with sofy the kitten than with her sisters not perceiving that pussy was the safetyvalve for the poor childs demonstrations of all the sorrow that was oppressing her  gillian in the corner of a rockstone carriage had time for the full heartsickness and tumult of fear that causes such acute suffering to young hearts  it is quite a mistake to say that youth suffers less from apprehension than does age indeed the very inexperience and novelty add to the alarms where there is no background of anxieties that have ended happily only a crowd of examples of other peoples misfortunes  the difference is in the greater elasticity and power of being distracted by outward circumstances and thus lookerson never guess at the terrific possibilities that have scared the imagination and the secret ejaculations that have met them  how many times on that brief journey had not gillian seen her father dying her sisters in despair her mother crushed in the train wrecked in the steamer perishing of the climate or arriving to find all over and dying of the shock yet all was varied by speculations on the great thing that was to offer itself to be done and the delight it would give and when the train slackened anxieties were merged in the care for bags baskets and umbrellas  rockstone and rockquay had once been separate placesa little village perched on a cliff of a promontory and a small fishing hamlet within the bay but these had become merged in one since fashion had chosen them as a winter resort  speculators blasted away such of the rocks as they had not covered with lodginghouses and desirable residences  the inhabitants of the two places had their separate churches and knew their own bounds perfectly well but to the casual observer the chief distinction between them was that rockstone was the more fashionable rockquay the more commercial although the one had its shops the other its handsome crescents and villas  the station was at rockquay and there was an uphill drive to reach rockstone where the two miss mohuns had been early inhabitantshad named their cottage beechcroft after their native home and to justify the title had flanked the gate with two copper beeches which had attained a fair growth in spite of sea winds perhaps because sheltered by the house on the other side  the garden reached out to the verge of the cliff or rather to a low wall with iron rails and spikes at the top and a narrow rather giddy path beyond  there was a gate in the wall the key of which aunt jane kept in her own pocket as it gave near access to certain rocky steps about one hundred and thirty in number by which when in haste the inhabitants of rockstone could descend to the lower regions of the quay  there was a most beautiful seaview from the house which compensated for difficulties in gardening in such a situation though a very slight slope inwards from the verge of the cliff gave some protection to the flowerbeds and there was not only a little conservatory attached to the drawingroom at the end but the verandah had glass shutters which served the purpose of protecting tender plants and also the windows from the full blast of the winter storms  miss mohun was very proud of these shutters which made a winter garden of the verandah for miss adeline to take exercise in  the house was their own and though it aimed at no particular beauty had grown pleasant and pretty looking by force of being lived in and made comfortable  it was a contrast to its neighbours on either side of its pink and gray limestone wall  on one side began the grounds of the great rockstone hotel on the other was cliff house the big and seldom inhabited house of one of the chief partners in the marble works which went on on the other side of the promontory and some people said would one day consume rockstone altogether  it was a very fine house and the gardens were reported to be beautifully kept up but the owner was almost always in italy and had so seldom been at rockstone that it was understood that all this was the ostentation of a man who did not know what to do with his money  aunt adeline met the travellers at the door with her charming welcome  kunz all snowy white wagged his tightcurled tail amid his barks at sight of aunt jane but capered wildly about the sofys basket much to valettas agony while growls as thunderous as a small kitten could produce proceeded therefrom  kunz be quiet said aunt jane in a solemn tobeminded voice and he crouched blinking up with his dark eye  give me the basket  now kunz this is our cat  do you hear  you are not to meddle with her  did kunz really wink assenta very unwilling assent  oh aunt jane from val as her aunts fingers undid the cover of the basket  once for all said aunt jane  mmmmpspsspsss from the sofy two screams from val and fergus a buffeting of paws a couple of wild bounds first on a chairback then on the mantelpiece where between the bronze candlestick and the vase the persian philosopher stood hissing and swearing while kunz danced about and barked  take her down gillian said aunt jane and gillian who had some presence of mind accomplished it with soothing words and thanks to her gloves only one scratch  meantime miss mohun caught up kunz held up her finger to him stopped his barks and then in spite of the oh donts and even the tears of valetta the two were held upblack nose to pink nose with a resolute now you are to behave well to each other from aunt jane  kunz sniffed the sofy hissed but her claws were captive  the dog was the elder and more rational and when set down again took no more notice of his enemy whom valetta was advised to carry into mrs mounts quarters to be comforted and made at home there the united voice of the household declaring that the honour of the spitz was as spotless as his coat  such was the first arrival at rockstone preceding even aunt adelines inquiries after mysie and the full explanation of the particulars of the family dispersion  aunt adas welcome was not at all like that of kunz  she was very tender and caressing and rejoiced that her sister could trust her children to her  they should all get on most happily together she had no doubt  truehearted as gillian was there was something hopeful and refreshing in the sight of that fair smiling face and the touch of the soft hand in the room that was by no means unfamiliar though she had never slept in the house before  it was growing dark and the little fire lighted it up in a friendly manner  wherever aunt jane was everything was neat wherever aunt adeline was everything was graceful  gillian was old enough to like the general prettiness but it somewhat awed val and fergus who stood straight and shy till they were taken upstairs  the two girls had a very pretty room and dressingroomthe guest chamber in fact and fergus was not far off in a small apartment which as val said stood on legs and formed the shelter of the porch  but oh dear oh dear sighed val as gillian unpacked their evening garments isnt there any nice place at all where one can make a mess  i dont know whether the aunts will ever let us make a mess said gillian they dont look like it  at which valettas face puckered up in the way only too familiar to her friends  come dont be silly val  you wont have much time you know you will go to school and get some friends to play with and not want to make messes here  i hate friends  oh val  all but fly and mysie is gone to her  i want mysie  so in truth did gillian almost as much as her mother  her heart sank as she thought of having val and fergus to save from scrapes without mysies readiness and good humour  if mysie were but there she should be free for her great thing  and oh above all vals hairthe brown bush that val had a delusion that she did herself but which her doing left looking rather worse than it did before and which was not permitted in public to be in the convenient tail gillian advanced on her with the brush but she tossed it and declared it all right  however at that moment there was a knock  mrs mounts kindly face and stout form appeared  she had dressed miss ada and came to see what she could do for the young people being of that delightful class of old servants who are charmed to have anything young in the house especially a boy  she took valettas refractory mane in hand tied her sash inspected ferguss hands which had succeeded in getting dirty in their inevitable fashion and undertook all the unpacking and arranging  to vals inquiry whether there was any place for making a dear delightful mess she replied with a curious little friendly smile and wonder that a young lady should want such a thing  im afraid we are all rather strange specimens of young ladies replied gillian very untidy i mean  and im sure i dont know what miss mohun and miss ada will say said good mrs mount  whats that  what am i to say asked aunt jane coming into the room  but after all aunt jane proved to have more sympathy with messes than any of the others  she knew very well that the children would be far less troublesome if they had a place to themselves and she said well val you shall have the boxroom in the attics  and mind you must keep all your goods there both of you  if i find them about the house i shall  oh what aunt jane  confiscate them was the reply in a very awful voice which impressed fergus the more because he did not understand the word  you need not look so much alarmed fergus said gillian you are not at all the likely one to transgress  no said valetta gravely  fergus is what lois calls a regular old battledore  i wont be called names exclaimed fergus  well lois said sowhen you were so cross because the poker had got on the same side as the tongs  she said she never saw such an old battledore and you know how all the others took it up  shuttlecock yourself then angrily responded fergus while both aunt and sister were laughing too much to interfere  i shall call you a little uncle maurice instead said aunt jane how things come round  perhaps you would not believe gill that aunt ada was once in a scrape when she was our mrs malaprop for applying that same epithet on hearsay to maurice  this laugh made gillian feel more at home with her aunt and they went up happily together for the introduction to the lumberroom not a very spacious place and with a window leading out to the leads aunt jane proceeded to put the children on their word of honour not to attempt to make an exit thereby which gillian thought unnecessary since this pair were not enterprising  the evening went off happily  aunt jane produced one of the old games which had been played at the elder beechcroft and had a certain historic character in the eyes of the young people  it was one of those variations of the game of the goose that were once held to be improving and their mother had often told them how the family had agreed to prove whether honesty is really the best policy and how it had been agreed that all should cheat as desperately as possible except honest phyl who couldnt and how by some extraordinary combination good for their morals she actually was the winner  it was immensely interesting to see the identical much worn sheet of dilapidated pictures with the padlock almost close to the goal sending the counter back almost to the beginning in search of the key  still more interesting was the imitation in very wonderful drawing devised by mamma of the career of a true knight from pagedom upwardsin pale watery prussianblue armour a crimson scarf vermilion plume gamboge spurs and very peculiar arms and legs  but as valetta observed it must have been much more interesting to draw such things as that than stupid freehand lines and twists with no sense at all in them  aunt ada being subject to asthmatic nights never came down to breakfast and indeed it was at an hour that gillian thought fearfully early but her aunt jane was used to making every hour of the day available and later rising would have prevented the two children from being in time for the schools to which they were to go on the monday  some of aunt janes many occupations on saturday consisted in arranging with the two heads of their respective schools and likewise for the mathematical class gillian was to join at the high school two mornings in the week and for her lessons on the organ which were to be at st andrews church  somehow gillian felt as if she were as entirely in her aunts hands as kunz and the sofy had been  after the early dinner which suited the invalids health aunt jane said she would take valetta and fergus to go down to the beach with the little varleys while she went to her district leaving gillian to read to aunt ada for half an hour and then to walk with her for a quiet turn on the beach  it was an amusing article in a review that gillian was set to read and she did it so pleasantly that her aunt declared that she looked forward to many such afternoon pastimes and then by an easier way than the hundred and a half steps they proceeded down the hill the aunt explaining a great deal to the niece in a manner very gratifying to a girl beginning to be admitted to an equality with grownup people  there is our old church said aunt ada as they had a glimpse of a gray tower with a curious dumpy steeple  do you go to church there  i doalways  i could not undertake the hill on sundays but jane takes the schoolchildren to the st andrews service in the afternoon  but which is the parish church  in point of fact my dear it is all one parish  good morning mr hablot  my niece miss gillian merrifield  yes my sister is come home  i think she will be at the high school  he is the vicar of st andrews as the clergyman went off in the direction of the steps  i thought you said it was all one parish  st andrews is only a district  ah it was all before your time my dear  i know dear uncle claude was the clergyman here and got st andrews built  yes my dear  it was the great work and thought with him and lord rotherwood in those days that look so bright now said aunt ada yes and with us all  do tell me all about it entreated gillian and her aunt nothing loth went on  dear claude was only fiveandtwenty when he had the living  nobody would take it it was such a neglected place  all rockquay down there had grown up with only the old church and nobody going to it it was a great deal through rotherwood  some property here came to him and he was shocked at the state of things  then we all thought the climate might be good for dear claude and jane came to live with him and help him and look after him  you see there were a great many of us and janewell she didnt quite get on with alethea and claude thought she wanted a sphere of her own and that is the way she comes to have more influence than any one else here  and as i am always better in this air than anywhere else i came soon aftereven before my dear fathers death  and oh what an eager hopeful time it was setting everything going and making st andrews all we could wish  we were obliged to be cautious at the old church you know because of not alarming the oldfashioned people  and so we are still  is that st andrews  oh it is beautiful  may i look in  not now my dear  you will see it another time  i wish it were our church  you will find the convenience of having one so near  and our services are very nice with our present rector mr ellesmere an excellent active man but his wife is such an invalid that all the work falls on jane  i am so glad you are here to help her a little st andrews has a separate district and mr hablot is the vicar but as it is very poor we keep the charities all in one  rotherwood built splendid schools so we only have an infant school for the rockstone children  on sunday jane assembles the older children there and takes them to church but in the afternoon they all go to the national schools and then to a childrens service at st andrews  she gets on so well with mr hablothe was dear claudes curate you see and little mrs hablot was quite a pupil of ours what do you think little gerald hablot saidhe is only fiveisnt miss mohun the most consultedest woman in rockquay  i suppose it is true said gillian laughing but rather awestruck  i declare it makes me quite giddy to count up all she has on her hands  nobody can do anything without her  there are so few permanent inhabitants and when people begin good works they go away or marry or grow tired and then we cant let them drop  oh whats that pretty spire on the rise of the other hill  my dear that was the kennel mission chapel a horrid little hideous iron thing but lady flight mistook and called it st kenelms and st kenelms it will be to the end of the chapter  and as she exchanged bows with a personage in a carriage there she is my dear  who  did she build that church  it is not consecrated  it really is only a mission chapel and he is nothing but a curate of mr hablots said aunt ada gillian thought a little venomously  she asked who  the reverend augustine flight my dear  i ought not to say anything against them i am sure for they mean to be very good but she is some city mans widow and he is an only son and they have more money than their brains can carry  they have made that little place very beautiful quite oppressed with ornamentcity taste you know and they have all manner of odd doings there which mr hablot allows because he says he does not like to crush zeal and he thinks interference would do more harm than good  jane thinks he ought not to stand so much but  gillian somehow felt a certain amusement and satisfaction in finding that aunt jane had one disobedient subject but they were interrupted by two ladies eagerly asking where to find miss mohun and a few steps farther on a young clergyman accosted them and begged that miss mohun might be told the hour of some meeting  also that the bellevue church people would not cooperate in the coal club  then it was explained that bellevue church was within the bounds of another parish and had been built by and for people who did not like the doctrine at the services of st andrews  by this time aunt and niece had descended to the marine esplanade a broad road on one side of which there was a low sea wall and then the sands and rocks stretched out to the sea on the other a broad space of short grass where there was a cricket ground and a lawn tennis ground and the volunteers could exercise and the band played twice a week round a russian gun that stood by the flagstaff  the band was playing now and the notes seemed to work on gillians feet and yet to bring her heart into her throat for the last time she had heard that march was from the band of her fathers old regiment when they were all together  her aunt was very kind and talked to her affectionately and encouragingly of the hopes that her mother would find her father recovering and that it would turn out after all quite an expedition of pleasure and refreshment  then she said how much she rejoiced to have gillian with her as a companion to herself while her sister was so busy and she was necessarily so much left alone  we will read together and draw and play duets and have quite a good account of our employment to give she said smiling  i shall like it very much said gillian heartily  dear child the only difficulty will be that you will spoil me and i shall never be able to part with you  besides you will be such a help to my dear jane  she never spares herself you know and no one ever spares her and i can do so little to help her except with my head  surely here are plenty of people said gillian for they were in the midst of welldressed folks and aunt ada had more than once exchanged nods and greetings  quite true my dear but when there is anything to be done then there is a sifting  but now we have you with all our own lilys spirit i shall be happy about jane for this winter at least  they were again interrupted by meeting a gentleman and lady to whom gillian was introduced and who walked on with her aunt conversing they had been often in india and made so light of the journey that gillian was much cheered  moreover she presently came in sight of val and fergus supremely happy over a castle on the beach and evidently indoctrinating the two little varleys with some of the dramatic sports of silverfold  aunt ada found another acquaintance a white moustached old gentleman who rose from a green bench in a sunny corner saying ah miss mohun i have been guarding your seat for you  thank you major dennis  my niece miss merrifield  he seemed to be a very courteous old gentleman for he bowed and made some polite speech about sir jasper and as he was military gillian hoped to have heard some more about the journey when they sat down and room was made for her but instead of that he and her aunt began a discussion of the comings and goings of people she had never heard of and the letting or not letting of half the villas in rockstone and she found it so dull that she had a great mind to go and join the siege of sandcastle  only her shoes and her dress were fitter for the esplanade than the shore with the tide coming in and when one has just begun to buy ones own clothes that is a consideration  at last she saw aunt janes trim little figure come out on the sands and make as straight for the children as she could amid greetings and consultations so with an exclamation she jumped up and went over the shingle to meet them finding an endeavour going on to make them tolerably respectable for the walk home by shaking off the sand and advising val to give up her intention of dragging home a broad brown ribbon of weed with a frilled edge all polished and shiny with wet  she was not likely to regard it as such a curiosity after a few days experience of rockquay as her new friends told her  kitty varley went to the high school which greatly modified valettas disgust to it for the little girls had already vowed to be the greatest chums in the world and would have gone home with arms entwined if aunt jane had not declared that such things could not be done in the street and clem varley with still more effect threatened that if they were such a pair of ninnies he should squirt at them with the dirtiest water he could find  valetta had declared that she infinitely preferred kitty to fly and kitty was so flattered at being adopted by the second cousin of a lady phyllis and the daughter of a knight that she exalted val above all the popsys and mopsys of her present acquaintance and at parting bestowed on her a chocolate cream which tasted about equally of salt water and hot handat least if one did not feel it a testimonial of ardent friendship  fergus and clement had on the contrary been so much inclined to punch and buffet one another that miss mohun had to make them walk before her to keep the peace and was by no means sorry when the gate of the tamarisks was reached and the varleys could be disposed of  however the battery must have been amicable for fergus was crazy to go in and see clements little pump which he declared would do it an enigmatical phrase supposed to refer to the great pegtop perpetualmotion invention  he was dragged away with difficulty on the plea of its being too late by aunt jane who could not quite turn two unexpected children in on mrs varley and had to effect a cruel severance of val and kitty in the midst of their kisses  sudden friendships said gillian from the superiority of her age  i do not think you are given that way said aunt jane  does the large family suffice for all of you  people are so different added aunt ada  yes said gillian  we have never been in the way of caring for any outsider  i dont reckon bessie merrifield sonor fly devereux nor dolores because they are cousins  cousins may be everything or nothing asserted miss mohun  you have been about so much that you have hardly had time to form intimacies  but had you no friends in the officers families  people always retired before their children grew up to be companionable said gillian  there was nobody except the whites and that wasnt exactly friendship  who were they said aunt jane who always liked to know all about everybody  he rose from the ranks said gillian  he was very much respected and nobody would have known that he was not a gentleman to begin with  but his wife was half a greek  papa said she had been very pretty but oh she had grown so awfully fat  we used to call her the queen of the white ants  then kallyher name was really kalliopewas very nice and mamma got them to send her to a good dayschool at dublin and alethea and phyllis used to have her in to try to make a lady of her  there used to be a great deal of fun about their muse i remember claude thought her very pretty and always stood up for her and alethea was very fond of her  but soon after we went to belfast mr white was made to retire with the rank of captain  i think papa tried to get something for him to do but i am not sure whether he succeeded and i dont know any more about them  not exactly friendship certainly said aunt jane smiling  after all gillian in your short life you have had wider experiences than have befallen your old aunts  wider perhaps not deeper jane suggested miss adeline  and gillian thoughtthough she felt it would be too sentimental to saythat in her life persons and scenes outside her own family had seemed to come like shadows and so depart and there was a general sense of depression at the partings the anxiety and the being unsettled again when she was just beginning to have a home     chapter iii  perpetual motion    if fergus had not yet discovered the secret of perpetual motion gillian felt as if aunt jane had done so and moreover that the greater proportion of parish matters were one vast machine of which she was the moving power  as she was a small spare woman able to do with a very moderate amount of sleep her day lasted from 6 am to some unnamed time after midnight and as she was also very methodical she got through an appalling amount of business and with such regularity that those who knew her habits could tell with tolerable certainty within reasonable limits where she would be found and what she would be doing at any hour of the seven days of the week  everything she influenced seemed to recur as regularly as the motions of the great ruthlesslooking engines that gillian had seen at work at belfast the only loose cog being apparently her sister adeline who quietly took her own way seldom came downstairs before eleven oclock went out and came in made visits or received them wrote letters read and worked at her own sweet will  only two undertakings seemed to belong to hera mission working party and an italian class of young ladies and even the presidency of these often lapsed upon her sister when she had had one of those bad nights of asthma which were equally sleepless to both sisters  she was principally useful by her exquisite needlework both in church embroidery and for sales and likewise as the recipient of all the messages left for miss mohun which she never forgot besides that having a clear sensible head she was useful in consultation  she was thoroughly interested in all her sisters doings and always spoke of herself as the invalid precluded from all service except that of being a pivot for jane the stationary leg of the compasses as she sometimes called herself  this repose together with her prettiness and sweetness of manner was very attractive especially to gillian who had begun to feel herself in the grip of the great engine which bore her along without power of independent volition and with very little time for hildas experiences  at home she had gone on harmoniously in full acquiescence with household arrangements but before the end of the week the very same sensations came over her which had impelled her and jasper into rebellion and disgrace during the brief reign of a very strict daily governess long ago at dublin  her reason and sense approved of all that was set before her and much of it was pleasant and amusing but this was the more provoking by depriving her of the chance of resistance or the solace of complaint  moreover with all her time at aunt janes disposal how was she to do her great thing valettas crewel battle cushion had been reduced to a delicious design of the battle of the frogs and mice drawn by aunt ada and which she delighted in calling at full length the batrachyomachia sparing none of the syllables which she was to work below  and it was to be worked at regularly for half an hour before bedtime trust aunt jane for seeing that any one under her dominion did what had been undertaken  only thus the spontaneity seemed to have departed and the work became a task  fergus meanwhile had set his affections on a big japanese top he had seen in a window and was eagerly awaiting his weekly threepence to be able to complete the purchase though no one but valetta was supposed to understand what it had to do with his great thing  it was quite pleasant to gillian to have a legitimate cause of opposition when miss mohun made known that she intended gillian to take a class at the afternoon sundayschool while the two children went to mrs hablots drawingroom class at st andrews vicarage all meeting afterwards at church  did mamma wish it asked gillian  there was no time to mention it but i knew she would  i dont think so said gillian  we dont teach on sundays unless some regular person fails  mamma likes to have us all at home to do our sunday work with her  alas i am not mamma  nor could i give you the time  i have brought the books to go on with val and ferg  i always do some of their work with them and i am sure mamma would not wish them to be turned over to a stranger  the fact is that young ladies have got beyond sundayschools  no no jane said her sister gillian is quite willing to help you but it is very nice in her to wish to take charge of the children  they would be much better with mrs hablot than dawdling about here and amusing themselves in the new sunday fashion  mind i am not going to have them racketing about the house and garden disturbing you and worrying the maids  aunt jane cried gillian indignantly you dont think that is the way mamma brought us up to spend sunday  we shall see said aunt jane then more kindly my dear you are right to use your best judgment and you are welcome to do so as long as the children are orderly and learn what they ought  it was more of a concession than gillian expected though she little knew the effort it cost since miss mohun had been at much pains to set mrs hablots class on foot and felt it a slight and a bad example that her niece and nephew should be defaulters  the motive might have worked on gillian but it was a lower one therefore mentioned  she had seen mrs hablot at the italian class and thought her a mere girl and an absolute subject of aunt janes stumbling pitifully moreover in a speech of adelchis therefore evidently not at all likely to teach sunday subjects half so well as herself  nor was there anything amiss on that first sunday  the lessons were as well and quietly gone through as if with mamma and there was a pleasant little walk on the esplanade before the childrens service at st andrews after which there was a delightful introduction to some of the old books mamma had told them of  they were all rather subdued by the strangeness and newness of their surroundings as well as by anxiety  if the younger ones were less anxious about their parents than was their sister each had a plunge to make on the morrow into a very new world and the varleys information had not been altogether reassuring  valetta had learnt how many marks might be lost by whispering or bad spelling and how ferociously cross fraulein adler looked at a mistake in a german verb while fergus had heard a dreadful account of the ordeals to which burfield and stebbing made new boys submit and which would be all the worse for him because he had a rum christian name and his father was a swell  gillian had some experience through her elder brothers and suspected master varley of being guilty of heightening the horrors so she assured fergus that most boys had the same sort of christian names but were afraid to confess them to one another and so called each other bill and jack  she advised him to call himself by his surname not to mention his fathers title if he could help it and above all not to seem to mind anything  her own spirits were much exhilarated the next morning by a note from harry the recipient of all telegrams with tidings that the doctors were quite satisfied with sir jasper and that lady merrifield had reached brindisi  there was great excitement at sight of a wet morning for it appeared that an omnibus came round on such occasions to pick up the scholars and valetta thought this so delightful that she danced about exclaiming what fun and only wishing for mysie to share it  she would have rushed down to the gate umbrellaless if aunt jane had not caught and conducted her while gillian followed with fergus  aunt jane looked down the vista of young facesfive girls and three boys nodding to them and saying to the senior a tall damsel of fifteen  here are my children emma  you will take care of them please you are keeping order here i suppose  there was a smile and bow in answer as the door closed and the omnibus jerked away its ponderous length  im sorry to see that stebbing there observed the aunt as she went back but emma norton ought to be able to keep him in order it is well you have no lessons out of the house today gillian  are you going out then  oh yes said miss mohun running upstairs and presently coming back with a schoolbag and a crackling waterproof cloak but pausing as she saw gillian at the window nursing the sofy and gazing at the gray cloud over the gray sea  you are not at a loss for something to do she said you said you meant to write to your mother  oh yes said gillian suddenly fretted and with a sense of being hunted i have plenty to do  i see said miss mohun turning over the books that lay on the little table that had been appropriated to her niece in a way that unreasonably or not unspeakably worried the girl brachets french grammarthats right  colensos algebrai dont think they use that at the high school  julius caesaryou should read that up in merivale  i did said gillian in a voice that very nearly said do let them alone  well you have materials for a very useful sensible mornings work and when ada comes down very likely she will like to be read to  off went the aunt leaving the niece stirred into an absolute desire instead of spending the sensible morning to take up near neighbours and throw herself into an easychair and when she had conscientiously resisted that temptation her pen would hover over hildas experiences even when she had actually written dearest mamma  she found she was in no frame to write such a letter as would be a comfort to her mother so she gave that up and made her sole assertion of liberty the working out of a tough double equation in colenso which actually came right and put her in such good humour that she was no longer afraid of drumming the poor piano to death and aunt ada upstairs to distraction but ventured on learning one of the lieder ohne worte and when her aunt ada came down and complimented her on the sounds that had ascended she was complacent enough to write a very cheerful letter whilst her aunt was busied with her own  she described the sundayschool question that had arisen and felt sure that her father would pronounce his gill to be a sensible young woman  afterwards miss adeline betook herself to a beautiful lily of church embroidery observing as gillian sat down to read to her alphonse karrs voyage autour de mon jardin that it was a real pleasure to listen to such prettilypronounced french kunz lay at her feet the sofy nestled in gillians lap and there was a general sense of being rubbed down the right way  by and by there loomed through the rain two dripping shiny forms under umbrellas strongly inclined to fly away from themmiss mohun and mr grant the junior curate whom she had brought home to luncheon  both were full of the irregularities of the two churches of bellevue and st kenelms on the recent harvestthanksgiving sunday  it was hard to tell which was most reprobated what st kenelms did or what bellevue did not do  if the one blew trumpets in procession the other collected the offertory in a warmingpan gillian had already begun to find that these misdoings supplied much conversation at beechcroft cottage and began to get half weary half curious to judge for herself of all these enormities nor did she feel more interested in the discussion of who had missed church or school and who needed tickets for meat or to be stirred up to pay for their coal club  at last she heard well i think you might read to her gillian oh were not you listening  a very nice girl near here a pupil teacher who has developed a hip complaint poor child  she will enjoy having visits from you a young thing like herself  gillian did not like it at all but she knew that it would be wrong to refuse and answered very well with no alacrityhoping that it was not an immediate matter and that something might happen to prevent it  but at that moment the sun came out the rain had ceased and there were glistening drops all over the garden the weather quarter was clear and after half an hours rest after dinner aunt jane jumped up decreeing that it was time to go out and that she would introduce gillian to lilian giles before going on to the rest of her district  she gathered a few delicate flowers in the little conservatory and put them in a basket with a peach from the dessert then took down a couple of books from the shelf  gillian could not but acquiesce though she was surprised to find that the one given to her was a translation of undine  the child is not badly off explained miss mohun  her father is a superior workman  she does not exactly want comforts but she is sadly depressed and disappointed at not being able to go on with her work and the great need is to keep her from fretting over her troubles and interested in something  gillian began to think of one of the graceful hectic invalids of whom she had read and to grow more interested as she followed aunt jane past the old church with the stout square steeple constructed to hold on a small side turret window a light for the benefit of ships at sea  then the street descended towards the marble works  there was a great quarry all red and raw with recent blasting and above below and around rows of new little stuccoed slated houses for the workpeople and a large range of workshops and offices fronting the sea  this was miss mohuns district and at a betterlooking house she stopped and used the knocker  that was no distinction all had doors with knockers and sash windows but this was a little larger and the tiny strip of garden was well kept while a beautiful myrtle and pelargonium peeped over the muslin blind and it was a very nicelooking woman who opened the door though she might have been the better for a cap  aunt jane shook hands with her rather to gillians surprise and heard that lily was much the same  it is her spirits are so bad you see miss mohun she added as she ushered them into a somewhat stuffy little parlour carpeted and bedecked with all manner of knickknacks photographs and framed certificates of various societies of temperance and providence on the gailypapered walls  the girl lay on a couch near the fire a sallow creature with a big overhanging brow made heavier by a dark fringe and an expression that gillian not unjustly decided was fretful though she smiled and lighted up a little when she saw miss mohun  there was a good deal said about her bad nights and her appetite and how the doctor wanted her to take as much as she could and how everything went against hereven lardy cake and rolypoly pudding with bacon in it  miss mohun put the flowers on the little table near the girl who smiled a little and thanked her in a languid dreary manner  finding that she had freshly been visited by the rector miss mohun would not stop for any serious reading but would leave miss merrifield to read a story to her  and you ought to get on together she said smiling  you are just about the same age and your names rhymegillian and lilian  and gillians mother is a lily too  this the young lady lid not like for she was already feeling it a sort of presumption in the girl to bear a name so nearly resembling her mothers  she had seen a little cottage poverty and had had a class of little maidservants but this level of life which is in no want keeps a best parlour and does not say maam was quite new to her and she did not fancy it  when the girls were left together while mrs giles returned to her ironing gillian was the shyer of the two and began rather awkwardly and reluctantly  miss mohun thought you would like to hear this  it is a sort of german fairy tale  lilian said yes miss merrifield in a short dry tone completing gillians distaste and she began to read not quite at her best and was heartily glad when at the end of half an hour mrs giles was heard in parley with another visitor so that she had an excuse for going away without attempting conversation  she was overtaken by the children on their way home from their schools where they had dined they rushed upon her together with the two varleys who wanted to take them home to tea and gillian giving her ready consent fergus dashed home to fetch his beloved hummingtop which was to be introduced to clement varleys pump and in a few minutes they were off hardly vouchsafing an answer to such comparatively trifling inquiries as how they were placed at their schools  gillian found however that neither of her aunts was pleased at her having consented to the childrens going out without reference to their authority  how did she suppose they were to come home  i did not think cant they be fetched said gillian startled  it is not far said adeline pitying her  one of the maids  my dear ada exclaimed aunt jane  you know that fanny cannot go out at night with her throat and i never will send out those young girls on any account  cant i go said gillian desperately  are not you a young girl  i must go myself  and go she did at a quarter to eight and brought home the children looking much injured  gillian went upstairs with them and there was an outburst  it was horrid to be fetched home so soon just as there was a chance of something nice when all the tiresome big ones had gone to dress and we could have had some real fun said valetta  real fun  real sense said fergus  but what had you been about all this time  why their sisters and a man that was there would come and drink tea in the nursery where nobody wanted them and make us play their play  wasnt that nice  you are always crying out for harry and me to come and play with you  oh it wasnt like that said val you play with us and they only pretended and played with each other  it wasnt nice  clem said it wasforking said fergus  no spooning said val  the dish ran after the spoon you know  well but you havent told me about the schools said gillian in elder sisterly propriety thinking the subject had better be abandoned  jolly jolly scrumptious cried fergus  oh fergus mamma doesnt like slang words  jasper doesnt say them  not at home but men say what they like at school and the bus was scrumptious and splendiferous  im sure it wasnt said valetta i cant bear being boxed up with horrid rude boys  because you are only a girl  now gill they shot with  val if you tell  telling gill isnt telling  is it gill  she assented  they did gill  they shot at us with peashooters sighed the girl  oh it was jolly jolly jolly cried the boy  stebbing hit the girl who made the sour face on her cheeks and they all squealed and the cad looked in and tried to jaw us  but that dreadful boy shot right into his mouth said val while fergus went into an ecstasy of laughter  wasnt it a shame gill  indeed it was said gillian  such ungentlemanly boys ought not to be allowed in the omnibus  girls shouldnt be allowed in the bus they are so stupid said fergus  that oneas cross as old halfpennywho was she val  emma norton  up in the highest form  well she is a prig and a telltaletit besides only stebbing said if she did her junior would catch it  what a dreadful bully he must be exclaimed gillian  ill tell you what said fergus in a tone of profound admiration no one can hold a candle to him at batting  he snowballed all the kennel choir into fits and he can brosier old tillys stall and go on just the same  what a greedy boy exclaimed val  disgusting added gillian  youre girls responded fergus lengthening the syllable with infinite contempt but valetta had spirit enough to reply much better be a girl than rude and greedy  exactly said gillian it is only little silly boys who think such things fine  claude doesnt nor harry nor japs  you know nothing about it said fergus  well but youve never told me about schoolhow you are placed and whom you are under  oh im in middle form under miss edgar  disgusting  its only the third form that go up to smiler  she knows it is no use to try to take stebbing and burfield  and gill added val im in second class too and i took three places for knowing where teheran was and got above kitty varley and a girl there two years older than i am and her name is maura  maura how very odd  i never heard of any one called maura but one of the whites said gillian  what was her surname  this valetta could not tell and at the moment mrs mount came up with intent to brush miss valettas hair and to expedite the going to bed  gillian not very happy about the revelations she had heard went downstairs and found her younger aunt alone miss mohun having been summoned to a conference with one of her clients in the parish room in her absence gillian always felt more free and communicative and she had soon told whatever she did not feel as a sort of confidence including valettas derivation of spooning and when miss mohun returned it was repeated to her  yes was her comment childrens play is a convenient cover to the present form of flirtation  no doubt bee varley and mr marlowe believe themselves to have been most goodnatured  who is he and will it come to anything asked aunt ada taking her sisters information for granted  oh no it is nothing  a civil service man second cousins brother inlaws stepson  thats quite enough in these days to justify fraternal romping  i thought beatrice varley a nice girl  so she is my dear  it is only the spirit of the age and after all this deponent saith not which was the dish and which was the spoon  have the children made any other acquaintances i wonder and how did george stebbing comport himself in the omnibus  i was sorry to see him there i dont trust that boy  i wonder they didnt send him in solitary grandeur in the brougham said miss ada  gillian held the history of the peashooting as a confidence even though aunt jane seemed to have been able to see through the omnibus so she contented herself with asking who george stebbing was  the son of the manager of the marble works partner i believe  yes said aunt ada the co means stebbing primarily  is he a gentleman  well as much as old mr white himself i suppose  he is come up heremores the pityto the aristocratic quarter if you please said aunt jane smiling and if garden parties are not over mr stebbing may show you what they can be  that boy ought to be at a public school said her sister  i hope he doesnt bully poor little fergus  i dont think he does said gillian  fergus seemed rather to admire him  i had rather hear of bullying than patronage in that quarter said miss mohun  but gillian we must impress on the children that they are to go to no ones house without express leave  that will avoid offence and i should prefer their enjoying the society of even the varleys in this house  did aunt jane repent of her decision on the thursday halfholiday granted to mrs edgars pupils when in the midst of the working party round the diningroom table in a pause of the reading some one said whats thatand a humming accompanied by a drip drop drip drop became audible  up jumped miss mohun and so did gillian half in consternation half to shield the boy from her wrath  in a few moments they beheld a puddle on the mat at the bottom of the oak stairs while a stream was descending somewhat as the water comes down at lodore while ferguss voice could be heard above  dont varley  you see how it will act  the string of the humming top moves the pump handle and that spins  oh  master fergus  ohh you bad boy  the shriek was caused by the avenging furies who had rushed up the back stairs just as miss mohun had darted up the front so as to behold on the landing between the two the boys one spinning the top the other working the pump which stood in its own trough of water receiving a reckless supply from the tap in the passage  the maids scream of what will your aunt say was answered by her appearance and rush to turn the cock  dont dont aunt jane shouted fergus ive almost done it perpetual motion  he seemed quite unconscious that the motion was kept up by his own hands and even dismay could not turn him from being triumphant  oh miss jane cried mrs mount if i had thought what they boys was after  mop it up alice said aunt jane to the younger girl  no dont come up ada it is too wet for you  it is only a misdirected experiment in hydraulics  i told him not said clement varley thinking affairs serious  fergus i am shocked at you said gillian sternly  you are frightfully wet  you must be sent to bed  you must go and change said aunt jane preventing the howl about to break forth  my dear boy that tap must be let alone  we cant have cataracts on the stairs  i didnt mean it aunt jane i thought it was an invention said fergus  i know but another time come and ask me where to try your experiments  go and take off those clothes and you clement you are soaking too  run home at once  gillian much scandalised broke out  it is very naughty  at home he would be sent to bed at once  i am not mrs halfpenny gillian said aunt jane coldly  jane has a soft spot for inventions for maurices sake said her sister  i cant confound ingenuity and enterprise with wanton mischief or crush it out for want of sympathy said miss mohun  come we must return to our needles  if aunt jane had gone into the state of wrath to be naturally expected gillian would have risen in arms on her brothers behalf and that would have been much pleasanter than the leniency which made her views of justice appear like unkindness  this did not dispose her to be the better pleased at an entreaty from the two children to be allowed to join mrs hablots class on sunday it appeared that they had asked aunt jane and she had told them that their sister knew what their mother would like  but i am sure she would not mind said valetta  only think she has got a portfolio with pictures of everything all through the bible  yes added fergus clem told me  there are the dogs eating jezebel and such a jolly picture of the lion killing the prophet i do want to see them  varley told me  and kitty told me added valetta  she is reading such a book to them  it is called the beautiful face and is all about two children in a wood and a horrid old grandmother and a dear old hermit and a wicked baron in a castle  do let us go gillyflower  yes said fergus it would be ever so much better fun than poking here  you dont want fun on sunday  not fun exactly but it is nicer  to leave me the last bit of home and mammas own lessons  they aint mammas protested fergus but valetta was touched by the tears in gillians eyes kissed her and declared not that  whether it were on purpose or not the next sunday was eminently unsuccessful the collects were imperfect the answers in the catechism recurred to disused babyish blunders fergus twisted himself into preternatural attitudes and valetta teased the sofy to scratching point they yawned ferociously at the birthday and would not be interested even in the ponys death  then when they went out walking they would not hear of the sober rockstone lane but insisted on the esplanade where they fell in with the redoubtable stebbing who chose to patronise instead of bullying little merry and took him off to the tide markto the agony of his sisters when they heard the st andrews bell  at last when the tempter had gone off to higher game ferguss sunday boots and stockings were such a mass of black mud that gillian had to drag him home in disgrace sending valetta into church alone she would have put him to bed on her own responsibility but she could not master him he tumbled about the room declaring aunt jane would do no such thing rolled up his stockings in a ball and threw them in his sisters face  gillian retired in tears which she let no one see not even aunt ada and proceeded to record in her letter to india that those dreadful boys were quite ruining fergus and aunt jane was spoiling him  however aunt jane having heard what had become of the youth met him in no spoiling mood and though she never knew of his tussle with gillian she spoke to him very seriously shut him into his own room to learn thoroughly what he had neglected in the morning and allowed him no jam at tea  she said nothing to gillian but there were inferences  the lessons went no better on the following sunday gillian could neither enforce her authority nor interest the children  she avoided the esplanade thinking she had found a nice country walk to the common beyond the marble works but behold there was an outbreak of drums and trumpets and wild singing  the salvation army was marching that way and what was worse yells and catcalls behind showed that the skeleton army was on its way to meet them  gillian frightened almost out of her wits managed to fly over an impracticablelooking gate into a field with her children but fergus wanted to follow the drum  after that she gave in  the children went to mrs hablot and gillian thought she saw i told you so in the corners of aunt janes eyes  it was a further offence that her aunt strongly recommended her going regularly to the high school instead of only attending certain classes  it would give her far more chance of success at the examination to work with others and her presence would be good for valetta  but to reduce her to a schoolgirl was to be resented on miss vincents account as well as her own     chapter iv  the queen of the white ants    the high school was very large  it stood at present at the end of a budding branch of rockquay where the managers assisted by the funds advanced by lord rotherwood and that great invisible potentate the head of the marble works had secured and adapted a suitable house and a space round it well walled in  the various classes of students did not see much of each other except those who were day boarders and spent the midday recreation time together  even those in the same form were only together in school as the dressingroom of those who dined there was separate from that of the others and they did not come in and out at the same time  valetta had thus only really made friends with two or three more rockstone girls of about her own age besides kitty yarley with whom she went backwards and forwards every day under the escort provided in turn by the families of the young ladies  gillians studies were for three hours in the week at the high school and on two afternoons she learnt from the old organist at rockstone church  she went and came alone except when miss mohun happened to join her and that was not often for said that lady to her sister gillian always looks as if she thought i was acting spy upon her  i wish i could get on with that girl i begin to feel almost as poor lily did with dolores  she is a very good girl said miss adeline  so she is and that makes it all the more trying to be treated like the grand inquisitor  shall i speak to her  she is always as pleasant as possible with me  oh no dont  it would only make it worse and prevent you from having her confidence  ah jane i have often thought your one want was gentleness said miss ada with the gesture of her childhoodher head a little on one side  and besides dont you know what reggie used to call your ferret look  well i suppose you cant help it but when you want to know a thing and are refraining from asking questions you always have it more or less  thank you ada  theres nothing like brothers and sisters for telling one hometruths  i suppose it is the penalty of having been a regular paul pry in my childhood in spite of poor eleanor making me learn meddlesome matty as soon as i could speak  i always do and always shall have ringing in my ears             oh what a pretty box is this             ill open it said little miss   well you know you always do know or find out everything about everybody and it is very useful  useful as a bloodhound is eh  oh no not that jenny  as a ferret or a terrier perhaps  i suppose i cannot help that though she added rather sadly  i have tried hard to cure the slander and gossip that goes with curiosity  i am sorry it results in repulsion with that girl but i suppose i can only go on and let her find out that my bark or my eye is worse than my bite  you are so good so everything jenny said adeline that i am sure you will have her confidence in time if only you wont poke after it  which made miss mohun laugh though her heart was heavy for she had looked forward to having a friend and companion in the young generation  gillian meantime went her way  one morning after her mathematical class was over she was delayed for about ten minutes by the head mistress to whom she had brought a message from her aunt and thus did not come out at noon at the same time as the day scholars  on issuing into the street where as yet there was hardly any traffic except what was connected with the two schools she perceived that a party of boys were besetting a little girl who was trying to turn down the cross road to bellevue barring her way and executing a derisive wardance around her and when she almost crying made an attempt to dash by pulling at her plaited tail with derisive shouts even gillians call boys boys how can you be so disgraceful did not check them  one made a face and put his tongue out while the biggest called out thank you teacher and gillian perceived to her horror that they were no street boys but mrs edgars and that fergus was one of them  that he cried in dismay dont stebbing  its my sister was no consolation as she charged in among them catching hold of her brother as she said  i could not believe that you could behave in such a disgraceful manner  all the other tormentors rushed away headlong except stebbing who in some compunction said  i beg your pardon miss merrifield i had no notion it was you  you are making it no better said gillian  the gentlemen i am used to know how to behave properly to any woman or girl  my father would be very sorry that my brother has been thrown into such company  and she walked away with her head extremely high having certainly given master stebbing a good lesson  fergus ran after her  gill gill you wont tell  i dont think i ever was more shocked in my life returned gillian  but gill shes a nasty stuckup conceited little ape that maura white or whatever her ridiculous name is  they pretend her father was an officer but he was really a bad cousin of old mr whites that ran away and her mother is not a ladya great fat disgusting woman half a nigger and mr white let her brother and sister be in the marble works out of charity because they have no father and she hasnt any business to be at the high school  white did you say  maura white exclaimed gillian  captain white dead  oh fergus it must be captain white  he was in the dear old royal wardours and papa thought so much of him  to think of your going and treating his daughter in that shocking way  it was what stebbing said gruffly answered fergus  if you let yourself be led by these horrid cads  he is no such thing  he is the crack bat of edgars  a boy is a cad who cant behave himself to a girl because she is poor  i really think the apology to me was the worst part or the matter  he only treats people well when he sees they can take care of themselves  ill tell him about captain white said fergus a little abashed  yes  and i will get the aunts to call on mrs white and that may help them to a better level among these vulgar folk  but you wont said fergus with an expressive pause  i wont get you into trouble for i think you are sorry you treated one of our own in such a manner  i wouldnt indeed if i had known  i shall only explain that i have found out whom maura belongs to i should go and see them at once only i must make val find out where she lives  so gillian returned home communicating the intelligence with some excitement that she had discovered that valettas schoolmate maura white was none other than the daughter of her fathers old fellow soldier whose death shocked her greatly and she requested to go and call on mrs white as soon as she could learn her abode  however it seemed to be impossible that any one should live in rockstone unknown to aunt jane  white she said  it cant be the whites down by cliffside  no theres a father there though he generally only comes down for sunday  i am sure there are some whites on the library list said miss ada  oh yes but she washes  i know who they must be  i know in bellevue there are some but they go to the kennel church  didnt you come home ada from that function you went to with florence raving about the handsome youth in the choir  oh yes we thought it such an uncommon foreign face and he looked quite inspired when he was singing his solo  yes i found out that his name was white a clerk or something in the marble works and that he had a mother and sister living at bellevue  i did see the sister when i went to get the marble girls into the gfs but she said something foolish about her mother not liking it  yes nobody under the st kenelm influence ever will come into the gfs  but what is she doing asked gillian  do you mean kalliope  i suppose i do  i saw a rather nicelooking young woman in the department where they make florentine mosaic and i believe they said she was miss white but she cut me off very short with her mother so i had no more to do with her  i am sure mamma would wish me to call on mrs white said gillian  theres no reason against it said aunt jane i will go with you the first day i can  when would that be wondered gillian  she told valetta to talk to maura and learn the name of the house and this was ascertained to be 3 ivinghoe terrace bellevue road but val had very little opportunity of cultivating the acquaintance of town girls who did not stay to dinner as she had to go home immediately after school under emma nortons escort and perhaps she was not very ardent in the cause for kitty varley and her other friends did not like the child and she was more swayed by them than perhaps she liked to confess to her sister  each morning at breakfast gillian hoped that aunt jane would lay out her day so as to call on mrs white but first there was the working party then came the mothers meeting followed by afternoon tea at mrs hablots for some parish council  on the third day which might have been clear a miserable creature as gillian mentally called her wrote to beg the misses mohun to bring themselves and her niece to make up a lawntennis set since some one had failed  gillian vainly protested that she did not care about lawn tennis and could not play unless jasper was her partner and aunt jane so far sided with her as to say it was very inconvenient and on such short notice they ought not to be expected but aunt ada clearly wanted to go and so they went  it was a beautiful place but gillian could not enjoy herself partly because she knew so few of the people but more because she was vexed and displeased about the whites  she played very badly but aunt jane when pressed into the service skipped about with her little light figure and proved herself such a splendid player doing it so entirely con amore that gillian could not but say to herself she was bent on going it was all humbug her pretending to want to refuse  that afternoons dissipation had made it needful to do double work the next day and gillian was again disappointed  then came saturday when miss mohun was never available nor was she on monday and when it appeared that she had to go to a meeting at the cathedral town on tuesday gillian grew desperate and at her teteatete meal with aunt ada related the whole history of the whites and her great desire to show kindness to her fathers old brotherofficers family and how much she was disappointed  miss adeline was touched and indeed fond as she was of her sister she could not help being flattered by gillians preference and confidence  well my deal this is a nice day not too hot or too cold i do not see why i should not walk down with you and call  if i find it too far we can take a cab to go back  oh thank you aunt ada it is very very kind of you and there is no knowing when aunt jane may be able to go  i dont like to close up my indian letter till i can say i have seen them  gillian fidgeted a good deal lest before her aunts postprandial repose was over visitors should come and put a stop to everything and she looked ready to cut the throat of a poor lady in a mushroom hat who came up to leave a message for miss mohun about a possible situation for one of her class of boys  however at last they started kunz and all miss adeline quite infected by gillians excitement  so your father and mother were very fond of them  papa thought very highly of him and was very sorry he had to return said gillian  and she was a beautiful greek  gillian began to be quite afraid of what she might have said  i dont think she is more than half greek she said  i believe her mother was a gorfiote but her father was english or irish  i believe he kept a shop in malta  quite a mixture of nationalities then and no wonder she is beautiful  that youth had a very striking profile it quite reminded me of a gem as i saw it against the dark pillar  i did not say she was very beautiful now said gillian feeling a qualm as she recollected the queen of the white ants and rather oddly divided between truthfulness fear of alarming her aunt into turning back and desire of giving her a little preparation  ah those southern beauties soon go on  some one told me that lord byrons maid of athens whose portrait i used to think the loveliest thing in the world became a great stout woman but was quite a mother to all the young englishmen about  i remember i used to try to hold my head and keep my eyelids down like the engraving in an old book that had been my mothers  oh i think i have seen it at beechcroft said gillian very much amused for she now perceived whence arose aunt adas peculiar turn of the head and droop of the eyelashes and how the conscious affectation of childhood had become unconsciously crystallised  she grew more and more anxious as they found some difficulty in making out ivinghoe terrace and found it at last to be a row of rather dilapidated little houses apparently built of lath and stucco and of that peculiar meanness only attained by the modern suburb  aunt ada evidently did not like it at all and owned herself almost ready to turn back being sure that valetta must have made some mistake  gillian repeated that she had always said the whites were very poor but she began to feel that her impatience had misled her and that she would have been better off with the aunt who was used to such places and whose trim browns and crimsons were always appropriate everywhere rather than this dainty figure in delicate hues that looked only fit for the esplanade or the kettledrum and who was becoming seriously uneasy as kunz in his fresh snowiness was disposed to make researches among vulgar remains of crabs and hakes and was with difficulty restrained from disputing them with a very ignoble and spiteful yellow cur of low degree  no 3 with its blistered wall and rusty rail was attained kunz was brought within the enclosure and gillian knocked as sharply and fast as she could in the fear that her aunt might yet turn about and escape  the door was opened with a rapidity that gave the impression that they had been watched but it was by a very untidylooking small maid and the parlour into which they were turned had most manifestly been lately used as the family diningroom and was redolent of a mixture of onion cabbage and other indescribable odours  nobody was there except a black and white cat who showed symptoms of flying at kunz but thought better of it and escaped by the window which fortunately was open though the little maid would have shut it but for miss adelines gasping and peremptory entreaty to the contrary  she sat on the faded sofa looking as if she just existed by the help of her fan and scentbottle and when gillian directed her attention to the case of clasps and medals and the photograph of the finelooking officer she could only sigh out oh my dear  there was a certain air of taste in the arrangement of the few chimneypiece ornaments and gillian was pleased to see the two large photographs of her father and mother which captain white had so much valued as parting gifts  a few drawings reminded her of the school of art at belfast and there was a vase of wild flowers and ferns prettily arranged but otherwise everything was wretchedly faded and dreary  then came the opening of the door and into the room rolled rather than advanced something of stupendous breadth which almost took gillians breath away as she durst not look to see the effect on her aunt  if the queen of the white ants had been stout before what was she now  whatever her appearance had been in the days of comparative prosperity with a husband to keep her up to the mark and a desire to rank with the officers wives she had let everything go in widowhood poverty and neglect and as she stood panting in her old shiny black alpaca the only thing gillian recalled about her like old times was the black lace veil thrown mantilla fashion over her head but now it was over a widows cap and a great deal rustier than of old  of the lovely foreigner nothing else remained except the dark eyes and that sort of pasty sallow whiteness that looks at if for generations past cold water and fresh air had been unknown there was no accent more interesting in her voice than a soupcon of her irish father as she began i am sorry to have kept the lady so long waiting  was it about the girls character that you came  oh no mrs white interrupted gillian her shyness overpowered by the necessity of throwing herself into the breach  dont you remember me  i am gillian merrifield and this is my aunt miss adeline mohun  the puffy features lighted up into warmth  little miss gillian and i am proud to see you  my little maura did tell me that miss valetta was in her class at the high school but i thought there was no one now who would come near the poor widow  and is your dear mamma here miss gillian and are she and your papa quite well  gillian could hardly believe in such dense remoteness that her fathers accident should be unknown but she explained all and met with abundant sympathy the dark eyes filled with tears and the voice broke into sobs as mrs white declared that sir jasper and lady merrifield had been the best friends she ever had in her life  but oh that the handkerchief had been less grimy with which she mopped her eyes as she spoke of the happy days that were gone gillian saw that poor aunt ada was in an agony to get away and hurried out her questions for fear of being stopped  how was kalliopewas she at home  oh no poor kally she is the best girl in the world  i always say that with all my sorrows no one ever was more blest in their children than poor little me  richard my eldest is in a lawyers office at leeds  kally is employed in the art department just as a compliment to her relation mr white  quite genteel superior work though i must say he does not do as much for us as he might  such a youth as my alexis now was surely worthy of the position of a gentleman  the good lady was quite disposed to talk but there was no making out through her cloud of confused complaints what her son and daughter were actually doing and aunt ada while preserving her courtesy was very anxious to be gone and rose to take leave at the first moment possible though after she was on her feet mrs white detained her for some time with apologies about not returning her visit  she was in such weak health so unequal to walking up the cliff that she was sure miss mohun would excuse her though alexis and kally would be perfectly delighted to hear of miss gillians kindness  gillian had not made out half what she wanted to know nor effected any arrangement for seeing kalliope when she found herself out in the street and her aunt panting with relief  my dear that woman you dont mean that your mother was fond of her  i never said mamma was fond of her  my dear excuse me  it was the only reason for letting you drag me here  i was almost stifled  what a night i shall have  i am very sorry aunt ada but indeed i never said that mamma was fond of her only that papa thought very highly of her husband and wished us to be kind to her  well you gave me that impression whether you wished it or not such a hole and im sure she drinks gin  oh no aunt  i cant be mistaken  i really was afraid she was going to kiss you  i do wish i could have made out about alexis and kalliope  oh my dear just working like all the lot though she shuffled about it  i see what they are like and the less you see of them the better  i declare i am more tired than if i had walked a mile  how am i ever to get up the hill again  i am sorry aunt said gillian  will you take my arm  perhaps we may meet kalliope if the marble people come out at four or five whats that bell as a little tinkle was heard  thats st kenelms  oh you would like to go there and it would rest me only theres kunz  i should like to see it very much said gillian  well said aunt ada who certainly seemed to have something of the cats away feeling about her and moreover trusted to avoid meeting kalliope  just round the corner here is mrs webbs who used to live with us before she married kunz will be happy with her wont he my doggie like to go and see his old jessie  so kunz was disposed of with a very pleasant neatlooking woman who begged miss adeline to come and have some tea after the service  it was really a beautiful little churcha little gem was exactly the term that suggested itselfvery ornate and the chief lack being of repose for there seemed not an inch devoid of colour or carving there was a choir of boys in short surplices and blue cassocks and a very musical service in the course of which it was discovered to be the feast of st remigius for after the lesson a short discourse was given on the conversion of clovis not forgetting the sacred ampulla  there were about five ladies present and six old women belonging to a home maintained by lady flight  the young priest her son had a beautiful voice and gillian enjoyed all very much and thought the st andrews people very hard and unjust but all this went out of her head in the porch for while lady flight was greeting miss mohun with empressement and inviting her to come in to tea gillian had seen a young woman who had come in late and had been kneeling behind them  turning back and holding out her hands she exclaimed  kalliope  i so wanted to see you  miss gillian merrifield was the response  maura told me you were here but i hardly hoped to see you  how can i see you  where are you  busy  i am at the marble works all dayin the mosaic department  oh miss gillian i owe it all to miss merrifields encouraging me to go to the school of art  how is she  and i hope you have good accounts of sir jasper  he is better and i hope my mother is just arriving  thats why we are here and alethea and phyllis are out there  they will want to know all about you  at that moment aunt adeline looked round having succeeded in persuading lady flight that she had another engagement  she saw a young woman in a shabby black dress with a bag in her hand and a dark fringe over a complexion of clear brown straight features to whom gillian was eagerly talking  ah she said as mr flight now came up from the vestry do you know anything of that girl  secondrate people somewhere in bellevue said the lady  the brother is my best tenor said mr flight  she is very often at st kenelms but i do not know any more of her  the mother either goes to bellevue or nowhere  they are in bellevue parish  this was quite sufficient answer for any interference with parochial visiting in the bellevue district was forbidden  aunt ada called to gillian and when she eagerly said this is kalliope aunt only responded with a stiff bow  i do not know what these people might have been gillian she said as they pursued their way to mrs webbs butthey must have sunk so low that i do not think your mother can wish you to have anything to do with them  oh aunt ada  kalliope was always such a good girl  she has a fringe  and she would not belong to the gfs said aunt ada  no my dear i see exactly the sort of people they are your aunt jane might be useful to them if they would let her but they are not at all fit for you to associate with  gillian chafed inwardly but she was beginning to learn that aunt ada was more impenetrable than aunt jane and what was worse aunt jane always stood by her sisters decision whether she would have herself originated it or not  when the elder aunt came home and heard the history of their day and gillian tried to put in a word she said  my dear we all know that rising from the ranks puts a mans family in a false position and they generally fall back again  all this is unlucky for they do not seem to be people it is possible to get at and now you have paid your kind act of attention there is no more to be done till you can hear from ceylon about them  gillian was silenced by the united forces of the aunts  it really was a horrid place said aunt ada when alone with her sister and such a porpoise of a woman  gillian should not have represented her as a favourite  i do not remember that she did so returned aunt jane  i wish she had waited for me  i have seen more of the kind of thing than you have ada  i am sure i wish she had  i dont know when i shall get over the stifling of that den but it was just as if they were her dearest friends  girls will be silly  and theres a feeling about the old regiment too  i can excuse her though i wish she had not been so impatient i fancy that eldest daughter is really a good girl and the mainstay of the family  but she would have nothing to do with you or the gfs  if i had known that her father had been an officer i might have approached her differently  however i will ask lily about their antecedents and in six weeks we shall know what is to be done about them     chapter v  marbles    six weeks seem a great deal longer to sixteen than to sixandforty and gillian groaned and sighed to herself as she wrote her letters and assured herself that so far from her having done enough in the way of attention to the old soldiers family she had simply done enough to mark her neglect and disdain  grizzling to use an effective family phrase under opposition is a grand magnifier and it was not difficult to erect poor captain white into a hero his wife into a patient sufferer and aletheas kindness to his daughter into a bosom friendship while the aunts seemed to be absurdly fastidious and prejudiced  i dont wonder at aunt ada she said to herself i know she has always been kept under a glass case but i thought better things of aunt jane  it is all because kalliope goes to st kenelms and wont be in the gfs  and all the time gillian was perfectly unaware of her own family likeness to dolores  other matters conduced to a certain spirit of opposition to aunt jane  that the children should have to use the back instead of the front stair when coming in with dusty or muddy shoes and that their possessions should be confiscated for the rest of the day when left about in the sittingrooms and hall were contingencies she could accept as natural though they irritated her but she agreed with valetta that it was hard to insist on half an hours regular work at the cushion which was not a lesson but play she was angered when aunt jane put a stop to some sportive passes and chatter on the stairs between valetta and alice mount and still more so when her aunt took away adam bede from the former as not desirable reading at eleven years old  it was only the remembrance of her mothers positive orders that withheld gillian from the declaration that mamma always let them read george eliot and in a cooler moment of reflection she was glad she had abstained for she recollected that always was limited to mammas having read most of romola aloud to her and mysie and to her having had silas marner to read when she was unwell in lodgings and there was a scarcity of books  such miffs about her little sister were in the natural order of things and really it was the all pervadingness as she called it in her own mind of aunt jane that chiefly worried her the way that the little lady knew everything that was done and everything that was touched in the house but as long as valetta took refuge with herself and grumbled to her it was bearable  it was different with fergus  there had been offences certainly aunt jane had routed him out of preparing his lessons in mrs mounts room where he diversified them with teaching the sofy to beg and inventing new modes of tying down jam pots  moreover she had declared that gillians exemplary patience was wasted and harmful when she found that they had taken threequarters of an hour over three tenses of a greek verb and that he said it worse on the seventh repetition than on the first  after an evening when gillian had gone to a musical party with aunt ada and fergus did his lessons under aunt janes superintendence he utterly cast off his sisters aid  there was something in miss mohuns briskness that he found inspiring and she put in apt words or illustrations instead of only rousing herself from a book to listen prompt and sigh  he found that he did his tasks more thoroughly in half the time and rose in his class and busy as his aunt was she made the time not only for this but for looking over with him those plates of mechanics in the encyclopaedia which were a mere maze to gillian but of which she knew every detail from ancient studies with her brother maurice  as fergus wrote to his mother aunt jane is the only woman who has any natural scence  gillian could not but see this as she prepared the letters for the post and whatever the ambiguous word might be meant for she had rather not have seen it for she really was ashamed of her secret annoyance at ferguss devotion to aunt jane knowing how well it was that stebbing should have a rival in his affections  yet she could not help being provoked when the boy followed his aunt to the doors of her cottages like a little dog and waited outside whenever she would let him for the sake of holding forth to her about something which wheels and plugs and screws were to do  was it possible that miss mohun followed it all  his great desire was to go over the marble works and she had promised to take him when it could be done but unfortunately his halfholiday was on saturday when the workmen struck off early and when also aunt jane always had the pupilteachers for something between instruction and amusement  gillian felt lonely for though she got on better with her younger than her elder aunt and had plenty of surface intercourse of a pleasant kind with both it was a very poor substitute for her mother or her elder sisters and valetta was very far from being a mysie  the worst time was sunday when the children had deserted her for mrs hablot and aunt ada was always lying down in her own room to rest after morning service  she might have been at the sunday school but she did not love teaching nor do it well and she did not fancy the town children or else there was something of opposition to aunt jane  it was a beautiful afternoon of the first sunday in october and she betook herself to the garden with the lyra innocentium in her hand meaning to learn the poem for the day  she wandered up to the rail above the cliff looking out to the sea  here beyond the belt of tamarisks and other hardy lowgrowing shrubs which gave a little protection from the winds the wall dividing the garden of beechcroft cottage from that of cliff house became low with only the iron spiked railing on the top as perhaps there was a desire not to overload the cliff  the sea was of a lovely colour that day soft blue and with exquisite purple shadows of clouds with ripples of golden sparkles here and there near the sun and gillian stood leaning against the rail gazing out on it with a longing yearning feeling towards the dear ones who had gone out upon it when she became conscious that some one was in the other garden which she had hitherto thought quite deserted and looking round she saw a figure in black near the rail their eyes met and both together exclaimed  kalliopemiss gillian  oh i beg your pardon  how did you come here  i thought nobody did  mr whites gardener lets us walk here  it is so nice and quiet alexis has taken the younger ones for a walk but i was too much tired  but i will not disturb you  oh dont go away  nobody will disturb us and i do so want to know about you all  i had no notion nor mamma either that you were living here or  or of my dear fathers death said kalliope as gillian stopped short confused  i did write to miss merrifield but the letter was returned  but where did you write  to swanage where she had written to me last  oh we were only there for six weeks while we were looking for houses i suppose it was just as the wardours were gone to natal too  yes we knew they were out of reach  but do tell me about it if you do not mind  my father will want to hear  kalliope told all in a calm matteroffact way but with a strain of deep suppressed feeling  she was about twentythree a girl with a fine outline of features beautiful dark eyes and a clear brown skin who would have been very handsome if she had looked better fed and less hardworked  her sunday dress showed wear and adaptation but she was altogether ladylike and even the fringe that had startled aunt ada only consisted of little wavy curls on the temples increasing her classical look  it was feverat leeds  my father was just going into a situation in the police that we had been waiting for ever so long and there were good schools and richard had got into a lawyers office when there began a terrible fever in our streetthe drains were to blame they saidand every one of us had it except mother and richard who did not sleep at home  we lost poor little mary first and then papa seemed to be getting better but he was anxious about expense and there was no persuading him to take nourishment enough  i do believe it was that  and he had a relapseand  oh poor kalliope  and we never heard of it  i did feel broken down when the letter to miss merrifield came back said kalliope  but my father had made me write to mr james whitenot that we had any idea that he had grown so rich  he and my father were first cousins sons of two brothers who were builders but there was some dispute and it ended by my father going away and enlisting  there was nobody nearer to him and he never heard any more of his home but when he was so ill he thought he would like to be reconciled to jem as he said so he made me write from his dictation  such a beautiful letter it was and he added a line at the end himself  then at last when it was almost too late mr white answered  i believe it was a mere chanceor rather providencethat he ever knew it was meant for him but there were kind words enough to cheer up my father at the last  i believe then the clergyman wrote to him  did not he come near you  no i have never seen him but there was a correspondence between him and mr moore the clergyman and richard and he said he was willing to put us in the way of working for ourselves ififwe were not too proud  then he did it in an unkind way said gillian  i try to think he did not mean to be otherwise than good to us  i told mr moore that i was not fit to be a governess and i did not think they could get on without me at home but that i could draw better than i would do anything else and perhaps i might get christmas cards to do or something like that  mr moore sent a card or two of my designing and then mr white said he could find work for me in the mosaic department here and something for my brothers if we did not give ourselves airs  so we came  not richard said gillian who remembered dimly that richard had not been held in great esteem by her own brothers  no richard is in a good situation so it was settled that he should stay on there  and you  i am in the mosaic department  oh miss gillian i am so grateful to miss merrifield  dont you remember her looking at my little attempts and persuading lady merrifield to get mother to let me go to the school of art  i began only as the girls do who are mere hands and now i have to prepare all the designs for them and have a nice little office of my own for it  sometimes i get one of my own designs taken and then i am paid extra  then do you maintain them all  oh no we have lodgers the organist and his wife said kalliope laughing and alexis is in the telegraph office at the works besides it turned out that this house and two more belong to us and we do very well when the tenants pay their rents  but maura is not the youngest of you said gillian who was rather hazy about the family  no there are the two little boys  we let them go to the national school for the present  it is a great trial to my poor mother but they do learn well there and we may be able to do something better for them by the time they are old enough for further education  just then the sound of a bell coming up from the town below was a warning to both that the conversation must be broken off  a few wordsi am so glad to have seen you and it has been such a pleasurepassed and then each hastened down her separate garden path  must i tell of this meeting  gillian asked herself  i shall write it all to mamma and alethea of course  how delightful that those lessons that kalliope had have come to be of so much use  how pleased alethea will be  poor dear thing  how much she has gone through  but can there be any need to tell the aunts  would it not just make aunt ada nervous about any one looking through her sweet and lovely wall  and as to aunt jane i really dont see that i am bound to gratify her passion for knowing everything  i am not accountable to her but to my own mother  my people know all about kalliope and she is prejudiced  why should i be unkind and neglectful of an old fellowsoldiers family because she cannot or will not understand what they really are  it would not be the slightest use to tell her the real story  mrs white is fat and kalliope has a fringe goes to st kenelms and wont be in the gfs and thats enough to make her say she does not believe a word of it or else to make it a fresh ground for poking and prying in the way that drives one distracted  it really is quite a satis faction to have something that she cant find out and it is not underhand while i write every word of it to mamma  so gillian made her conscience easy and she did write a long and full account of the whites and their troubles and of her conversation with kalliope  in the course of that week fergus had a holiday asked for by some goodnatured visitor of mrs edgars  he rushed home on the previous day with the news to claim aunt janes promise and she undertook so to arrange matters as to be ready to go with him to the marble works at three oclock  valetta could not go as she had her music lesson at that time and she did not regret it for she had an idea that blasting with powder or dynamite was always going on there  gillian was not quite happy about the dynamite but she did not like to forego the chance of seeing what the work of kalliope and alexis really was so she expressed her willingness to join the party and in the meantime did her best to prevent aunt ada from being driven distracted by ferguss impatience which began at halfpast two  miss mohun had darted out as soon as dinner was over and he was quite certain some horrible cad would detain her till four oclock and then going would be of no use  nevertheless he was miserable till gillian had put on her hat and then she could do nothing that would content him and keep him out of aunt adas way but walk him up and down in the little front court with the copper beeches while she thought they must present to the neighbours a lively tableau of a couple of leopards in a cage  however precisely as the clock struck three aunt jane walked up to the iron gate  she had secured an order from mr stebbing the managing partner without which they would not have penetrated beyond the gate where no admittance except on business was painted  mr stebbing himself a man with what valetta was wont to call a grisly beard met them a little within the gate and did the honours of the place with great politeness  he answered all the boys questions and seemed much pleased with his intelligence and interest letting him see what he wished and even having the machinery slacked to enable him to perceive how it acted and most delightful of all in the eyes of fergus letting him behold some dynamite and explaining its downward explosion  he evidently had a great respect for miss mohun because she entered into it all put pertinent questions and helped her nephew if he did not understand  it was all dull work to gillian all that blasting and hewing and polishing which made the place as busy as a hive  she only wished she could have seen the cove as once it was with the weatherbeaten rocks descending to the sea overhung with wild thrift and bramble and with the shore the peaceful haunts of the white seabirds whereas now the freshcut rock looked red and wounded and all below was full of ugly slated or ironroofed sheds rough workmen and gratings and screeches of machinery  it was the whites whom she wanted to see and she never came upon the brother at all nor on the sister till mr stebbing perhaps observing her listless looks said that they were coming to what would be more interesting to miss merrifield and took them into the workrooms where a number of young women were busy over the very beautiful work by which flowers and other devices were represented by inlaying different coloured marbles and semiprecious stones in black and white so as to make tables slabs and letterweights and brooches for those who could not aspire to the most splendid and costly productions  miss mohun shook hands with the young ladies within the magic circle of the gfs and showed herself on friendly terms of interest with all  from a little inner office miss white was summoned came out and met an eager greeting from gillian but blushed a little and perhaps had rather not have had her unusual christian name proclaimed by the explanation  this is kalliope white aunt jane  miss mohun shook hands with her and said her niece had been much pleased at the meeting and her sister would be glad to hear of her explaining to mr stebbing that captain white had been a brother officer of sir jasper merrifield  kalliope had a very prettilyshaped head with short hair in little curls and rings all over it  her whole manner was very quiet and unassuming as she explained and showed whatever mr stebbing wished it was her business to make the working drawings for the others and to select the stones used and there could be no doubt that she was a capable and valuable worker  gillian asked her to show something designed by herself and she produced an exquisite tableweight bearing a spray of sweet peas gillian longed to secure it for her mother but it was very expensive owing to the uncommon stones used in giving the tints and mr stebbing evidently did not regard it with so much favour as the jessamines and snowdrops which being of commoner marbles could be sold at a rate fitter for the popular purse  several beautiful drawings in her office had been laid aside as impracticable unless we had a carte blanche wedding order he said with what gillian thought a sneer  she would gladly have lingered longer but this was a very dull room in ferguss estimation and perhaps aunt jane did not desire a long continuance of the conversation under mr stebbings eyes so gillian found herself hurried on  mr stebbing begged miss mohun to come in to his wife who would have tea ready and this could not be avoided without manifest incivility fergus hoped to have been introduced to the haunts of his hero but master george was gone off in attendance on his brother who was fishing and there was nothing to relieve the polite circle of the drawingrooma place most aesthetically correct from cornice to the little rugs on the slippery floor  the little teacups and the low turkish table were a perfect study to those who did notlike fergus think more of the dainty dolls muffins on the stand or the long backed dachshund who looked for them beseechingly  mrs stebbing was quite in accordance with the rest with a little row of curls over her forehead a terracotta dress and a chain of watch cocks altogether rather youthful for the mother of a grownup son engaged in his fathers business  she was extremely civil and polite and everything went well except for a certain stiffness  by and by the subject of the whites came up and mr stebbing observed that miss merrifield seemed to know miss white  oh yes said gillian eagerly her father was in my fathers regiment the royal wardours  a noncommissioned officer i suppose said mrs stebbing  not for a good many years said gillian  he was lieutenant for six years and retired with the rank of captain  i know they said he was a captain said mrs stebbing but it is very easy to be called so  captain white was a real one said gillian with a tone of offence every one in the royal wardours thought very highly of him  i am sure no one would have supposed it from his family said mrs stebbing  you are aware miss mohun that it was under disgraceful circumstances that he ran away and enlisted  many a youth who gets into a scrape becomes an excellent soldier even an officer said miss mohun  exactly so said mr stebbing  those highspirited lads are the better for discipline and often turn out well under it  but their promotion is an awkward thing for their families who have not been educated up to the mark  it is an anomalous position and i have a great pity for them said miss mohun  miss white must be a very clever girl  talented yes said mr stebbing  she is useful in her department  that may be said mrs stebbing but it wont do to encourage her she is an artful designing girl i know very well  do you know anything against her asked miss mohun looking volumes of repression at gillian whose brown eyes showed symptoms of glaring like a cats under her hat  i do not speak without warrant miss mohun  she is one of those demure properbehaved sort that are really the worst flirts of all if youll excuse me  most thankful was miss mohun that the door opened at that moment to admit some more visitors for she saw that gillian might at any moment explode  aunt jane she exclaimed as soon as they had accomplished their departure you dont believe it  i do not think miss white looks like it said miss mohun  she seemed a quiet simple girl  and you dont believe all that about poor captain white  not the more for mrs stebbings saying so  but you will find out and refute her  there must be people who know  my dear you had better not try to rake up such things  you know that the man bore an excellent character for many years in the army and you had better be satisfied with that said miss jane for once in her life as if to provoke gillian not on the side of curiosity  then you do believe it went on gillian feeling much injured for her heros sake and wearing what looked like a pertinacious pout  truth compels me to say gillian that the sons of men even in a small way of business are not apt to run away and enlist without some reason  and i am quite sure it was all that horrid old whites fault  you had better content yourself with that belief  gillian felt greatly affronted but fergus who thought all this very tiresome broke in after a third attempt  aunt jane if the pulley of that crane  and all the way home they discussed machinery and gillians heart swelled  i am afraid gillian was greatly displeased with me said miss mohun that evening talking it over with her sister  but her captain might have a fall if she went poking into all the gossip of the place about him  most likely whatever he did would be greatly exaggerated said adeline  no doubt of it  besides those young men who are meant by nature for heroes are apt to show some beserkerwuth in their youth like hereward le wake  but what did you think of the girl  i liked her looks very much  i have seen her singing in the choruses at the choral society concert and thought how nice her manner was  she does justice to her classical extraction and is modest and ladylike besides  mrs stebbing is spiteful  i wonder whether it is jealousy  she calls her artful and designing which sounds to me very much as if master frank might admire the damsel i have a great mind to have the two girls to tea and see what they are made of  we had much better wait till we hear from lily  we cannot in the least tell whether she would wish the acquaintance to be kept up and if there is anything going on with young stebbing nothing could be more unadvisable than for gillian to be mixed up in any nonsense of that sort     chapter vi  single misfortunes never come alone    on sunday gillians feet found their way to the top of the garden where she paced meditatively up and down hoping to see kalliope and just as she was giving up the expectation the slender black figure appeared on the other side of the railings  oh miss gillian how kind  kally i am glad  wherewith they got into talk at once for lady merrifields safe arrival and sir jaspers improvement had just been telegraphed and there was much rejoicing over the good news  gillian had nearly made up her mind to confute the enemy by asking why captain white had left rockquay but somehow when it came to the point she durst not make the venture and they skimmed upon more surface subjects  the one point of union between the parishes of rockstone and rockquay was a choral society whereof mr flight of st kenelms was a distinguished light and which gave periodical concerts in the masonic hall  it being musical miss mohun had nothing to do with it except the feeling it needful to give her presence to the performances  one of these was to take place in the course of the week and there were programmes in all the shops mr alexis white being set down for more than one solo and as a voice in the glees  shall not you sing asked gillian remembering that her sisters had thought kalliope had a good ear and a pretty voice  i  oh no  i thought you used to sing  yes but i have no time to keep it up  not even in the choruses  no i cannot manage itand there was a little glow in the clear brown cheek  does your designing take up so much time  it is not that but there is a great deal to do at home in after hours  my mother is not strong and we cannot keep a really efficient servant  oh but you must be terribly hardworked to have no time for relaxation  not quite that butit seems to me burst out poor kalliope that relaxation does nothing but bring a girl into difficultiesan unprotected girl i mean  what do you mean cried gillian quite excited but kalliope had caught herself up  never mind miss gillian you have nothing to do with that kind of thing  but do tell me kally i do want to be your friend said gillian trying to put her hand through  theres nothing to tell said kalliope smiling and evidently touched but still somewhat red only you know when a girl has nobody to look after her she has to look after herself  doesnt alexis look after you said gillian not at all satisfied to be put off with this truism  poor alex  he is younger you know and he has quite enough to do oh miss gillian he is such a very dear good boy  he has a most beautiful voice aunt ada said  yes poor fellow though he almost wishes he had not  oh dear i theres the little bell  goodbye miss merrifield i must run or mrs smithson will be gone to church and i shall be locked in  so gillian was left to the enigma why alexis should regret the beauty of his own voice and what kalliope could mean by the scrapes of unprotected girls  it did not occur to her that miss white was her elder by six or seven years and possibly might not rely on her judgment and discretion as much as she might have done on those of alethea  meantime the concert was coming on  it was not an amusement that aunt ada could attempt but miss mohun took both her nieces to the extreme pride and delight of valetta who had never been as she said to any evening thing but just stupid childish things only trees and magiclanterns and would not quite believe gillian who assured her in a sage tone that she would find this far less entertaining than either judging by the manner in which she was wont to vituperate her music lesson  oh but thats only scales and everybody hates them  and i do love a german band  especially in the middle of lessontime said gillian  however fergus was to spend the evening with clement varley and kitty was to go with her mother and sister the latter of whom was to be one of the performers but it was decreed by the cruel authorities that the two bosom friends would have their tongues in better order if they were some chairs apart and therefore though the members of the two families at beechcroft and the tamarisks were consecutive valetta was quartered between her aunt and gillian with mrs varley on the other side of miss mohun and major dennis flanking miss merrifield  when he had duly inquired after sir jasper and heard of lady merrifields arrival he had no more conversation for the young lady and valetta having perceived by force of example that in this waitingtime it was not like being in church poured out her observations and inquiries on her sister  what a funny room  and oh do look at the pictures  why has that man got on a blue apron  freemasons  what are freemasons  do they work in embroidered blue satin aprons because they are gentlemen ill tell fergus that is what he ought to be he is so fond of making thingsonly i am sure he would spoil his apron  whats that curtain for  will they sing up there  oh theres emma norton just come in that must be her father  thats alice gidding she comes to our sunday class and do you know she thought it was joseph who was put into the den of lions  has not her mother got a funny head  hush now val  here they come as the whole chorus trooped in and began the men of harlech  val was reduced to silence but there was a long instrumental performance afterwards during which bad examples of chattering emboldened her to whisper  did you see beatrice varley  and miss berry our singingmistress and alexis white  maura says  aunt jane gave a touch and a frown which reduced valetta to silence at this critical moment and she sat still through a good deal only giving a little jump when alexis white with various others came to sing a glee  gillian could study the youth who certainly was as aunt ada said remarkable for the cameolike cutting of his profile though perhaps no one without an eye for art would have remarked it as he had the callow unformed air of a lad of seventeen or eighteen and looked shy and grave but his voice was a fine one and was heard to more advantage in the solos to a hunting song which shortly followed  valetta had been rather alarmed at the applause at first but she soon found out what an opportunity it gave for conversation and after a good deal of popping her head about she took advantage of the encores to excuse herself by saying i wanted to see if maura white was there  she was to go if mrs leethats the lodgerwould take her  she says kally wont go or sing or anything because  how tantalising the singers reappeared and valetta was reduced to silence  nor could the subject be renewed in the interval between the parts for major dennis came and stood in front and talked to miss mohun and after that valetta grew sleepy and nothing was to be got out of her till all was over when she awoke into extra animation and chattered so vehemently all the way home that her aunt advised gillian to get her to bed as quietly as possible or she would not sleep all night and would be good for nothing the next day  gillian however being given to think for herself in all cases of counsel from aunt jane thought it could do no harm to beguile the brushing of the childs hair by asking why kalliope would not come to the concert  oh its a great secret but maura told me in the cloakroom  it is because mr frank wants to be herto be herher admirer said valetta cocking her head on one side and adding to the already crimson colour of her cheeks  nonsense val what do you and maura know of such things  we arent babies gill and it is very unkind of you when you told me i was to make friends with maura white and kitty varley is quite cross with me about it  i told you to be kind to maura but not to talk about such foolish things  i dont see why they should be foolish  it is what we all must come to  grownup people do as lois says  i heard aunt ada going on ever so long about beatrice varley and that gentleman  it is just the disadvantage of that kind of school that girls talk that sort of undesirable stuff  gillian said to herself but curiosity or interest in the whites prompted her to add what did she tell you  if you are so cross i shant tell you  you hurt my head i say  come val i ought to know  its a secret  then you should not have told me so much  val laughed triumphantly and called her sister mrs curiosity and at that moment aunt jane knocked at the door and said val was not to talk  val made an impatient face and began to whisper but gillian had too much proper feeling to allow this flat disobedience and would not listen much as she longed to do so  she heard her little sister rolling and tossing about a good deal but made herself hardhearted on principle and acted sleep  on her own judgment she would not waken the child in the morning and aunt jane said she was quite right it would be better to let val have her sleep out than send her to school fretful and half alive  but you ought not to have let her talk last night  as usual reproof was unpleasing and silenced gillian  she hoped to extract the rest of the story in the course of the day  but before breakfast was over valetta rushed in with her hat on having scrambled into her clothes in a hurry and consuming her breakfast in great haste for she had no notion either of losing her place in the class or of missing the discussion of the entertainment with kitty from whom she had been so cruelly parted  teteatetes were not so easy as might have been expected between two sisters occupying the same room for valetta went to bed and to sleep long before gillian and the morning toilette was a hurry besides gillian had scruples partly out of pride and partly out of conscientiousness about encouraging valetta in gossip or showing her curiosity about it  could she make anything out from kalliope herself  however fortune favoured her for she came out of her class only a few steps behind little maura and as some of mr edgars boys were about the child naturally regarded her as a protector  maura was quite as pretty as her elders and had more of a southern look  perhaps she was proportionably precocious for she returned gillians greeting without embarrassment and was quite ready to enter into conversation and show her gratification at compliments upon her brothers voice  and does not kalliope sing  i think she used to sing very nicely in the old times  oh yes said maura but she doesnt now  why not  has not she time  thats not all said maura looking significant and an interro gative sound sufficed to bring outit is because of mr frank  mr frank stebbing  yes  he was always after her and would walk home with her after the practices though alexis was always there  i know that was the reason for i heard la mamma mia trying to persuade her to go on with the society and she was determined and would not  alex said she was quite right and it is very tiresome of him for now she never walks with us on sunday and he used to come and give us bonbons and crackers  then she does not like him  she says it is not right or fitting because mr and mrs stebbing would be against it but mamma said he would get over them if she would not be so stupid and he could make her quite a lady like an officers daughter as we are  is it not a pity she wont miss gillian  i do not know  i think she is very good said gillian  oh but if she would we might all be well off again said little worldlyminded maura and i should not have to help her make the beds and darn and iron and all sorts of horrid things but we could live properly like ladies  i think it is more ladylike to act uprightly said gillian  wherewith having made the discovery and escorted maura beyond the reach of her enemies she parted with the child and turned homewards  gillian was at the stage in which sensible maidens have a certain repugnance and contempt for the idea of love and lovers as an interruption to the higher aims of life and destruction to family joys  romance in her eyes was the exaltation of woman out of reach and mauras communications inclined her to glorify kalliope as a heroine molested by a very inconvenient person spighted by a fool spighted and angered both as she quoted imogen to herself  it would be a grand history to tell alethea of her friend when she should have learnt a little more about it as she intended to do on sunday from kalliope herself who surely would be grateful for some sympathy and friendship  withal she recollected that it was indian mail day and hurried home to see whether the midday post had brought any letters  her two aunts were talking eagerly but suddenly broke off as she opened the door  well gillian began aunt ada  no no let her see for herself said aunt jane  oh  i hope nothing is the matter she exclaimed seeing a letter to herself on the table  no rather the reverse  a horrible suspicion as she afterwards called it came over gillian as she tore open the letter  there were two small notes  the first was   dear little gilli am going to give you a new brother  mother will tell you allyour loving sister                                         p e m   she gasped and looked at the other   dearest gillianafter all you have heard about frank perhaps you will know that i am very happy  you cannot guess how happy and it is so delightful that mamma is charmed with him  he has got two medals and three clasps  there are so many to write to i can only give my poor darling this little word  she will find it is only having another to be as fond of her as her old alley   gillian looked up in a bewildered state and gasped both  aunt jane could not help smiling a little and saying yes both at one fell swoop  its dreadful said gillian  my dear if you want to keep your sisters to yourself you should not let them go to india said aunt ada  they said they wouldnt  they were quite angry at the notion of being so commonplace said gillian  oh no one knows till her time comes said aunt jane  gillian now applied herself to her mothers letter which was also short   my dearest gillyfloweri know this will be a great blow to you as indeed it was to me but we must not be selfish and must remember that the sisters happiness and welfare is the great point  i wish i could write to you more at length but time will not let me scattered as are all my poor flock at home  so i must leave you to learn the bare public facts from aunt jane and only say my especial private words to you  you are used to being brevet eldest daughter to me now you will have to be so to papa who is mending fast but i think will come home with me  isnt that news                                         your loving mother   they have told you all about it aunt jane said gillian  yes they have been so cruel as not even to tell you the names of these robbers  well i dare say you had rather read my letter than hear it  thank you very much aunt jane  may i take it upstairs with me  consent was readily given and gillian had just time for her first cursory reading before luncheon   dearest jennyfancy what burst upon me only the day after my comingthough really we ought to be very thankful  you might perhaps have divined what was brewing from the letters  jasper knew of one and suspected the other before the accident and he says it prevented him from telegraphing to stop me for he was sure one or both the girls would want their mother  phyllis began it  hers is a young merchant just taken into the great underwood firm  bernard underwood a very nice fellow brother to the husband of one of harry mays sistersvery much liked and respected and by the way an uncommonly handsome man  that was imminent before jaspers accident and the letter to prepare me must be reposing in harrys care  mr underwood came down with claude to meet me when i landed and i scented danger in his eye  but it is all rightonly his income is entirely professional and they will have to live out here for some time to come  the other only spoke yesterday having abstained from worrying his general  he is lord francis somerville son to lord liddesdale and a captain in the glen lorn highlanders who have not above a couple of years to stay in these parts  he was with the riding party when jasper fell and was the first to lift him indeed he held him all the time of waiting for poor claude trembled too much  he was an immense help through the nursing and they came to know and depend on him as nothing else would have made them do and they proved how sincerely rightminded and good he is  there is some connection with the underwoods though i have not quite fathomed it  there is no fear about home consent for it seems that he is given to outpourings to his mother and had heard that if he thought of sir jasper merrifields daughter his parents would welcome her knowing what sir j is  theres for you considering that we have next to nothing to give the child and frank has not much fortune but alethea is trained to the soldierly life and they will be better off than jasper and i were  the worst of it is leaving them behind and as neither of the gentlemen can afford a journey home we mean to have the double wedding before lent  as to outfit the native tailors must be chiefly trusted to or the stores at calcutta and i must send out the rest when i come home  only please send by post my wedding veil gillian knows where it is together with another as like it as may be  any slight lace decorations to make us respectable which suggest themselves to you and her might come i cant recollect or mention them now  i wish reginald could come and tell you all but the poor fellow has to go home full pelt about those irish  jasper is writing to william and you must get business particulars from him and let gillian and the little ones hear for there is hardly any time to write  phyllis being used to the idea is very quiet and matterof fact about it  she hoped indeed that i guessed nothing till i was satisfied about papa and had had time to rest  alethea is in a much more april condition and i am glad frank waited till i was here on her account and on her fathers  he is going on well but must keep still  he declares that being nursed by two pair of lovers is highly amusing  however such homes being found for two of the tribe is a great relief to his mind  i suppose it is to ones rational mind though it is a terrible tug at ones heartstrings  you shall hear again by the next mail  a brown creature waits to take this to be posted                                        your loving sister                                                        l m   gillian came down to dinner quite pale and to aunt adas kind well gillian she could only repeat it is horrid  it is hard to lose all the pretty double wedding said aunt ada  gillian does not mean that hastily put in miss mohun  oh no said gillian that would be worse than anything  so you think said aunt jane but believe those who have gone through it all my dear when the wrench is over one feels the benefit  gillian shook her head and drank water  her aunts went on talking for they thought it better that she should get accustomed to the prospect and moreover they were so much excited that they could hardly have spoken of anything else  aunt jane wondered if phylliss betrothed were a brother of mr underwood of st matthews whittingtown with whom she had corresponded about the consumptive home and aunt ada regretted the not having called on lady liddesdale when she had spent some weeks at rockstone and consoled herself by recollecting that lord rotherwood would know all about the family she had already looked it out in the peerage and discovered that lord francis cunningham somerville was the only younger son that his age was twentynine and that he had three sisters all married as well as his elder brother who had children enough to make it improbable that alethea would ever be lady liddesdale  she would have shown gillian the record but received the ungracious answer i hate swells  let her alone ada said aunt jane it is a very sore business she will be better by and by  there ensued a little discussion how the veil at silverfold was to be hunted up or if gillian and her aunt must go to do so  can you direct miss vincent asked miss mohun  no i dont think i could besides i dont like to set any one to poke and meddle in mammas drawers  and she could hardly judge what could be available added miss ada  gillian must go to find it said aunt jane and let me see when have i a day  saturday is never free and mondayi could ask mrs hablot to take the cutting out and then i could look up lilys brussels  there she caught a sight of gillians face  perhaps one cause of the alienation the girl felt for her aunt was that there was a certain kindred likeness between them which enabled each to divine the others inquiring disposition though it had different effects on the elder and younger character  jane mohun suspected that she had on her ferret look and guessed that gillians disgusted air meant that the idea of her turning over lady merrifields drawers was almost as distasteful as that of the governesss doing it  suppose gillian goes down on monday with fanny she said  she could manage very well i am sure  gillian cleared up a little  there is much consolation in being of a little importance and she liked the notion of a day at home a quiet day as she hoped in her present mood of speaking to nobody  her aunt let her have her own way and only sent a card to macrae to provide for meeting and for food not even letting miss vincent know that she was coming  that feeling of not being able to talk about it or be congratulated would wear off aunt jane said if she was not worried or argued with in which case it might become perverse affectation  it certainly was not shared by the children  sisters unseen for three years could hardly be very prominent in their minds  fergus hoped that they would ride to the wedding upon elephants and valetta thought it very hard to miss the being a bridesmaid when kitty varley had already enjoyed the honour  however she soon began to glorify herself on the beauty of aletheas future title  what will kitty varley and all say was her cry  nothing unless they are snobs as girls always are said fergus  it is not a nice word said miss adeline  but theres nothing else that expresses it aunt ada returned gillian  i agree to a certain degree said miss mohun but still i am not sure what it does express  just what girls of that sort are said gillian  mere worshippers of any sort of handle to ones name  gillian gillian you are not going in for levelling cried aunt adeline  no said gillian but i call it snobbish to make more fuss about aletheas concern than phyllissjust because he calls himself lord  that is to a certain degree true said miss mohun  the worth of the individual man stands first of all and nothing can be sillier or in worse taste than to parade ones grand relations  to parade yes said aunt adeline but there is no doubt that good connections are a great advantage  assuredly said miss mohun  good birth and an ancestry above shame are really a blessing though it has come to be the fashion to sneer at them  i do not mean merely in the eyes of the world though it is something to have a name that answers for your relations being respectable  but there are such things as hereditary qualities and thus testimony to the existence of a distinguished forefather is worth having  lilys dear old sir maurice de mohun to wit said miss adeline you know she used to tease florence by saying the barons of beechcroft had a better pedigree than the devereuxes  id rather belong to the man who made himself said gillian  well done gill  but though your father won his own spurs you cant get rid of his respectable merrifield ancestry wherewith he started in life  i dont want to  i had rather have them than horrid robber borderers such as no doubt these liddesdale people were  there was a little laughing at this but gillian was saying in her own mind that it was a fine thing to be ones own rodolf of hapsburg and in that light she held captain white who in her present state of mind she held to have been a superior being to all the somervillesperhaps to all the devereuxes who ever existed     chapter vii  an empty nest    there had been no injunctions of secrecy and though neither miss mohun nor gillian had publicly mentioned the subject all rockquay who cared for the news knew by sunday morning that lady merrifields two elder daughters were engaged  gillian in the course of writing her letters had become somewhat familiarised with the idea and really looked forward to talking it over with kalliope  though that young person could hardly be termed aletheas best friend it was certain that alethea stood foremost with her and that her interest in the matter would be very loving  accordingly kalliope was at the place of meeting even before gillian and anxiously she looked as she said  may i venturemay i ask if it is true  true  oh yes kally i knew you would care  indeed i well may  there is no expressing how much i owe to dear miss alethea and lady merrifield and it is such a delight to hear of them  accordingly gillian communicated the facts as she knew them and offered to give any message  only my dear love and congratulations said kalliope with a little sigh  i should like to have written but  but why dont you then  oh no she would be too much engaged to think of us and it would only worry her to be asked for her advice  i think i know what it is about said gillian  how  oh how do you know  did mr flight say anything  mr flight exclaimed gillian  what has he to do with it  it was foolish perhaps but i did hope he might have helped alexis and now he seems only to care for his music  helped him  how  perhaps it was unreasonable but alexis has always been to good schools  he was getting on beautifully at leeds and we thought he would have gained a scholarship and gone on to be a clergyman  that was what his mind has always been fixed upon  you cannot think how good and devoted he is said kalliope with a low trembling voice and my father wished it very much too  but when the breakup came mr white made our not being too fine as he said to work a sort of condition of doing anything for us  mr moore did tell him what alexis is but i believe he thought it all nonsense and there was nothing to be done  alexisdear fellowtook it so nicely said he was thankful to be able to help mother and if it was his duty and gods will it was sure to come right and he has been plodding away at the marble works ever since quite patiently and resolutely but trying to keep up his studies in the evening only now he has worked through all his old schoolbooks  and does not mr flight know that i will help him  well mr flight means to be kind and sometimes seems to think much of him but it is all for his music i am afraid  he is always wanting new things to be learnt and practised and those take up so much time and though he does lend us books they are of no use for study though they only make the dear boy long and long the more to get on  does not mr flight know  i am not sure  i think he does but in his ardour for music he seems to forget all about it  it does seem such a pity that all alexiss time should be wasted in this drudgery  if i could only be sure of more extra work for my designs i could set him free and if sir jasper were only at home i am sure he would put the boy in the way of earning his education  if it were only as a pupil teacher he would be glad but then he says he ought not to throw all on me  oh he must be very good exclaimed gillian  i am sure papa will help him  i wish i could  ohwith a sudden recollectioni wonder what books he wants most  i am going to silverfold tomorrow and there are lots of old schoolbooks there of the boys doing nothing that i know he might have  oh miss gillian how good of you  how delighted he would be  do you know what he wants most  a greek grammar and lexicon most of all was the ready answer  he has been trying to find them at the secondhand shop ever so long but i am afraid there is no hope of a lexicon they are so large and expensive  i think there is an old one of jaspers if he would not mind its back being off and lots of blots  he would mind nothing  oh miss gillian you cant think how happy he will be  if there is anything else he wants very much how could he let me know mused gillian  oh i see  what time are you at the works  alex is there at seven i dont go till nine  i am to be at the station at 840  could you or maura meet me there and tell me  to this kalliope agreed for she said she could be sure of getting to her post in time afterwards and she seemed quite overjoyed  no one could look at her without perceiving that alexis was the prime thought of her heart and gillian delighted her by repeating aunt adelines admiration of his profile and the general opinion of his singing  i am so sorry you have had to give it up she added  it cant be helped kalliope said and i really have no time  but thats not all said gillian beginning to blush herself  0h  i hope theres no gossip or nonsense about that cried kalliope her cheeks flaming  only  not maura  naughty little girl i did not think she knew anything not that there is anything to tell said kalliope much distressed but it is dreadful that there should be such talk  i thought it was that you meant when you said you wanted advice  no one could advise me i am afraid said the girl  if we could only go away from this place  but thats impossible and i dare say the fancy will soon go off  then you dont care for him  my dear miss gillian when i have seen gentlemen said kalliope in a tone that might have cured her admirer  they had however talked longer than usual and the notes of the warning bell came up just when gillian had many more questions to ask and she had to run down the garden all in a glow with eagerness and excitement so that aunt ada asked if she had been standing in the sea wind  her affirmative was true enough and yet she was almost ashamed of it as not the whole truth and there was a consciousness about her all the afternoon which made her soon regret that conversation was chiefly absorbed by the younger ones lamentations that they were not to accompany her to silverfold and by their commissions  fergus wanted a formidable amount of precious tools and inchoate machines which mrs halfpenny had regarded as mess and utterly refused to let his aunts be fashed with while valettas orders were chiefly for the visiting all the creatures so as to bring an exact account of the health and spirits of rigdum funnidos etc also for some favourite storybooks which she wished to lend to kitty varley and maura white  for do you know gill maura has never had a new storybook since mamma gave her little alice and her sister when she was seven years old  do bring her stories they tell me and on angels wings  but is not that mysies  oh yes but i know mysie would let her have it  mysie always let maura have everything of hers because the boys teased her  i will bring it but i think mysie ought to be written to before it is lent  that is right gillian said miss mohun it is always wiser to be aboveboard when dealing with other peoples things even in trifles  why did this sound like a reproach and as if it implied suspicion that gillian was not acting on that principle  she resented the feeling  she knew she might do as she liked with the boys old books for which they certainly had no affection and which indeed her mother had talked of offering to some of those charities which have a miscellaneous appetite and wonderful power of adaptation of the disused  besides though no one could have the least objection to their being bestowed on the whites the very fact of this being her third secret meeting with kalliope was beginning to occasion an awkwardness in accounting for her knowledge of their needs  it was obvious to ask why she had not mentioned the first meeting and this her pride would not endure  she had told her parents by letter what more could be desired  again when she would not promise to see either miss vincent or the miss hackets because she did not want to have a fuss aunt jane said she thought it a pity with regard at least to the governess who might feel herself hurt at the neglect and needless secrets are always unadvisable  gillian could hardly repress a wriggle but her aunt ada laughed saying especially with you about jenny for you always find them out  at present however miss mohun certainly had no suspicion  gillian was very much afraid she would think proper to come to the station in the morning but she was far too busy and gillian started off in the omnibus alone with mrs mount in handsome black silk trim to be presented to mr macrae and much enjoying the trip having been well instructed by fergus and valetta in air that she was to see  kalliope was descried as the omnibus stopped and in a few seconds gillian had shaken hands with her received the note and heard the ardent thanks sent from alexis and which the tattered bookseven if they proved to be rightwould scarcely deserve  he would come with his sister to receive the parcel at the station on gillians return at 529 an offer which obviated any further difficulties as to conveyance  mrs mount was intent upon the right moment to run the gauntlet for the tickets and had it been otherwise would have seen nothing remarkable in her charge being accosted by a nicelooking ladylike girl  so on they rushed upon their way gillians spirits rising in a curious sense of liberty and holidaymaking  in due time they arrived and were received by macrae with the pony carriage while the trees of silverfold looked exquisite in their autumn red gold and brown  but the dreariness of the deserted house with no one on the steps but quiz and all the furniture muffled in sheets struck gillian more than she had expected though the schoolroom had been wakened up for her a bright fire on the hearth and the cockatoo highly conversational the cats so affectionate that it was difficult to take a step without stumbling over one of them  when the business had all been despatched the wedding veil disinterred and the best brussels and honiton safely disposed in a box when an extremely dilapidated and muchinked collection of schoolbooks had been routed out of the backstairs cupboard commonly called erebus and duly packed when a selection of lighter literature had been made with a view both to valetta and lilian when gillian had shown all she could to mrs mount visited all the animals gone round the garden and made two beautiful posies of autumn flowers one for her little sister and the other for kalliope discovered that ferguss precious machine had been ruthlessly made away with but secured his toolsshe found eating partridge in solitary grandeur rather dreary work though she had all the bread sauce to herself and cream to her apple tart to say nothing of macrae waiting upon her as if she had been a duchess and conversing in high exultation upon the marriages only regretting that one gentleman should be a civilian he had always augured that all his young ladies would be in the service and begging that he might be made aware of the weddingday so as to have the bells rung  to express her own feelings to the butler was not possible and his glee almost infected her  she was quite sorry when having placed a choice of pears and october peaches before her he went off to entertain mrs mount and after packing a substratum of the fruit in the basket for the whites she began almost to repent of having insisted on not returning to rockstone till the four oclock train feeling her solitary liberty oppressive and finally she found herself walking down the drive in search of miss vincent  she had to confess to herself that her aunt was quite right and that the omission would have been a real unkindness when she saw how worn and tired the governess looked and the brightness that flashed over the pale face at sight of her  mrs vincent had been much worse and though slightly better for the present was evidently in a critical state very exhausting to her daughter  good miss hacket at that moment came in to sit with her and send the daughter out for some air and it was well that gillian had had some practice in telling her story not too disconsolately for it was received with all the delight that the mere notion of a marriage seems to inspire though phyllis and alethea had scarcely been seen at silverfold before they had gone to india with their father  miss hacket had to be content with the names before she hastened up to the patient but miss vincent walked back through the paddock with gillian talking over what was more personally interesting to the governess the success of her own pupils scattered as they were and comparing notes upon mysies letters  one of these miss vincent had just received by the second post having been written to announce the great news and it continued in true mysie fashion   cousin rotherwood knows all about them and says they will have a famous set of belongings  he will take me to see some of them if we go to london before mamma comes home  bernard underwoods sister is married to mr grinstead the sculptor who did the statue of mercy at the gate that harry gave a photograph of to mamma and she paints pictures herself  i want to see them but i do not know whether we shall stay in london for they do not think it agrees with fly  i do more lessons than she does now and i have read through all autour de mon jardin  i have a letter from dolores too and she thinks that aunt phyllis and all are coming home to make a visit in england for uncle harry to see his father and she wishes very much that they would bring her but it is not to be talked about for fear they should be hindered and old dr may hear of it and be disappointed but you wont see any one to tell   there what have i done exclaimed miss vincent in dismay  but i had only just got the letter and had barely glanced through it  besides who would have thought of mysie having any secrets said gillian  after all i suppose no harm is done for you cant have any other connection with these mays  oh yes there will be for i believe a brother of this man of phylliss married one of the miss mays and i suppose we shall have to get mixed up with the whole lot  how i do hate strangers  but ill take care miss vincent indeed i will  one is not bound to tell ones aunts everything like ones mother  no said miss vincent decidedly especially when it is another persons secret betrayed through inadvertence  perhaps she thought gillian looked dangerously gratified for she added however you know poor dolores did not find secrecy answer  oh there are secrets and secrets and aunts and aunts said gillian  dolores had no mother  it makes a difference said miss vincent  i should never ask you to conceal anything from lady merrifield  besides this is not a matter of conduct only a report  gillian would not pursue the subject  perhaps she was a little disingenuous with her conscience for she wanted to carry off the impression that miss vincent had pronounced concealment from her aunts to be justifiable and she knew at the bottom of her heart that her governess would condemn a habit of secret intimacy with any one being carried on without the knowledge of her hostess and guardian for the time beingabove all when it was only a matter of waiting  it is a fine thing for selfsatisfaction to get an opinion without telling the whole of the facts of the case and gillian went home in high spirits considerably encumbered with parcels and surprising mrs mount by insisting that two separate packages should be made of the books  kalliope and alexis were both awaiting her at the station their gratitude unbounded and finding useful vent by the latter fetching a cab and handing in the goods  it was worth something to see how happy the brother and sister looked as they went off in the gaslight the one with the big brown paper parcel the other with the basket of fruit and flowers and gillians explanation to mrs mount that they were old friends of her soldiering days was quite satisfactory  there was a grand unpacking  aunt ada was pleased with the late roses and aunt jane that there had been a recollection of lilian giles to whom she had thought her niece far too indifferent valetta fondled the flowers and was gratified to hear of the ardent affection of the begum and the health of rigdum though gillian was forced to confess that she had not transferred to him the kiss that she had been commissioned to convey  nobody was disappointed except fergus who could not but vituperate the housemaids for the destruction of his new patent guillotine for mice which was to have been introduced to clement varley  to be sure it would hardly ever act and had never cut off the head of anything save a dandelion but that was a trifling consideration  a letter from mysie was awaiting gillian not lengthy for there was a long interval between mysies brains and her pen and saying nothing about the new zealand report  the selection of lace was much approved and the next day there was to be an expedition to endeavour to get the veil matched as nearly as possible  the only dangerous moment was at breakfast the next day when miss mohun said  fanny was delighted with silverfold  macrae seems to have been the pink of politeness to her  she must come when the house is alive again said gillian  what would she think of it then  oh that would be perfectly delicious cried valetta  she would see begum and rigdum  and i could show her how to work the lawn cutter added fergus  by the bye said aunt jane whom have you been lending books to  oh to the whites said gillian colouring as she felt more than she could wish  there were some old schoolbooks that i thought would be useful to them and i was sure mamma would like them to have some flowers and fruit  she felt herself very candid but why would aunt jane look at those telltale cheeks  sunday was wet or rather misty moisty with a raw seafog overhanging everythingnot bad enough however to keep any one except aunt ada from church or school though she decidedly remonstrated against gillians going out for her wandering in the garden in such weather and if she had been like the other aunt might almost have been convinced that such determination must be for an object  however gillian encountered the fog in vain though she walked up and down the path till her clothes were quite limp and flabby with damp  all the view that rewarded her was the outline of the shrubs looming through the mist like distant forests as mountains  moreover she got a scolding from aunt ada who met her coming in and was horrified at the misty atmosphere which she was said to have brought in and insisted on her going at once to change her dress and staying by the fireside all the rest of the afternoon  i cannot think what makes her so eager about going out in the afternoon said the younger aunt to the elder  it is impossible that she can have any reason for it  only sunday restlessness said miss mohun added to the reckless folly of the bachfisch about health  thats true said adeline girls must be either so delicate that they are quite helpless or so strong as to be absolutely weather proof  fortune however favoured gillian when next she went to lily giles she had never succeeded in taking real interest in the girl who seemed to her to be so silly and sentimental that an impulse to answer drily instantly closed up all inclination to effusions of confidence  gillian had not yet learnt breadth of charity enough to understand that everybody does not feel or express feeling after the same pattern that gush is not always either folly or insincerity and that girls of lilys class are about at the same stage of culture as the young ladies of whom her namesake in the inheritance is the type  when lily showed her in some little magazine the weakest of poetry and called it so sweet just like dear mr grants lovely sermon the last she had heard  did he not look so like a saint in his surplice and white stole with his holy face and beautiful blue eyes it was enough to make any one feel good to look at him gillian simply replied oh i never think of the clergymans looks and hurried to her book feeling infinitely disgusted and contemptuous never guessing that these poor verses and the curates sermons and devotional appearance were to the young girls heart the symbols of all that was sacred and all that was refined and that the thought of them was the solace of her lonely and suffering hours  tolerant sympathy is one of the latest lessons of life and perhaps it is well that only             the calm temper of our age should be            like the high leaves upon the hollytree   for the character in course of formation needs to be guarded by prickles  however on this day undine was to be finished for gillian was in haste to begin katharine ashton which would she thought be much more wholesome reality so she went on later than usual and came away at last leaving her auditor dissolved in tears over poor undines act of justice  as mrs giles full of thanks opened the little gardengate just as twilight was falling gillian beheld kalliope and alexis white coming up together from the works and eagerly met and shook hands with them  the dark days were making them close earlier they explained and as kalliope happened to have nothing to finish or purchase she was able to come home with her brother  therewith alexis began to express with the diffidence of extreme gratitude his warm thanks for the benefaction of books which were exactly what he had wanted and longed for  his foreign birth enabled him to do this much more prettily and less clumsily than an english boy and gillian was pleased though she told him that her brothers old illused books were far from worthy of such thanks  ah you cannot guess how precious they are to me said alexis they are the restoration of hope  and can you get on by yourself asked gillian  is it not very difficult without any teacher  people have taught themselves before returned the youth so i hope to do so myself but of course there are many questions i long to ask  perhaps i could answer some said gillian i have done some classics with a tutor  oh thank you miss merrifield he said eagerly  if you could make me understand the force of the aorist  it so happened that gillian had the explanation at her tongues end and it was followed by another and another till one occurred which could hardly be comprehended without reference to the passage upon which alexis pulled a greek testament out of his pocket and his sister could not help exclaiming  oh alexis you cant ask miss merrifield to do greek with you out in the street  certainly it was awkward the more so as mrs stebbing just then drove by in her carriage  what a pity exclaimed gillian  but if you would set down any difficulties you could send them to me by kalliope on sunday  oh miss merrifield how very good of you exclaimed alexis his face lighting up with joy  but kalliope looked doubtful and began a hesitating but  ill tell you of a better way exclaimed gillian  i always go once a week to read to this lilian giles and if i come down afterwards to kalliopes office after you have struck work i could see to anything you wanted to ask  alexis broke out into the most eager thanks  kalliope said hardly anything and as they had reached the place where the roads diverged they bade one another goodevening  gillian looked after the brother and sister just as the gas was being lighted and could almost guess what alexis was saying by his gestures of delight  she did not hear and did not guess how kalliope answered dont set your heart on it too much dear fellow for i should greatly doubt whether miss gillians aunts will consent oh yes of course if they permit her it will be all right  so gillian went her way feeling that she had found her great thing training a minister for the church  was not that a great thing     chapter viii  gillians pupil    gillian was not yet seventeen and had lived a home life totally removed from gossip so that she had no notion that she was doing a more awkward or remarkable thing than if she had been teaching a drummerboy  she even deliberated whether she should mention her undertaking to her mother or produce the grand achievement of alexis white prepared for college on the return from india but a sense that she had promised to tell everything and that while she did so she could defy any other interference led her to write the design in a letter to ceylon and then she felt ready to defy any censure or obstructions from other quarters  mystery has a certain charm  infinite knowledge of human nature was shown in the text stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant and it would be hard to define how much gillians satisfaction was owing to the sense of benevolence or to the pleasure of eluding aunt jane when after going through her chapter of katharine ashton in a somewhat perfunctory manner she hastened away to miss whites office  this being connected with the showroom could be entered without passing through the gate with the inscriptionno admittance except on business  indeed the office had a private door which at gillians signal was always opened to her  there on the drawingdesk lay a greek exercise and a translation with queries upon the difficulties for gillian to correct or answer in writing  kalliope had managed to make that little room a pleasant place bare as it was by pinning a few of her designs on the walls and always keeping a terracotta vase of flowers or coloured leaves upon the table  the lower part of the window she had blocked with transparencies delicately cut and tinted in cardboarddone as she told gillian by her little brother theodore who learnt to draw at the national school and had the same turn for art as herself  altogether the perfect neatness and simplicity of the little room gave it an air of refinement which rendered it by no means an unfit setting for the grave beauty of kalliopes countenance and figure  the enjoyment of the meeting was great on both sides partly from the savour of old times and partly because there was really much that was uncommon and remarkable about kalliope herself  her fathers promotion had come exactly when she and her next brother were at the time of life when the changes it brought would tell most on their minds and manners  they had both been sent to schools where they had associated with young people of gentle breeding which perhaps their partly foreign extraction and southern birth and childhood made it easier for them to assimilate  their beauty and brightness had led to a good deal of kindly notice from the officers and ladies of the regiment and they had thus acquired the habits and ways of the class to which they had been raised  their father likewise had been a man of a chivalrous nature whose youthful mistakes had been the outcome of high spirit and romance and who under discipline danger suffering and responsibility had become earnestly religious  there had besides been his colonels influence on him and on his children that of lady merrifield and alethea  it had then been a piteous change and darkening of life when after the crushing grief of his death the young people found themselves in such an entirely different stratum of society  they were ready to work but they could not help feeling the mortification of being relegated below the mysterious line of gentry as they found themselves at rockquay and viewed as on a level with the clerks and shopgirls of the place  still more as time went on did they miss the companionship and intercourse to which they had been used  mr flight the only person in a higher rank who took notice of them and perceived that there was more in them than was usual was after all only a patronnot a friend and perhaps was not essentially enough of a gentleman to be free from all airs of condescension even with alexis while he might be wise in not making too much of an approach to so beautiful a girl as kalliope  besides after a fit of eagerness and something very like promises he had apparently let alexis drop only using him for his musical services and not doing anything to promote the studies for which the young man thirsted nor proposing anything for the younger boys who would soon outgrow the national school  alexis had made a few semifriends among the musical youth of the place but there was no one to sympathise with him in his studious tastes and there was much in his appearance and manners to cause the accusation of being stuckupmusic being really the only point of contact with most of his fellows of the lower professional class  kalliope had less time but she had on principle cultivated kindly terms with the young women employed under her  her severe style of beauty removed her from any jealousy of her as a rival and she was admiredalmost worshippedby them as the glory of the workshop they felt her superiority and owned her ability but nobody there was capable of being a companion to her  thus the sister and brother had almost wholly depended upon one another and it was like a breath from what now seemed the golden age of their lives when gillian merrifield walked into the office treating kalliope with all the freedom of an equal and the affection of an old friend  there was not very much time to spare after gillian had looked at the exercises noted and corrected the errors and explained the difficulties or mistakes in the translation from testament and delectus feeling all the time how much more mastery of the subject her pupil had than mr pollocks at home had ever attained to  however kalliope always walked home with her as far as the opening of church cliff road and they talked of the cleverness and goodness of the brothers except richard at leeds who never seemed to be mentioned how theodore kept at the head of the school and had hopes of the drawing prize and how little petros devoured tales of battles and would hear of nothing but being a soldier  now and then too there was a castle in the air of a home for little maura at alexiss future curacy  kalliope seemed to look to working for life for poor mother while theodore should cultivate his art oftener the two recalled old adventures and scenes of their regimental days and discussed the weddings of the two indian sisters  once however kalliope was obliged to suggest with a blushing apology that she feared gillian must go home alone she was not ready  cant i help you what have you to do  kalliope attempted some excuse of putting away designs but presently peeped from the window and gillian with excited curiosity imitated her and beheld lingering about a young man in the pink of fashion with a tearose in his buttonhole and a cane in his hand  oh kally she cried does he often hang about like this waiting for you  not often happily  there old mr stebbing has come out and they are walking away together  we can go now  so he besets you and you have to keep out of his way exclaimed gillian much excited  is that the reason you come to the garden all alone on sunday  yes though i little guessed what awaited me there returned kalliope but we had better make haste for it is late for you to be returning  it was disappointing that kalliope would not discuss such an interesting affair but gillian was sensible of the danger of being so late as to cause questions and she allowed herself to be hurried on too fast for conversation and passing the two stebbings who no doubt took her for a hand  does this often happen asked gillian  no alec walks home with me and the boys often come and meet me oh did i tell you that the master wants theodore to be a pupil teacher  i wish i knew what was best for him  could not he be an artist  i should like some one to tell me whether he really has talent worth cultivating dear boy or if he would be safer and better in an honourable occupation like a schoolmaster  do you call it honourable  oh yes to be sure  i put it next to a clergymans or a doctors life  not a soldiers  that depends said kalliope  on the service he is sent upon you mean  but that is his sovereigns lookout  he only has to obey to do or die  yes it is the putting away of self and possible peril of life that makes all those grandest said kalliope and i think the schoolmaster is next in opportunities of doing good  gillian could not help thinking that none of all these could put away self more entirely than the girl beside her toiling away her beauty and her youth in this dull round of toil not able to exercise the instincts of her art to the utmost and with no change from the monotonous round of mosaics which were forced to be second rate to the commonest household works and the company of the queen of the white ants  gillian perceived enough of the nobleness of such a life to fill her with a certain enthusiasm and make her feel a day blank and uninteresting if she could not make her way to the little office  one evening towards the end of the first fortnight alexis himself came in with a passage that he wanted to have explained  his sister looked uneasy all the time and hurried to put on her hat and stand demonstratively waiting telling gillian that they must go the moment the lesson began to tend to discursive talk and making a most decided sign of prohibition to her brother when he showed a disposition to accompany them  i think you are frightfully particular kally said gillian when they were on their way up the hill  such an old friend and you there too  it would never do here  it would be wrong answered kalliope with the authority of an older woman  he must not come to the office  oh but how could i ever explain to him  one cant do everything in writing  i might as well give up the lessons as never speak to him about them  there was truth in this and perhaps alexis used some such arguments on his side for at about every third visit of gillians he dropped in with some important inquiry necessary to his progress which was rapid enough to compel gillian to devote some time to preparation in order to keep ahead of him  kalliope kept diligent guard and watched against lengthening the lessons into gossip and they were always after hours when the hands had gone away  the fear of being detected kept gillian ready to shorten the time  how late you are were the first words she heard one october evening on entering beechcroft cottage but they were followed by heres a pleasure for you  its from papa himself  open it  open it quick cried valetta dancing round her in full appreciation of the honour and delight  sir jasper said that his daughter must put up with him for a correspondent since two brides at once were as much as any mother could be supposed to undertake  indeed as mamma would not leave him phyllis was actually going to calcutta chaperoned by one of the matrons of the station to make purchases for both outfits since alethea would not stir from under the maternal wing sooner than she could help  at the end came we are much shocked at poor whites death he was an excellent officer and a good and sensible man though much hampered with his family  i am afraid his wife must be a very helpless being  he used to talk about the good promise of one of his sonsthe second i think  we will see whether anything can be done for the children when we come home  i say we for i find i shall have to be invalided before i can be entirely patched up so that mamma and i shall have a sort of postponed silver wedding tour a new variety for the old folks from home  oh is papa coming home cried valetta  for good  oh i hope it will be for good added gillian  then we shall live at dear silverfold all the days of our life added fergus  and i shall get back to rigdum  and i shall make a telephone down to the stables were the cries of the children  the transcendent news quite swallowed up everything else for some time but at last gillian recurred to her fathers testimony as to the white family  is the second son the musical one she was asked and on her affirmative aunt jane remarked well though the rev augustine flight is not on a pinnacle of human wisdom his choir practices etc will keep the lad well out of harms way till your father can see about him  this would have been an opportunity of explaining the youths aims and hopes and her own share in forwarding them but it had become difficult to avow the extent of her intercourse with the brother and sister so entirely without the knowledge of her aunts  even miss mohun acute as she was had no suspicions and only thought with much satisfaction that her niece was growing more attentive to poor lilian giles even to the point of lingering  i really think she said in consultation with miss adeline that we might gratify that damsel by having the white girls to drink tea  well we can add them to your winter party of young ladies in business  hardly  these stand on different ground and i dont want to hurt their feelings or gillians by mixing them up with the shopocracy  have you seen the queen of the white ants  not yet but i mean to reconnoitre and if i see no cause to the contrary i shall invite them for next tuesday  the mother  you might as well ask her namesake  probably but i shall be better able to judge when i have seen her  so miss mohun trotted off made her visit and thus reported poor woman she certainly is not lovely now whatever she may have been but i should think there was no harm in her and she is effusive in her gratitude to all the merrifield family  it is plain that the absent eldest son is the favourite far more so than the two useful children at the marble works and mr white is spoken of as a sort of tyrant whereas i should think they owed a good deal to his kindness in giving them employment  i always thought he was an old hunks  the town thinks so because he does not come and spend freely here but i have my doubts whether they are right  he is always ready to do his part in subscriptions and the employing these young people as he does is true kindness  unappreciated  yes by the mother who would expect to be kept like a lady in idleness but perhaps not so by her daughter  from all i can pick up i think she must be a very worthy person so i have asked her and the little schoolgirl for tuesday evening and i hope it will not be a great nuisance to you ada  oh no said miss adeline good humouredly it will please gillian and i shall be interested in seeing the species or rather the variety  var musa groeca hibernica militaris laughed aunt jane  by the bye i further found out what made the captain enlist  trust you for doing that laughed her sister  really it was not on purpose but old zack skilly was indulging me with some of his ancient smuggling experiences in what he evidently views as the heroic age of rockquay  men was men then he says now they be good for nought but to row out the gentlefolks when the water is as smooth as glass  you should hear the contempt in his voice  well a promising young hero of his was dick white what used to work for his uncle but liked a bit of a lark and at last hit one of the coastguard men in a fight and ran away and folks said he had gone for a soldier  skilly had heard he was dead and his wife had come to live in these parts but there was no knowing what was true and what wasnt  folks would talk  dick was a likely chap with more life about him than his cousin jem as was a great man now and owned all the marble works and a goodish bit of the town  there was a talk as how the two lads had both been a courting of the same maid that was betsy polwhele and had fallen out about her but how that might be he could not tell  anyhow she was not wed to one nor tother of them but went into a waste and died  i wonder if it was for dicks sake  so jem was not constant either  except to his second love  that was a piteous little story too  you mean his young wifes health failing as soon as he brought her to that house which he was building for her and then his taking her to italy and never enduring to come back here again after she and her child died  but he made a good thing of it with his quarries in the mountains  you sordid person do you think that was all he cared for  well i always thought of him as a great stout monied man quite incapable of romance and sensitiveness  if so dont you think he would have let that house instead of keeping it up in empty state  there is a good deal of character in those whites  the captain is certainly the most marked man except jasper in that group of officers in gillians photographbook  partly from the fact that a herd of young officers always look so exactly alikeat least in the eyes of elderly spinsters  jane  let us hope so now that it is all over  this same dick must have had something remarkable about him to judge by the impression he seems to have left on all who came in his way and i shall like to see his children  you always do like queer people  it is plain that we ought to take notice of them said miss mohun and it is not wholesome for gillian to think us backward in kindness to friends about whom she plainly has a little romance  she refrained from uttering a suspicion inspired by her visit that there had been more kindnesses on her nieces part than she could quite account for  yet she believed that she knew how all the girls days were spent was certain that the sunday wanderings never went beyond the garden and moreover she implicitly trusted lilys daughter  gillian did not manifest as much delight and gratitude at the invitation as her aunts expected  in point of fact she resented aunt janes making a visit of investigation without telling her and she was uneasy lest there should have been or yet should be a dis closure that should make her proceedings appear clandestine  and they are not said she to herself with vehemence  do i not write them all to my own mother  and did not miss vincent allow that one is not bound to treat aunts like parents  even the discovery of captain whites antecedents was almost an offence for if her aunt would not let her inquire why should she do so herself save to preserve the choice morceau for her own superior intelligence  thus all the reply that gillian deigned was of course i knew that captain white could never have done anything to be ashamed of  the weather was too wet for any previous meetings and it was on a wild stormy evening that the two sisters appeared at seven oclock at beechcroft cottage  while hats and waterproofs were being taken off upstairs gillian found opportunity to give a warning against mentioning the greek lessons  it was received with consternation  oh miss merrifield do not your aunts know  no  why should they  mamma does  not yet  and she is so far off  i wish miss mohun knew  i made sure that she did said kalliope much distressed  but why  it would only make a fuss  i should be much happier about it  and perhaps have it all upset  that is the point  i felt that it must be all right as long as miss mohun sanctioned it but i could not bear that we should be the means of bringing you into a scrape by doing what she might disapprove while you are under her care  dont you think you can trust me to know my own relations said gillian somewhat haughtily  indeed i did not mean that we are not infinitely obliged to you said kalliope  it has made alexis another creature to have some hope and feel himself making progress  then why do you want to have a fuss and a bother and a chatter if my father and mother dont approve they can telegraph  with which argument she appeased or rather silenced kalliope who could not but feel the task of objecting alike ungracious and ungrateful towards the instructor and absolutely cruel and unkind towards her brother and who spoke only from a sense of the treachery of allowing a younger girl to transgress in ignorance  still she was conscious of not understanding on what terms the niece and aunts might be and the st kenelms estimate of the beechcroft ladies was naturally somewhat different from that of the st andrews congregation  miss mohun was popularly regarded in those quarters as an intolerable busybody and miss adeline as a hypochondriacal fine lady so that gillian might perhaps reasonably object to put herself into absolute subjection so though kalliope might have a presentiment of breakers ahead she could say no more and gillian feeling that she had been cross changed the subject by admiring the pretty short curly hair that was being tied back at the glass  i wish it would grow long said kalliope but it always was rather short and troublesome and ever since it was cut short in the fever i have been obliged to keep it like this  but it suits you said gillian  and it is exactly the thing now  that is the worst of it  it looks as if i wore it so on purpose however all our hands know that i cannot help it and so does lady flight  the girl looked exceedingly well though little alice the maid would not have gone out to tea in such an ancient black dress with no relief save a rim of white at neck and hands and a tiny silver maltese cross at the throat  maura had a comparatively new gray dress picked out with black  she was a pretty creature the irish beauty predominating over the greek in her great longlashed brown eyes which looked radiant with shy happiness  miss adeline was perfectly taken by surprise at the entrance of two such uncommon forms and faces and the quiet dignity of the elder made her for a moment suppose that her sister must have invited some additional guest of undoubted station  valetta who had grown fond of maura in their school life and who dearly loved patronising pounced upon her guest to show her all manner of treasures and curiosities at which she looked in great delight and fergus was so well satisfied with her comprehension of the principles of the letter balance that he would have taken her upstairs to be introduced to all his mechanical inventions if the total darkness and cold of his den had not been prohibitory  kalliope looked to perfection but was more silent than her sister though as miss mohuns keen eye noted it was not the shyness of a conscious inferior in an unaccustomed world but rather that of a grave reserved nature not chattering for the sake of mere talk  gillians photographbook was well looked over with all the brothers and sisters at different stages and the group of officers  miss mohun noted the talk that passed over these as they were identified one by one sometimes with little reminiscences childishly full on gillians part betraying on kalliopes side friendly acquaintance but all in as entirely ladylike terms as would have befitted phyllis or alethea  she could well believe in the words with which miss white rather hastened the turning of the page those were happy daysi dare not dwell on them too much  oh i like to do so cried gillian  i dont want the little ones ever to forget them  yesyou  but with you it would not be repining  this was for gillians ear alone as at that moment both the aunts were at the childrens solicitation engaged on the exhibition of a wonderful musicalboxaunt adelines share of her mothers wedding presentscontaining a bird that hovered and sung the mechanical contrivance of which was the chief merit in ferguss eyes and which had fascinated generations of young people for the last sixty years aunt jane however could hear through anythingeven through the windingup of what the family called aunt adas jackdaw and she drew her conclusions with increasing respect and pity for the young girl over whose life such a change had come  but it was not this but what she called common humanity which prompted her on hearing a heavy gust of rain against the windows to go into the lower regions in quest of a messenger boy to order a brougham to take the guests home at the end of the evening  the meal went off pleasantly on the whole though there loomed a storm as to the ritual of st kenelms but this chiefly was owing to the younger division of the company when valetta broke into an unnecessary inquiry why they did not have as many lights on the altar at st andrews as at st kenelms and fergus put her down with unceremoniously declaring that stebbing said flight was a donkey  gillian came down with what she meant for a crushing rebuke and the indignant colour rose in the cheeks of the guests but fergus persisted but he makes a guy of himself and a mountebank  aunt jane thought it time to interfere  fergus she said you had better not repeat improper sayings especially about a clergyman  fergus wriggled  and added aunt ada with equal severity you know mr flight is a very kind friend to little maura and her sister  indeed he is said kalliope earnestly and maura feeling herself addressed added nobody but he ever called on poor mamma till miss mohun did no not lady flight  we are very grateful for his kindness put in kalliope in a repressive tone  but said gillian i thought you said he had seemed to care less of late  i do not know said miss white blushing music seems to be his chief interest and there has not been anything fresh to get up since the concert  i suppose there will be for the winter said miss mohun and therewith the conversation was safely conducted away to musical subjects in which some of the sisters pride and affection for their brothers peeped out but gillian was conscious all the time that kalliope was speaking with some constraint when she mentioned alexis and that she was glad rather to dwell on little theodore who had good hopes of the drawing prize and she seriously consulted miss mohun on the pupilteachership for him as after he had passed the seventh standard he could not otherwise go on with his education though she did not think he had much time for teaching  would not mr white help him further asked miss mohun  i do not know  i had much rather not ask said kalliope  we are too many to throw ourselves on a person who is no near relation and he has not seemed greatly disposed to help  your elder brother  oh poor richard he is not earning anything yet  i cant ask him if i only knew of some school i could be sure was safe and good and not too costly alexis and i would try to manage for theodore after the examination in the spring  the woodward schools were a new light to her and she was eagerly interested in miss mohuns explanations and in the scale of terms  meantime miss adeline got on excellently with the younger ones and when the others were free proposed for their benefit a spelling game  all sat round the table made words and abstracted one anothers with increasing animation scarcely heeding the roaring of the wind outside till there was a ring at the bell  my brother has come for us said kalliope  oh but it is not fit for you to walk home said miss mohun  the brougham is coming by and by ask mr white to come in she added as the maid appeared with the message that he was come for his sisters  there was a confusion of acknowledgments and disclaimers and word was brought back that mr white was too wet to come in  miss mohun who was not playing but prompting fergus jumped up and went out to investigate when she found a form in an ancient military cloak trying to keep himself from dripping where wet could do mischief she had to explain her regret at his having had such a walk in vain but she had taken alarm on finding that rain was setting in for the night and had sent word by the muffinboy that the brougham would be wanted contriving to convey that it was not to be paid for  nothing remained to be said except thanks and alexis emerged from the cloak which looked as if it had gone through all his fathers campaigns took off his gaiters did his best for his boots and though not in evening costume looked very gentlemanlike and remarkably handsome in the drawingroom with no token of awkward embarrassment save a becoming blush  gillian began to tremble inwardly again but the game had just ended in her favour owing to fergus having lost all his advantages in aunt janes absence besides signalising himself by capturing mauras bury under the impression that an additional r would combine that and straw into a fruit  so the coast being cleared miss adeline greatly relieved her nieces mind by begging as a personal favour to hear the song whose renown at the concert had reached her and thus the time was safely spent in singing till the carriage was announced and goodnights exchanged  mauras eyes grew round with delight and she jumped for joy at the preferment  oh she said as she fervently kissed valetta it is the most delightful evening i ever spent in the whole course of my life except at lady merrifields christmastree  and now to go home in a carriage  i never went in one since i can remember  and kalliopes thank you we have enjoyed ourselves very much was very fervent  those young people are very superior to what i expected said aunt adeline  what fine creatures all so handsome and that little maura is a perfect darling  the muse herself is very superior said miss mohun  one of those home heroines who do the work of atlas without knowing it  i do not wonder that the marble girls speak of her so enthusiastically  how gillian might have enjoyed all this and yet she could not except so far that she told herself that thus there could be no reasonable objection made by her aunts to intercourse with those whom they so much admired  yet perhaps even then she would have told all but that after having bound over kalliope to secrecy it would be awkward to confess that she had told all  it would be like owning herself in the wrong and for that she was not prepared  besides where would be the secrecy of her great thing     chapter ix  gauging ajee    without exactly practising to deceive gillian began to find that concealment involved her in a tangled web all the more since aunt jane had become thoroughly interested in the whites and was inquiring right and left about schools and scholarships for the little boys  she asked their master about them and heard that they were among his best scholars and that their home lessons had always been carefully attended to by their elder brother and sister  in fact he was most anxious to retain theodore to be trained for a pupilteacher the best testimony to his value  aunt jane came home full of the subject relating what the master said of alexis white and that he had begun by working with him at latin and mathematics but that they had not had time to go on with what needed so much study and preparation  in fact said miss mohun i have a suspicion that if a certificated schoolmaster could own any such thing the pupil knew more than the teacher  when your father comes home i hope he will find some way of helping that lad  gillian began to crimson but bethought herself of the grandeur of its being found that she was the youths helper  i am glad you have been lending him books added aunt jane  what business had she to know what had not been told her  the sense of offence drove back any disposition to consult her  yet to teach alexis was no slight task for though he had not gone far in greek his inquiries were searching and explaining to him was a different thing from satisfying even mr pollock  besides gillian had her own studies on hand  the cambridge examinations were beginning to assume larger proportions in the rockquay mind and the general screw company as mr grant observed was prevailing  gillians knowledge was rather discursive and the concentration required by an examination was hard work to her and the time for it was shortened by the necessity of doing all alexiss greek exercises and translations beforehand and of being able to satisfy him why an error was not right for in all politeness he always would know why it did not look right  and there was valetta twisting and groaning the screw was on her form who unless especially exempted were to compete for a prize for language examination  valetta had begun by despising kitty varley for being excepted by her mothers desire and for not learning latin but now she envied any one who had not to work double tides at the book of caesar that was to be taken up and vercingetorix and his arverni got vituperated in a way that would have made the hair of her heroworshipping mother fairly stand on end  but then lilias mohun had studied him for love of himself not for dread of failure  gillian had been displeased when fergus deserted her for aunt jane as an assistant but she would not have been sorry if valetta had been off her hands when she was interrupted in researches after an idiom in st johns gospel by the sigh that this abominable dictionary had no verb oblo or in the intricacies of a double equation by despair at this horrid caesar always hiding away his nominatives out of spite  valetta like the american child evidently regarded the great julius in no other light than as writer of a book for beginners in latin and moreover a very unkind one and she fully reciprocated the sentiment that it was no wonder that the romans conquered the world since they knew the latin grammar by nature  nor was gillians hasty and sometimes petulant assistance very satisfactory to the poor child since it often involved hearing wait a minute and a very long one how can you be so stupid  i told you so long ago and sometimes consisted of a gabbling translation with rapidly pointed finger very hard to follow and not quite so painstaking as when alexis deferentially and politely pointed out the difficulties with a strong sense of the favour that she was doing him  not that these personal lessons often took place  kalliope never permitted them without dire necessity and besides there was always an uncertainty when gillian might come down or when alexis might be able to come in  one day when aunt jane had come home with a story of how one of her business girls had confessed to miss whites counsel having only just saved her from an act of folly it occurred to aunt adeline to say  it is a great pity you have not her help in the gfs  i did not understand enough about her before and mixed her up with the ordinary class of business girls  i had rather have her a member for the sake of example but if not she would be a valuable associate  could not you explain this to her without hurting her feelings as i am afraid i did gill  i did not understand enough about her when i spoke to her before  gillian started  the conversation that should have been so pleasant to her was making her strangely uncomfortable  i do not see how gill is to get at her objected the other aunt it would be of no great use to call on her in the nest of the queen of the white ants  i cant help recollecting the name it was so descriptive  yes it was on her mothers account that she refused and of course her office must not be invaded in business hours  i might call on her there before she goes home suggested gillian seeing daylight  you cannot be walking down there at dusk just as the workmen come away exclaimed aunt ada making the colour so rush into gillians cheeks that she was glad to catch up a screen  no said miss mohun emphatically but i could leave her there at five oclock and go to tideshole to take old jemmy burnet his jersey and call for her on the way back  or she could walk home with me murmured the voice behind the screen  gillian felt with dismay that all these precautions as to her escort would render her friend more scrupulous than ever as to her visits to have said i have several times been at the office would have been a happy clearance of the ground but her pride would not bend to possible blame nor would she run the risk of a prohibition  it would be the ruin of hope to alexis and mamma knows all said she to herself  it was decided that she should trust to kalliope to go back with her for when once aunt jane get into the very fishy hamlet of tideshole which lay beyond the quarries there was no knowing when she might get away since             alike to her were time and tide            novembers snow or julys pride   so after a few days too wet and tempestuous for any expedition they set forth accompanied by fergus who rushed in from school in time to treat his aunt as a peripatetic joyces scientific dialogues valetta had not arrived and gillian was in haste to elude her knowing that her aunt would certainly not take her on to tideshole and that there would be no comfort in talking before her but it was a new thing to have to regard her little sister in the light of a spy and again she had to reason down a sense of guiltiness however her aunt wanted valetta as little as she did and she had never so rejoiced in ferguss monologue then this small flywheel catches into the targe one and so dont you see only pausing for a sound of assent  unacquainted with the private door miss mohun entered the office through the showroom exchanging greetings with the young saleswomen and finding miss white putting away her materials  shaking hands miss mohun said  i have brought your friend to make a visit to you while i go on to tideshole  she tells me that you will be kind enough to see her on her way home if you are going back at the same time  i shall be delighted said kalliope with eyes as well as tongue and no sooner were she and gillian alone together than she joyfully exclaimed  then miss mohun knows  you have told her  no  oh and there were volumes in the intonation  i was alarmed when she came in and then so glad if it was all over  dear miss merrifield  call me gillian i have told you to do so before  phyllis is miss merrifield and i wont be so before my time said gillian interrupting in a tone more cross than affectionate  i was going to say pursued kalliope that the shock her entrance gave to me proved all the more that we cannot be treating her properly  never mind that  i did not come about that  she is quite taken with you kally and wants you more than ever to be a friendly girl because she thinks it would be so good for the others who are under you  they have told me something about it said kalliope thoughtfully  she fancied added gillian that perhaps she did not make you understand the rights of it not knowing that you were different from the others  oh no it was not that said kalliope  indeed i hope there is no such nonsense in me   it was what my dear father always warned us against only poor mamma always gets vexed if she does not think we are keeping ourselves up and she had just been annoyed at something and we did not know then that it was lady merrifields sister  this was contradictory but it was evident that while kalliope disowned conceit of station for herself she could not always cross her mothers wishes  it was further elicited that if lady flight had taken up the matter there would have been no difficulty  half a year ago the flights had seemed to the young whites angelic and infallible and perhaps expectations had been founded on their patronage but there had since been a shadow of disappointment and altogether kalliope was less disposed to believe that my lady was correct in pronouncing miss mohuns cherished society as dissentish and only calculated for low servant girls and ladies who wished to meddle in families  clanship made gillians indignation almost bring down the office and her eloquence was scarcely needed since kalliope had seen the value to some of her hands from the class the library the recreation room and the influence of the ladies above all the showing them that it was possible to have variety and amusement free from vulgar and perilous dissipation but still she hesitated  she had no time she said she could not attend classes and she was absolutely necessary at home in the evenings but gillian assured her that nothing was expected from her but a certain influence in the right direction and the showing the younger and giddier that she did not think the society beneath her  i see all that said kalliope i wish i had not been mistaken at first but miss mergillian i do not see how i can join it now  why not  what do you mean  kalliope was very unwilling to speak but at last it came  how can i do this to please your aunt who thinks better of me than i deserve whenoh excuse mei know it is all your kindnessbut when i am allowing you to deceive heralmost i mean  deceive  i never spoke an untrue word to my aunt in my life said gillian in proud anger but if you think so miss white i had better have no more to do with it  i feel said kalliope with tears in her eyes as if it might be better so unless miss mohun knew all about it  well if you think so and like to upset all your brothers hopes  it would be a terrible grief to him i know and i dont undervalue your kindness indeed i dont but i cannot be happy about it while miss mohun does not know  i dont understand why you do not tell her  because i know there would be a worry and a fuss  either she would say we must wait for letters from mamma or else that alexis must come to beechcroft and all the comfort would be over and it would be gossiped about all over the place  cant you trust me when i tell you i have written it all to my own father and mother and surely i know my own family best  kalliope looked half convinced but she persisted  i suppose you do only please till there is a letter from lady merrifield i had rather not go into this society  but kally you dont consider  what am i to say to my aunt  what will she think of you  i cant help that  i cannot do this while she could feel i was conniving at what she might not like  indeed i cannot  i beg your pardon but it goes against me  when shall you be able to hear from lady merrifield  i wrote three weeks ago  i suppose i shall hear about halfway through december and you know they could telegraph if they wanted to stop it so i think you might be satisfied  still kalliope could not be persuaded and finally as a sort of compromise gillian decided on saying that she would think about it and give her answer at christmas to which she gave a reluctant assent with one more protest that if there were no objection to the lessons she could not see why miss mohun should not know of them  peace was barely restored before voices were heard and in came fergus bringing alexis with him  they had met on the beach road in front of the works and fergus being as usual full of questions about a crane that was swinging blocks of stone into a vessel close to the little pier his aunt had allowed him to stay to see the work finished after which alexis would take him to join his sister  so it came about that they all walked home together very cheerfully though gillian was still much vexed under the surface at kalliopes oldmaidish particularity  however the aunts were not as annoyed at the delay as she expected miss mohun said she would look out some papers that would be convincing and persuasive and that it might be as well not to enrol miss white too immediately before the christmas festivities but to wait till the books were begun next year  plans began to prevail for the christmas diversions and entertainments but the young merrifields expected to have nothing to do with these as they were to meet the rest of the family at their eldest uncles house at beechcroft all except harry who was to be ordained in the advent ember week and at once begin work with his cousin david merrifield in the black country  their aunts would not go with them as beechcroft breezes though her native air were too cold for adeline in the winter and jane could leave neither her nor her various occupations and the festivities of all rockstone  it is not easy to say which gillian most looked forward to mysies presence or the absence of the supervision which she imagined herself to suffer from because she had set herself to shirk it  she knew she should feel more free  but behold a sudden change produced by one mornings letters  it is a beastly shame  oh fergus  thats not a thing to say cried valetta  i dont care  it is a beastly shame not to go to beechcroft and be poked up here all the holidays  but you cant when primrose has got the whoopingcough  bother the whoopingcough  and welcome but you would find it bother you i believe  i shouldnt catch it  i want wilfred and to ride the pony and see the sluice that uncle maurice made  you couldnt if you had the cough  then i should stay there instead of coming back to school  i say it is horrid and beastly and abominable and  come come fergus here put in gillian that is very wrong  you dont hear gill and me fly out in that way added valetta though we are so sorry about mysie and fly  oh you are girls and dont know what is worth doing  i will say it is beast  now dont fergus it is very rude and ungrateful to the aunts none of us like having to stay here and lose our holiday but it is very improper to say so in their own house and i thought you were so fond of aunt jane  aunt jane knows a thing or two but she isnt wilfred  and wilfred is always teasing you  fergus is quite right said miss mohun who had been taking off her galoshes in the vestibule while this colloquy was ending in the diningroom it is much better to be bullied by a brother than made much of by an aunt and you know i am very sorry for you all under the infliction  oh aunt jane we know you are very kind and began gillian  never mind my dear i know you are making the best of us and i am very much obliged to you for standing up for us  it is a great disappointment but i was going to give fergus a note that i think will console him  and out of an envelope which she had just taken from the letterbox she handed him a note which he pulled open and then burst out cousin david  hurrah  scrumptious commencing a wardance at the same moment  what is it  has david asked you demanded both his sisters at the same moment  hurrah  yes it is from him my dear fergus i hopehurrah harry mmmmmmbrothers 20th mmmm  your affectionate cousin david merrifield  let me read it to you volunteered gillian  wouldnt you like it  how can you be so silly ferg  you cant read it yourself  you dont know whether he really asks you  fergus made a face and bolted upstairs to gloat and perhaps peruse the letter while valetta rushed after him whether to be teased or permitted to assist might be doubtful  he really does ask him said aunt jane  your cousin david i mean  he says that he and harry can put up all the three boys between them and that they will be very useful in the christmas festivities of coalham  it is very kind of him said gillian in a depressed tone  fergus will be very happy  i only hope he will not be bent on finding a coal mine in the garden when he comes back said aunt jane smiling but it is rather dreary for you my dear  i had been hoping to have jasper here for at least a few days  could he not come and fetch fergus  gillians eyes sparkled at the notion but they fell at once for jasper would be detained by examinations until so late that he would only just be able to reach coalham before christmas day  harry was to be ordained in a fortnights time to work under his cousin mr david merrifield and his young brothers were to meet him immediately after  i wish i could go too sighed gillian as a hungry yearning for jasper or for mysie took possession of her  i wish you could said miss mohun sympathetically but i am afraid you must resign yourself to helping us instead  oh aunt jane i did not mean to grumble  it cant be helped and you are very kind  oh dear said poor miss jane afterwards in private to her sister how i hate being told i am very kind  it just means you are a not quite intolerable jailor and despot with fairly good intentions  i am sure you are kindness itself dear jenny responded miss adeline  i am glad they own it  but it is very inconvenient and unlucky that that unjustifiable mother should have sent her child to the party to carry the whoopingcough to poor little primrose and mysie and phyllis  all at one fell swoop  as for primrose the worthy halfpenny is quite enough for her and lily is well out of it but fly is a little shrimp overdone all round and i dont like the notion of it for her  and rotherwood is so wrapped up in her  poor dear fellow i hope all will go well with her  there is no reason it should not  delicate children often have it the most lightly  but i am sorry for gillian though if she would let us i think we could make her happy  gillian meantime after her first fit of sick longing for her brother and sister and sense of disappointment was finding some consolation in the reflection that had jasper discovered her instructions to alexis white he would certainly have made no end of a row about it and have laughed to scorn the bare notion of her teaching greek to a countinghouse clerk  but then jasper was wont to grumble and chafe at all employmentsespecially beneficent onesthat interfered with devotion to his lordly self and on the whole perhaps he was safer out of the way as he might have set on the aunts to put a stop to her proceedings  of mysies sympathy she was sure yet she would have her scruples about the aunts and she was a sturdy person hard to answerpoor mysie whooping away helplessly in the schoolroom at rotherwood  gillian felt herself heroically goodhumoured and resigned  moreover here was the indian letter so long looked for likely by its date to be an answer to the information as to alexis whites studies  behold it did not appear to touch on the subject at all  it was all about preparations for the double wedding written in scraps by different hands at different times evidently snatched from many avocations and much interruption  of mamma there was really least of all but squeezed into a corner scarcely legible gillian read as to lessons if at j approves  it was evidently an afterthought and gillian could and chose to refer it to a certain inquiry about learning the violin which had never been answeredfor the confusion that reigned at columbo was plainly unfavourable to attending to minute details in home letters  the longest portions of the despatch were papas since he was still unable to move about  he wroteour two young men think it probable you will have invitations from their kith and kin  if this comes to pass you had better accept them though you will not like to break up the christmas party at beechcroft court  there being no christmas party at beechcroft court gillian in spite of her distaste to new people was not altogether sorry to receive a couple of notes by the same post the first enclosed in the second both forwarded from thence                                              vale leston priory                                              9th december  my dear miss merrifieldwe are very anxious to make acquaintance with my brother bernards new belongings since we cannot greet our new sister phyllis ourselves  we always have a family gathering at christmas between this house and the vicarage and we much hope that you and your brother will join it  could you not meet my sister mrs grinstead in london and travel down with her on the 23rd  i am sending this note to her as i think she has some such proposal to makeyours very sincerely                                            wilmet u harewood   the other letter was thus                                            brompton 10th december  my dear gillianit is more natural to call you thus as you are becoming a sort of relationvery unwillingly i dare sayfor in this storm i too have lost a brother  however we will make the best of it and please dont hate us more than you can help  since your own home is dispersed for the present it seems less outrageous to ask you to spend a christmas day among new people and i hope we may make you feel at home with us and that you will enjoy our beautiful church at vale leston  we are so many that we may be less alarming if you take us by driblets so perhaps it will be the best way if you will come up to us on the 18th or 19th and go down with us on the 23rd  you will find no one with us but my nephewalmost songerald underwood and my niece anna vanderkist who will be delighted to make friends with your brother jasper who might perhaps meet you here  you must tell me all about phyllis and what she would like best for her cingalese homeyours affectionately                                             geraldine grinstead   thus then affairs shaped themselves  gillian was to take fergus to london where jasper would meet them at the station and put the little boy into the train for coalham whither his brother wilfred had preceded him by a day or two  jasper and gillian would then repair to brompton for two or three days before going down with mr and mrs grinstead to vale leston and they were to take care to pay their respects to old mrs merrifield who had become too infirm to spend christmas at stokesley  what was to happen later was uncertain whether they were to go to stokesley or whether jasper would join his brothers at coalham or come down to rockstone with his sister for the rest of the holidays valetta must remain there and it did not seem greatly to distress her and whereas nothing had been said about children she was better satisfied to stay within reach of kitty and mamma and the christmas trees that began to dawn on the horizon than to be carried into an unknown region of grownups  while gillian was not only delighted at the prospect of meeting jasper her own especial brother but was heartily glad to make a change and defer the entire question of lessons confessions and gfs for six whole weeks  she might get a more definite answer from her parents or something might happen to make explanation to her aunt either unnecessary or much more easyand she was safe from discovery  but examinations had yet to be passed     chapter x  aut caesar aut nihil    examinations were the great autumn excitement  gillian was going up for the higher cambridge and valettas form was under preparation for competition for a prize in languages  the great mr white on being asked to patronise the high school at its first start four years ago had endowed it with prizes for each of the four forms for the most proficient in two tongues  as the preparation became more absorbing brows were puckered and looks were anxious and the aunts were doubtful as to the effect upon the girls minds or bodies  it was too late however to withdraw them and miss mohun could only insist on air and exercise and permit no work after the sevenoclock tea  she was endeavouring to chase cobwebs from the brains of the students by the humours of mrs nickleby when a message was brought that miss leverett the headmistress of the high school wished to speak to her in the diningroom  this was no unusual occurrence as miss mohun was secretary to the managing committee of the high school but on the announcement valetta began to fidget and presently said that she was tired and would go to bed  the most ordinary effect of fatigue upon this young lady was to make her resemble the hero of the nursery poem             i do not want to go to bed            sleepy little harry said   nevertheless this willingness excited no suspicion till miss mohun came to the door to summon valetta  is there anything wrong exclaimed sister and niece together  gone to bed  oh  ill tell you presently  dont you come gillian  she vanished again leaving gillian in no small alarm and vexation  i wonder what it can be mused aunt ada  i shall go and find out said gillian jumping up as she heard a door shut upstairs  no dont said aunt ada you had much better not interfere  it is my business to see after my own sister returned gillian haughtily  i see what you mean my dear said her aunt stretching out her hand kindly but i do not think you can do any good  if she is in a scrape you have nothing to do with the high school management and for you to burst in would only annoy miss leverett and confuse the affair  oh i know your impulse of defence dear gillian but the time has not come yet and you cant have any reasonable doubt that jane will be just nor that your mother would wish that you should be quiet about it  but suppose there is some horrid accusation against her said gillian hotly  but dear child if you dont know anything about it how can you defend her  i ought to know  so you will in time but the more people there are present the more confusion there is and the greater difficulty in getting at the rights of anything  more by her caressing tone of sympathy than by actual arguments adeline did succeed in keeping gillian in the drawingroom though not in pacifying her till doors were heard again and something so like valetta crying as she went upstairs that gillian was neither to have nor to hold and made a dash out of the room only to find her aunt and the headmistress exchanging last words in the hall and as she was going to brush past them aunt jane caught her hand and said  wait a moment gillian i want to speak to you  there was no getting away but she was very indignant  she tugged at her aunts hand more than perhaps she knew and there was something of a flouncing as she flung into the drawingroom and demanded  well what have you been doing to poor little val  we have done nothing said miss mohun quietly  miss leverett wanted to ask her some questions  sit down gillian   you had better hear what i have to say before going to her  well it appears that there has been some amount of cribbing in the third form  im sure val never would broke out gillian  and her aunt answered  so was i but  oh  my dear do hush pleaded adeline  you must let yourself listen  gillian gave a desperate twist but let her aunt smooth her hand  all the classalmostseem to have done it in some telegraphic way hard to understand proceeded aunt jane  there must have been some stupidity on the part of the classmistress miss mellon or it could not have gone on but there has of late been a strong suspicion of cribbing in caesar in valettas class  they had got rather behindhand and have been working up somewhat too hard and fast to get through the portion for examination  some of them translated too wellused terms for the idioms that were neither literal nor could have been forged by their small brains so there was an examination and georgie purvis was detected reading off from the marks on the margin of her notebook  but what has that to do with val  georgie being had up to miss leverett made the sort of confession that implicates everybody  then why believe her muttered gillian  but her aunt went on  she said that four or five of them did it from the notes that valetta merrifield brought to school  never interjected gillian  she said continued miss mohun it was first that they saw her helping maura white and they thought that was not fair and insisted on her doing the same for them  it cant be true  oh dont believe it cried the sister  i grieve to remind you that i showed you in the drawer in the diningroom chiffonier a translation of that very book of caesar that your mother and i made years ago when she was crazy upon vercingetorix  but was that reason enough for laying it upon poor val  she owned it  there was a silence and then gillian said  she must have been frightened and not known what she was saying  she was frightened but she was very straightforward and told without any shuffling  she saw the old copybooks when i was showing you those other remnants of our old times and one day it seems she was in a great puzzle over her lessons and could get no help or advice because none of us had come in  i suppose you were with lilian and she thought she might just look at the passage  she found maura in the same difficulty and helped her and then georgie purvis and nelly black found them out and threatened to tell unless she showed them her notes but the copying whole phrases was only done quite of late in the general overhurry  she must have been bullied into it cried gillian  i shall go and see about her  aunt ada made a gesture as of deprecation but aunt jane let her go without remonstrance merely saying as the door closed  poor child  esprit de famille  will it not be very bad for valetta to be petted and pitied  i dont know  at any rate we cannot separate them at night so it is only beginning it a little sooner and whatever i say only exasperates gillian the more  poor little val she had not a formed character enough to be turned loose into a high school without mysie to keep her in order  or gillian  i am not so sure of gillian  theres something amiss though i cant make out whether it is merely that i rub her down the wrong way  i wonder whether this holiday time will do us good or harm at any rate i know how lily felt about dolores  it must have been that classmistresss fault  to a great degree but miss leverett has just discovered that her cleverness does not compensate for a general lack of sense and discipline  poor little valperhaps it is her turningpoint  gillian rushing up in a boiling state of indignation against everybody felt the family shame most acutely of all and though as a merrifield she defended her sister below stairs on the other hand she was much more personally shocked and angered at the disgrace than were her aunts and far less willing to perceive any excuse for the culprit  there was certainly no petting or pitying in her tone as she stood over the little iron bed where the victim was hiding her head on her pillow  oh valetta how could you do such a thing  the merrifields have never been so disgraced before  oh dont gill  aunt jane and miss leverett werenot so angry when i saidi was sorry  but what will papa and mamma say  must theymust they hear  you would not think of deceiving them i hope  not deceiving only not telling  that comes to much the same  you cant say anything gill for you are always down at kals office and nobody knows  this gave gillian a great shock but she rallied and said with dignity do you think i do not write to mamma everything i do  it sufficed for the immediate purpose of annihilating valetta who had just been begging off from letting mamma hear of her proceedings but it left gillian very uneasy as to how much the child might know or tell and this made her proceed less violently and more persuasively whatever i do i write to mamma and besides it is different with a little thing like you and your school work  come tell me how you got into this scrape  oh gill it was so hard  all about those tiresome gauls and there were bits when the nominative case would go and hide itself and those nasty tenses one doesnt know how to look out and i knew i was making nonsense and you were out of the way and there was nobody to help and i knew mammas own book was therethe very part too because aunt jane had shown it to us so i did not think there was any harm in letting her help me out of the muddle  ah that was the beginning  if you had been in i would not have done it  you know aunt jane said there was no harm in giving a clue and this was mamma  but that was not all  well then there was maura first as much puzzled and her brother is so busy he hasnt as much time for her as he used to have and it does signify to her for perhaps if she does not pass mr white may not let her go on at the high school and that would be too dreadful for you know you said i was to do all i could for maura  so i marked down things for her and she copied them off and then georgie and nelly found it out and oh they were dreadful  i never knew it was wrong till they went at me  and they were horrid to maura and said she was a greek and i a maltese and so we were both false and cheaty and sly and they should tell miss leverett unless i would help them  oh  valetta why didnt you tell me  i never get to speak to you said val  i did think i would that first time and ask you what to do but then you came in late and when i began something you said you had your greek to do and told me to hold my tongue  i am very sorry said gillian feeling convicted of having neglected her little sister in the stress of her own work and of the preparation for that of her pupil who was treading on her heels but indeed val if you had told me it was important i should have listened  ah i but when one is halffrightened and you are always in a hurry sighed the child  and indeed i did do my best over my own work before ever i looked only those two are so lazy and stupid they would have ever so much more help than maura or i ever wanted and at last i was so worried and hurried with my french and all the rest that i did scramble a whole lot down and that was the way it was found out  and i am glad now it is over whatever happens  yes that is right said gillian and i am glad you told no stories but i wonder emma norton did not see what was going on  oh she is frightfully busy about her own  and kitty varley  kitty is only going up for french and german  miss leverett is so angry  what do you think she will do to me gill  expel me  i dont knowi cant guess  i dont know high school ways  it would be so dreadful for papa and mamma and the boys to know sobbed valetta  and mysie oh if mysie was but here  mysie would have been a better sister to her said gillians conscience and her voice said you would never have done it if mysie had been here  and mysie would be nice said the poor child who longed after her companion sister as much for comfort as for conscience  is aunt jane very very angry she went on do you think i shall be punished  i cant tell  if it were i i should think you were punished enough by having disgraced the name of merrifield by such a dishonourable action  ii didnt know it was dishonourable  well said gillian perhaps a little tired of the scene or mayhap dreading another push into her own quarters i have been saying what i could for you and i should think they would feel that no one but our father and mother had a real right to punish you but i cant tell what the school may do  now hush it is of no use to talk any more  goodnight i hope i shall find you asleep when i come to bed  valetta would have detained her but off she went with a consciousness that she had been poor comfort to her little sister and had not helped her to the right kind of repentance  but then that highest groundthe strict rule of perfect conscientious uprightnesswas just what she shrank from bringing home to herself in spite of those privileges of seniority by which she had impressed poor valetta  the worst thing further that was said that night when she had reported as much of valettas confidence as she thought might soften displeasure was aunt adas observation maura  thats the white child is it not  no doubt it was the greek blood  the english girls were much worse hastily said gillian with a flush of alarm as she thought of her own friends being suspected  yes but it began with the little greek said aunt ada  what a pity for she is such an engaging child  i would take the child away from the high school except that it would have the appearance of her being dismissed  we must consider of that said aunt jane  there will hardly be time to hear from lilias before the next term begins  indeed it will not be so very long to wait before the happy return i hope  only two months said gillian but it would be happier but for this  no said aunt jane  if we made poor little val write her confession and i do the same for not having looked after her better it will be off our minds and need not cloud the meeting  the disgrace sighed gillian the public disgrace  my dear i dont want to make you think lightly of such a thing it was very wrong in a child brought up as you have all been with a sense of honour and uprightness but where there has been no such training the attempt to copy is common enough for it is not to be looked on as an extraordinary and indelible disgrace  do you remember primrose saying she had broken mammas heart when she had knocked down a china vase  you need not be in that state of mind over what was a childish fault made worse by those bullying girls it is of no use to exaggerate  the sin is the thingnot the outward shame  and valetta told at once when asked added aunt ada  that makes a great difference  in fact she was relieved to have it out said miss mohun  it is not at all as if she were in the habit of doing things underhand  everything struck on gillian like a covert reproach  it was pain and shame to her that a merrifield should have lowered herself to the common herd so as to need these excuses of her aunts and then in the midst of that indignation came that throb of selfconviction which she was always confuting with the recollection of her letter to her mother  she was glad to bid goodnight and rest her head  the aunts ended by agreeing that it was needful to withdraw valetta from the competition  it would seem like punishment to her but it would remove her from the strain that certainly was not good for her indeed they had serious thoughts of taking her from the school altogether but the holidays would not long be ended before her parents return  i am sorry we ever let her try for the prize said ada  yes said aunt jane i suppose it was weakness but having opposed the acceptance of the system of prizes by competition at first i thought it would look sullen if i refused to let valetta try stimulus is all very well but competition leads to emulation wrath strife and a good deal besides  valetta wished it too and she knew so much latin to begin with that i thought she would easily get it and certainly she ought not to get into difficulties  after the silken rein and easy amble of silverfold the spur and the race have come severely  it is i suppose the same with gillian though there it is not competition  do you expect her to succeed  no  she has plenty of intelligence and a certain sort of diligence but does not work to a point  she wants a real hand over her  she will fail and it will be very good for her  i should say the work was overmuch for her and had led her to neglect valetta  work becomes overmuch when people dont know how to set about it and resent being told no not in words but by looks and shoulders besides i am not sure that it is her proper work that oppresses her i think she has some other undertaking in hand probably for christmas or for her mothers return but as secrecy is the very soul of such things i shut my eyes  somehow jane i think you have become so much afraid of giving way to curiosity that you sometimes shut your eyes rather too much  well perhaps in ones old age one suffers from the reaction of ones bad qualities  i will think about it ada  i certainly never before realised how very different school supervision of young folks is from looking after them all round  moreover gillian has been much more attentive to poor lily giles of late in spite of her avocations  valetta was not at first heartbroken on hearing that she was not to go in for the language examination  it was such a relief from the oppression of the task and she had so long given up hopes of having the prize to show to her mother that she was scarcely grieved though aunt jane was very grave while walking down to school with her in the morning to see miss leverett and explain the withdrawal  that lady came to her private room as soon as she had opened the school  from one point of view she said she agreed with miss mohun that it would be better that her niece should not go up for the examination  but she said it may be considered as a stigma upon her since none of the others are to give up  indeed  i had almost thought it a matter of course  on the contrary two of the mothers seem to think nothing at all of the matter  mrs black  the surveyors wife isnt she  yes she writes a note saying that all children copy if they can and she wonders that i should be so severe upon such a frequent occurrence which reflects more discredit on the governesses than the scholars  polite that  and mrs purvis  at least she is a lady  she is more polite but evidently has no desire to be troubled  she hopes that if her daughter has committed a breach of school discipline i will act as i think best  no feeling of the real evil in either  how about maura white  that is very different  it is her sister who writes and so nicely that i must show it to you   my dear madami am exceedingly grieved that maura should have acted in a dishonourable manner though she was not fully aware how wrongly she was behaving  we have been talking to her and we think she is so truly sorry as not to be likely to fall into the same temptation again  as far as we can make out she has generally taken pains with her tasks and only obtained assistance in unusually difficult passages so that we think that she is really not illprepared  if it is thought right that all the pupils concerned should abstain from the competition we would of course readily acquiesce in the justice of the sentence but to miss it this year might make so serious a difference to her prospects that i hope it will not be thought a necessary act of discipline though we know that we have no right to plead for any exemption for her  with many thanks for the consideration you have shown for her i remain faithfully yours                                                      k white   a very different tone indeed and it quite agrees with valettas account said miss mohun  yes the other two girls were by far the most guilty  and morally perhaps maura the least but i retain my view that irrespective of the others valettas parents had rather she missed this examination considering all things  valetta came home much more grieved when she had found she was the only one left out and declared it was unjust  no said gillian for you began it all  none of the others would have got into the scrape but for you  it was all your fault for not minding me  as if i made you do sly things  you made me  you were so cross if i only asked a question and val prepared to cry  i thought people had to do their own work and not other folks dont be so foolish  oh dear oh dear how unkind you are  i wishi wish mysie was here every one is grown cross  oh if mamma would but come home  now val dont be such a baby  stop that  and valetta went into one of her old agonies of crying and sobbing which brought aunt jane in to see what was the matter  she instantly stopped the scolding with which gillian was trying to check the outburst and which only added to its violence  it is the only thing to stop those fits said gillian  she can if she will  it is all temper  leave her to me commanded aunt jane  go  gillian went away muttering that it was not the way mamma or nurse halfpenny treated val and quite amazed that aunt jane of all people should have the naughty child on her lap and in her arms soothing her tenderly  the cries died away and the long heaving sobs began to subside and at last a broken voice said on aunt janes shoulder itsa little bitlike mamma  for aunt janes voice had a ring in it like mammas and this little bit of tenderness was inexpressibly comforting  my poor dear child she said mamma will soon come home and then you will be all right  i shouldnt have done it if mamma had been there  no and now you are sorry  will mamma be very angry  she will be grieved that you could not hold out when you were tempted but i am sure she will forgive you if you write it all to her  and val you know you can have gods forgiveness at once if you tell him  yes said valetta gravely then i did not before because i thought every one made so much of it and were so cross  and georgie and nellie dont care at all  nor maura  oh maura does because of kalliope  how do you mean  valetta sat up on her aunts lap and told  maura told me  she said kally and alec both were at her but her mamma was vexed with them and said she would not have her scolded at home as well as at school about nothing and she told theodore to go and buy her a tart to make up to her but theodore wouldnt for he said he was ashamed of her  so she sent the maid  but when maura had gone to bed and to sleep she woke up and there was kally crying over her prayers and whispering half aloud is she going too  my poor child  oh save her  give her the spirit of truth  poor kalliope  she is a good sister  yes maura says kally is awfully afraid of their telling stories because of richardthe eldest you know  he does it dreadfully i remember nurse used to tell us not to fib like dick white  maura said he used to tell his father stories about being late and getting money and their mother never let him be punished  he was her pet and maura remembers being carried in to see poor captain white just before he died when she was getting better but could not stand and he said truth before all children  be true to god and man captain white did care so much but mrs white doesnt  isnt that very odd for she isnt a roman catholic ended valetta obviously believing that falsehood was inherent in romanists and pouring out all this as soon as her tears were assuaged as if having heard it she must tell  mrs white is half a greek you know said aunt jane and the greeks are said not to think enough about truth  epaminondas did said valetta who had picked up a good deal from the home atmosphere but ulysses didnt  no and the greeks have been enslaved and oppressed for a great many years and that is apt to make people get cowardly and false  but that is not our concern val and i think with such a recollection of her good father and such a sister to help her maura will not fall into the fault again  and my dear i quite see that neither you nor she entirely realised that what you did was deception though you never spoke a word of untruth  no we did not said valetta  and so my dear child i do forgive you quite and entirely as we used to say though i have settled with miss leverett that you had better not go up for the examination since you cannot be properly up to it  and you must write the whole history to your mother  yes i know it will be very sad work but it will be much better to have it out and done with instead of having it on your mind when she comes home  shall you tell her  yes certainly said the aunt well knowing that this would clench the matter  but i shall tell her how sorry you are and that i really think you did not quite understand what you were about at first  and i shall write to miss white and try to comfort her about her sister  you wont say i told  oh no but i shall have quite reason enough for writing in telling her that i am sorry my little niece led her sister into crooked paths  gillian knew that this letter was written and sent and it did not make her more eager for a meeting with kalliope  so that she was not sorry that the weather was a valid hindrance though a few weeks ago she would have disregarded such considerations  besides there was her own examination which for two days was like a fever and kept her at her little table thinking of nothing but those questions and dreaming and waking over them at night  it was over and she was counselled on all sides to think no more about it till she should hear of success or failure  but this was easier said than done and she was left in her tired state with a general sense of being on a wrong tack and of going on amiss whether due to her aunts want of assimilation to herself or to her mothers absence she did not know and with the further sense that she had not been the motherly sister she had figured to herself but that both the children should show a greater trust and reliance on aunt jane than on herself grieved her not exactly with jealousy but with sense of failure and dissatisfaction with herself  she had a universal distaste to her surroundings and something very like dread of the whites and she rejoiced in the prospect of quitting rockstone for the present  she felt bound to run down to the office to wish kalliope goodbye there she found an accumulation of exercises and translations waiting for her  oh what a quantity  it shows how long it is since i have been here  and indeed began kalliope since your aunt has been so very kind about poor little maura  oh please dont talk to me  theres such a lot to do and i have no time  wait till i have done  and she nervously began reading out the greek exercise so as effectually to stop kalliopes mouth  moreover either her own uneasy mind or the difficulty of the greek brought her into a dilemma  she saw that alexiss phrase was wrong but she did not clearly perceive what the sentence ought to be and she perplexed herself over it till he came in whether to her satisfaction or not she could not have told for she had not wanted to see him on the one hand though on the other it silenced kalliope  she tried to clear her perceptions by explanations to him but he did not seem to give his mind to the grammar half as much as to the cessation of the lessons and her absence  you must do the best you can she said and i shall find you gone quite beyond me  i shall never do that miss merrifield  nonsense she said laughing uncomfortably a pretty clergyman you would be if you could not pass a girl  there goodbye  make a list of your puzzles and i will do my best with them when i come back  thank you and he wrung her hand with an earnestness that gave her a sense of uneasiness     chapter xi  lady merrifields christmas letterbag                             primrose  my dear mammai wish you a merry christmas

real row in the street last night just outside  we are to go down a mine some day when cousin david has time  i mean to be a great jeologist and get lots of specimens and please bring me home all the minerals in ceylon harry gave me a hammeri am your affectionate son                                                 fergus merrifield                            valetta  my dearest mammai hope you

will sing carols  macrae brought some for us the day before yesterday and a famous lot of holly and ivy and mistletoe and flowers and three turkeys and some hams and pheasants and partridges  aunt jane sent the biggest turkey and ham in a basket covered up with holly to mrs white and another to mrs hablot and they are doing the church with the holly and ivy we are to eat the other the day after tomorrow and mr grant and miss burne who teaches the youngest form are coming  it was only cold beef today to let mrs mount go to church but we had mince pies and i am going to kittys christmas party tomorrow and we shall danceso aunt ada has given me a new white frock and a lovely roman sash of her own  poor old mrs vincent is dead and ferguss great black rabbit and poor little mary brown with dipblot  i cant spell it and nobody is here to tell me how but the thing in peoples throats and poor anne has got it and dr ellis says it was a mercy we were all away from home for we should have had it too and that would have been ever so much worse than the whoopingcough  i have lots of cards but my presents are waiting for my birthday when maura is to come to tea  it is much nicer than i thought the holidays would be  maura white has got the prize for french and latin  it is a lovely shakespeare  i wish i had been good for i think i should have got it  only she does want more help than i do so perhaps it is lucky i did not  no i dont mean lucky either your affectionate little daughter                   val                            wilfred  dear motherfergus is such a little ape that he will send you that disgusting coal mine on his card as if you would care for it  i know you will like mine much betterthat old buffer skating into a hole in the ice  i dont mind being here for though harry and davy get up frightfully early to go to church they dont want us down till they come back and we can have fun all day except when harry screws me down to my holiday task which is a disgusting one about the wars of the roses  harry does look so rum now that he is got up for a parson that we did not know him when he met us at the station there was an awful row outside here last night between two sets of waits  david went out and parted them and i thought he would have got a black eye  all the choir had supper here for there was a service in the middle of the night but they did not want us at it and on tuesday we are to have a christmas ship and a magiclantern and rollo and mr bowater are coming to helphe is the clergyman at the next placeand no end of fun and the biggest dog you ever saw fergus has got one of his crazes worse than ever about old stones and is always in the coal hole poking after ferns and things wishing you a merry christmasyour affectionate son                                              wilfred merrifield                            mysie                                         rotherwood christmas day  my own dearest mammaa very happy christmas to you and papa and claude and my sisters and here are the cards which miss elbury helped me about so kindly that i think they are better than usual i mean that she advised me for no one touched them but myself  you will like your text i hope i chose it because it is so nice to think we are all one though we are in so many different places  i did one with the same for poor dolores in new zealand  uncle william was here yesterday and he said dear little primrose is almost quite well  fly is much better today her eyes look quite bright and she is to sit up a little while in the afternoon but i may not talk to her for fear of making her cough but she slept all night without one whoop and will soon be well now  cousin rotherwood was so glad that he was quite funny this morning and he gave me the loveliest writingcase you ever saw with a good lock and gold key and gold tops to everything and my three ms engraved on them all  i have so many presents and cards that i will write out a list when i have finished my letter  i shall have plenty of time for everybody is gone to church except cousin florence who went early  i am to dine at the late dinner which will be early because of the church singers and cousin rotherwood says he and i will do snapdragon if i will promise not to whoop  430i had to stop again because of the doctor  he says he does not want to have any more to do with me and that i may go out the first fine day and that fly is much better  and only think  he says rockquay is the very place for fly and as soon as we are not catching we are all to go there  cousin rotherwood told me so for a great secret but he said i might tell you and that he would ask aunt alethea to let primrose come too  it does warm one up to think of it and it is much easier to feel thankful and glad about all the rest of the right sort of christmas happiness now i am so near having gill and val againyour very loving child                                                m m merrifield                            jasper                                               vale leston priory                                                 25th december dearest motherhere are my christmas wishes that we may all be right again at home this year and that you could see the brace of pheasants i killed  however gill and i are in uncommonly nice quarters  i shall let her tell the long story about who is who for there is such a swarm of cousins and uncles and aunts and when you think you have hold of the right one it turns out to be the other lot  there are three houses choke full of them and more floating about and all running in and out till it gets like the little pig that could not be counted it ran about so fast  they are all underwood or harewood more or less except the vanderkists who are all girls except a little fellow in knickerbockers  poor little chap his father was a great man on the turf and ruined him horse and foot before he was born and then died of d t and his mother is a great invalid and very badly off with no end of daughtersthe most stunning girls you ever sawreal beauties and no mistake especially emily who is great fun besides  she is to be helena when we act midsummer nights dream on twelfth night for all the natives and i am demetrius dirty cad that he is  she lives with the grinsteads and anna with the travis underwoods phylliss young mans bosses  if he makes as good a thing of it as they have done she will be no end of a swell  mr travis underwood has brought down his hunters and gives me a mount  claude would go stark staring mad to see his campeador  they are awfully musical here and are always at carols or something and thats the only thing against them  as to gill she is in clover in raptures with every one especially mrs grinstead and i think it is doing her goodyour affectionate son                                                      j r m                            gillian  dearest mammaall christmas love and a message to phyllis that i almost forgive her desertion for the sake of the set of connections she has brought us like the nearest and dearest relations or more but geraldinefor so she told me to call heris still the choicest of all  it is so pretty to see her husbandthe great sculptorwait on her as if she was a queen and he her knight  anna told me that he had been in love with her ever so long and she refused him once but after the eldest brother died and she was living at st wulstans he tried again and she could not hold out  i told you of her charming house so full of lovely things and about gerald all cleverness and spirit but too delicate for a public school  he is such a contrast to edward harewood a great sturdy redhaired fellow who is always about with jasper except when hejaps i meanis with emily vanderkist  she is the prettiest of the vanderkists  there are eight of them besides little sir adrian mary always stays to look after her mother who is in very bad health and has weak eyes  they call mary invaluable and so very good but she is like a homely little dutchwoman and nobody would think she was only twenty  sophy the next to her calls herself pupilteacher to mrs william harewood and together they manage the schoolroom for all the younger sisters the two little girls at the vicarage and wilmet the only girl here at the priory but of course no lessons are going on now only learning and rehearsing the parts and making the dresses painting the scenes and learning songs  they all do care so much about music here that i find i really know hardly anything about it and jasper says it is their only failing  they say mr lancelot underwood sings and plays better than any of them but he is at stoneborough  however he is coming over with all the mays for our play old dr may and all  i was very much surprised to find he was an organist and a bookseller but geraldine told me about it and how it was for the sake of the eldest brother my brother they all say and somehow it seems as if the house was still his though it is so many years since he died  and yet they are all such happy merry people  i wish i could let you know how delightful it all is  sometimes i feel as if i did not deserve to have such a pleasant time  i cant quite explain but to be with geraldine grinstead makes one feel ones self to be of a ruder more selfish mould and i know i have not been all i ought to be at rockstone but i dont mind telling you now you are so soon to be at home aunt jane seems to worry mei cant tell how exactlywhile there is something about geraldine that soothes and brightens and all the time makes one long to be better  i never heard such sermons as mr harewoods either it seems as if i had never listened before but these go right down into one  i cannot leave off thinking about the one last sunday about making manifest the counsels of all hearts  i see now that i was not as much justified in not consulting aunt jane about kalliope and alexis as i thought i was and that the concealment was wrong  it came over me before the beautiful early celebration this morning and i could not feel as if i ought to be there till i had made a resolution to tell her all about it though i should like it not to be till you are come home and can tell her that i am not really like dolores as she will be sure to think me for i really did it not out of silliness and opposition but because i knew how good they were and i did tell you  honestly perhaps there was some opposition in the spirit of it but i mean to make a fresh start when i come back and you will be near at hand then and that will help me  26ththe afternoon service of song began and i was called off  i never heard anything so lovely and we had a delightful evening  i cant tell you about it now for i am snatching a moment when i am not rehearsing as this must go today  dr and miss may and the lances as they call them are just come  the doctor is a beautiful old man  all the children were round him directly and he kissed me and said that he was proud to meet the daughter of such a distinguished man  this must goyour loving daughter       juliana merrifield                            harry                                           coalham christmas day it is nearly st stephens day for dear mother i have not had a minute before to send you or my father my christmas greeting  we have had most joyous services unusually well attended david tells me and that makes up for the demonstration we had outside the door last night  david is the right fellow for this place though we are disapproved of as south country folk  the boys are well and amused wilfred much more comfortable for being treated more as a man and fergus greatly come on and never any trouble being always deadset on some pursuit  it is geology or rather mineralogy at present and if he carries home all the stones he has accumulated in the back yard he will have a tolerable charge for extra luggage  david says there is the making of a great man in him i think it is of an uncle maurice  macrae writes to me in a state of despair about the drains at silverfold scarlet fever and diphtheria abound at the town so that he says you cannot come back there till something has been done and he wants me to come and look at them but i do not see how i can leave david at present as we are in the thick of classes for baptism and confirmation in lent and i suspect aunt jane knows more about the matter than i do  gillian and jasper seem to be in a state of great felicity at vale lestonand mysie getting better but poor little phyllis devereux has been seriously illyour affectionate son   h merrifield                    aunt jane and aunt adeline                                               1130 christmas eve my dearest lilythis will be a joint letter for ada will finish it tomorrow and i must make the most of my time while waiting for the waits to dwell on unsavoury business  macrae came over here with a convoy of all sorts of delicacies of the season for which thank you heartily in the name of whites hablots and others who partook thereof according no doubt to your kind intention  he was greatly perturbed poor man for your cook has been very ill with diphtheria and the scarlet fever is severe all round there have been some deaths and the gardeners child was in great danger  the doctor has analysed the water and finds it in a very bad state so that your absence this autumn is providential  if you are in haste telegraph to me and i will meet your landlord there and the sanitary inspector and see what can be done without waiting for jasper at any rate you cannot go back there at once  shall i secure a furnished house for you here  the rotherwoods are coming to the hotel next door to us as soon as phyllis is fit to move and infection over  victoria will stay there with the children and he go back and forwards  if harry and phyllis may should come home i suppose their headquarters will be at stoneborough but still this would be the best place for a family gathering  moreover fergus gets on very nicely at mrs edgars and it would be a pity to disturb him  on the other hand i am not sure of the influences of the place upon the  christmas day 3 pmthere came the waits i suppose and jane had to stop and leave me to take up the thread  poor dear jenny the festival days are no days of rest to her but i am not sure that she would enjoy repose or that it would not be the worse possible penance to her  she is gone down now to the workhouse with valetta to take cards and tea and tobacco to the old people not sending them because she says a few personal wishes and the sight of a bright child will be worth something to the old bodies  then comes tea for the choirboys before evensong and carols and after that my turn may come for what remains of the evening  i must say the church is lovely thanks to your arums and camellias which macrae brought us just in time  it is very unfortunate that silverfold should be in such a state but delightful for us if it sends you here and this brings me to jennys broken thread which i must spin on though i tell her to take warning by you when you so repented having brought maurice home by premature wails about dolores  perhaps impatience is a danger to all of us and i believe there is such a thing as over candour  what jane was going to say was that she did not think the place had been good for either of the girls but all that would be obviated by your presence  if poor miss vincent joins you now that she is free you would have your own schoolroom again and the locality would not make much difference  indeed if the rotherwood party come by the end of the holidays i have very little doubt that victoria will allow valetta to join phyllis and mysie in the schoolroom and that would prevent any talk about her removal from the high school  the poor little thing has behaved as well as possible ever since and is an excellent companion jane is sure that it has been a lesson that will last her for life and i am convinced that she was under an influence that you can put an end toi mean that white family  jane thinks well of the eldest daughter in spite of her fringe and of her refusal to enter the gfs but i have good reason for knowing that she holds assignations in mr whites garden on sunday afternoons with young stebbing whose mother knows her to be a most artful and dangerous girl though she is so clever at the mosaic work that there is no getting her discharged  mrs stebbing called to warn us against her and as i was the only person at home told me how she had learnt from mr whites housekeeper that this girl comes every sunday alone to walk in the gardensshe was sure it must be to meet somebody and they are quite accessible to an active young man on the side towards the sea  he is going in a few days to join the other partner at the italian quarries greatly in order that the connection may be broken off  it is very odd that jane generally so acute should be so blind here  all she said was thats just the time gillian is so bent on mooning in the garden  it is a mere absurdity gillian always goes to the childrens service and besides she was absent last sunday when miss white was certainly there  but gillian lends the girl books and altogether patronises her in a manner which is somewhat perplexing to us though as it cannot last long jane thinks it better not to interfere before your return to judge for yourself  these young people are members of the kennel church congregation and i had an opportunity of talking to mr flight about them  he says he had a high opinion of the brother and hoped to help him to some higher education with a view perhaps to holy orders but that it was so clearly the youths duty to support his mother and it was so impossible for her to get on without his earnings that he mr flight i mean had decided to let him alone that his stability might be proved or till some opening offered and of late there had been reason for disappointment tokens of being unsettled and reports of meetings with some young woman at his sisters office  it is always the way when one tries to be interested in those halfandhalf peoplethe essential vulgarity is sure to break out generally in the spirit of flirtation conducted in an underhand manner  and oh that mother  i write all this because you had better be aware of the state of things before your return  i am afraid however that between us we have not written you a very cheering christmas letter  there is a great question about a supply of water to the town  much excitement is caused by the expectation of rotherwoods visit and it is even said that he is to be met here by the great white himself whom i have always regarded as a sort of mythical personage not to say a harpy always snatching away every promising family of janes to the italian quarries  you will have parted with the dear girls by this time and be feeling very sad and solitary but it is altogether a good connection and a great advantage  i have just addressed to gillian at vale leston a coroneted envelope which must be an invitation from lady liddesdale  i am very glad of it  nothing is so likely as such society to raise her above the tone of these whitesyour loving                                                 a m   1030 pmthese whites  really i dont think it as bad as ada supposes so dont be uneasy though it is a pity she has told you so much of the gossip respecting them  i do not believe any harm of that girl kalliope she has such an honest modest pair of eyes  i dare say she is persecuted by that young stebbing for she is very handsome and he is an odious puppy  but as to her assignations in the garden if they are with any one it is with gillian and i see no harm in them except that we might have been toldonly that would have robbed the entire story of its flavour i suppose  besides i greatly disbelieve the entire story so dont be worried about it thereas if we had not been doing our best to worry you  but come home dearest old lily  gather your chicks under your wing and when you cluck them together again all will be well  i dont think you will find valetta disimproved by her crisis  it is curious to hear how she and gillian both declare that mysie would have prevented it as if naughtiness or deceit shrank from that childs very face  it has been a very happy successful christmas day full of rejoicing  may you be feeling the same that joy has made us one in many a time of separationyour faithful old brownie                                                        j mohun                            gillian again                                           rowthorpe 20th january  dearest mammathis is a sunday letter  i am writing it in a beautiful place more like a drawingroom than a bedroom and it is all very grand such long galleries such quantities of servants so many people staying in the house that i should feel quite lost but for geraldine  we came so late last night that there was only just time to dress for dinner at eight oclock  i never dined with so many people before and they are all staying in the house  i have not learnt half of them yet though lady liddesdale who is a nice merry old lady with gray hair called her eldest granddaughter kitty somerville and told her to take care of me and tell me who they all were  one of them is that lord ormersfield whom mysie ran against at rotherwood and do you know i very nearly did the same for there is early celebration at the little church just across the garden  kitty talked of calling for me but i did not make sure because i heard some one say she was not to go if she had a cold and when i heard the bell i grew anxious and started off and i lost my way and thought i should never get to the stairs but just as i was turning back out came lord and lady ormersfield  he looks quite young though he is rather lamei shall like all lame people for the sake of geraldineand lady ormersfield has such a motherly face  he laughed and said i was not the first person who had lost my way in the labyrinths of passages so i went on with them and after all kitty was hunting for me  i sat next him at breakfast and do you know he asked me whether i was the sister of a little downright damsel he met at rotherwood two years ago and said he had used her truthfulness about the umbrella for a favourite example to his small youngest  when i hear of truthfulness i feel a sort of shock oh if you knew i am ready to say and i grow quite hot  that is what i am really writing about today  i never had time after that christmas day at vale leston to do more than keep you up to all the doings but i did think and there were mr harewoods sermons which had a real sting in them and a great sweetness besides  i have tried to set some down for you and that is one reason i did not say more  but today after luncheon it is very quiet for kitty and constance are gone to their sunday classes and the gentlemen and boys are out walking except lord somerville who has a mens class of his own and all the old ladies are either in their rooms or talking in pairs  so i can tell you that i see now that i did not go on in a right spirit with aunt jane and that i did poor val harm by my example and went very near deception for i did not choose to believe that when you said if aunt j approves you meant about alexis whites lessons so i never told her or kalliope and i perceive now that it was not right towards either for kally was very unhappy about her not knowing  i am very sorry i see that i was wrong all round and that i should have understood it before if i had examined myself in the way mr harewood dwelt upon in his last sunday in advent sermon and never gone on in such a way  i am not going to wait for you now but shall confess it all to aunt jane as soon as i go home and try to take it as my punishment if she asks a terrible number of questions  perhaps i shall write it but it would take such a quantity of explanation and i dont want aunt ada to open the letter as she does any that come while aunt jane is out  please kiss my words and forgive me as you read this dear mamma i never guessed i was going to be so like dolores  kitty has come to my door to ask if i should like to come and read something nice and sundayish with them in her grandmammas dressing roomso no more from your loving                gill     chapter xii  transformation    well now for the second stage of our guardianship said aunt ada as the two sisters sat over the fire after valetta had gone to bed fergus comes back tomorrow and gillianwhen  she does not seem quite certain for there is to be a day or two at brompton with this delightful geraldine so that she may see her grandmotheralso mr clement underwoods church and the merchant of venicean odd mixture of ecclesiastics and dissipations  i wonder whether she will be set up by it  so do i  they are all remarkably good people but then good people do sometimes spoil the most of all for they are too unselfish to snub  and on the other hand seeing the world sometimes has the wholesome effect of making one feel small  my dear jenny  oh i did not mean you who are never easily effaced but i was thinking of youthful bumptiousness fostered by country life and elder sistership  certainly though valetta is really much improved gillian has not been as pleasant as i expected especially during the latter part of the time  query was it her fault or mine or the worry of the examination or all three  perhaps you did superintend a little too much at first  more than modern independence was prepared for though i should not have expected recalcitration in a young lily but i think there was more ruffling of temper and more reserve than i can quite understand  it has not been a success  as dear old lily would have said my dream has vanished of a friend in the younger generation and now it remains to do the best i can for her in the few weeks that are left before we have her dear mother again  at any rate you have no cause to be troubled about the other two valetta is really the better for her experience and you have always got on well with the boy  fergus was the first of the travellers to appear at rockstone  miss mohun who went to meet him at the station beheld a small figure lustily pulling at a great canvas bag which came bumping down the step assisted by a shove from the other passengers and threatening for a moment to drag him down between platform and carriages  fergus fergus what have you got there  give it to me  how heavy  its a few of my mineralogical specimens replied fergus  harry wouldnt let me put any more into my portmanteaubut the peacock and the dendrum are there  already without special regard to peacock or dendrum whatever that article might be miss mohun was claiming the little old military portmanteau with a great m and 110th painted on it that held ferguss garments  he would scarcely endure to deposit the precious bag in the omnibus and as he walked home his talk was all of tertiary formations and coal measures and limestones as he extracted a hammer from his pocket and looked perilously disposed to use it on the vein of crystals in a great pink stone in a garden wall  his aunt was obliged to begin by insisting that the walls should be safe from geological investigations  but it is such waste aunt jane  only think of building up such beautiful specimens in a stupid old wall  aunt jane did not debate the question of waste but assured him that equally precious specimens could be honestly come by while she felt renewed amusement and pleasure at anything so like the brother maurice of thirty odd years ago being beside her  it made her endure the contents of the bag being turned out like a miniature rockery for her inspection on the floor of the glazed verandah outside the drawingroom and also try to pacify mrs mounts indignation at finding the more valuable specimens or as she called them nasty stones and bits of dirty coal within his socks  much more information as to mines coal or copper was to be gained from him than as to cousin david or harry or jasper who had spent the last ten days of his holidays at coalham which had procured for fergus the felicity of a second underground expedition  it was left to his maturer judgment and the next move to decide how many of his specimens were absolutely worthless it was only stipulated that he and valetta should carry them all and sundry up to the lumberroom and there arrange them as he choseaunt jane routing out for him a very dull little manual of mineralogy and likewise a book of maria hacks long since out of print but wherein harry beaufoy is instructed in the chief outlines of geology in a manner only perhaps inferior to that of madame how and lady why which she reserved for a birthday present  meantime rockstone and its quarries were almost as excellent a field of research as the mines of coalham and in a different line  how much nicer it is to be a boy than a girl sighed valetta as she beheld her junior marching off with all the dignity of hammer and knapsack to look up alexis white and obtain access to the heaps of rubbish which in his eyes held as infinite possibilities as the diamond fields of kimberley  and alexis was only delighted to bestow on him any space of daylight when both were free from school or from work and kept a lookout for the treasures he desired  of course out of gratitude to his parentsor was it out of gratitude to his sister  perhaps fergus could have told if he had paid the slightest attention to such a trifle how anxiously alexis inquired when miss gillian was expected to return  moreover he might have told that his other model stebbing pronounced old dick white a beast and a screw with whom his brother frank was not going to stop  gillian came back a fortnight later having been kept at rowthorpe together with mrs grinstead for a family festival over the double marriage in ceylon after which she spent a few days in london so as to see her grandmother mrs merrifield who was too infirm for an actual visit to be welcome since her attendant grandchild bessie merrifield was so entirely occupied with her as to have no time to bestow upon a guest of more than an hour or two  gillian was met at the station by her aunt and when all her belongings had been duly extracted proving a good deal larger in bulk than when she had left rockstone and both were seated in the fly to drive home through a dismal february filldyke day the first words that were spoken were  aunt jane i ought to tell you something  hastily revolving conjectures as to the subject of the coming confession miss mohun put herself at her nieces service  aunt jane i know i ought to have told you how much i was seeing of the whites last autumn  indeed i know you wished to do what you could for them  yes said gillian finding it easier than she expected  you know alexis wants very much to be prepared for holy orders and he could not get on by himself so i have been running down to kalliopes office after reading to lily giles to look over his greek exercises  meeting him  only sometimes  but kally did not like it  she said you ought to know and that was the reason she would not come into the gfs  she is so good and honourable aunt jane  i am sure she is a very excellent girl said aunt jane warmly but certainly it would have been better to have these lessons in our house  does your mother know  yes said gillian i wrote to her all i was doing and how i have been talking to kally on sunday afternoons through the rails of mr whites garden  i thought she could telegraph if she did not approve but she does not seem to have noticed it in my letters only saying something i could not make outabout if you approved  and is that the reason you have told me  partly but i got the letter before the holidays  i think it has worked itself up aunt jane into a sense that it was not the thing there was kally and there was poor valettas mess and her justifying herself by saying i did more for the whites than you knew and altogether i grew sorry i had begun it for i was sure it was not acting honestly towards you aunt jane and i hope you will forgive me  miss mohun put her arm round the girl and kissed her heartily  my dear gill i am glad you have told me  i dare say i seemed to worry you and that you felt as if you were watched i will do my very best to help you if you have got into a scrape  i only want to ask you not to do anything more till i can see kally and settle with her the most suitable way of helping the youth  but do you think there is a scrape aunt  i never thought of that if you forgave me  my dear i see you did not and that you told me because you are my lilys daughter and have her honest heart  i do not know that there is anything amiss but i am afraid young ladies cant dowell impulsive things without a few vexations in consequence  dont be so dismayed i dont know of anything and i cannot tell you how glad i am of your having spoken out in this way  i feel as if a load were off my back said gillian  and a bar between her and her aunt seemed to have vanished as they drove up the now familiar slope and under the leafless copper beeches  blood is thinker than water and what five months ago had seemed to be exile had become the first step towards home if not home itself for now like valetta she welcomed the sound of her mothers voice in her aunts  and there were valetta and fergus rushing out almost under the wheels to fly at her and aunt adas soft embraces in the hall  the first voice that came out of the melee was valettas  gill is grown quite a lady  how much improved exclaimed aunt ada  the bachfisch has swum into the river was aunt janes comment  shell never be good for anything jollyno scrambling grumbled fergus  now fergus didnt kitty somerville and i scramble when we found the gate locked and thought we saw the spiteful stag and that he was going to run at us  im afraid that was rather on compulsion gill  it wasnt the spiteful stag after all but we had such a long way to come home and got over the park wall at last by the help of the limb of a tree  we had been taking a bit of weddingcake to frank somervilles old nurse and kitty told her i was her maiden aunt and we had such funher uncles wifes sister you know  we sent a great piece of our weddingcake to the whites put in valetta  fergus and i took it on saturday afternoon but nobody was at home but mrs white and she is fatter than ever  i say gill which is the best formation vale leston or rowthorpe  oh nobody is equal to geraldine but kitty is a dear thing  i didnt mean that stuff but which had the best strata and specimens   geological he meansnot of society interposed aunt jane  oh yes  harry said he had gone geology mad and i really did get you a bit of something at vale leston fergus that mr harewood said was worth having  was it an encrinite  i know it was a stonelily  an encrinite  oh scrumptious  then ensued such an unpacking as only falls to the lot of homecomers from london within the later precincts of christmas gifts of marvellous contrivance and novelty as well as cheapness for all and sundry those reserved for others almost as charming to the beholders as those which fell to their own lot  the box divided into compartments transported fergus as much as the encrinite valetta had a photographbook and more diffidently gillian presented aunt ada with a graceful little statuette in parian and aunt jane with the last novelty in baskets  there were appropriate keepsakes for the maids and likewise for kalliope and maura  aunt jane was glad to see that discretion had prevailed so as to confine these gifts to the female part of the white family  there were other precious articles in reserve for the absent and the display of gillians own garments was not without interest as she had been to her first ball under the chaperonage of lady somerville and mrs grinstead had made her white tarletan available by painting it and its ribbons with exquisite blue nemophilas too lovely for anything so fleeting  mrs grinstead and her maid had taken charge of the damsels toilette at rowthorpe had perhaps touched up her dresses and had certainly taught her how to put them on and how to manage her hair so that though it had not broken out into fringes or tousles as if it were desirable to imitate savages with foreheads marvellous low the effect was greatly improved  the young brownskinned darkeyed face and rather tall figure were the same even the clothes the very same chosen under her aunt adas superintendence but there was an indescribable change not so much that of fashion as of distinction and something of the same inward growth might be gathered from her conversation  all the evening there was a delightful outpouring  gillian had been extremely happy and considerably reconciled to her sisters marriages but she had been away from home and kin long enough to make her feel her nearness to her aunts and to appreciate the pleasure of describing her enjoyment without restraint and of being with those whose personal family interests were her own not only sympathetic like her dear geraldines  they were ready for any amount of description though on the whole miss mohun preferred to hear of the vale leston charities and church details and miss adeline of the rowthorpe grandees and gaieties after the children had supped full of the diversions of their own kind at both places and the deeply interesting political scraps and descriptions of great men had been given  it had been said aunt jane a bit of education  gillian had indeed spent her life with thoughtful cultivated and superior people but the circumstances of her family had confined her to a schoolroom sort of existence ever since she had reached appreciative years retarding though not perhaps injuring her development nor did rockquay society afford much that was elevating beyond the bureau de charite that beechcroft cottage had become  details were so much in hand that breadth of principle might be obscured  at vale leston however there was a strong ecclesiastical atmosphere but while practical parish detail was thoroughly kept up there was a wider outlook and constant conversation and discussion among superior men such as the harewood brothers lancelot underwood mr grinstead and dr may on the great principles and issues of church and state matters religion and morals together with matters of art music and literature opening new vistas to her and which she could afterwards go over with mrs grinstead and emily and anna vanderkist with enthusiasm and comprehension  it was something different from grumbling over the number of candles at st kenelms or the defective washing of the st andrews surplices  at rowthorpe she had seen and heard people with great historic names champions in the actual battle  there had been a constant coming and going of guests during her three weeks visit political meetings entertainments to high and low the opening of a public institute in the next town the exhibition of tableaux in which she had an important share parties in the evenings and her first ball  the length of her visit and her connection with the family had made her share the part of hostess with lady constance and lady katharine somerville and she had been closely associated with their intimates the daughters of these men of great names  of course there had been plenty of girlish chatter and merry trifling perhaps some sharp satirical criticism and the revelations she had heard had been a good deal of the domestic comedy of political and aristocratic life but throughout there had been a view of conscientious goodness for the young girls who gave a tone to the rest had been carefully brought up and were earnest and rightminded accepting representation gaiety and hospitality as part of the duty of their position often involving selfdenial though there was likewise plenty of enjoyment  such glimpses of life had taught gillian more than she yet realised as has been seen the atmosphere of vale leston had deepened her spiritual life and the sermons had touched her heart to the quick and caused selfexamination which had revealed to her the secret of her dissatisfaction with herself and her perception was the clearer through her intercourse on entirely equal terms with persons of a high tone of refinement  the immediate fret of sense of supervision and opposition being removed she had seen things more justly and a distaste had grown on her for stolen expeditions to the office and for the corrections of her pupils exercises  she recoiled from the idea that this was the consequence either of having swell friends or of getting out of her depth in her instructions but reluctance recurred while advance in knowledge of the world made her aware that alexis white after hours in his sisters office might justly be regarded by her mother and aunts as an undesirable scholar for her and that his sisters remonstrances ought not to have been scouted  she had done the thing in her simplicity but it was through her own wilful secretiveness that her ignorance had not been guarded  thus she had as a matter of truth conscience and repentance made the confession which had been so kindly received as to warm her heart with gratitude to her aunt and she awoke the next morning to feel freer happier and more at home than she had ever yet done at rockstone  when the morning letters were opened they contained the startling news that mysie might be expected that very evening with fly the governess and lady rotherwoodat least that was the order of precedence in which the party represented itself to the minds of the young merrifields  primrose had caught a fresh cold and her uncle and aunt would not part with her till her mothers return but the infection was over with the other two and sea air was recommended as soon as possible for lady phyllis so as the wing of the hotel which was almost a mansion in itself had been already engaged the journey was to be made at once and the arrival would take place in the afternoon  the tidings were most rapturously received valetta jumped on and off all the chairs in the room unchidden while fergus shouted hurrah for mysie and fly and gillians heart felt free to leap  this made it a very busy day since lady rotherwood had begged to have some commissions executed for her beforehand small in themselves but with a scrupulously thorough person occupying all the time left from other needful engagements so that there was no chance of the promised conversation with kalliope nor did gillian trouble herself much about it in her eagerness and hardly heard fergus announce that frank stebbing had come home and the old boss was coming bad luck to him  all the three young people were greatly disappointed that their aunts would not consent to their being on the platform nor in front of the hotel nor even in what its mistress termed the receptionroom to meet the travellers  there was nothing lady rotherwood would dislike more than a rush of you all said aunt adeline and they had to submit though valetta nearly cried when she was dragged in from demonstratively watching at the gate in a scotch mist  however in about a quarter of an hour there was a ring at the door and in another moment mysie and gillian were hugging one smother valetta hanging round mysies neck fergus pulling down her arm  the four creatures seemed all wreathed into one like fabulous snakes for some seconds and when they unfolded enough for mysie to recollect and kiss her aunts there certainly was a taller betterequipped figure but just the same round goodhumoured countenance and the first thing beyond happy ejaculations that she was heard in a dutiful voice to say was miss elbury brought me to the door  i may stay as long as my aunts like to have me this evening if you will be so kind as to send some one to see me back  great was the jubilation and many the inquiries after primrose who had once been nearly well but had fallen back again and fly who mysie said was quite well and as comical as ever when she was well but quickly tired  she had set out in high spirits but had been dreadfully weary all the latter part of the journey and was to go to bed at once  she still coughed but mysie was bent on disproving nurse halfpennys assurance that the recovery would not be complete till may nor was there any doubt of her own air of perfect health  it was an evening of felicitous chatter of showing off christmas cards of exchanging of news of building of schemes the most prominent being that valetta should be in the constant companionship of mysie and fly until her own schoolroom should be reestablished this had been proposed by lord rotherwood and was what the aunts would have found convenient but apparently this had been settled by lord rotherwood and the two little girls but lady rotherwood had not said anything about it and quoth mysie somehow things dont happen till lady rotherwood settles them and then they always do  and shall i like miss elbury asked valetta  yes ifif you take pains said mysie but you mustnt bother her with questions in the middle of a lesson or she tells you not to chatter  she likes to have them all kept for the end and then if they arent foolish she will take lots of trouble  oh i hate that said valetta  i shouldnt remember them and i like to have done with it  then she is not like miss vincent  oh no  she couldnt be dear miss vincent but indeed she is very kind and nice  how did you get on altogether mysie  wasnt it horrid asked gillian  i was afraid it was going to be horrid said mysie  you see it wasnt like going in holiday time as it was before  we had to be almost always in the schoolroom and there were lots of lessonsmore for me than fly  just like a horrid old governess to slake her thirst on you put in fergus and though his aunts shook their heads at him they did not correct him  and one had to sit bolt upright all the time and never twist ones ankles continued mysie and not speak except french and german good mind  it wouldnt do to say la jambe du table est sur mon exercise   oh oh  no wonder fly got ill  fly didnt mind one bit  french and german come as naturally to her as the days of the week and they really begin to come to me in the morning now when i see miss elbury  but have you to go on all day asked valetta disconsolately  oh no  not after one oclock  and you didnt say that mamma thinks it only leads to slovenly bad grammar said gillian  that would have been impertinent said mysie and no one would have minded either  did you never play  we might play after our walkand after tea but it had to be quiet play not real good games even before fly was illat least we did have some real games when primrose came over or when cousin rotherwood had us down in his study or in the hall but fly got tired and knocked up very soon even then  miss elbury wanted us always to play battledore and shuttlecock or les graces if we couldnt go out  horrid woman said valetta  no she isnt horrid said mysie stoutly i only fancied her so when she used to say vos coudes mademoiselle or redresses vous and when she would not let us whisper but really and truly she was very very kind and i came to like her very much and see she was not crossonly thought it right  and redressezvous has been useful mysie said aunt ada you are as much improved as gillian  i thought it would be dreadful continued mysie when the grown ups went out on a round of visits and we had no drawingroom and no cousin rotherwood but cousin florence came every day and once she had us to dinner and that was nice and once she took us to beechcroft to see primrose and if it was not fine enough for fly to go out she came for me and i went to her cottages with her  oh i did like that  and when the whoopingcough came you cant think how very kind she was and miss elbury too  they both seemed only to think how to make me happy though i didnt feel ill a bit except when i whooped but they seemed so sorry for me and so pleased that i didnt make more fuss  i couldnt you know when poor fly was so ill  and when she grew better we were all so glad that somehow it made us all like a sort of a kind of a home together though it could not be that  mysies english had scarcely improved whatever her french had done but gillian gathered that she had had far more grievances to overcome and had met them in a very different spirit from herself  as to the schoolroom arrangements which would have been so convenient to the aunts it was evident that the matter had not yet been decisively settled though the children took it for granted it was pretty to see how mysie was almost devoured by fergus and valetta hanging on either side of her as she sat and gillian as near as they would allow while the four tongues went on unceasingly  it was only horrid valetta said that mysie should sleep in a different house but almost as much of her company was vouchsafed on the ensuing day sunday for miss elbury had relations at rockquay and was released for the entire day and fly was still so tired in the morning that she was not allowed to get up early in the day  her mother however came in to go to church with adeline mohun and gillian who had heard so much of the great marchioness was surprised to see a small slight woman not handsome and wornlooking about the eyes  at the first glance she was plainly dressed but the eye of a connoisseur like aunt ada could detect the exquisiteness of the material and the taste and the slow soft tone of her voice and every gesture and phrase showed that she had all her life been in the habit of condescendingin fact thought gillian revolving her recent experience though lady liddesdale and all her set are taller finerlooking people they are not one bit so grandno not that but so unapproachable as i am sure she is  she is gracious while they are just goodnatured  aunt ada was evidently pleased with the graciousness and highly delighted to have to take this distinguished personage to church mysie was with her sisters valetta was extremely anxious to take her to the sunday drawingroom classwhether for the sake of showing her to mrs hablot or mrs hablot to her did not appear  gillian was glad to be asked to sit with fly in the meantime  it was a sufficient reason for not repairing to the garden and she hoped that kalliope was unaware of her return little knowing of the replies by which fergus repaid alexis for his assistance in mineral hunting  she had no desire to transgress miss mohuns desire that no further intercourse should take place till she herself had spoken with kalliope  she found little phyllis devereux a great deal taller and thinner than the droll childish being who had been so amusing two years before at silverfold but eagerly throwing herself into her arms with the same affectionate delight  all the table was spread with pretty books and outlined illuminations waiting to be painted and some really beautiful illustrated sunday books but as gillian touched the first fly cried out oh dont i am so tired of all those things and this is such a stupid window  i thought at least i should see the people going to church and this looks at nothing but the old sea and a tiresome garden  that is thought a special advantage said gillian smiling  then i wish some one had it who liked it  you would not be so near us  no and that is nice and very nice for mysie  how are all the dear beasts at silverfoldbegum and all  i am afraid i do not know more about them than mysie does  aunt jane heard this morning that she must go down there tomorrow to meet the healthman and see what he says but she wont take any of us because of the diphtheria and the scarlet fever being about  oh dear how horrid those catching things are  ive not seen ivinghoe all this winter  ah but they are good sometimes  if it had not been for the measles i should never have had that most delicious time at silverfold nor known mysie  now please tell me all about where you have been and what you have been doing  fly knew some of the younger party that gillian had met at rowthorpe but she was more interested in the revels at vale leston and required a precise description of the theatricals or still better of the rehearsals  never was there a more appreciative audience of how it all began from kit harewood the young sailor having sent home a lions skin from africa which had already served for tableaux of androcles and of unahow the boy element had insisted on fun and the child element on fairies and how mrs william harewood had suggested midsummer nights dream as the only combination of the three essentials lion fun and fairy and pronounced that education had progressed far enough for the representation to be understanded of the people at least by the 6th and 7th standards  on the whole however comprehension seemed to have been bounded by intense admiration of the little girl fairies whom the old women appeared to have taken for angels for one had declared that to hear little miss cherry and miss katie singing their hymns like the angels they was was just like heaven  she must have had an odd notion of spotted snakes with double tongues  moreover effect was added to the said hymns by uncle lance behind the scenes  then there was the account of how it had been at first intended that oberon should be represented by little sir adrian with his bexley cousin pearl underwood for his titania but though she was fairy enough for anything he turned out so stolid and uttered well met by moonlight proud titania the only lines he ever learnt exactly like a lesson besides crying whenever asked to study his part that the attempt had to be given up and the fairy sovereigns had to be of large size mr grinstead pronouncing that probably this was intended by shakespeare as titania was a name of diana and he combined grecian nymphs with english fairies  so gerald underwood had to combine the part of peter quince including thisbe with that of oberon and the queen was offered to gillian  but i had learnt hermia she said and i saw it was politeness so i wouldnt and anna vanderkist is ever so much prettier besides being used to acting with gerald  she did look perfectly lovely asleep on the moss in the scene mrs grinstead painted and devised for her  there was  oh not only the prettiness i dont care for that  one gets enough of the artistic but the funthe dear fun  there was fun enough i am sure said gillian  puck was felix pearls brother you knoweleven years old so clever and an awful impand he was moon besides but the worst of it was that his dog it was a funny rough terrier at the vicaragewas so furious at the lion when adrian was roaring under the skin that nobody could hear and adrian got frightened as well he might and crept out from under it screaming and there fell the lion collapsing flat in the middle of the place  even theseusmajor harewood you know who had tried to be as grave as a judge and so polite to the actorscould not stand that interpolation as he called it of the man in the moon not to say the dog came down too soonwhy fly  for fly was in such a paroxysm of laughter as to end in a violent fit of coughing and to bring lady rotherwood in vexed and anxious  oh mother it was onlyit was only the lions skin and off went fly laughing and coughing again  i was telling her about the acting or midsummer nights dream at vale leston explained gillian  i should not have thought that a suitable subject for the day said the marchioness gravely and flys endeavour to say it was her fault for asking about it was silenced by choking and gillian found herself courteously dismissed in polite disgrace and as she felt not entirely without justice  it was a great disappointment that aunt jane did not think it well to take any of the young people to their home with her  as she said she did not believe that they would catch anything but it was better to be on the safe side and she fully expected that they would spend most of the day with mysie and fly  i wish i could go and talk to kalliope my dear she said to gillian but i am afraid it must wait another day  oh never mind said gillian as they bade each other goodnight at their doors they dont know that i am come home so they will not expect me     chapter xiii  st valentines day    miss mohun came back in the dark after a long day for once in her life quite jaded and explaining that the healthofficer and the landlord had been by no means agreed and that nothing could be done till sir jasper came home and decided whether to retain the house or not  all that she was clear about and which she had telegraphed to aden was that there must be no going back to silverfold for the present and she was prepared to begin lodginghunting as soon as she received an answer  and how have you got on she asked thinking all looked rather blank  we havent been to see fly broke out valetta though she went out on the beach and mysie must not stay out after dark for fear she should cough  mysie says they are afraid of excitement said gillian gloomily  then you have seen nothing of the others  yes i have seen victoria said aunt adeline with a meaning smile  miss mohun went up to take off her things and gillian followed her shutting the door with ominous carefulness and colouring all over  aunt jane i ought to tell you  a dreadful thing has happened  indeed my dear  what  i have had a valentine  oh repressing a certain inclination to laugh at the bathos from the look of horror and shame in the girls eyes  it is from that miserable alexis  oh i know i brought it on myself and i have been so wretched and so ashamed all day  was it so very shocking  let me see  oh  i sent it back at once by the post in an envelope saying sent by mistake  but what was it like  surely it was not one of the common shop things  oh no there was rather a pretty outline of a nymph or muse or something of that sort at the topdrawn i meanand verses written below something about my showing a lodestar of hope but i barely glanced at it  i hated it too much  i am sorry you were in such a hurry said aunt jane  no doubt it was a shock but i am afraid you have given more pain than it quite deserved  it was so impertinent cried gillian in astonished shamestricken indignation  so it seems to you said her aunt and it was very bad taste but you should remember that this poor lad has grown up in a stratum of society where he may have come to regard this as a suitable opportunity of evincing his gratitude and perhaps it may be very hard upon him to have this work of his treated as an insult  but you would not have had me keep it and tolerate it exclaimed gillian  i can hardly tell without having seen it but you might have done the thing more civilly through his sister or have let me give it back to him  however it is too late now i will make a point of seeing kalliope tomorrow but in the meantime you really need not be so horribly disgusted and ashamed  i thought he was quite a different sort  perhaps after all your thoughts were not wrong and he only fancied poor boy that he had found a pretty way of thanking you  this did not greatly comfort gillian who might prefer feeling that she was insulted rather than that she had been cruelly unkind and might like to blame alexis rather than herself  and indeed in any case she had sense enough to perceive that this very unacceptable compliment was the consequence of her own act of independence of more experienced heads  the next person miss mohun met was fergus lugging upstairs step by step a monstrous lump of stone into which he required her to look and behold a fascinating crevice full of glittering spar  where did you get that fergus  up off the cliff over the quarry  are you sure that you may have it  oh yes white said i might  its so jolly auntie  frank stebbing is gone away to the other shop in the apennines where the old boss lives  what splendiferous specimens he must have the run of  our stebbing says tis because kally white makes eyes at him but any way white has got to do his work while hes away and go all the rounds to see that things are right so i go after him and he lets me have just what i likesuch jolly crystals  i am sure i hope it is all right  oh yes i always ask him as you told me but he is awfully slow and mopy and down in the mouth today  stebbing says he is sweet upon gill but i told him that couldnt be white knew better  a generals daughter indeed and will remembers his father a sergeant  it is very foolish fergus  say no more about it for it is not nice talk about your sister  ill lick any one who does said fergus bumping his stone up another step  poor aunt jane  there was more to fall on her as soon as the door was finally shut on the two rooms communicating with one another which the sisters called their own  mrs mounts manipulations of miss adelines rich brown hair were endured with some impatience while miss mohun leant back in her chair in her shawlpatterned dressinggown watching with a sort of curious wonder and foreboding the restlessness that proved that something was in store and meantime somewhat lazily brushing out her own thinner darker locks  you are tired miss jane said the old servant using the pet name in private moments  you had better let me do your hair  no thank you fanny i have very nearly done she said marking the signs of eagerness on her sisters part  oh by the bye did that hot bottle go down to lilian giles  yes maam mrs giles came up for it  did she say whether lily was well enough to see miss gillian  mrs mount coughed a peculiar cough that her mistresses well knew to signify that she could tell them something they would not like to hear if they chose to ask her and it was the younger who put the question  fanny did she say anything  well miss ada i told her she must be mistaken but she stuck to it though she said she never would have breathed a word if miss gillian had not come back again but she thought you should know it  know what demanded jane  well miss jane she should say tis the talk that miss gillian when you have thought her reading to the poor girl has been running down to the worksand tis only the ignorance of them that will talk but they say it is to meet a young man  she says mrs giles do that she never would have noticed such talk but that the young lady did always seem in a hurry only just reading a chapter and never stopping to talk to poor lily after it and she has seen her herself going down towards the works instead of towards home maam and she said she could not bear that reading to her girl should be made a colour for such doings  certainly not if it were as she supposes said miss mohun sitting very upright and beating her own head vigorously with a very prickly brush but you may tell her fanny that i know all about it and that her friend is miss white who you remember spent an evening here  fannys goodhumoured face cleared up  yes maam i told her that i was quite sure that miss gillian would not go for to do anything wrong and that it could be easy explained but people has tongues you see  you were quite right to tell us fanny  goodnight  people has tongues repeated adeline when that excellent person had disappeared  yes indeed they have  but jenny do you really mean to say that you know all about this  yes i believe so  oh i wish you had been at home today when victoria came in  it really is a serious business  victoria  what has she to do with it  i should have thought her marchionessship quite out of the region of gossip though for that matter grandees like it quite as much as other people  dont jane  you know it does concern her through companionship for phyllis and she was very kind  oh yes i can see her sailing in magnificently kind from her elevation  but how in the world did she manage to pick up all this in the time said poor jane tired and pestered into the sharpness of her early youth  dear jenny i wish i had said nothing tonight  do wait till you are rested  i am not in the least tired and if i were do you think i could sleep with this half told  you said you knew  then it is only about gillian being so silly as to go down to miss whites office at the works to look over the boys greek exercises  you dont mean that you allowed it  no gillians impulsiveness just like her mothers began it as a little assertion of modern independence but while she was away that little step from brook to river brought her to the sense that she had been a goose and had used me rather unfairly and so she came and confessed it all to me on the way home from the station the first morning after her return  she says she had written it all to her mother from the first  i wonder lily did not telegraph to put a stop to it  do you suppose any mother our poor old lily especially can marry a couple of daughters without being slightly frantic  ten to one she never realised that this precious pupil was bigger than fergus  but do tell me what my lady had heard and how she heard it  you remember that her governess miss elbury has connections in the place  the most excellent creature in the world  oh yes and she spent sunday with them  so that was the conductor  i can hardly say that miss elbury was to be blamed considering that she had heard the proposal about valetta  it seems that that high school classmistress miss mellon who had the poor child under her is her cousin  oh dear  it is exactly what i was afraid of when we decided on keeping valetta at home  miss mellon told all the caesar story in plainly the worst light for poor val and naturally deduced from her removal that she was the most to blame  whereas it was miss mellon herself  but nobody could expect victoria to see that and no doubt she is quite justified in not wishing for the child in her schoolroom  but after all valetta is only a child it wont hurt her to have this natural recoil of consequences and her mother will be at home in three weeks time it signifies much more about gillian  did i understand you that the gossip about her had reached those august ears  oh yes jane and it is ever so much worse  that horrid miss mellon seems to have told miss elbury that gillian has a passion for low company that she is always running after the whites at the works and has secret meetings with the young man in the garden on sunday while his sister carries on her underhand flirtation with another youth frank stebbing i suppose  it really was too preposterous and victoria said she had no doubt from the first that there was exaggeration and had told miss elbury so but still she thought gillian must have been to blame  she was very nice about it and listened to all my explanation most kindly as to gillians interest in the whites and its having been only the sister that she met but plainly she is not half convinced  i heard something about a letter being left for gillian and really i dont know whether there may not be more discoveries to come  i never felt before the force of our dear fathers saying apropos of rotherwood himself that no one knows what it is to lose a father except those who have the care of his children  whatever gillian did was innocent and ladylike and nothing to be ashamed of said aunt jane stoutly of that i am sure  but i should like to be equally sure that she has not turned the head of that poor foolish young man without in the least knowing what she was about  you should have seen her state of mind at his sending her a valentine which she returned to him perfectly ferociously at once and that was all the correspondence somebody seems to have smelt out  a valentine  gillian must have behaved very ill to have brought that upon herself  oh dear  i wish she had never come here i wish lily could have stayed at home instead of scattering her children about the world  the rotherwoods will never get over it  thats the least part of the grievance in my eyes said her sister  it wont make a fraction of difference to the dear old cousin rotherwood and as to my lady it is always a liking from the teeth outwards  how can you say so  i am sure she has always been most cordial  most correct if you please  oh did she say anything about mysie  she said nothing but good of mysie called her delightful and perfectly good and trustworthy said they could never have got so well through phylliss illness without her and that they only wished to keep her altogether  i dare say to be humble companion to my little lady out of the way of her wicked sisters  jane  my dear i dont think i can stand any more defence of her just now no she is an admirable woman i know  thats enough  i really must go to bed and consider which is to be faced first she or kalliope  it was lucky that miss mohun could exist without much sleep for she was far too much worried for any length of slumber to visit her that night though she was afoot as early as usual  she thought it best to tell gillian that lady rotherwood had heard some foolish reports and that she was going to try to clear them up and she extracted an explicit account as to what the extent of her intercourse with the whites had been which was given willingly gillian being in a very humble frame and convinced that she had acted foolishly  it surprised her likewise that aunt adeline whom she had liked the best and thought the most goodnatured was so much more angry with her than aunt jane who as she felt forgave her thoroughly and was only anxious to help her out of the scrape she had made for herself  miss mohun thought her best time for seeing kalliope would be in the dinnerhour and started accordingly in the direction of the marble works  not far from them she met that young person walking quickly with one of her little brothers  i was coming to see you miss mohun said  i did not know that you went home in the middle of the day  my mother has been so unwell of late that i do not like to be entirely out of reach all day returned kalliope who certainly looked worn and sorrowful so i manage to run home though it is but for a quarter of an hour  i will not delay you i will walk with you and when petros had been dismissed i am afraid my niece has not been quite the friend to you that she intended  oh miss mohun do you know all about it  it is such a relief  i have felt so guilty towards you and yet i did not know what to do  i have never thought that the concealment was your fault said jane  i did think at first that you knew said kalliope and when i found that was not the case i suppose i should have insisted on your being told but i could not bear to seem ungrateful and my brother took such extreme delight in his lessons and miss merrifields kindness thatthat i could not bear to do what might prevent them and now poor fellow it shows how wrong it was since he has ventured on that unfortunate act of presumption which has so offended her  oh miss mohun he is quite brokenhearted  i am afraid gillian was very discourteous  i was out or it should not have been done so unkindly  indeed in the shock gillian did not recollect that she might be giving pain  yes yes  poor alexis  he has not had any opportunity of understanding how different things are in your class of life and he thought it would show his gratitude andandoh he is so miserable and she was forced to stop to wipe away her tears  poor fellow  but it was one of those young mens mistakes that are got over and outgrown so you need not grieve over it so much my dear  my brotherinlaw is on his way home and i know he means to see what can be done for alexis for your fathers sake  oh miss mohun how good you are  i thought you could never forgive us  and people do say such shocking things  i know they do and therefore i am going to ask you to tell me exactly what intercourse there has been with gillian  kalliope did so and miss mohun was struck with the complete accordance of the two accounts and likewise by the total absence of all attempt at selfjustification on miss whites part  if she had in any way been weak it had been against her will and her position had been an exceedingly difficult one  she spoke in as guarded a manner as possible but to such acute and experienced ears as those of her auditor it was impossible not to perceive that while gillian had been absolutely simple and unconscious of all but a kind act of patronage the youths imagination had taken fire and he had become her ardent worshipper with calflove no doubt but with a distant humble adoration which had whether fortunately or unfortunately for once found expression in the valentine so summarily rejected the drawing and the composition had been the work of many days and so much against his sisters protest that it had been sent without her knowledge after she had thought it given up  she had only extracted the confession through his uncontrollable despair which made him almost unfit to attend to his increased work perhaps by his southern nature exaggerated  the stronger at first the sooner over thought miss mohun but she knew that consolation betraying her comprehension would not be safe  one further discovery she made namely that on sunday alexis foolish lad had been so wildly impatient at their having had no notice from gillian since her return that he had gone to the garden to explain as he said his sisters nonappearance there since she was detained by her mothers illness  it was the only time he had ever been there and he had met no one but miss mohun felt a sinking of heart at the foreboding that the mauvaises langues would get hold of it  the only thing to be decided on was that there must be a suspension of intercourse at any rate till lady merrifields arrival not in unkindness but as best for all  and indeed kalliope had no time to spare from her mother whose bloated appearance poor woman was the effect of longstanding disease  the daughters heart was very full of her and evidently it would have been a comfort to discuss her condition with this kind friend but no more delay was possible and miss mohun had to speed home in a quandary how much or how little about alexiss hopeless passion should be communicated to its object and finally deciding that gillian had better only be informed that he had been greatly mortified by the rude manner of rejection but that the act itself proved that she must abstain from all renewal of the intercourse till her parents should return  but that was not all the worry of the day  miss mohun had still to confront lady rotherwood and going as soon as the early dinner was over found the marchioness resting after an inspection of houses in rockquay  she did not like hotels she said and she thought the top of the cliff too bleak for phyllis so that they must move nearer the sea if the place agreed with her at all which was doubtful  miss mohun was pretty well convinced that the true objection was the neighbourhood of beechcroft cottage  she said she had come to give some explanation of what had been said to her sister yesterday  oh my dear jane adeline told me all about it yesterday  i am very sorry for you to have had such a charge but what could you expect of girls cast about as they have been always with a marching regiment  i do not think mysie has given you any reason to think her ill brought up  a little uncouth at first but that was all  oh no  mysie is a dear little girl  i should be very glad to have her with phyllis altogether and so would rotherwood  but she was very young when sir jasper retired  and valetta was younger  poor little girl  she was naughty but i do not think she understood the harm of what she was doing  lady rotherwood smiled  perhaps not but she must have been deeply involved since she was the one amongst all the guilty to be expelled  oh victoria  was that what you heard  miss elbury heard it from the governess she was under  surely she was the only one not permitted to go up for the examination and removed  true but that was our doingno decree of the high school  her own governess is free now and her mother on her way and we thought she had better not begin another term  yes victoria i quite see that you might doubt her fitness to be much with phyllis  i am not asking for thati shall try to get her own governess to come at once but for the childs sake and her mothers i should like to get this cleared up  may i see miss elbury  certainly but i do not think you will find that she has exaggerated though of course her informant may have done so  miss elbury was of the older generation of governesses motherly kind but rather prim and precise the accomplished element being supplied with diplomaed foreigners who since lady phylliss failure in health had been dispensed with  she was a good and sensible woman as jane could see in spite of the annoyance her report had occasioned and it was impossible not to assent when she said she had felt obliged under the circumstances to mention to lady rotherwood what her cousin had told her  about both my nieces said jane  yes i quite understand  but though of course the little ones affair is the least important we had better get to the bottom of that first and i should like to tell you what really happened  she told her story and how valetta had been tempted and then bullied into going beyond the first peeps and finding she did not produce the impression she wished she begged miss elbury to talk it over with the headmistress  it was all in the telling  miss elburys young cousin miss mellon had been brought under rebuke and into great danger of dismissal through valetta merrifields lapse and it was no wonder that she had warned her kinswoman against the horrid little deceitful thing who had done so much harm to the whole class  miss mohun was running about over the whole place but not knowing what went on in her own house  and as to miss white miss elbury mentioned at last though with some reluctance that it was believed that she had been on the point of a private marriage and of going to italy with young stebbing when her machinations were detected and he was forced to set off without her  with this in her mind the governess could not be expected to accept as satisfactory what was not entire confutation or contradiction and miss mohun saw that politely as she was listened to it was all only treated as excuse since there could be no denial of gillians folly and it was only a question of degree  and provoking as it was the disappointment might work well for valetta  the allegations against gillian were a far more serious affair but much more of these could be absolutely disproved and contradicted in fact all that miss mohun herself thought very serious ie the flirtation element was shown to be absolutely false both as regarded gillian and kalliope but it was quite another thing to convince people who knew none of the parties when there was the residuum of truth undeniable that there had been secret meetings not only with the girl but the youth  to acquit gillian of all but modern independence and imprudent philanthropy was not easy to any one who did not understand her character and though lady rotherwood said nothing more in the form of censure it was evident that she was unconvinced that gillian was not a fast and flighty girl and that she did not desire more contact than was necessary  no doubt she wished herself farther off  lord rotherwood she said was coming down in a day or two when he could get away and then they should decide whether to take a house or to go abroad which after all might be the best thing for phyllis  he will make all the difference said miss adeline when the unsatisfactory conversation was reported to her  i dont know  but even if he did and i dont think he will i wont have valetta waiting for his decision and admitted on sufferance  shall you send her back to school  no  poor miss vincent is free and quite ready to come here fergus shall go and sleep among his fossils in the lumberroom and i will write to her at once  she will be much better here than waiting at silverton though the hacketts are very kind to her  yes it will be better to be independent  but all this is very unfortunate  however victoria will see for herself what the children are  she has asked me to take a drive with her tomorrow if it is not too cold  oh yes she is not going to make an estrangement  you need not fear that ada  she does not think it your fault  aunt jane pondered a little as to what to say to the two girls and finally resolved that valetta had better be told that she was not to do lessons with fly as her behaviour had made lady rotherwood doubt whether she was a good companion  valetta stamped and cried and said it was very hard and cross when she had been so sorry and every one had forgiven her but gillian joined heartily with aunt jane in trying to make the child understand that consequences often come in spite of pardon and repentance  to gillian herself aunt jane said as little as possible not liking even to give the veriest hint of the foolish gossip or of the extent of poor alexis whites admiration for it was enough for the girl to know that concealment had brought her under a cloud and she was chiefly concerned as to how her mother would look on it  she had something of aunt janes impatience of patronage and perhaps thought it snobbish to seem concerned at the great ladys displeasure  mysie was free to run in and out to her sisters but was still to do her lessons with miss elbury and fly took up more of her time than the sisters liked  neither she nor fly were formally told why their castles vanished into empty air but there certainly was a continual disappointment and fret on both sides which fly could not bear as well as when she was in high health and poor mysies loving heart often found it hard to decide between her urgent claims and those of valetta  but was not mamma coming and papa  would not all be well then yes hearts might bound at the thought  but where was gillians great thing  miss vincents coming was really like a beginning of home in spite of her mourning and depressed look  it was a great consolation to the lonely woman to find how all her pupils flew at her with infinite delight  she had taken pains to bring a report of all the animals for valetta and she duly admired all ferguss geological specimens and even undertook to print labels for them  mysie would have liked to begin lessons again with her but this would have been hard on fly and besides her mother had committed her to the rotherwoods and it was better still to leave her with them  the aunts were ready with any amount of kindness and sympathy for the governesss bereavement and her presence was a considerable relief in the various perplexities  even lady rotherwood and miss elbury had been convinced and by no means unwillingly that gillian had been less indiscreet than had been their first impression but she had been a young lady of the period in her independence and was therefore to be dreaded  no more garden trystes would have been possible under any circumstances for the house and garden were in full preparation for the master who was to meet lord rotherwood to consult about the proposed waterworks and other designs for the benefit of the town where they were the chief landowners     chapter xiv  the partner    the expected telegram arrived two days later requesting miss mohun to find a lodging at rockstone sufficient to contain sir jasper and lady merrifield and a certain amount of sons and daughters while they considered what was to be done about silverfold  so you and i will go out househunting gillian said aunt jane when she had opened it and the exclamations were over  i am afraid there is no house large enough up here said her sister  no it is an unlucky time in the thick of the season  victoria said she had been looking at some houses in bellevue  i am afraid she will have raised the prices of them  but oh aunt jane we couldnt go to bellevue church cried gillian  your mother would like to be so near the daily services at the kennel said miss mohun  yes we must begin with those houses theres nothing up here but sorrento and i have heard enough of its deficiencies  at that moment in came a basket of game grapes and flowers with lady rotherwoods compliments  solid pudding muttered miss mohun  in this case i should almost prefer empty praise  look here ada what a hamper they must have had from home  i think i shall as i am going that way take a pheasant and some grapes to the poor queen of the white ants i believe she is really ill and it will show that we do not want to neglect them  oh thank you aunt jane cried gillian the colour rising in her face and she was the willing bearer of the basket as she walked down the steps with her aunt and along the esplanade only pausing to review the notices of palatial rural and desirable villas in the houseagents window and to consider in what proportion their claims to perfection might be reduced  as they turned down ivinghoe terrace and were approaching the rusty gardengate they overtook mrs lee the wife of the organist of st kenelms who lodged at mrs whites  in former times before her marriage mrs lee had been a sundayschool teacher at st andrews and though party spirit considered her to have gone over to the enemy there were old habits of friendly confidence between her and miss mohun and there was an exchange of friendly greetings and inquiries  when she understood their errand she rejoiced in it saying that poor mrs white was very poorly and rather fractious and that this supply would be most welcome both to her and her daughter  ah i am afraid that poor girl goes through a great deal  indeed she does miss mohun and a better girl never lived  i cannot think how she can bear up as she does there she is at the office all day with her work except when she runs home in the middle of the dayall that distance to dish up something her mother can taste for theres no dependence on the girl nor on little maura neither  then she is slaving early and late to keep the house in order as well as she can when her mother is fretting for her attention and i believe she loses more than half her nights rest over the old lady  how she bears up i cannot guess and never a cross word to her mother who is such a trial nor to the boys but looking after their clothes and their lessons and keeping them as good and nice as can be  i often say to my husband i am sure it is a lesson to live in the house with her  i am sure she is an excellent girl said miss mohun  i wish we could do anything to help her  i know you are a real friend miss mohun and never was there any young person who was in greater need of kindness though it is none of her fault  she cant help her face poor dear and she has never given any occasion i am sure but has been as guarded and correct as possible  oh i was in hopes that annoyance was suspended at least for a time  you are aware of it then miss mohun  yes the young gentleman is come back not a bit daunted  yesterday evening what does he do but drive up in a cab with a great bouquet and a basketful of grapes and what not  poor kally she ran in to me and begged me as a favour to come downstairs with her and i could do no less  and i assure you miss mohun no queen could be more dignified nor more modest than she was in rejecting his gifts and keeping him in check poor dear when he was gone she burst out cryinga thing i never knew of her before not that she cared for him but she felt it a cruel wrong to her poor mother to send away the grapes she longed after and so she will feel these just a providence  then is mrs white confined to her room  for more than a fortnight  for that matter the thing was easier for she had encouraged the young man as far as in her lay poor thing though my husband and young alexis both told her what they knew of him and that it would not be for kallys happiness let alone the offence to his father  then it really went as far as that  miss mohun i would be silent as the grave if i did not know that the old lady went talking here and there never thinking of the harm she was doing  she was so carried away by the idea of making a lady of kally  she says she was a beauty herself though you would not think it now and she is perfectly puffed up about kally  so she actually lent an ear when the young man came persuading kally to get married and go off to italy with him where he made sure he could come over mr white with her beauty and relationship and allamong the myrtle grovesthat was his expressionwhere she would have an association worthy of her  i dont quite know how he meant it to be brought about but he is one who would stick at nothing and of course kally would not hear of it and answered him so as one would think he would never have had the face to address her again but poor mrs white has done nothing but fret over it and blame her daughter for undutifulness and missing the chance of making all their fortunesbreaking her heart and her health and i dont know what besides  she is half a foreigner you see and does not understand and she is worse than no one to that poor girl  and you say he is come back as bad as ever  or worse you may say miss mohun absence seems only to have set him the more upon her and i am afraid that mrs whites talk though it may not have been to many has been enough to set it about the place and in cases like that it is always the poor young woman as gets the blameespecially with the gentlemans own people  i am afraid so  and you see she is in a manner at his mercy being son to one of the heads of the firm and in a situation of authority  what can she do all day at the office  she keeps one or two of the other young ladies working with her said mrs lee but if any change could be made it would be very happy for her though after all i do not see how she could leave this place the house being family property and mr white their relation besides that mrs white is in no state to move but on the other hand mr and mrs stebbing know their son is after her and the lady would not stick at believing or saying anything against her though i will always bear witness and so will mr lee that never was there a more good rightminded young woman or more prudent and guarded  so would mr flight and his mother i have no doubt  mr flight would miss mohun butwith an odd looki fancy my lady thinks poor kally too handsome for it to be good for a young clergyman to have much to say to her  they have not been so cordial to them of late but that is partly owing to poor mrs whites foolish talk and in part to young alexis having been desultory and mopy of latenot taking the interest in his music he did  mr lee says he is sure some young woman is at the bottom of it  miss mohun saw her nieces ears crimson under her hat and was afraid mrs lee would likewise see them  they had reached the front of the house and she made haste to take out a visitingcard and to beg mrs lee kindly to give it with the basket saying that she would not give trouble by coming to the door  and then she turned back with gillian who was in a strange tumult of shame and consternation yet withal feeling that first strange thrill of young womanhood at finding itself capable of stirring emotion and too much overcome by these strange sensationsabove all by the shock of shameto be able to utter a word  i must make light of it but not too light thought miss mohun and she broke the ice by saying poor foolish boy  oh aunt jane what shall i do  let it alone my dear  but that i should have done so much harm and upset him soin a voice betraying a certain sense of being flattered  cant i do anything to undo it  certainly not  to be perfectly quiet and do nothing is all you can do  my dear boys and young men have such foolish fitsmore in that station than in ours because they have none of the public school and college life which keeps people out of it  you were the first lady this poor fellow was brought into contact with andwell you were rather a goose and he has been a greater one but if he is let alone he will recover and come to his senses  i could tell you of men who have had dozens of such fits  i am much more interested about his sister  what a noble girl she is  oh isnt she aunt jane  quite a real heroine  and now mamma is coming she will know what to do for her  i hope she will but it is a most perplexing case altogether  and that horrid young stebbing is come back too  i am glad she has that nice mrs lee to help her  and to defend her added miss mohun  her testimony is worth a great deal and i am glad to know where to lay my hand upon it  and here is our first house les rochers  for madame de sevignes sake i hope it will do  but it didnt  miss mohun got no farther than the hall before she detected a scent of gas and they had to betake themselves to the next vacant abode  the investigating nature had full scope in the various researches that she made into parlour kitchen and hall desperately wearisome to gillian whose powers were limited to considering how the family could sit at ease in the downstairs rooms how they could be stowed away in the bedrooms and where there were the prettiest views of the bay  aunt jane becoming afraid that while she was literally ferreting in the offices gillian might be meditating on her conquest picked up the first cheap book that looked innocently sensational and left her to study it on various sofas  and when daylight failed for inspections gillian still had reason to rejoice in the pastime devised for her since there was an endless discussion at the agents over the only two abodes that could be made available as to prices repairs time and terms they did not get away till it was quite dark and the gas lighted and miss mohun did not think the ascent of the steps desirable so that they went round by the street  i declare exclaimed miss mohun theres mr whites house lighted up  he must be come  i wonder whether he will do anything for kalliope sighed gillian  oh jenny exclaimed miss adeline as the two entered the drawing room  you have had such a loss rotherwood has been here waiting to see you for an hour and such an agreeable man he brought with him  who could it have been  i didnt catch his namerotherwood was mumbling in his quick way indeed i am not sure he did not think i knew him  a distinguished looking man like a picture with a fine white beard and he was fresh from italy told me all about the carnival and the curious ceremonies in the country villages  from italy  it cant have been mr white  mr white  my dear jane this was a gentlemanquite a grand looking man  he might have been an italian nobleman only he spoke english too well for that though i believe those diplomates can speak all languages  however you will see for we are to go and dine with them at eight oclockyou and i and gillian  you ada  oh  i have ordered the chair round it wont hurt me with the glasses up  gillian my dear you must put on the white dress that mrs grinsteads maid did up for youit is quite simple and i should like you to look nice  welloh how tired you both look ring for some fresh tea gillian  have you found a house  so excited and occupied was adeline that the househunting seemed to have assumed quite a subordinate place in her mind  it really was an extraordinary thing for her to dine out though this was only a family party next door and she soon sailed away to hold counsel with mrs mount on dresses and wraps and to get her very beautiful hair dressed  she made by far the most imposing appearance of the three when they shook themselves out in the anteroom at the hotel in her softlytinted sheeny palegray dress with pearls in her hair and two beautiful blush roses in her bosom while her sister in black satin and coral somehow seemed smaller than ever probably from being tired and from the same cause gillian had dark marks under her brown eyes and a much more limp and languid look than was her wont  fly was seated on her fathers knee looking many degrees better and brighter as if his presence were an elixir of life and when he put her down to greet the arrivals both she and mysie sprang to gillian to ask the result of the quest of houses  the distinguished friend was there and was talking to lady rotherwood about italian progress and there was only time for an inquiry and reply as to the success of the search for a house before dinner was announcedthe little girls disappeared and the marquess gave his arm to his eldest cousin  grand specimen of marble isnt he he muttered  ada hasnt the least idea who he is  she thinks him a great diplomate communicated jane in return and her arm received an ecstatic squeeze  it was amusing to jane mohun to see how much like a dinner at rotherwood this contrived to be with my ladys own footman and my lords valet waiting in state  she agreed mentally with her sister that the other guest was a very finelooking man with a picturesque head and he did not seem at all out of place or illatease in the company in which he found himself  lord rotherwood with a view perhaps to prolonging adelines mystification turned the conversation to italian politics and the present condition and the industries of the people on all of which subjects much ready information was given in fluent good english with perhaps rather unnecessarily fine words  it was only towards the end of the dinner that a personal experience was mentioned about the impossibility of getting work done on great feast days or of knowing which were the greaterand the great dislike of the peasant mind to new methods  when it came to at first i had to superintend every blasting with gelatine the initiated were amused at the expression of adelines countenance and the suppressed start of frightful conviction that quivered on her eyelids and the corners of her mouth though kept in check by good breeding and then smoothed out into a resolute complacency which convinced her sister that having inadvertently exalted the individual into the category of the distinguished she meant to abide staunchly by her first impression  lady rotherwood like most great ladies in public life was perfectly well accustomed to have all sorts of people brought home to dinner and would have been far less astonished than her cousins at sitting down with her grocer but she gave the signal rather early and on reaching the sittingroom where miss elworthy was awaiting them said  we will leave them to discuss their waterworks at their ease certainly residence abroad is an excellent education  a very superior man said adeline  those selfmade men always are  in the nature of things added miss mohun or they would not have mounted  it is the appendages that are distressing said lady rotherwood and they seldom come in ones way  has this man left any in italy  oh no none alive  he took his wife there for her health and that was the way he came to set up his italian quarries but she and his child both died there long ago and he has never come back to this place since explained ada  but he has relations here said jane  his cousin was an officer in jasper merrifields regiment  she hoped to have been saying a word in the cause of the young people but she regretted her attempt for lady rotherwood replied  i have heard of them  a very undeserving family are they not  gillian whom miss elworthy was trying to entertain heard and could not help colouring all over face neck and ears all the more for so much hating the flush and feeling it observed  miss mohuns was a very decided i should have said quite the reverse  indeed  well i heard the connection lamented for his sake by what was her name  mrs stirlingor  mrs stebbing said adeline  you dont mean that she has actually called on you  is there any objection to her asked lady rotherwood with a glance to see whether the girl was listening  oh no no only he is a mere masonor quarryman who has grown rich said adeline  the hostess gave a little dry laugh  is that all  i thought you had some reason for disapproving of her i thought her rather sensible and pleasing  cringing and flattering thought jane and that is just what these magnificent ladies like in the wide field of inferiors  but aloud she could not help saying my principal objection to mrs stebbing is that i have always thought her rather a gossipon the scandalous side  then bethinking herself that it would not be well to pursue the subject in gillians presence she explained where the stebbings lived and asked how long lord rotherwood could stay  only over sunday  he is going to look over the place tomorrow and next day there is to be a public meeting about it  i am not sure that we shall not go with him  i do not think the place agrees with phyllis  the last words were spoken just as the two gentlemen had come in from the diningroom rather sooner than was expected and they were taken up  agrees with phyllis  she looks poundsnay hundredweights better than when we left home  i mean to have her down tomorrow on the beach for a larkcastlebuilding paddlingwith mysie and val and fergus and all  thats what would set her up best wouldnt it jane  jane gave a laughing assent wondering how much of this would indeed prove castlebuilding though adding that fergus was at school and that it was not exactly the time of year for paddling  oh ah eh  well perhaps notforestalling sweet st valentine stepping into their nests they paddled  though st valentine is past and i thought our fortunes had been made mr white by calling this the english naples and what not  those are the puffs my lord  there is a good deal of difference even between this and rocca marina which is some way up the mountain  it must be very beautiful said miss ada  well miss mohun people do say it is striking  and he was drawn into describing the old italian mansion purchased on the extinction of an ancient family of nobles perched up on the side of a mountain whose feet the sea laved with a terrace whence there was a splendid view of the gulf of genoa and fine slopes above and below of chestnuttrees and vineyards and therewith he gave a hearty invitation to the company present to visit him there if ever they went to italy when he would have great pleasure in showing them many bits of scenery and curious remains that did not fall in the way of ordinary tourists  lady rotherwood gratefully said she should remember the invitation if they went to the south as perhaps they should do that very spring  and said ada you are not to be expected to remain long in this climate when you have a home like that awaiting you  dont call it home miss mohun he said  i have not had that these many years but i declare the first sound of our county dialect when i got out at the station made my heart leap into my mouth  i could have shaken hands with the fellow  then i hope you will remain here for some time  there is much wanting to be set going said jane  so i thought of doing and i had out a young fellow who i thought might take my placemy partners son young stebbing  they wrote that he had been learning italian with a view to being useful to me and so on but when he came out what was he but a fine gentleman never had put his hand to a pick nor a blastingiron and as to his italian he told me it was the italian of alfieri and leopardi leopardis italian it might be for it was a very mottled or motley tongue but he might as well have talked english or doubledutch to our hands or better for they had picked up the meaning of some orders from me before i got used to their lingo  and then he says tis office work and superintendence he understands  how can you superintend i told him what you dont know yourself  no no go home and bring a pair of hands fit for a quarryman before i make you overlooker  this was rather delightful and it further appeared that he could answer all janes inquiries after her beloved promising lads whom he had deported to the rocca marina quarries  they were evidently kindly looked after and she began to perceive that it was not such a bad place after all for them more especially as he was in the act of building them a chapel and one of his objects in coming to england was to find a chaplain and as lord rotherwood said he had come to the right shop since rockquay in the spring was likely to afford a choice of clergy with weak chests or better still with weakchested wives to whom light work in a genial climate would be the greatest possible boon  altogether the evening was very pleasant only too short  it was a curious study for jane mohun how far lady rotherwood would give way to her husband  she always seemed to give way but generally accomplished her own will in the end and it was little likely that she would allow the establishment to await the influx of merrifields though certainly gillian had done nothing displeasing all that evening except that terrible blushing for which piece of ingenuousness her aunt loved her all the better  at halfpast ten next morning however lord rotherwood burst in to borrow valetta for a donkeyride for which his lady had compounded instead of the paddling and castlebuilding and certainly poor val could not do much to corrupt fly on donkey back and in his presence he further routed out gillian nothing loth from her algebra bidding her put on her sevenleagued boots and not get bent double and he would fain have seized on his cousin jane but she was already gone off for an interview with the landlord of the most eligible of the two houses  gillian and valetta came back very rosy and in fits of merriment lord rotherwood had paid the donkeyboys to stay at home and let him and gillian take their place  they had gone out on the common above the town with most amusing rivalries as to which drove the beast worst making mysie umpire  then having attained a delightfully lonely place fly had begged for a race with valetta which failed partly because vals donkey would not stir and partly because fly could not bear the shaking and then lord rotherwood himself insisted on riding the donkey that wouldnt go and racing gillian on the donkey that wouldand he made his go so effectually that it ran away with him and he pulled it up at last only just in time to save himself from being ignominiously stopped by an old fishwoman  he had as aunt jane said regularly dipped gill back into childhood and she looked spoke and moved all the better for it     chapter xv  the rocks of rockstone    lord rotherwood came in to try to wile his cousin to share in the survey of the country but she declared it to be impossible as all her avocations had fallen into arrear and she had to find a couple of servants as well as a house for the merrifields  this took her in the direction of the works and gillian proposed to go with her as far as the giless there to sit a little while with lilian for whom she had a new book  my dear surely you must be tired out exclaimed the stayathome aunt  oh no aunt ada  quite freshened by that blow on the common  and miss mohun was not sorry thinking that to leave gillian free to come home by herself would be the best refutation of mrs mounts doubts of her  they had not however gone far on their wayon the walk rather unfrequented at this time of daybefore gillian exclaimed is that kally  oh and who is that with her  for there certainly was a figure in somewhat close proximity the ulster and porkpie hat being such as to make the gender doubtful  how late she is  i am afraid her mother is worse said miss mohun quickening her steps a little and at the angle of the road the pair in front perceived them  kalliope turned towards them the companionabout whom there was no doubt by that timegave a petulant motion and hastened out of sight  in another moment they were beside kalliope who looked shaken and trembling with tears in her eyes which sprang forth at the warm pressure of her hand  i am afraid mrs white is not so well said miss mohun kindly  she is no worse i think thank you but i was delayed  are you going this way  may i walk with you  i will come with you to the office said miss mohun perceiving that she was in great need of an escort and protector  oh thank you thank you if it is not too much out of your way  a few more words passed about mrs whites illness and what advice she was having  miss mohun could not help thinking that the daughter did not quite realise the extent of the illness for she added  it was a good deal on the nerves and mind  she was so anxious about mr james whites arrival  have you not seen him  oh no  not yet  i think you will be agreeably surprised said gillian  and here they left her at mrs giless door  yes added miss mohun he gave me the idea of a kind just man  miss mohun said the poor girl as soon as they were teteatete i know you are very good  will you tell me what i ought to do  you saw just now  i did and i have heard  her face was all in a flame and her voice choked  he saysmr frank doesthat his mother has found out and that she will tell her own story to mr white andand we shall all get the sack as he calls it and it will be utter misery and he will not stir a finger to vindicate me but if i will listen to him he will speak to mr white and bear me through but i canti cant  i know he is a bad man i know how he treated poor edith vane  i never can and how shall i keep out of his way  my poor child said miss mohun it is a terrible position for you but you are doing quite right  i do not believe mr white would go much by what that young man says for i know he does not think highly of him  but he does go altogether by mr stebbingaltogether and i know hemr stebbing i meancant bear us and would not keep us on if he could help it  he has been writing for another designeran artistinstead of me  still you would be glad to have the connection severed  oh yes i should be glad enough to be away but what would become of my mother and the children  remember your oldest friends are on their way home and i will try to speak to mr white myself  they had reached the little door of kalliopes office which she could open with a latchkey and miss mohun was just about to say some parting words when there was a sudden frightful rumbling sound something between a clap of thunder and the carting of stones and the ground shook under their feet while a cry went uploud horror struck men and womens voices raised in dismay  jane had heard that sound once before  it was the fall of part of the precipitous cliff much of which had been quarried away  but in spite of all precautions frost and rain were in danger of loosening the remainder and wire fences were continually needing to be placed to prevent the walking above on edges that might be perilous  where was it  what had it done was the instant thought  kalliope turned as pale as death the girls came screaming and thronging out of their workshop the men from their sheds the women from the cottages as all thronged to the more open space beyond the buildings where they could see while miss mohun found herself clasped by her trembling niece  others were rushing up from the wharf  one moments glance showed all familiar with the place that a projecting point forming a sort of cusp in the curve of the bay had gone and it lay a great shattered mass fragments spreading far and wide having crashed through the roof of a stable that stood below  there was a general crowding forward to the spot and crying and exclamation and a shouting of all right from above and below  had any one come down with it  a double horror seized miss mohun as she remembered that her cousin was to inspect those parts that very afternoon  she caught at the arm of a man and demanded was any one up there  masters there and some gentlemen but they haint brought down with it said the man  dont be afraid miss  thank the lord no one was under the rockhorses even out at work  thank god indeed exclaimed miss mohun daring now to look up and seeing not very distinctly some figures of men who however were too high up and keeping too far from the dangerous broken edge for recognition  room was made for the two ladies by the men who knew miss mohun to push forward so as to have a clearer view of the broken wall and roof of the stable and the great ruddy blue and white veined mass of limestone rock turf and bush adhering to what had been the top  there was a moments silence through the crowd a kind of awe at the spectacle and the possibilities that had been mercifully averted  then one of the men said  that was how it was  i saw one of them abovenot stebbingno coming out to the brow and after this last frost not a doubt but that must have been enough to bring it down  not railed off eh said the voice of young stebbing from among the crowd  well it were marked with big stones where the rail should go said another  i know for i laid em myself but there werent no orders given  there werent no stones either  some one been and took em away added the first speaker  i see how it is frank stebbings metallic voice could plainly be heard flavoured with an oath  this is your neglect white droning stuckup sneak as you always were and will be  i shall report this  damage to property and maybe life all along of your confounded idleness  and there were worse imprecations which made miss mohun break out in a tone of shocked reproof  mr stebbing  i beg your pardon miss mohun i was not aware of your presence  nor of a higher one she could not help interposing while he went on justifying himself  it is the only way to speak to these fellows and it is enough to drive one mad to see what comes of the neglect of a conceited young ass above his business  life and property  but life is safe is it not she interrupted with a shudder  ay ay maam said the voice of the workman or we should know it by this time  but at that moment a faint gasping cry caught janes ear  others heard it too  it was a childs voice and grew stronger after a moment  it came from the corner of the shed outside the stable  oh oh cried the women pressing forward the poor little fields  then it was recollected that mrs fieldone of those impracticable women on whom the shafts of school officers were lost and who was always wandering in the townhad been seen going out leaving two small children playing about the younger under the charge of the elder  the father was a carter and had been sent on some errand with the horses  this passed while anxious hands were struggling with stones and earth foremost among them alexis white  the utmost care was needful to prevent the superincumbent weight from falling in and crushing the life there certainly was beneath happily not the rock from above but some of the debris of the stable  frank stebbing and the foreman had to drive back anxious crowds and keep a clear space  then came running shrieking pushing her way through the men the poor mother who had to be forcibly withheld by miss mohun and one of the men from precipitating herself on the pile of rubbish where her children were buried and so shaking it as to make their destruction certain  those were terrible moments but when the mothers voice penetrated to the children a voice answered  mammy mammy get us out theres a stone on tommyat least so the poor woman understood the lispings almost stifled and she shrieked again mammys coming darlings  the time seemed endless though it was probably only a few minutes before it was found that the children were against the angle of the shed where the wall and a beam had protected the younger a little girl of five who seemed to be unhurt  but alas though the boys limbs were not crushed a heavy stone had fallen on his temple  the poor woman would not believe that life was gone  she disregarded the little one who screamed for mammy and clutched her skirts in spite of the attempts of the women to lift her up and comfort her and gathering the poor lifeless boy in her arms she alternately screamed for the doctor and uttered coaxing caressing calls to the child  she neither heard nor heeded miss mohun with whom indeed her relations had not been agreeable and as a young surgeon sniffing the accident from afar had appeared on the scene and had at the first glance made an all too significant gesture jane thought it safe to leave the field to him and a kind motherly good neighbour who promised her to send up to beechcroft cottage in case there was anything to be done for the unhappy woman or the poor father  mr hablot who now found his way to the spot promised to walk on and prepare him he was gone with a marble cross to a churchyard some five miles off  gillian had not spoken a word all this time  she felt perfectly stunned and bewildered as if it was a dream and she could not understand it  only for a moment did she see the bleeding face and prone limbs of the poor boy and that sent a shuddering horror over her so that she felt like fainting but she had so much recollection and selfconsciousness that horror of causing a sensation and giving trouble sent the blood back to her heart and she kept her feet by holding hard to her aunts arm and presently miss mohun felt how tight and trembling was the grasp and then saw how white she was  my dear we must get home directly she said kindly  lean on me there  there was leisure now as they turned away for others to see the young ladys deadly paleness and there were invitations to houses and offers of all succours at hand but the dread of a fuss further revived gillian and all that was accepted was a seat for a few moments and a glass of water which aunt jane needed almost as much as she did  though the girls colour was coming back and she said she could walk quite well both had such aching knees and such shaken limbs that they were glad to hold by each other as they mounted the sloping road and halfway up gillian came to a sudden stop  aunt jane she said panting and turning pale again you heard that dreadful man  oh do you think it was true  ferguss bit of sparalexis not minding  oh then it is all our doing  i cant tell  dont you think about it now said aunt jane feeling as if the girl were going to swoon on the spot in the shock consequences are not in our hands  whatever it came from and very sad it was there was great mercy and we have only to thank god it was no worse  when at last aunt and niece reached home they had no sooner opened the front door than adeline came almost rushing out of the drawing room  oh my dearest jane she cried clasping and kissing her sister wasnt it dreadful  where were you  mr white knows no one was hurt below but i could not be easy till you came in  mr white  yes mr white was so kind as to come and tell meand about rotherwood  what about rotherwood exclaimed miss mohun advancing into the drawingroom where mr white had risen from his seat  nothing to be alarmed about  indeed i assure you his extraordinary presence of mind and agility  what was it as she and gillian each sank into a chair the one breathless the other with the faintness renewed by the fresh shock but able to listen as mr white told first briefly then with more detail howas the surveying party proceeded along the path at the top of the cliffs he and lord rotherwood comparing recollections of the former outline now much changed by quarryingthe marquis had stepped out to a slightly projecting point mr stebbing had uttered a note of warning knowing how liable these promontories were to break away in the end of winter and happily lord rotherwood had turned and made a step or two back when the rock began to give way under his feet so that being a slight and active man a spring and bound forward had actually carried him safely to the firm ground and the others who had started back in selfpreservation then in horror fully believing him borne down to destruction saw him the next instant lying on his face on the path before them  when on his feet he had declared himself unhurt and solely anxious as to what the fall of rock might have done beneath but he was reassured by those cries of all right which were uttered before the poor little fields were discovered and then when the party were going to make their way down to inspect the effects of the catastrophe he had found that he had not escaped entirely unhurt  of course he had been forced to leap with utter want of heed only as far and wide as he could and thus though he had lighted on his feet he had fallen against a stone and pain and stiffness of shoulder made themselves apparent though he would accept no help in walking back to the hotel and was only anxious not to frighten his wife and daughter and desired mr white who had volunteered to go to tell the ladies next door that he was convinced it was nothing or if anything only a trifle of a collarbone  mr white had since the arrival of the surgeon made an expedition of inquiry and heard this verdict confirmed with the further assurance that there was no cause for anxiety  the account of the damage and disaster below was new to him as his partner had declared the stables to be certain to be empty and moreover in need of being rebuilt and he departed to find mr stebbing and make inquiries  miss mohun going to the hotel saw the governess and heard that all was going on well and that lord rotherwood insisted that nothing was the matter and would not hear of going to bed but was lying on the sofa in the sittingroom  her ladyship presently came out and confirmed the account but jane agreed with her that if possible the knowledge of the poor childs death should be kept from him that night lest the shock should make him feverish  however in that very moment when she was off guard the communication had been made by his valet only too proud to have something to tell and with the pleasing addition that miss mohun had had a narrow escape  whereupon ensued an urgent message to miss mohun to come and tell him all about it  wife and cousin exchanged glances of consternation and perhaps each knew she might be thankful that he did not come himself instead of sending and yet feared that the abstinence was a proof more of incapacity than of submission  lying there in a dressinggown over a strapped shoulder he showed his agitation by being more than usually unable to finish a sentence  jenny jennyyou areare you all safe not frightened  oh no no i was a great way off i only heard the noise and i did not know you were there  ah there must besomething must be meant for me to do  heaven must meanthank him  but is it truea poor child  cant one ever be foolish without hurting more than ones self  jane told him the truth calmly and quietly explaining that the survivor was entirely unhurt and the poor little victim could not have suffered adding with all her heart the whole thing was full of mercy and i do not think you need blame yourself for heedlessness for it was an accident that the place was not marked  shameful neglect said lady rotherwood  the partnerwhatshisnamestebbingsaid something about his son being away  an untrustworthy substitute wasnt there said lord rotherwood  the son was the proficient in leopardine italian we heard of last night said jane  i dont know what he may be as an overlooker here  he certainly fell furiously on the substitute a poor cousin of mr whites own but i am much afraid the origin of the mischief was nearer homemaster ferguss geological researches  fergus  why he is a mite  yes but maurice encore  however i must find out from him whether this is only a foreboding of my prophetic soul  curious cattle observed lord rotherwood  well put in his wife i do not think ivinghoe has ever given us cause for anxiety  exactly the reason that i am always expecting him to break out in some unexpected place  no victoria he added seeing that she did not like this i am quite ready to allow that we have a model son and i only pity him for not having a model father  well i am not going to stay and incite you to talk nonsense said jane rising to depart i will let you know my discoveries  she found fergus watching for her at the gate with the appeal aunt jane theres been a great downfall of cliff and i want to see what formations it has brought to light but they wont let me through to look at it though i told them white always did  i do not suppose that they will allow any one to meddle with it at present said aunt jane then as fergus made an impatient exclamation she added do you know that a poor little boy was killed and cousin rotherwood a good deal hurt  yes said fergus big blake said so  and now fergus i want to know where you took that large stone from that you showed me with the crack of spar  with the micaceous crystals corrected fergus  it was off the top of that very cliff that fell down so i am sure there must be more in it and some one else will get them if they wont let me go and see for them  and alexis white gave you leave to take it  oh yes i always ask him  were you at the place when you asked him fergus  at the place on the cliff  no  for i couldnt find him for a long time and i carried it all the way down the steps  and you did not tell him where it came from  he didnt ask  indeed aunt jane i always did show him what i took and he would have let me in now only he was not at the office and the man at the gate big blake was as savage as a bear and slammed the door on me and said they wouldnt have no idle boys loafing about there  and when i said i wasnt an idle boy but a scientific mineralogist and that mr alexis white always let me in he laughed in my face and said mr alexis had better look out for himself  i shall tell stebbing how cheeky he was  my dear fergus there was good reason for keeping you out  you did not know it nor alexis but those stones were put to show that the cliff was getting dangerous and to mark where to put an iron fence and it was the greatest of mercies that rotherwoods life was saved  the boy looked a little sobered but his aunt had rather that his next question had not been do you think they will let me go there again  however she knew very well that conviction must slowly soak in and that nothing would be gained by frightening him so that all she did that night was to send a note by mysie to her cousin explaining her discovery and she made up her mind to take fergus to the inquest the next day since his evidence would exonerate alexis from the most culpable form of carelessness  only however in the morning when she had ascertained the hour of the inquest did she write a note to mrs edgar to explain ferguss absence from school or inform the boy of what she intended  on the whole he was rather elated at being so important as to be able to defend alexis white and he was quite above believing that scientific research could be reckoned by any one as mischief  just as miss mohun had gone up to get ready mysie ran in to say that cousin rotherwood would be at the door in a moment to take fergus down  lady rotherwood cant bear his going said mysie and mr white and mr stebbing say that he need not but he is quite determined though he has got his arm in a sling for he says it was all his fault for going where he ought not  and he wont have the carriage for he says it would shake his bones ever so much more than shanks mare  just like him said aunt jane  has dr dagger given him leave  yes he said it wouldnt hurt him but lady rotherwood told miss elbury she was sure he persuaded him  mysies confused pronouns were cut short by lord rotherwoods own appearance  you need not go jane he said  i can take care of this little chap  theyll not chop off his head in the presence of one of the legislature  nice care to begin by chaffing him out of his wits she retorted the question is whether you ought to go  yes jenny i must go  it cant damage me and besides to tell the truth it strikes me that things will go hard with that unlucky young fellow if some one is not there to stand up for him and elicit ferguss evidence  alexis white  whiteay a cousin or something of the exemplary boss  hes been dining with his partnersthe old white i meanand theyve been cramming himi imagine with a view to scapegoat treatmentjealousy and all the rest of it  if there is not a dismissal theres a hovering on the verge  exactly what i was afraid of said jane  oh rotherwood i could tell you volumes  but may i not come down with you  could not i do something  well on the whole you are better away jenny  consider williams feelings  womankind even brownies are better out of it  prejudice against proteges whether of petticoats or cassocksbegging your pardon  i can fight battles better as an unsophisticated stranger coming down fresh though i dont expect any one from the barony of beechcroft to believe it and maybe the less i know of your volumes the better till after  oh rotherwood as if i wasnt too thankful to have you to send for me  there  ive kept the firm out there waiting an unconscionable time theyll think you are poisoning my mind  come along you imp of science  trust me ill not bully him though its highly tempting to make the chien chasser de race  oh aunt jane wont you go exclaimed gillian in despair as her cousin waved a farewell at the gate  no my dear it is not for want of wishing but he is quite right he can do much better than i could  but is he in earnest aunt  oh yes most entirely and i quite see that he is rightindeed i do gillian  people pretend to defer to a lady but they really dont like her poking her nose in and after all i could have no right to say anything  my only excuse for going was to take care of fergus  a further token of lord rotherwoods earnestness in the cause was the arrival of his servant who was to bring down the large stone which master merrifield had moved and who conveyed it in a cab being much too grand to carry it through the streets  gillian was very unhappy and restless unable to settle to anything and linking cause and effect together disconsolately in a manner mysie whom she admitted to her confidence failed to understand  it was a great pity fergus did not show alexis where the stone came from but i dont see what your not giving him his lessons had to do with it  made him unhappy  oh gilly dear you dont mean any one would be too unhappy to mind his business for such nonsense as that i am sure none of us would be so stupid if mr pollock forgot our greek lessons  certainly not said gillian almost laughing but you dont understand mysie  it was the taking him up and letting him down and i could not explain it and it looked so nasty and capricious  well i suppose you ought to have asked aunt janes leave but i do think he must be a ridiculous young man if he could not attend to his proper work because you did not go after him when you were only just come home  ah mysie you dont understand  mysie opened a round pair of brown eyes and said oh i did think people were never so silly out of poetry  there was wilfrid in hokeby to be sure  he was stupid enough about matilda but do you mean that he is like that  dont dont you dreadful child i wish i had never spoken to you cried gillian overwhelmed with confusion  you must never say a word to any living creature  i am sure i shant said mysie composedly for as far as i can see it is all stuff  this alexis never found out what fergus was about with the stone and so the mark was gone and cousin rotherwood trod on it and the poor little boy was killed but as to the rest nurse halfpenny would say it was all conceited maggots and how you can make so much more fuss about that than about the poor child being crushed i cant make out  but if i think it all my fault  thats maggots returned mysie with uncompromising commonsense you arent old enough nor pretty enough for any of that kind of stuff gill  and gillian found that either she must go without comprehension or have a great deal more implied if she turned for sympathy to any one save aunt jane who seemed to know exactly how the land lay     chapter xvi  vanished    it seemed to be a very long time before the inquest was over and aunt jane had almost yielded to her nieces impatience and her own and consented to walk down to meet the intelligence when fergus came tearing in ive seen the rock and there is a flaw of crystal lisation in it  and the coronerman called me an incipient geologist  but the verdict  they said it was accidental death and something about more care being taken and valuable lives endangered  and alexis white  oh there was a great bother about his not being there  they said it looked very bad but they could not find him  not find him  oh  where is cousin rotherwood  he is coming home and he said i might run on and tell you that if you had time to come in to the hotel he would tell you about it  with which invitation miss mohun hastened to comply gillian was ardent to come too and it seemed cruel to prevent her but besides that jane thought that her cousin might be tired enough to make his wife wish him to see as few people as possible she was not sure that gillian might not show suspicious agitation and speech and action would not be free in her presence  so the poor girl was left to extract what she could from her little brother which did not amount to much  it was a propitious moment for jane met lord rotherwood at the door of the hotel parting with mr white she entered with him and his wife after satisfying herself that he was not the worse for his exertions was not sorry that he should have his cousin to keep him quiet in his easychair while she went off to answer a pile of letters which had just been forwarded from home  well jenny he said i am afraid your protege does not come out of it very well that is if he is your protege  he must be an uncommonly foolish young man  i reserve myself on that point  but is it true that he never appeared  quite true  didnt they send for him  yes but he could not be found either at the works or at home however the first might be so far accounted for since he met at his desk a notice of dismissal from white and stebbing  no  really  concocted at that unlucky dinner yesterday  but of course it was not immediate  of course not and perhaps something might have been done for him but a man who disappears condemns himself  but what for  i hope fergus explained that the stone was not near the spot when he showed it  yes fergus spoke up like a little man and got more credit than he deserved  if they had known that of all varieties of boys the scientific is the worst imp of mischief  it all went in order due surgeon explained injuries to poor little beingmen how the stone came down and they dug him outpoor little babysister made out her sad little story  that was the worst part of all  something must be done for that childorphanage or somethingonly unluckily theres the father and mother  poor father he is the one to be pitied  i mean to get at him without the woman  well then came my turn and how i am afflicted with the habit of going where i ought not and only by a wonderful mercy was saved from being part of the general average below  then we got to the inquiry were not dangerous places railed off  yes stebbing explained that it was the rule of the firm to have the rocks regularly inspected once a month and once a fortnight in winter and spring when the danger is greater  if they were ticklish the place was marked at the moment with big stones reported and railed off  an old foremansort of fellow swore to having detected the danger and put stones  he had reported it  to whom  to mr frank  yes he thought it was mr frank just before he went away  it was this fellows business to report it and send the order it seems and in his absence alexander white or whatever they call him took his work  well the old man doesnt seem to know whether he mentioned the thing to young white or not which made his absence more unlucky but anyway the presence of the stones was supposed to be a sufficient indication of the need of the rail or to any passenger to avoid the place  in fact if master white had been energetic he would have seen to the thing  i fancy that is the long and short of it  but when the question came how the stones came to be removed i put fergus forward  the foreman luckily could identify his stone by the precious crack of spar and the boy explained how he had lugged it down and showed it to his friend far away from its placehad in fact turned over and displaced all the lot  depend upon it alexis has gone out of the way to avoid accusing fergus  dont make me start it hurts but do you really believe that jane you the commonsense female of the family  indeed i do he is a romantic sensitive sort of fellow who would not defend himself at the boys expense  whew  he might have stood still and let fergus defend him then instead of giving up his own cause  and how did it end  accidental death of course couldnt be otherwise but censure on the delay and neglect of precaution which the common opinion of the court naturally concentrated on the absent though no doubt the first omission was young stebbings but owing to the hurry of his start for italy that was easily excused  and even granting that fergus did the last bit of mischief your friend may be romantically generous if you please but he must have been very slack in his work  poor fellowyes  now before i tell you what i know about him i should like to hear how mr stebbing represents him  you know his father was a lieutenant in the royal wardours  risen from the ranks a runaway cousin of whites  yes and theres a son in a lawyers office always writing to white for money  oh  i never had much notion of that eldest  they have no particular claim on white but when the father died he wrote to stebbing to give those that were old enough occupation at the works and see that the young ones got educated  so he lets the little boys go to the national school though theres no great harm in that as yet  he meant to come and see after them himself and find out what they are made of  but meantime this youth who did well at first is always running after music and nonsense of all kinds thinking himself above his business neglecting right and left while as to the sister she is said to be very clever at designingboth ways in factso determined to draw young stebbing in that having got proof of it at last they have dismissed her too  and jane i hardly like to tell you but somehow they mix gillian up in the business  they ate it up again when i cut them short by saying she was my cousin her mother and you like my sisters  i am certain it is all nonsense but had you any notion of any such thing  it is insulting you though to suppose you had not he added as he saw her air of acquiescence so of course it is all right  it is not all right but not so wrong as all that  oh no and i know all about it from poor gill herself and the girl  happily they are both too good girls to need prying  well the case is this there was a quarrel about a love story between the two original whites who must both have had a good deal of stuff in them  dick ran away enlisted rose and was respected by jasper etc but was married to a grecohibernian wife traditionally very beautiful poor woman though rather the reverse at present  lily and her girls did their best for the young people with good effect on the eldest girl who really in looks and ways is worthy of her muses name kalliope father had to retire with rank of captain and died shortly after letters failed to reach the merrifields who were on the move  this quarry cousin was written to and gave the help he described to you perhaps it was just but it disappointed them and while the father lived alexis had been encouraged to look to getting to the university and holy orders  he has a good voice and the young curate at the kennel patronised him perhaps a little capriciously but i am not quite sure  all this was unknown to me till the merrifield children came and gillian discovering these whites flew upon them in the true enthusiastic lilyfashion added to the independence of the modern maiden mistrustful of old cats of aunts like a little goose she held trystes with kalliope through the rails at the top of the garden on sunday afternoons  only kalliope  cela va sans dire  the brother was walking the young ones on the cliffs whence she had been driven by the attentions of master frank stebbing  poor thing she is really beautiful enough to be a misfortune to her and so is the youthmaid of athens irish eyes plus intellect  gill lent books and by and by volunteered to help the lad with his greek  whew  just as she would teach a nightschool class  she used to give him lessons at his sisters office  i find that as soon as kalliope found it was unknown to me she protested and did all in her power to prevent it but gillian had written all to her mother and thought that sufficient  and lily victoria would have gone crazysupposing such a thing possible he added sotto voce  lily was probably crazy already between her sick husband and her bridal daughters for she answered nothing intelligible  however absence gave time for reflection and gillian came home after her visits convinced by her own good sense and principle that she had not acted fairly towards us so that of her own accord the first thing she did was to tell me the whole and how much the sister had always objected  she was quite willing that i should talk it over with kalliope before she went near them again but i have never been able really to do so  then it was all greek andlilyism  lilys grammar over again eh  on her side purely sobut i am afraid she did upset the boys mind  he seems to have been bitterly disappointed at what must have appeared like neglect and offenceand oh you know how silly youths can beand he had southern blood too poor fellow and he went mooning and moping about i am afraid really not attending to his business and instead of taking advantage of the opening young stebbings absence gave him of showing his abilities absolutely gave them the advantage against him by letting them show him up as an idle fellow  or worse  stebbing talked of examining the accounts to see if there were any deficiency  that can be only for the sake of prejudicing mr whitethey cannot really suspect him  if not it was very good acting and stebbing appears to me just the man to suspect a parsons pet and a ladysas he called this unlucky fellow  ask any of the workmenask mr flight  well i wish he had come to the front  it looks bad for him and your plea jenny is more like lily than yourself  thank you i had rather be like lily than myself  and you are equally sure that the sister is maligned  quite sureon good evidencethe thing is how to lay it all before mr white for you see these stebbings evidently want to prevent him from taking to his own kindredyou must help me rotherwood  when i am convinced he said  my dear jenny i beg your pardoni have an infinite respect for your sagacity but allow me to observe though your theory holds together still it has rather an ancient and fishlike smell  i only ask you to investigate and make him do so  listen to any one who knows to any one but the stebbings and you will find what an admirable girl the sister is and that the poor boy is perfectly blameless of anything but being forced into a position for which he was never intended and of all his instincts rebelling  they were interrupted by the arrival of the doctor whom lady rotherwood had bound over to come and see whether her husband was the worse for his exertions  he came in apologising most unnecessarily for his tardiness  and in the midst of miss mohuns mingled greeting and farewell she stood still to hear him say that he had been delayed by being called in to that poor woman mrs white who had had a fit on hearing the policeman inquiring for that young scamp her son  the policeman ejaculated jane in consternation  it was only to summon him to attend the inquest explained dr dagger but there was no one in the house with her but a little maid and the shock was dreadful  if he has really absconded it looks exceedingly ill for him  i believe he has only been inattentive said jane firmly knowing that she ought to go and yet feeling constrained to wait long enough to ask what was the state of the poor mother and if her daughter were with her  the daughter was sent for and seems to be an effective person uncommonly handsome by the bye  the attack was hysteria but there is evidently serious disease about her which may be accelerated  i thought so  i am afraid she has had no advice  no i promised the daughter to come and examine her tomorrow when she is calmer and if that son is good for anything he may have returned  and therewith jane was forced to go away to carry this wretched news to poor gillian  aunt and niece went as soon as the midday meal was over to inquire for poor mrs white and see what could be done  she was sleeping under an opiate and kalliope came down pale as marble but tearless  she knew nothing of her brother since she had given him his breakfast that morning  he had looked white and haggard and had not slept neither did he eat  she caught at the theory that had occurred to miss mohun that he did not like to accuse fergus for even to her he had not mentioned who had removed the stone  in that case he might return at night  yet it was possible that he did not know even now whence the stone had come and it was certain that he had been at his office that morning and opened the letter announcing his dismissal  kalliope going later had found the like notice but had had little time to dwell on it before she had been summoned home to her mother  poor mrs white had been much shaken by the first reports of yesterdays accident which had been so told to her as to alarm her for both her children and when her little maid rushed in to say that the pelis was come after mr alec it was no wonder that her terror threw her into a most alarming state which made good mrs lee despatch her husband to bring home kalliope and as the attack would not yield to the soothing of the women or to their domestic remedies but became more and more delirious and convulsive the nearest doctor was sent for and dr dagger otherwise a higher flight than would have been attempted was caught on his way and brought in to discover how serious her condition already was  this kalliope told them with the desperate quietness of one who could not afford to give way  her own affairs were entirely swallowed up in this far greater trouble and for the present there were no means of helping her  mr and mrs lee were thoroughly kind and ready to give her efficient aid in her home cares and her nursing and it could only be hoped that alexis might come back in the evening and set the poor patients mind at rest  we will try to make mr white come to a better understanding said miss mohun kindly  thank you said kalliope pushing back her hair with a half bewildered look  i remember my poor mother was very anxious about that  but it seems a little thing now  may god bless and help you my dear said miss mohun with a parting kiss  gillian had not spoken all the time but outside she saidoh aunt is this my doing  not quite said aunt jane kindly  there were other causes  oh if i could do anything  alas it is easier to do than to undo  aunt jane was really kind and gillian was grateful but oh how she longed for her mother  there was no better news the next morning  nothing had been heard of alexis and nothing would persuade his mother in her halfdelirious and wholly unreasonable state that he had not been sent to prison and that they were not keeping it from her  she was exceedingly ill and kalliope had been up all night with her  such was the report in a note sent up by mrs lee by one of the little boys early in the morning and as soon as she could reasonably do so miss mohun carried the report to lord rotherwood whom she found much better and anxious to renew the tour of inspection which had been interrupted  before long mr white was shown in intending to resume the business discussion and miss mohun was about to retreat with lady rotherwood when her cousin taking pity on her anxiety said  if you will excuse me for speaking about your family matters mr white my cousin knows these young people well and i should like you to hear what she has been telling me  a gentleman has just been calling on me about them said mr white not overgraciously  mr flight asked jane anxiously  yes a young clergyman just what we used to call puseyite when i left england but that name seems to be gone out now  anyway said jane i am sure he had nothing but good to say of miss white or indeed of her brother and i am afraid the poor mother is very ill  thats true miss mohun but you see there may be one side to a lady or a parson and another to a practical man like my partner  not but that i should be willing enough to do anything in reason for poor dicks widow and children but not to keep them in idleness or letting them think themselves too good to work  that i am sure these two do not  their earnings quite keep the family  i know no one who works harder than miss white between her business her lodgers the children and her helpless mother  i saw her mosaicsvery fair very clever some of them but im afraid she is a sad little flirt miss mohun  mr white said lord rotherwood did ever you hear of a poor girl beset by an importunate youth but his family thought it was all her fault  if mr white would see her said jane he would understand at a glance that the attraction is perfectly involuntary and i know from other sources how persistently she has avoided young stebbing giving up sunday walks to prevent meeting him accepting nothing from him always avoiding teteatetes  hum  but tell me this madam said mr white eagerly how is it that if these young folks are so steady and diligent as you would make out that eldest brother writes to me every few months for help to support them  oh jane breathed out then rallying i know nothing about that eldest  yes i do though  his sister told my niece that all the rents of the three houses went to enable richard to appear as he ought at the solicitors office at leeds  theres a screw loose somewhere plainly said lord rotherwood  the question is where it is said mr white  and all i hope said jane is that mr white will judge for himself when he has seen kalliope and made inquiries all round  i do not say anything for the mother poor thing except that she is exceedingly ill just now but i do thoroughly believe in the daughter  and this runaway scamp miss mohun  i am afraid he is a runaway but i am quite sure he is no scamp said jane  only so clever as to be foolish eh said the marquis rather provokingly  exactly so she answered and i am certain that if mr white will trust to his own eyes and his own inquiries he will find that i am right  she knew she ought to go and lord rotherwood told her afterwards that was not an illaimed shaft jane  stebbing got more than one snub over the survey  i see that white is getting the notion that theres a system of hoodwinking going on and of not letting him alone and he is not the man to stand that  if he only would call on kalliope  i suspect he is afraid of being beguiled by such a fascinating young woman  it was a grievous feature in the case to gillian that she could really do nothing  mrs white was so ill that going to see kalliope was of no use and maura was of an age to be made useful at home and there were features in the affair that rendered it inexpedient for gillian to speak of it except in the strictest confidence to aunt jane or mysie  it was as if she had touched a great engine and it was grinding and clashing away above her while she could do nothing to stay its course     chapter xvii  they come they come    dr dagger examined mrs white and pronounced that there had been mortal disease of long standing and that she had nearly if not quite reached the last stage  while people had thought her selfish weak and exacting she must really have concealed severe suffering foolishly perhaps but with great fortitude  and from hearing this sentence kalliope had turned to find at last tidings of her brother in a letter written from avoncester the nearest garrison town  he told his sister that heartbroken already at the result of what he knew to be his own presumption and horrified at the fatal consequences of his unhappy neglect he felt incapable of facing any of those whom he had once called his friends and the letter of dismissal had removed all scruples  had it not been for his faith and fear he would have put an end to his life but she need have no alarms on that score  he had rushed away scarce knowing what he was doing till he had found himself on the road to avoncester and then had walked on thither and enlisted in the regiment quartered there where he hoped to do his duty having no other hope left in life  part of this letter kalliope read to miss mohun who had come down to hear the doctors verdict  it was no time to smile at the heart being broken by the return of a valentine or all hope in life being over before twenty  kalliope who knew what the life of a private was felt wretched over it and her poor mother was in despair but miss mohun tried to persuade her that it was by no means an unfortunate thing since alexis would be thus detained safely and within reach till sir jasper arrived to take up the matter and mr white had been able to understand it  yes but he cannot come to my poor mother  and richard will be so angrythink it such a degradation  he ought not  your father  oh but he will  and i must write to him  mother has been asking for him  tell me my dear has richard ever helped you  oh no poor fellow he could not  he wants all we can send him or we would have put the little boys to a better school  i would not write before it is absolutely necessary said miss mohun  a young man hanging about with nothing to do even under these circumstances might make things harder  yes i know said kalliope with a trembling lip  and if it was urgent even alexis might come  indeed i ought to be thankful that he is safe after all my dreadful fears and not far off  miss mohun refrained from grieving the poor girl by blaming alexis for the impetuous selfish folly that had so greatly added to the general distress of his family and rendered it so much more difficult to plead his cause  in fact she felt bound to stand up as his champion against all his enemies though he was less easy of defence than his sister and mr flight the first person she met afterwards was excessively angry and disappointed speaking of such a step as utter ruin  the lad was capable of so much better things said he  i had hoped so much of him and had so many plans for him that it is a grievous pity but he had no patience and now he has thrown himself away  i told him it was his first duty to maintain his mother and if he had stuck to that i would have done more for him as soon as he was old enough and i could see what was to be done for the rest of them but he grew unsettled and impatient and this is the end of it  not the end i hope said miss mohun  it is not exactly slavery without redemption  he does not deserve it  who does  besides remember what his father was  his father must have been of the highspirited daredevil sort this lad was made for a scholarfor the priesthood in fact and the army will be more uncongenial than these marble works  foolish fellow he will soon have had enough of it with his refinement among such associates  jane wondered that the young clergyman did not regret that he had sufficiently tried the youths patience to give the sense of neglect and oblivion  there had been many factors in the catastrophe and this had certainly been one since the loan of a few books and an hour a week of direction of study would have kept alexis contented and have obviated all the perilous intercourse with gillian but she scarcely did the rev augustine flight injustice in thinking that in the aesthetic and the emotional side of religion he somewhat lost sight of the daily drudgery that works on character chiefly as a preventive  he was at the bottom of it little as he knows it she said to herself as she walked up the hill  how much harm is done by good beginnings of a skein left to tangle  lady flight provided a trained nurse to help kalliope and sent hosts of delicacies and plenty of abuse was bestowed on mr james white for his neglect  meanwhile mrs white though manifestly in a hopeless state seemed likely to linger on for some weeks longer  in the meantime miss mohun at last found an available house and was gratified by the young peoples murmur that il lido was too far off from beechcroft  but then their mother would be glad to be so near st andrews for she belonged to the generation that loved and valued daily services  lord rotherwood perhaps owing to his exertions felt the accident more than he had done at first and had to be kept very quiet which he averred to be best accomplished by having the children in to play with him and as he always insisted on sending for valetta to make up the party the edict of separation fell to the ground when lady rotherwood having written his letters for him went out for a drive taking sometimes miss elbury but more often adeline mohun who flattered herself that her representations had done much to subdue prejudice and smooth matters  which always were smooth said jane smooth and polished as a mahogany table and as easy to get into  however she was quite content that ada should be the preferred one and perhaps no one less acute than herself would have felt that the treatment as intimates and as part of the family was part of the duty of a model wife  both sisters were in request to enliven the captive and jane forebore to worry him with her own anxieties about the present disgrace of the whites  nothing could be done for kalliope in her mothers present state alexis must drink of his own brewst and sir jasper and lady merrifield were past brindisi  as to mr white he seemed to be immersed in business and made no sign of relenting jane had made one or two attempts to see him but had not succeeded  only one of her gfs maidens who was an enthusiastic admirer of kalliope and in perfect despair at her absence mentioned that mr white had looked over all their work and had been immensely struck with miss whites designs and especially with the table inlaid with autumn leaves which had been set aside as expensive unprofitable and not according to the public taste and not shown to him on his first visit to the works with mr stebbing  there were rumours in the air that he was not contented with the state of things and might remain for some time to set them on a different footing  miss adeline had been driving with lady rotherwood and on coming in with her for the afternoon cup of tea found mr white conversing with lord rotherwood evidently just finishing the subjecta readingroom or institute of some sort for the men at the works  all these things are since my time said mr white  we were left pretty much to ourselves in those days  and what do you think  should you have been much the better for them asked the marquis  some of us would was the answer  you would not have thought them a bore  there were some who would as plenty will now but we were a rough setwe had not so much to start with as the lads willy nilly have now  but i should have been glad of books and diversion free from lawlessness might have prevented poor dicks scrapes  by the bye that daughter of his can do good work  poor thing said miss adeline she is a very good girl and in great trouble  i was much pleased with her and i think she has behaved remarkably well under very trying circumstances  i observed that the young women in the mosaic department seemed to be much attached to her said mr white  my sister thinks she has been an excellent influence there  she was not there said mr white  no her mother is too ill to be leftdying i should think from what i hear  from the shock of that foolish lads evasion asked lord rotherwood  she was very ill before i believe though that brought it to a crisis  no one would believe how much that poor girl has had depending on her  i wish she had been at the worksi am sure you would have been struck with her  have you any reason to think they are in any distress miss mohun  not actually at present but i do not know what they are to do in future with the loss of the salaries those two have had said adeline exceedingly anxious to say neither too much nor too little  there is the elder brother  oh he is no help only an expense  miss mohun may i ask are you sure of that  as sure as i can be of anything  i have always heard that the rents of their two or three small houses went to support richard and that they entirely live on the earnings of the brother and sister except that you are so good as to educate the younger girl  it has come out casuallythey never ask for anything  mr white looked very thoughtful  adeline considered whether importunity would do most harm or good but thought her words might work  when she rose to take leave mr white did the same evidently thought she for the sake of escorting her home and she might perhaps say another word in confidence for the poor young people  she had much reliance and not unjustly on her powers of persuasion and she would make the most of those few steps to her own door  indeed mr white she began excuse me but i cannot help being very much interested in those young people we were speaking of  that is your goodness miss mohun  i have no doubt they are attractivetheres no end to the attractiveness of those southern folk they belong toon one side of the house at least but unfortunately you never know where to have themtheres no truth in them and though i dont want to speak of anything i may have done for them i cant get over their professing never to have had anything from me  may i ask whether you sent it through that eldest brother  certainly he always wrote to me  then mr white i cannot help believing that the family here never heard of it  do you know anything of that young man  no i will write to his firm and inquire  thank you for the hint miss mohun  they were at beechcroft cottage gate and he seemed about to see her even to the door  at that instant a little girlish figure advanced and was about to draw back on perceiving that miss adeline was not alone when she exclaimed maura is it you out so late  how is your mother  much the same thank you miss adeline  here is one of the very young folks we were mentioning said ada seeing her opportunity and glad that there was light enough to show the ladylike little figure  this is maura mr white whom you are kindly educating  mr white took the hand which was given with a pretty respectful gesture and said something kind about her mothers illness while adeline took the girl into the house and asked if she had come on any message  yes if you please said maura blushing miss mohun was so kind as to offer to lend us an aircushion and poor mamma is so restless and uncomfortable that kally thought it might ease her a little  by all means my dear  come in and i will have it brought said adeline whose property the cushion was and who was well pleased that mr white came in likewise and thus had a full view of mauras great wistful longlashed eyes and delicate refined features under a little old brown velvet cap and the slight figure in a gray ulster  he did not speak while maura answered miss adelines inquiries but when the cushion had been brought down and she had taken it under her arm he exclaimed  is she going back alone  oh yes said maura cheerfully it is not really dark out of doors yet  i suppose it could not be helped said miss adeline  no theodore is at the school  they keep him late to get things ready for the inspection and petros had to go to the doctors to fetch something but he will meet me if he is not kept waiting  it is not fit for a child like that to go alone so late said mr white who perhaps had imbibed italian notions of the respectability of an escort  i will walk down with her  maura looked as if darkness were highly preferable to such a cavalier but miss adeline was charmed to see them walk off together and when her sister presently came in with gillian and fergus she could not but plume herself a little on her achievement  then it was those two exclaimed jane  i thought so from the other side of the street but it was too dark to be certain and besides there was no believing it  did not they acknowledge you  oh no they were much too busy  talking  oh what fun adeline could not help observing in such glee that she looked more like our youngest girl than the handsome middleaged aunt  but suggested fergus somewhat astonished stebbing says he is no end of a horrid brute of a screw  indeed  what has he been doing  he only tipped him a coach wheel  well to tip over as a coach wheel is the last thing i should have expected of mr white said aunt jane misunderstanding on purpose  a crown piece then growled fergus and of course he thought it would be a sovereign and so he cant pay me my two tenshillings i mean that i lent him and so i cant get the lovely ammonite i saw at notts  how could you be so silly as to lend him any money  i didnt want to but he said he would treat us all round if i wouldnt be mean and after all i only got half a goody with all the liqueur out of it  it served you right said gillian  i doubt whether you would see the two shillings again even if he had the sovereign  he faithfully promised i should said fergus whose allegiance was only half broken  and old white is a beast and no mistake  he was perfectly savage to stebbings major and he said he wouldnt be under him at no price  perhaps mr white might say the same put in aunt ada  he is a downright old screw and a bear i tell you persisted fergus  he jawed frank stebbing like a pickpocket for just having a cigar in the quarry  close to the blasting powder eh said miss mohun  and he is boring and worrying them all out of their lives over the books added fergus  poking his nose into everything so that stebbing says his governor vows he cant stand it and shall cut the concern it the old brute does not take himself off to italy before long  what a good thing thought both sisters looking into each others eyes and auguring well for the future  all were anxious to hear the result of mauras walk and gillian set out in the morning on a voyage of discovery with a glass of jelly for mrs white but all she could learn was that the great man had been very kind to maura though he had not come in at which gillian was indignant  men are often shy of going near sickness and sorrow said her aunt ada  you did not hear what they talked about  no maura was at school and kally is a bad person to pump  i should like to pump mr white was aunt janes comment  if i could meet him again said aunt ada i feel sure he would tell me  her sister laughed a little so well did she know that little half conscious halfgratified tone of assumption of power over the other sex but miss adeline proved to be right  nay mr white actually called in the raw cold afternoon which kept her in when every one else was out  he came for the sake of telling her that he was much pleased with the little girla pretty creature and simple and true he really believed  quite artlessly in answer to his inquiries she had betrayed that her eldest brother never helped them  oh no mamma was always getting all the money she could to send to him because he must keep up appearances at his office at leeds and live like a gentleman and it did not signify about kalliope and alexis doing common work  thats one matter cleared up rejoiced jane  it wont be brought up against them now  and then it seems he asked the child about her sisters lovers  oh  it was for a purpose  dont be old maidish jenny  well he isnt a gentleman  now jane im sure  never mind  i want to hear only i should have thought you would have been the first to cry out  little maura seems to have risen to the occasion and made a full explanation as far as she knewand that was more than the child ought to have known by the byeof how mr frank was always after kally and how she could not bear him and gave up the sunday walk to avoid him and how he had tried to get her to marry him and go to italy with him but she would not hear of it  just the thing the little chatterbox would be proud of but it is no harm that mon oncle des iles philippines should know  i see his little game was what mr white said repeated adeline the young dog expected to come over me with this pretty young wife my relation too but he would have found himself out in his reckoning  so far so good but it is not fair  however the ice is broken  whats that  is the house coming down  no but gillian and valetta came rushing in almost tumbling over one another and each waving a sheet of a letter  papa and mamma would land in three days time if all went well but the pity was that they must go to london before coming to rockquay since sir jasper must present himself to the military and medical authorities and likewise see his mother who was in a very failing state  the children looked and felt as if the meeting were deferred for years but miss mohun remembering the condition of il lido alike as to the presence of workmen and absence of servants felt relieved at the respite proceeded to send a telegram to macrae and became busier than ever before in her life  the rotherwoods were just going to london  the marquis was wanted for a division and though both he and dr dagger declared his collarbone quite repaired his wife could not be satisfied without hearing for herself a verdict to the same effect from the higher authorities being pretty sure that whatever their report might be his abstract would be all right  never mind  fly had gained so much in flesh and strength and was so much more like her real self that she was to remain at the hotel with miss elbury the rooms being kept for her parents till easter  mysie was however to go with them to satisfy her mother with a first mouthful of children said lord rotherwood  gillian had better come too and we will write to the merrifields to come to us unless they are bound to the old lady  this however was unlikely as she was very infirm and her small house was pretty well filled by her attendants  lady rotherwood seconded the invitation like a good wife and gillian was grateful such a forestalling was well worth even the being the marchionesss guest and being treated with careful politeness and supervision as a girl of the period always ready to break out  however she would have mysie and she tried to believe aunt jane who told her that she had conjured up a spectre of the awful dame  there was a melancholy parting on the side of poor little lady phyllis  what shall i do without you mysie dear  it is only for a few days  yes but then you will be in a different house all down in the townit will be only visitingnot like sisters  sisters are quite a different thing said mysie stoutly but we can be the next thing to it in our hearts  it is not equal said fly  you dont make a sister of me and i do of you  because you know no better  poor fly i do wish i could give you a sister of your own  do you know mysie i thinkim quite sure that daddy is going to ask your father and mother to give you to us out and out  oh  im sure they wont do that cried mysie in consternation mamma never would  and wouldnt you  dont you like me as well as gill and val  i like you better  stop dont fly you are what people call more of a companion to memy friend but friends arent the same as sisters are they  they may be more or they may be less but it is not the same kind  and then it is not only you there are papa and mamma and all my brothers  but you do love daddy and you have not seen yours for four years and aunt florence and all the cousins at beechcroft say they were quite afraid of him  because he is so oh i dont know how to say it but he is just like epaminondas or king arthur or robert bruce or  well thats enough said fly i am sure my daddy would laugh if you said he was like all those  to be sure he would said mysie  and do you think i would give mine for him though yours is so kind and good and such fun  and im sure id rather have him than yours said fly  well thats right  it would be wicked not to like ones own father and mother best  but if they thought it would be good for you to have all my governesses and advantages and they took pity on my loneliness what then  then  oh id try to bear it said unworldly and uncomplimentary mysie  and you need not be lonely now  theres val  the two governesses had made friends and the embargo on intercourse with valetta had been allowed to drop but fly only shook her head and allowed that val was better than nothing  mysie had a certain confidence that mamma would not give her away if all the lords and ladies in the world wanted her and gillian confirmed her in that belief so that no misgiving interfered with her joy at finding herself in the train where lord rotherwood declared that the two pair of eyes shone enough to light a candle by  i feel said mysie jumping up and down in her seat like the man who said he had a bird in his bosom  or a bee in his bonnet eh said lord rotherwood while mysie obeyed a sign from my lady to moderate the restlessness of her ecstasies  it really was a bird in his bosom said gillian gravely only he said so when he was dying in battle and he meant his faith to his king  and little mysie has kept her faith to her mother said their cousin putting out his hand to turn the happy face towards him so the bird may well sing to her  in spite of parting with phyllis asked lady rotherwood  i cant help it indeed said mysie divided between her politeness and her dread of being given away it has been very nice but ones own own papa and mamma must be more than any one  so they ought said lord rotherwood and there it ended chatter in the train not being considered desirable  gillian longed to show mysie and geraldine grinstead to each other and the first rub with her hostess occurred when the next morning she proposed to take a cab and go to brompton  is not your first visit due to your grandmother said lady rotherwood  you might walk there and i will send some one to show you the way  we must not go there till after luncheon said gillian  she is not ready to see any one and bessie merrifield cannot be spared but i know mrs grinstead will like to see us and i do so want mysie to see the studio  my dear it was not a favourable my dear i had rather you did not visit any one i do not know while you are under my charge  she is phylliss husbands sister pleaded gillian  lady rotherwood made a little bend of acquiescence but said no more and departed while gillian inly raged  a few months ago she would have acted on her own responsibility if mysie would not have been too much shocked but she had learnt the wisdom of submission in fact if not in word for she growled about great ladies and exclusiveness so that mysie looked mystified  it was certainly rather dull in the only halfrevivified london house and belgrave square in lent did not present a lively scene from the windows  the liddesdales had a house there but they were not to come up till the season began and gillian was turning with a sigh to ask if there might not be some books in flys schoolroom when mysie caught the sound of a bell and ventured on an expedition to find her ladyship and ask leave to go to church  there to their unexpected delight they beheld not only bessie but a clericallooking back which after some watching they so identified that they looked at one another with responsive eyes and gillian doubted whether this were recompense for submission or reproof for discontent  very joyful was the meeting on the steps of st pauls knightsbridge and an exchange of oh how did you come here  where are you  harry had come up the day before and was to go and meet the travellers at southampton with his uncle admiral merrifield who had brought his eldest daughter susan to relieve her sister or assist her  great was the joy and eager the talk as first bessie was escorted by the whole party back to grandmammas house and then harry accompanied his sisters to belgrave square where he was kept to luncheon and lady rotherwood was as glad to resign his sisters to his charge as he could be to receive them  he had numerous commissions to execute for his vicar and gillian had to assist the masculine brains in the department of church needlework actually venturing to undertake some herself trusting to the tuition of aunt ada a proficient in the same while mysie reverently begged at least to hem the borders  then they revelled in the little paradises of books and pictures in northumberland avenue and westminster sanctuary and went to evensong at the abbey mysies first sight thereof and nearly the like to gillian since she only remembered before a longing not to waste time in a dull place instead of being in the delightful streets  it is a thing never to forget she said under her breath as they lingered in the nave  i never guessed anything could make one feel so added mysie with a little sigh of rapture  that strange unexpected sense of delight always seems to me to explain eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive said harry  mysie whispered             beneath thy contemplation            sink heart and voice opprest   oh harry cant we stay and see henry viis chapel and poets corner and edward is monument pleaded the sister  i am afraid we must not gill  i have to see after some vases and to get a lot of things at the stores and it will soon be dark  if i dont go to southampton tomorrow i will take you then  now then feet or cab  oh let us walk  it is ten times the fun  then mind you dont jerk me back at the crossings  there are few pleasures greater of their kind than that of the youthful country cousin under the safe escort of a brother or father in london streets  the sisters looked in at windows wondered and enjoyed till they had to own their feet worn out and submit to a fourwheeler  an hour of london is more than a month of rockquay or a year of silverfold cried gillian  dear old silverfold said mysie when shall we go back  by the bye said harry how about the great things that were to be done for mother  primrose is all right said mysie  the dear little thing has written a nice copybook and hemmed a whole set of handkerchiefs for papa  she is so happy with them  and you little mouse  i have done my translationnot quite well i am afraid and made the little girls clothes  i wonder if i may go and take them to her  and val has finished her crewel cushion thanks to the aunts said gillian  ferguss machine how about that  perpetual motion wasnt it  that has turned into mineralogy worse luck said gillian  gill has done a beautiful sketch of rockquay added mysie  oh dont talk of me said gillian  i have only made a most unmitigated mess of everything  but here attention was diverted by harrys exclaiming  hullo was that henderson  nonsense the wardours are at cork  he may be on leave  or retired  he is capable of it  i believe it was old fangs  the discussion lasted to belgrave square  and then sunday was spent upon memorable churches and services under the charge of harry who was making the most of his holiday  the trio went to evensong at st wulstans and a grand idea occurred to gilliancould not theodore white become one of those young choristers who had their home in the clergy house     chapter xviii  father and mother    the telegram came early on monday morning  admiral merrifield and harry started by the earliest train deciding not to take the girls whereupon their kind host to mitigate the suspense placed himself at the young ladies disposal for anything in the world that they might wish to see  it was too good an opportunity of seeing the houses of parliament to be lost and the spell of westminster abbey was upon mysie  cousin rotherwood was a perfect escort and declared that he had not gone through such a course of english history since he had taken his cousin lilias and his sister florence the same round more years ago than it was civil to recollect  he gave a sigh to the great men he had then let them see and hear and regretted the less that there was no possibility of regaling the present pair with a debate  it was all like a dream to the two girls  they saw but suspense was throbbing in their hearts all the time and qualms were crossing gillian as she recollected that in some aspects her father could be rather a terrible personage when one was wilfully careless saucy to authorities or unable to see or confess wrongdoing and the element of dread began to predominate in her state of expectation  the bird in the bosom fluttered very hard as the possible periods after the arrivals of trains came round and it was not till nearly eight oclock that the decisive halt of wheels was heard and in a few moments mysie was in the dearest arms in the world and gillian feeling the moustached kiss she had not known for nearly four long years and which was halfstrange halffamiliar  in drawingroom light there was the mother looking none the worse for her journey her clear brown skin neither sallow nor lined and the soft brown eyes as bright and sweet as ever but the father must be learnt over again and there was awe enough as well as enthusiastic love to make her quail at the thought of her record of selfwill  there was however no disappointment in the sight of the fine tall soldierly figure broad shouldered but without an ounce of superfluous flesh and only altered by his hair having become thinner and whiter thus adding to the height of his forehead and making his very dark eyebrows and eyes have a different effect especially as he was still pallid beneath the browning of many years though he declared himself so well as to be ashamed of being invalided  time was short  harry and the admiral who were coming to dinner had rushed home to dress and to fetch susan and lady merrifield was conducted in haste to her bedroom and left to the almost too excited ministrations of her daughters  it was well that attentive servants had unfastened the straps for when gillian had claimed the keys of the dear old familiar box her hand shook so much that they jingled the key would not go into the hole and she had to resign them to sober mysie who had been untying the bonnet with a kiss and answering for the health of primrose whom uncle william was to bring to london in two days time  my dear silly child said her mother surprised at gillians emotion  and the reply was a burst of tears  oh so silly so wrong  i have so wanted you  i know all about it  you told us all like an honest child  oh such dreadful thingsthe rockthe poor child killedcousin rotherwood hurt  yes yes i heard  we cant have it out now  heres papa she is upset about these misadventures added lady merrifield looking up to her husband who stood amazed at the sobs that greeted him  you must control yourself gillian he said gravely  stop that your mother is tired and has to dress  dont worry her  go if you cannot leave off  the bracing tone made gillian swallow her tears the more easily because of the familiarity of home atmosphere confidence and protection and a mute caress from her mother was a promise of sympathy  the sense of that presence was the chief pleasure of the short evening for there were too many claimants for the travellers attention to enable them to do more than feast their eyes on their son and daughters while they had to talk of other things the weddings the two families the home news all deeply interesting in their degree though not touching gillian quite so deeply as the tangle she had left at rockstone and mammas view of her behaviour even though it was pleasant to hear of phylliss beautiful home in ceylon and aletheas bungalow and how poor claude had to go off alone to rawul pindee  she felt sure that her mother was far more acceptable to her hostess than either of the aunts and that indeed she might well be so  gillians first feeling was like mysies in the morning that nothing could go wrong with her again but she must perforce have patience before she could be heard  harry could not be spared for another day from his curacy and to him was due the first teteatete with his mother after that most important change his life had yet known and in which she rejoiced so deeply  the dream of her heart she said had always been that one of her sons should be dedicated and now that the fulfilment had come in her absence it was precious to her to hear all those feelings and hopes and trials that the young man could have uttered to no other ears  sir jasper meantime had gone out on business and was to meet the rest at luncheon at his mothers house go with them to call on the grinsteads and then do some further commissions lady rotherwood placing the carriage at their disposal  as to real talk that seemed impossible for the girls they could only as mysie expressed it bask in the light of mammas eyes and after harry was gone on an errand for his vicar there were no private interviews for her  indeed the mother did not know how much gillian had on her mind and thought all she wanted was discussion and forgiveness for the follies explained in the letter the last received  of any connection between that folly and the accident to lord rotherwood of course she was not aware and in fact she had more on her hands than she could well do in the time allotted and more people to see gillian had to find that things could not be quite the same as when she had been chief companion in the seclusion of silverfold  and just as she was going out the following letter was put into her hands come by one of the many posts from rockstone   my dear gilliani write to you because you can explain matters and i want your fathers advice or cousin rotherwoods  as i was on the way to il lido just now i met mr flight looking much troubled and distressed  he caught at me and begged me to go with him to tell poor kalliope that her brother alexis is in avoncester jail  he knew it from having come down in the train with mr stebbing  the charge is for having carried away with him l15 in notes the payment for a marble cross for a grave at barnscombe  you remember that on the day of the accident poor field was taking it in the waggon when he came home to hear of his childs death  the receipt for the price was inquired for yesterday and it appeared that the notes had been given to field in an envelope  in his trouble the poor man forgot to deliver this till the morning when on his way to the office he met young white and gave it to him finding it had not been paid in nor entered in the books and knowing the poor boy to have absconded off went mr stebbing got a summons and demanded to have him committed for trial  alexis owned to having forgotten the letter in the shock of the dismissal and to having carried it away with him but said that as soon as he had discovered it he had forwarded it to his sister and had desired her to send it to the office  he did not send it direct because he could only at the moment get one postagestamp  on this he was remanded till saturday when his sisters evidence can be taken at the magistrates meeting  this was the news that mr flight and i had to take to that poor girl who could hardly be spared from her mother to speak to us and how she is to go to avoncester it is hard to say but she has no fear of not being able to clear her brother for she says she put the dirty and ragged envelope that no doubt contained the notes into another with a brief explanation addressed it to mr stebbing and sent it by petros who told her that he had delivered it  i thought nothing could be clearer and so did mr flight but unluckily kalliope had destroyed her brothers letter and had not read me this part of it so that she can bring no actual tangible proof and it is a much more serious matter than it appeared when we were talking to her  mr white has just been here whether to condole or to triumph i dont exactly know  he has written to leeds and heard a very unsatisfactory account of that eldest brother who certainly has deceived him shamefully and this naturally adds to the prejudice against the rest of the family  we argued about kalliopes high character and he waved his hand and said my dear ladies you dont understand those southern womenthe more pious devoted doves they are the blacker they will swear themselves to get off their scamps of men  to represent that kalliope is only one quarter greek was useless especially as he has been diligently imbued by mrs stebbing with all last autumns gossip and as he confided to aunt ada thinks that they take advantage of his kindness  of course mr flight and all who really know alexis and kalliope feel the accusation absurd but it is only too possible that the avoncester magistrates may not see the evidence in the same light as its weight depends upon character and the money is really missing so that i much fear their committing him for trial at the quarter sessions  it will probably be the best way to employ a solicitor to watch the case at once and i shall speak to mr norton tomorrow unless your father can send me any better advice by post  i hope it is not wicked to believe that the very fact of mr nortons being concerned might lead to the notes finding themselves  meantime i am of course doing what i can  kally is very brave in her innocence and her brothers but shut up in her mothers sickroom she little guesses how bad things are made to look or how greek and false are treated as synonymous  much love to your mother  i am afraid this is a damper on your happiness but i am sure that your father would wish to know  aunt ada tackles mr white better than i do and means if possible to make him go to avoncester himself when the case comes on so that he should at least see and hear for himselfyour affectionate aunt                                                 j m   what a letter for poor gillian  she had to pocket it at first and only opened it while taking off her hat at grandmammas house and there was only time for a blank feeling of uncomprehending consternation before she had to go down to luncheon and hear her father and uncle go on with talk about india and stokesley to which she could not attend  afterwards lady merrifield was taken to visit grandmamma and bessie gratified the girls with a sight of her special den where she wrote her stories showing them the queer and flattering gifts that had come to her in consequence of her authorship which was becoming less anonymous since her family were growing hardened to it and grandmamma was past hearing of it or being distressed  it was in bessies room that gillian gathered the meaning of her aunts letter and was filled with horror and dismay  she broke out with a little scream which brought both mysie and bessie to her side but what could they do  mysie was shocked and sympathising enough and bessie was trying to understand the complicated story when the summons came for the sisters  there were hopes of communicating the catastrophe in the carriage but no the first exclamation of oh mamma was lost  sir jasper had something so important to tell his wife about his interviews at the horse guards that the attempt to interrupt was silenced by a look and sign  it was a happy thing to have a father at home but it was different from being mammas chief companion and confidante and poor gillian sat boiling over with something very like indignation at not being allowed even to allow that she had something to tell at least as important as anything papa could be relating  she hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry that the grinsteads proved to be out of town but at any rate she might be grateful to lady rotherwood for preventing a vain expeditiona call on another old friend mrs crayon the marianne weston of early youth and now a widow as she too was out  then followed some shopping that the parents wanted to do together but at the door of the stores lady merrifield said  i have a host of things to get here for the two brides  suppose papa that you walk home with gillian across the park  it will suit you better than this fearful list  lady merrifield only thought of letting father and daughter renew their acquaintance and though she saw that gillian was in an agony to speak about something did not guess what an ordeal the girl felt it to have to begin with the father unseen for four years and whose searching eyes and grave politeness gave a sense of austerity so that trepidation was spoiling all the elation at having a father and such a father to walk with  well gillian he said we have a great deal of lee way to make up  i want to hear of poor whites children  i am glad you have had the opportunity of showing them some kindness  oh papa it is so dreadful  if you would read this letter  i cannot do so here said sir jasper who could not well make trial of his new spectacles in great george street  what is dreadful  this accusation  poor alexis  oh you dont know  the accident and allour faultmine really gasped gillian  i am not likely to know at this rate said sir jasper  i hope you have not caught the infection of incoherency from lord rotherwood do you mean his accident  yes they have turned them both off and now they have gone and put alexis in prison  for the accident  i thought it was a fall of rock  oh noi mean yesit wasnt for that but it came of that and fergus and i were at the bottom of it said gillian in such confusion that her words seemed to tumble out without her own control  how did you escape with your lives  was he misunderstanding her on purpose or giving a lesson on slipslop at such a provoking moment  perhaps he was really only patient with the daughter who must have seemed to him halffoolish but she was forced to collect her senses and say  i only meant that we were the real cause  fergus is wild about geology and took away a stone that was put to show where the cliff was unsafe  he showed the stone to alexis white who did not know where it came from and let him have it and that was the way cousin rotherwood came to tread on the edge of the precipice  what had you to do with it  ioh  i had disappointed alexis about the lessons said gillian blushing a little and he was out of spirits and did not mind what he was about  hm  but you cannot mean that this youth can have been imprisoned for such a cause  no that was about the money but of course he sent it back  he ran away when he was dismissed because he was quite in despair and did not know what he was about  i think not indeed  papa said gillian steadying her voice you must not please blame him so much for it was really very much my fault and that is what makes me doubly unhappy  did you read my last letter to mamma  yes  i understood that you thought you had not treated your aunts rightly by not consulting them about your intercourse with the whites and that you had very properly resolved to tell them all i hope you did so  indeed i did and aunt jane was very kind or else i should have had no comfort at all  was mamma very much shocked at my teaching alexis  i do not remember  we concluded that whatever you did had your aunts sanction  ah that was the point  did these young people persuade you to secrecy  oh no no kalliope protested and i overpowered her because because i was foolish and i thought aunt jane interfering  i see said sir jasper with perhaps more comprehension of the antagonism than sisterly habit and affection would have allowed to his wife  i am glad you saw your error and tried to repair it but what could you have done to affect this boy so much  how old is he we thought of him as twelve or fourteen but one forgets how time goes on and you speak of him as in a kind of superintendents position  he is nineteen  sir jasper twirled his moustache  i begin to perceive he said you rushed into an undertaking that became awkward and when you had to draw off the young fellow was upset and did not mind his business  so far i understand but you said something about prison  the worst part of the personal confession was over now and gillian could go on to tell the rest of the stebbing enmity of mr whites arrival and of the desire to keep his relations aloof from him  this is guess work said sir jasper  i think cousin rotherwood would say the same rejoined gillian and then she explained the dismissal the flight and the unfortunate consequences and that aunt jane hoped for advice by the mornings post  i am afraid it is too late for that said sir jasper looking at his watch  i must read her letter and consider  gillian gave a desperate sigh and felt more desperate when at that moment the very man they had had a glimpse of on saturday met them exclaiming in a highly delighted tone  sir jasper merrifield  any royal wardour ought to have been welcome to the merrifields but this individual had not been a particular favourite with the young people  they knew he was the son of a popular dentist who had made his fortune and had put his son into the army to make a gentleman of him and prevent him from becoming an artist  in the first object there had been very fair success but the taste for art was unquenchable and it had been the fashion of the elder half of the merrifield family to make a joke and profess to be extremely bored when fangs as they naughtily called him among themselves used to arrive from leave armed with catalogues or come in with his drawings to find sympathy in his colonels wife  gillian had caught enough from her four elders to share in an unreasoning way their prejudice and she felt doubly savage and contemptuous when she heard  yes i retired  and what are you doing now  my mother required me as long as she lived then gillian noticed that he was in mourning  i think i shall go abroad and take lessons at florence or rome though it is too late to do anything seriouslyand there are affairs to be settled first  then came a whole shoal of other inquiries and even though they actually included poor white and his family gillian was angered and dismayed at the wretch being actually asked by her father to come in with them and see lady merrifield who would be delighted to see him  what would lady rotherwood think of the liberty the displeased mood whispered to gillian  but lady rotherwood presiding over her pretty worcester teaset was quite ready to welcome any of the merrifield friends  there were various people in the room besides lady merrifield and mysie who had just come in  there was the admiral talking politics with lord rotherwood and there was clement underwood who had come with harry from the city and bessie discussing with them boys guilds and their amusements  gillian felt frantic  would no one cast a thought on alexis in prison  if he had been to be hanged the next day her secret annoyance at their indifference to his fate could not have been worse  and yet at the first opportunity harry brought mr underwood to talk to her about his choirboys and to listen to her account of the 7th standard boy a member of the most musical choir in rockquay and the highest of the high  i hope not cockiest of the cocky said mr underwood smiling our experience is that superlatives may often be so translated  i dont think poor theodore is cocky said gillian the whites have always been so bullied and sat upon  is his name theodore asked mr underwood as if he liked the name which gillian remembered to have seen on a cross at vale leston  being sat upon is hardly the best lesson in humility said harry  theres apt to be a reaction said mr underwood but the crack voice of a country choir is not often in that condition as i know too well  i was the veriest young prig myself under those circumstances  dont be too hard on cockiness said lord rotherwood who had come up to them there must be consciousness of powers  how are you to fly if you mustnt flap your wings and crow a little  on a les defauts de ses qualites put in lady merrifield  yes added mr underwood  it is quite true that needful self assertion and originality and sense of the evils around  which the old folk have outgrown and got used to said lord rotherwood  may be condemned as conceit concluded mr underwood  ay exactly as eliab knew davids pride and the naughtiness of his heart said lord rotherwood  if you wont fight your giant yourself youve no business to condemn those who feel it in them to go at him  ah we have got to the condemnation of others instead of the exaltation of self said lady merrifield  it is better to cultivate humility in ones self than other people eh said the marquis and his cousin thought though she did not say that he was really the most humble and unselfconscious man she had ever known  what she did say was it is a plant that grows best uncultivated  and if you have it not by happy nature what then said clement underwood  then i suppose you must plant it and there will be plenty of tears of repentance to water it returned she  thank you said clement  that is an idea to work upon  all very fine sighed gillian to mysie but oh how about alexis in prison  theres papa now he has got rid of fangs actually going to walk off with uncle sam and mamma has let lady rotherwood get hold of her  will nobody care for anybody  i think i would trust papa said mysie  he was not long gone and when he came back he said you may give me that letter gillian   i posted a card to tell your aunt she should hear tomorrow  all that gillian could say to her mother in private that evening consisted of oh mamma mamma but the answer was i have heard about it from papa my dear i am glad you told him  he is thinking what to do  be patient  externally awe and good manners forced gillian to behave herself but internally she was so far from patient and had so many bitter feelings of indignation that she felt deeply rebuked when she came down next morning to find her father hurrying through his breakfast with a cab ordered to convey him to the station on his way to see what could be done for alexis white  that day gillian had her confidential talk with her mothera talk that she never forgot trying to dig to the roots of her failures in a manner that only the true motherconfessor of her own child can perhaps have patience and skill for and that only when she has studied the creature from babyhood  the concatenation ending if it was so to end in the committal to avoncester jail and beginning with the interview over the rails had to be traced link by link and was almost as long as the house that jack built  and now i see said gillian that it all came of a nasty sort of antagonism to aunt jane  i never guessed how like i was to dolores and i thought her so bad  but if i had only trusted aunt jane and had no secrets she would have helped me in it all i know now and never have brought the whites into trouble  yes said lady merrifield perhaps i should have warned you a little more but i went off in such a hurry that i had no time to think  you children are all very loyal to us ourselves but i suppose you are all rather infected by the modern spirit that criticises when it ought to submit to authorities  but how can one help seeing what is amiss  as some review says how respect what does not make itself respectable  you know i dont mean that for my aunts  i have learnt now what aunt jane really ishow very kind and wise and clever and forgivingbut i was naughty enough to think her at first  well what  dont be afraid  then i did think she was fidgety and worryingalways at one and wanting to poke her nose into everything  poor aunt jane  those are the faults of her girlhood which she has been struggling against all her life  but in your time mamma would such difficulties really not have been seeni mean if she had been actually what i thought her  i think the difference was that no faults of the elders were dwelt upon by a loyal temper  to find fault was thought so wrong that the defects were scarcely seen and were concealed from ourselves as well as others  it would scarcely i suppose be possible to go back to that unquestioning state now the temper of the times is changed but i belong enough to the older days to believe that the true safety is in submission in the spirit as well as the letter  i am sure i should have found it so said gillian  and oh i hope now that papa is come the whites may be spared any more of the troubles i have brought on them  we will pray that it may be so said her mother     chapter xix  the knight and the dragon    a telegram had been received in the morning which kept valetta and fergus on the qui vive all day  valetta was an unspeakable worry to the patient miss vincent and fergus arranged his fossils and minerals  both children flew out to meet their father at the gate but words failed them as he came into the house greeted the aunts and sat down with fergus on his knee and valetta encircled by his arm  yes lilias is quite well very busy and happywith her first instalment of children  i am so thankful that you are come said adeline  jane ventured to augur that you would but i thought it too much to hope for  there was no alternative said sir jasper  i infer that you halted at avoncester  i did so i saw the poor boy  what a comfort for his sister  poor fellow  mine was the first friendly face he had seen and he was almost overcome by itand the strong face quivered with emotion at the recollection of the boys gratitude  he is a nice fellow said jane  i am glad you have seen him for neither mr white nor rotherwood can believe that he is not utterly foolish if not worse  a boy may do foolish things without being a fool said sir jasper not that this one is such another as his father  i wish he were  i suppose he has more of the student scholarly nature  yes  the enlistment which was the making of his father was a sort of moral suicide in him  i got him to tell me all about it and i find that the idea of the inquest and of having to mention you you monkey drove him frantic and the dismissal completed the business  i told them about it said fergus  quite right my boy the pity was that he did not trust to your honour but he seems to have worked himself into the state of mind when young men run amuck  i saw his colonel lydiard and the captain and sergeant of his company who had from the first seen that he was a man of a higher class under a cloud and had expected further inquiry though even from the little that had been seen of him there was a readiness to take his word  as the sergeant said he was not the common sort of runaway clerk and it was a thousand pities that he must go to the civil powerin which i am disposed to agree  what sort of man is the cousin at the marble works  a regular beast murmured fergus  i think said jane that he means to be good and upright  more than means said ada but he is cautious and says he has been so often deceived  as far as i can understand said jane there was originally desperate enmity between him and his cousin  he forgave entirely said ada and he really has done a great deal for the family who own that they have no claim upon him  yes said jane but from a distance with no personal knowledge and a contempt for the foreign mother and the pretensions to gentility  he would have been far kinder if his cousin had remained a sergeant  he only wished to try them said adeline and he always meant to come and see about them besides that eldest son has been begging of him on false pretences all along  that i can believe said sir jasper  i remember his fathers distress at his untruth in the regimental school and his foolish mother shielding him  no doubt he might do enough to cause distrust of his family but has mr white actually never gone near them as gillian told me  excepting once walking maura home said jane no but i ascribe all that to the partner mr stebbing who has had it all his own way here and seems to me to have systematically kept alexis down to unnecessarily distasteful drudgery  kalliopes talent gave her a place but young stebbings pursuit of her though entirely unrequited has roused his mothers bitter enmity and there are all manner of stories afloat  i believe i could disprove every one of them but together they have set mr white against her and he cannot see her in her office as her mother is too ill to be left  i do believe that if the case against alexis is discharged they will think she has the money  stebbing said maura changed a fivepound note put in fergus and when i told him to shut up for it was all bosh he punched me  i hope richard sent it said ada but you see the sort of report that is continually before mr whitenot that i think he believes half or is satisfiedwith the stebbings  i am sure he is not with frank stebbing said jane  i do think and hope that he is only holding off in order to judge and i think your coming may have a great effect upon him jasper  the rotherwoods had requested sir jasper to use their apartments at the hotel and he went thither to dress being received as he said by little lady phyllis with much grace and simplicity  the evening passed brightly and when the children were gone to bed their father said rather anxiously that he feared the aunts had had a troublesome charge hastily thrust on them  we enjoyed it very much said adeline politely  we were thankful to have a chance of knowing the young people added jane  i am only glad you did not come home at christmas when i was not happy about the two girls  yes valetta got into trouble and wrote a piteous little letter of confession about copying  yes but you need not be uneasy about that it was one of those lapses that teach women without any serious loss  she did not know what she was about and she told no falsehoods indeed each one of your children has been perfectly truthful throughout  that is the great point after all  lilias could hardly fail to make her children true  fergus is really an excellent little boy and gillianpoor gillian i think she really did want more experience and was only too innocent  that is what you really think said the father anxiously  yes i do said jane  if she had been a fast girl she would have been on her guard against the awkward situation and have kept out of this mess but very likely would have run into a worse one  i do not think that her elder sisters would have done like her  perhaps not but they were living in your regimental world at the age when her schoolroom life was going on  i think you have every reason to be satisfied with her tone of mind  as you said of the boy a person may commit an imprudence without being imprudent  i quite agree to that he said and indeed i see that you have managed her most wisely and obtained her affection and gratitude as indeed you have mine he added with a tone in his voice that touched jane to the core of her heart  i never heard anything like it before she said to her sister over their fire at night with a dew of pleasure in her eyes  i never liked jasper so well before  he is infinitely pleasanter and more amiable  do you remember our first visit  no it was not you who went with me it was emily  i am sure he felt bound to be on guard all the time against any young officers attentions to his poor little sisterinlaw said ada with her maidofathens look  the smallest approach brought those hawks eyes of his like a dart right through ones backbone  it all came back to me tonight and the way he used to set poor lily to scold me  so that you rejoiced to be grown old  i beg your pardon but i did my experience was when i went to help lily pack for foreign service when i suppose my ferret look irritated him for he snubbed me extensively and i am sure he rejoiced to carry his wife out of reach of all the tribe  i dare say i richly deserved it but i hope we are all mellered down as wat greenwood used to say of his brewery for the pigs  my dear what a comparison  redolent of the old court and of lily waiting for her swans nest among the reeds till her stately warrior came and made her day dreams earnest in a way that falls to the lot of few  i dont think his severity ever dismayed her for a moment there was always such sweetness in it  true knight and lady  yes  he is grown handsomer than ever too  i hope he will get those poor children out of their hobble  it is chivalrous enough of him to come down about it in the midst of all his business in london  sir jasper started the next morning with fergus on his way to school getting on the road a good deal of information mingled together about forms and strata cricket and geology  leaving his little son at mrs edgars door he proceeded to ivinghoe terrace where he waited long at the blistered door of the dilapidated house before the little maid informed him that mr richard was gone out and missus was so ill that she didnt know as miss white could see nobody but she took his card and invited him to walk into the parlour where the breakfast things were just left  down came kalliope with a wan face and eyes worn with sleeplessness but a light of hope and gratitude flashing over her features as she met the kind eyes and felt the firm hand of her fathers colonel a sort of king in the eyes of all royal wardours  my poor child he said gently i am come to see if i can help you  oh so good of you and she squeezed his hand tightly in the effort perhaps not to give way  i fear your mother is very ill  very ill said kalliope richard came last night and he let her know what we had kept from her but she is calmer now  then your brother richard is here  yes he is gone up to mr whites  he is in a solicitors office i think  will he be able to undertake the case  oh no nothe white cheek flushed and the hand trembled  there is a leeds family here and he is afraid of their finding out that he has any connection with this matter  he says it would be ruin to his prospects  then we must do our best without him sir jasper said in a fatherly voice inexpressively comforting to the desolate wounded spirit  i will not keep you long from your mother but will you answer me a few questions  your brother tells me  she looked up almost radiantly you have seen him  yes  i saw him yesterday and as she gazed as if the news were water to a thirsty soulhe sent his love and begged his mother and you to forgive the distress his precipitancy has caused  i did not think him looking ill indeed i think the quiet of his cell is almost a rest to him as he makes sure that he can clear himself  oh sir jasper how can we ever be grateful enough  never mind that now only tell me what is needful for time is short  your brother sent these notes in their own envelope he says  yes a very dirty one  i did not open it or see them but enclosed it in one of my own and sent it by my youngest brother petros  how was yours addressed  francis stebbing esq marble works and i put in a note in explanation  is the sons name likewise francis  francis james  petros delivered it  yes certainly  here they were interrupted by mauras stealing timidly in with the message that poor mamma had heard that sir jasper was here and would he be so very good as to come up for one minute and speak to her  it is asking a great deal said kalliope but it would be very kind and it might ease her mind  he was taken to the poor little bedroom full of oppressive atmosphere though the window was open to relieve the labouring breath  it seemed absolutely filled with the enormous figure of the poor dropsical woman with white ghastly face sitting pillowed up incapable of lying down  oh so good so angelic she gasped  i am sorry to see you so ill mrs white  ah tis dying i am colonel merrifieldbegging your pardon but the sight of you brings back the times when my poor captain was living and i was the happy woman  tis the thought of my poor orphans that is vexing me leaving them as i am in a strange land where their own flesh and blood is unnatural to them she cried trying to clasp her swollen hands in the excitement that brought out the irish substructure of her nature  ah colonel dear youll bear in mind their father that would have died for you and be good to them  indeed i hope to do what i can for them  they are good children sir jasper all of them even the poor boy that is in trouble out of the very warmth of his heart but tis richard who would be the credit to you if you would lend him the helping hand  where is the boy kally  he is gone to call on mr white  ah and youll say a good word for him with his cousin she pleaded and say how tis no discredit to him if things are laid on his poor brother that he never did  the poor woman was evidently more anxious to bespeak patronage for her firstborn the pride and darling of her heart than for those who might be thought to need it more but she became confused and agitated when she thought of alexis declaring that the poor boy might have been hasty and have disgraced himself but it was hard very hard if they swore away his liberty and she never saw him more and she broke into distressing sobs  sir jasper in a decided voice assured her that he expected with confidence that her son would be freed the next day and able to come to see her  its the blessing of a dying mother will be on you colonel dear oh bring him back that his mothers eyes may rest on the boy that has always been dutiful  nono dick i tell you tis no disgrace to wear the coat his father wore  wandering was beginning and she was in no condition for kalliope to leave her  the communicative maura who went downstairs with him said that richard was so angry about alexis that it had upset poor mamma sadly  and could alexis come she asked even when he is cleared  i will ask for furlough for him  oh thank youthat would do mamma more good than anything  she is so fond of richard he is her favourite but alexis is the real help and comfort  i can quite believe so  and now will you tell me where i shall find your brother who took the letter peter or petros  petros is his name but the boys call him peter  he is at school the bellevue national schoolup that street  repairing to that imposing building sir jasper knocked at the door and sent in his card by an astonished pupilteacher with a request to the master that he might speak to petros white waiting in the porch till a handsome little fellow appeared stouter rosier and more english looking than the others of his family but very dusty and rather scared  you dont remember me said sir jasper but i was your fathers colonel and i want to find some way of helping your brother  your sister tells me she gave you a letter to carry to mr stebbing  yes sir  where did you take it  to his house carrara  was it not directed to the marble works  yes but  but what  speak out my man  at the gate blake the porter was very savage and would not let us in  he said he would have no boys loafing about we had done harm enough for one while and he would set his dog at us  then you did not give him the letter  no  i wouldnt after the way he pitched into me  i didnt know if he would give it  and he wouldnt hear a word so we went up to rockstone to the house  whom did you give it to there  i dropped it into the slit in the door  you only told your sister that you delivered it  yes sir  theodore said i must not tell sister it would only vex her more to hear how every one pitches into us right and left he said with trembling lip  is theodore your next brother  yes sir  was he with you  no it was sydney grove  is he here  ordid any one else see you leave the letter  mr stebbings sonthe young one george was in the drive and slanged us for not going to the back door  that is important thank you my boy give mymy compliments to your master and ask him to be kind enough to spare this sydney grove to me for a few moments  this proved to be an amphibiouslooking boy older and rougher than petros and evidently his friend and champion  he was much less shy and spoke out boldly saying how he had gone with little peter and the porter had rowed them downright shameful but it was nothing to that there young stebbing ordering them out of the grounds for a couple of beastly cads after no good  he grove had a good mind to ha give un a good warming only twas school time and they was late as it was  everybody was down upon the whites and it was a shame when they hadnt done nothing and he didnt see as they was stuck up not he  sir jasper made a note of master groves residence and requested an interview with the master from whom he obtained an excellent character of both the whites especially theodore  the master lamented that this affair of their brother should have given a handle against them for he wanted the services of the elder one as a monitor eventually as a pupilteacher but did not know whether the choice would be advisable under the present circumstances  the boys superiority made them unpopular and excited jealousy among a certain set though they were perfectly inoffensive and they had much to go through in consequence of the suspicion that had fallen on their brother  petros and sydney should have leave from school whenever their testimony was wanted  as sir jasper walked down the street his elder sisterinlaw emerged from a tamariskflanked gateway  this is our new abode jasper she said  come in and see what you think of it  well have you had any success  he explained how the letter could be traced to mr stebbings house and then consulted her whether to let all come out at the examination before the magistrates or to induce the stebbings to drop the prosecution  it would serve them right if it all came out in public she said  but would it be well  one must not be vindictive  and to drag poor kalliope to avoncester would be a dreadful business in her mothers state  besides frank stebbing is young and it may be fair to give them a chance of hushing it up  i ought to be satisfied with clearing alexis  then i will go to the house  when shall i be likely to find mr stebbing  just after luncheon i should say  and shall i take the lawyer  i should say not  if they hope to keep the thing secret they will be the more amenable but you should have the two boys within reach let us ask for them to come up after their dinner to beechcroft  no it must not be to dinner  petros must not be sent to the kitchen and ada would expire if the other came to us  now do you like to see your house  here is macrae dying to see you  the old soldier had changed his quarters too often to be keenly interested in any temporary abode provided it would hold the requisite amount of children and had a pleasant sittingroom for his lily but he inspected politely and gratefully and had a warmly affectionate interview with macrae who had just arrived with a great convoy of needfuls from silverfold and who undertook to bring up and guard the two boys from any further impertinences that might excite master groves pugnacity  it was a beautiful day of the lamblike entrance weather of march and on the way home miss adeline was met taking advantage of the noontide sunshine to exchange her book at the library where she said i found mr white reading the papers so i asked him to meet jasper at luncheon thinking that may be useful  if sir jasper would rather have managed matters by himself he forebore to say so and he got on very well with mr white on subjects of interest but to the ladies vexation he waited to be alone before he began i have come down to see what can be done for this poor young man mr white a connection of yours i believe  a bad business sir jasper a bad business  i am sorry to hear you say so i have seen a great deal of service with his father and esteemed him very highly  ay ay very likely  i had a young mans differences with my cousin as lads will fall out but there was the making of a fine fellow in him  but it was the wife bringing in that greek taint worse even than the italian so that theres no believing a word out of any of their mouths  well the schoolmaster has just given me a high character of the younger one for truthfulness especially  all art sir jasper all art  they are deeper than your common english sort and act it out better  ill just give you an instance or two  that eldest son has been with me just now a smart young chap who swears he has been keeping his mother all this timehe has written to me often enough for help to do so  on the other hand the little sister tells me mamma always wants money to send to poor richard  then again miss mohun assures me that the elder one vows that she never encouraged frank stebbing for a moment and to his mothers certain knowledge she is keeping up the correspondence  indeed said sir jasper  and may i ask what is your opinion as to this charge  i never knew a young man enlist with fifteen pounds in his pocket  spent it by the way sir  ran through it at billiards  nothing more probable it is the way with those soberlooking lads when something upsets them  then when luck went against him enlisted out of despair  sister like all women ready to lie through thick and thin to save him most likely even on oath  however said sir jasper i can produce independent witness that the youngest boy set off with the letter for the office and the porter not admitting him carried it to the house  what became of it then  mr stebbing will have to answer that  i propose to lay the evidence before him in his own house so that he may make inquiry and perhaps find it and drop the prosecution  will you come with me  certainly sir jasper  i should be very glad to think as you do  i came prepared to act kindly by these children the only relations i have in the world but i confess that what i have seen and heard has made me fear that they at least the elder ones are intriguing and undeserving  i should be glad of any proof to the contrary  carrara was not far off and they were just in time to catch mr stebbing in his armchair looking over his newspaper before repairing to his office  mrs stebbing stood up halfflattered halffluttered at the call of this stately gentleman and was scarcely prepared to hear him say  i have come down about this affair of young whites  his father was my friend and brotherofficer and i am very anxious about him  i have been greatly disappointed in those young people sir jasper said mr stebbing uneasily  i understand that you are intending to prosecute alexis white for the disappearance of the fifteen pounds he received on behalf of the firm  exactly so sir jasper  theres no doubt that the carter field handed it to him he acknowledges as much but he would have us believe that after running away with it he returned it to his sister to send to me  where is it i ask  yes put in mrs stebbing and the girl the little one changed a fivepound note at glovers  i can account for that said mr white with somewhat of an effort i gave her one for her sister and charged them not to mention it  he certainly seemed ashamed to mention it before those who accounted it a weakness and sir jasper broke the silence by proposing to produce his witnesses  really sir jasper this should be left for the court said mr stebbing  it might be well to settle the matter in private without dragging miss white into avoncester away from her dying mother  those things are so exaggerated said the lady  i have seen her said sir jasper gravely  may i ask who these witnesses are demanded mr stebbing  two are waiting herethe messenger and his companion  another is your porter at the marble works and the fourth is your youngest son  this caused a sensation and mrs stebbing began  i am sure i cant tell what you mean sir jasper  is he in the house  yes he has a bad cold  mrs stebbing opened the door and called george and on the boys appearance sir jasper asked him  do you remember the morning of the 17th of last monththree days after the accident  i want to know whether you saw any one in the approach to the house  i dont know what day it was said the boy somewhat sulkily  you did see some one and warned them off  i saw two little catwo boys out of the town on the front door steps  did you know them  nothat is to say one was a fishermans boy  and the other  i thought he belonged to the lot of whites  should you know them again  i suppose so  will you excuse me and i will call them into the hall said sir jasper  this was effected and master george had to identify the boys after which sir jasper elicited that petros had seen the dirty envelope come out of his brothers letter and that his sister had put it into another which she addressed as he described and gave into his charge to deliver  then came the account of the way he had been refused admittance by the porter  why didnt you give him the letter demanded mr stebbing  catch us responded sydney grove rejoiced at the opportunity when what we got was get out you young rascals  petros more discreetly added  my sister wanted it to be given to mr stebbing so we went up to the house to wait for him but it got late for school and i saw the postman drop the letters into the slit in the door so i thought that would be all right  did you see him do so asked sir jasper of the independent witness  yes sir and he therepointing to georgesaw it too and  did you  ay and thought it like their impudence  that will do my boys said sir jasper  now run away  mr white put something into each paw as the door was opened and the pair made their exit  if sir jasper acted as advocate mr white seemed to take the position of judge  there can be no doubt he said that the letter containing the notes reached this house  no said mr stebbing hotly  why was i not told  who cleared the letterbox  it was the pages business but to remember any particular letter on any particular day was quite beyond him and he only stared wildly and said dun no on which he was dismissed to the lower regions  the address was francis stebbing esq said sir jasper meditatively perhaps like a spider pulling his cord  francisyour sons name  can he  mr white ill thank you to take care what you say of my son exclaimed mrs stebbing but there was a blank look of alarm on the fathers face  where is he asked mr white  he may be able to explaincourtesy and pity made the general add  no no burst out the mother  he knows nothing of it  mr stebbing cant you stand up for your own son  perhaps began the poor man his tone faltering with a terrible anxiety but his wife exclaimed hastily  he never saw nor heard of it  i put it in the fire  there was a general hush broken by mr stebbing saying slowly  youputitinthefire  yes i saw those disreputablelooking boys put it into the box  i wasnt going to have that bold girl sending billydoos on the sly to my son  under these circumstances drily said sir jasper i presume that you will think it expedient to withdraw the prosecution  certainly certainly said mr stebbing in the tone of one delivered from great alarm  i will write at once to my solicitor at avoncester  then turning on his wife how was it that i never heard this before and you let me go and make a fool of myself  how was i to know mr stebbing  you started off without a word to me and all you told me when you came back was that the young man said he had posted the letter to his sister  i should like to know why he could not send it himself to the proper place  well mrs stebbing said her husband i hope it will be a lesson to you against making free with other peoples letters  she tossed her head and was about to retire when sir jasper said  before leaving us madam in justice to my old friends daughter i should be much obliged if you would let me know your grounds for believing the letter to be what you say  whywhy sir jasper it has been going on this year or more  she has perfectly infatuated the poor boy  i am not asking about your sons sentiments but can you adduce any proof of their being encouraged  sir jasper a young man doesnt go on in that way without encouragement  what encouragement can you prove  didnt i surprise a letter from her  wellchecked the tone of triumphant conviction  a refusal yes but we all know what that means and that there must have been something to lead to itand as there was an unconvinced silencebesidesoh why every one knew of her arts  you did mr stebbing and of poor franks infatuation  it was the reason of her dismissal  i knew what you told me mrs stebbing he answered grimly not at all inclined to support her at this moment of anger  i am sure i wish i had never listened to you  i never saw anything amiss in the girls behaviour and they are all at sixes and sevens without her at the mosaic workthough she is only absent from her mothers illness at present  you of course she would not show her goings on before you said the lady  is master frank in the house put in mr white i should like to put the question before him  you cant expect a young man to make mortifying admissions exclaimed the mother and as she saw smiles in answer she added of course the girl has played the modest and proper throughout  that was her art to draw him on till he did not know what he was about  setting aside the supposed purpose said sir jasper you admit mrs stebbing that of your own knowledge miss white has never encouraged your sons attentions  nno but we all know what those girls are  fatherless and unprotected said sir jasper dependent on their own character and exertion and therefore in especial need of kind construction  good morning mrs stebbing i have learnt all that i wish to know  overpowered but not convinced mrs stebbing saw her visitors depart  and i hope her husband will give it to her well said mr white as they left the house  they looked in at beechcroft cottage with the tidings  all safe i see cried miss jane  is the money found  no mrs stebbing burnt it under the impression that it was a love letter drily said sir jasper  miss mohun led the way in the hearty fit of laughter to which the gentlemen gave way the more heartily for recent suppression and mr white added  i assure you it was as good as a play to hear sir jasper worm it out  one would think he had been bred a lawyer  and now said the general i must go and relieve that poor girls suspense  i will come with you volunteered mr white  i fully believe that she is a good girl though this business and master richards applications staggered me and this soldier fellow must be an ass if he is not a scamp  scarcely that i think said miss adelaide with her pleading smile  well discipline will be as good for him as for his father said mr white  he has done for himself but that was a nice little lad that you had uptoo good for a common national school  wherewith they departed and found that kalliope must have been on the watch for she ran down to open the door to them and the gladness which irradiated her face as sir jaspers first all right lighted up her features which were so unlike the shopgirl prettiness that mr white expected as quite to startle him  richard was in the parlour in a cloud of smoke and began to do the honours  our acknowledgments are truly due to sir jasper  mr white we are much honoured  pray be seated please to excuse  they paid little attention to him while sir jasper told as much to his sister as could well be explained as to the fate of her envelope and added  you will not be wanted at avoncester as the case will not come on i shall go and see all safe then on to town but i mean to see your brothers commanding officer and you may tell your mother that i have no doubt that he will be allowed a furlough  but sir jasper broke in richard i beg your pardon but there is a family from leeds at bellevue the nortons and imagine what it would be if they reported me as connected with a common private soldier just out of prison too  let him come to me then exclaimed mr white  in spite of appearances of disgust richard took the invitation to himself and looked amiable and gratified  thank you mr white that will obviate the difficulty  when shall i move up  you sir did you think i meant you said mr white contemptuously no i prefer a fool to a knave  mr white interposed sir jasper whatever you may have to say to richard white consider his sister  or had you not better report our success to your mother my dear  one moment said mr white  tell me young lady if you do not object what assistance have you ever received from me  you have most kindly employed us and paid for mauras education said kalliope  is that all  has nothing been transmitted through this brother  i do not understand said kalliope trembling as richard scowled at her  sir said he i always intended but unforeseen circumstances  thats enough for the present sir said mr white  i have heard all i wish and more too  sir said kalliope still trembling indeed richard is a kind son and brother  my mother is much attached to him  i am generally out all day and it is quite possible that she did not tell me all that passed between them as she knew that i did not like you to be applied to  that will do my dear said mr white  i dont want to say any more about it  you shall have your brother tomorrow if sir jasper can manage it  i will bring him back to rockstone as my guest so that his brother need not be molested with his company     chapter xx  ivinghoe terrace    on an eastwindy friday afternoon valetta and fergus were in a crowning state of ecstasy  rigdum funnidos was in a hutch in the small garden under the cliff begum and two small gray kittens were in a basket under the kitchen stairs aga was purring under everybodys feet cocky was turning out the guard upon his perchin short il lido was made as like silverfold as circumstances would permit  aunt ada with miss vincent was sitting on the sofa in the drawingroom with a newlyworked cosy like a giants fez over the teapot and valettas crewel cushion fully displayed  she was patiently enduring a rush in and out of the room of both children and quiz once every minute and had only requested that it should not be more than once and that the door should neither be slammed nor left open  macrae and the silverfold carriage were actually gone to the station and oh oh oh here it really was with papa on the box and heaps of luggage and here were primrose and gillian and mamma and mrs halfpenny all emerging one after another and primrose lookingoh dear more like a schoolroom than a nursery girlsuch a great piece of black leg below the little crimson skirt but the dear little face as plump as ever  that was the first apparent fact after the disengaging from the general embrace when all had subsided into different seats and aunt jane who had appeared from somewhere in her little round sealskin hat had begun to pour out the tea  the first sentence that emerged from the melee of greetings and intelligence was  fly met her mother at the station how well she looks  then victoria came down with you  yes i am glad we went to her  i really do like her very much  then primrose and valetta varied the scene by each laying a kitten in their mothers lap and begum jumping after her progeny brushed lady merrifields face with her bushy tail interrupting the information about names  come children said sir jasper thats enough take away the cats  it was kindly said but it was plain that liberties with mamma would not continue before him  the whites was gillians question as she pressed up to aunt jane  poor mrs white died the night before last was the return  i have just come from kally  she is in a stunned state nowactually too busy to think and feel for the funeral must be tomorrow  sir jasper heard and came to ask further questions  she saw alexis went on miss mohun  they dressed him in his own clothes and she seemed greatly satisfied when he came to sit by her and had forgotten all that went before  however the end came very suddenly at last and all those poor children show their southern nature in tremendous outbursts of griefall except kalliope who seems not to venture on giving way will not talk or be comforted and is as it were dried up for the present  the big brothers give way quite as much as the children in gusts that is to say  poor alexis reproaches himself with having hastened it and i am afraid his brother does not spare him  but mr white has bought his discharge  you dont mean it  yes whether it was the contrast between alexiss air of refinement and his private soldiers turnout or the poor fellows patience and submission or the brothers horrid behaviour to him mr white has taken him up and bought him out  all because of richards brutal speech  that is good  though i confess i should have let the lad have at least a years discipline for his own good since he had put himself into it but i cant be sorry  there is something engaging about the boy  and mr white is the right man to dispose of them  no more passed for here were the children eager and important doing the honours of the new house and intensely happy at the sense of home which with them depended more on persons than on place  one schoolroom again said mysie  one again with val and prim and miss vincent  oh it is happiness  even mrs halfpenny was a delightful sight perhaps the more so that her rightful dominion was over the nursery was no more and she was only to preside in the workroom be generally useful wait on my lady and look after primrose as far as was needful  the bustle and excitement of settling in prevented much thought of the whites even from gillian during that evening and the next morning and she was ashamed of her own oblivion of her friend in the new current of ideas when she found that her father meant to attend the funeral out of respect to his old fellowsoldier  rockquay had outgrown its churchyard and had a cemetery half a mile off so that people had to go in carriages  mr white had made himself responsible for expenses and thus things were not so utterly dreary as poverty might have made them  it was a dreary gusty march day with driving rushes of rain which had played wildly with gillians waterproof while she was getting such blossoms and evergreen leaves as her aunts garden afforded not out of love for the poor queen of the white ants herself but thinking the attention might gratify the daughters and her elders moralised a little on the use and abuse of wreaths and how the manifestation of tender affection and respect had in many cases been imitated in empty and expensive compliment  the world spoils everything with its coarse finger said lady merrifield  i hope the custom will not be exaggerated altogether out of fashion said jane  it is a real comfort to poor little children at funerals to have one to carry and it is as mrs gaskells margaret said of mourning something to prevent settling to doing nothing but crying besides that afterwards there is a wholesome sweetness in thus keeping up the memory  sir jasper shared a carriage with mr white and returned somewhat wet and very cold and saying that it had been sadly bleak and wretched for the poor young people who stood trembling so far as he could see and he was anxious to know how the poor girls were after it  it had seemed to him as if kalliope could scarcely stand  he proved to be right  kalliope had said nothing not wept demonstratively perhaps not at all but when the carriage stopped at the door she proved to be sunk back in her corner in a dead faint she was very long in reviving and no sooner tried to move than she swooned again and this time it lasted so long that the doctor was sent for  miss mohun arrived just as he had partially restored her and they had a conversation  they must get that poor girl to bed as soon as it is possible to undress her he said  i have seen that she must break down sooner or later and im afraid she is in for a serious illness but as yet there is no knowing  nursing was not among janes accomplishments except of her sister adas chronic though not severe ailments but she fetched mrs halfpenny as the most effective person within reach trusting to that good womans scotch height strong arms great decision and the tenderness which real illness always elicited  nor was she wrong  not only did mrs halfpenny get the half unconscious girl into bed but she stayed till evening and then came back to snatch a meal and say  my leddy if you have no objection i will sit up with that puir lassie the night  they are all menfolk or bairns there except the lodgerlady who is worn out with helping the mother and they want some one with a head on her shoulders  lady merrifield consented with all her heart but the sunday mornings report was no better when mrs halfpenny came home to dress primrose and see her lady  that eldest brother set him up the idle loon was off by the mail train that night and naething wad serve him but to come in and bid goodbye to his sister just as i had gotten her off into something more like a sleep  it startled her up and she went off her head again poor dearie and began to talk about prison and disgrace and what not till she fainted again and when she came to i was fain to call the other lad to pacify her for i could see the trouble in her puir een though she could scarce win breath to speak  is alexis there  surely he is my leddy hes no the lad to leave his sister in sic a strait  it was all i could do to gar him lie down when she dozed off again but theres sair stress setting in for all of them puir things  i have sent the little laddie off to beg the doctor to look in as soon as he can for i am much mistaken if there be not fever coming on  indeed  and what can those poor children do  thats what im thinking my leddy  and since tis your pleasure that the nursery be done awa wi and i have not taen any fresh work i should like weel to see the puir lassie through wi it yell no mind that captain white and my puir halfpenny listed the same time and always forgathered as became douce lads  the twa of them got their stripes thegither and when halfpenny got his sunstroke in that weary march twas white who gave him his last sup of water and brought me his bit bible  so id be fain to tend his daughter in her sickness if you could spare me my leddy and id aye rin home to dress missie primrose and pit her to bed and see to matters here  theres no better nurse in the world dear old halfpenny said lady merrifield with tears in her eyes  i do feel most thankful to you for proposing it  never mind about primrose only you must have your meals and a good rest here and not knock yourself up  mrs halfpenny smiled grimly at the notion of her being sooner knocked up than a steamengine  dr dagger entirely confirmed her opinion that poor kalliope was likely to have a serious illness low nervous fever and failing action of the heart no doubt from the severe strain that she had undergone more or less for many months and latterly fearfully enhanced by her mothers illness and the shock and suspense about alexis all borne under the necessity of external composure and calmness so that even mrs lee had never entirely understood how much it cost her  the doctor did not apprehend extreme danger to one young and healthy but he thought much would depend on good nursing and on absolute protection from any sort of excitement so that such care as mrs halfpennys was invaluable since she was well known to be a dove to a patient but a dragon to all outsiders  every one around grieved at having done so little to lighten these burthens and having even increased them her brother alexis above all but on the other hand he was the only person who was of any use to her or was suffered to approach her since his touch and voice calmed the recurring distress lest he were still in prison and danger  alexis went back dutifully on the monday morning to his post at the works  the young man was much changed by his fortnights experiences or rather he had been cured of a temporary fit of distraction and returned to his better self  how many discussions his friends held about him cannot be recorded but after a conversation with mr flight with whom he was really more unreserved than any other being except kalliope this was the understanding at which miss mohun and lady merrifield arrived as to his nature and character  refined studious and sensitive thoroughly religiousminded and of a high tone of thought his aspirations had been blighted by his fathers death his brothers selfishness and his mothers favouritism  in a brave spirit of selfabnegation he had turned to the uncongenial employment set before him for the sake of his family and which was rendered specially trying by the dislike of his fellows to the gentleman cove and the jealousy of the stebbings  alike for his religious and his refined habits he had suffered patiently as mr flight had always known more or less and now bore testimony the curate who had opened to him the first door of hope and comfort had in these weeks begun to see that the apparent fitfulness of his kindness had been unsettling  then came the brief dream of felicity excited by gillian and the darkness of its extinction just as frank stebbings failure and the near approach of mr white had made the malice of his immediate superiors render his situation more intolerable than ever  there was the added sting of selfreproach for his presumption towards gillian and the neglect caused by his fit of low spirits  such a sensitive being in early youth wearied and goaded on all sides might probably have persevered through the darkness till daylight came but the catastrophe the dismissal and the perception that he could only defend himself at the expense of his idols little brother all exaggerated by youthful imagination were too much for his balance of judgment and he fled without giving himself time to realise how much worse he made it for those he left behind him  of course he perceived it all now and the more bitterly from his sisters wanderings but the morbid exaggeration was gone  the actual taste of a recruits life had shown him that there were worse things than employment at the quarries with his home awaiting him and his cell had been a place of thought and recovery of his senses he had never seriously expected conviction and sir jaspers visit had given him a spring of hopeful resignation in which thoughts stirred of doing his duty and winning his way after his fathers example and taking the trials of his military life as the just cross of his wrongdoing in entering it  his liberation and mr whites kindness had not altered this frame he was too unhappy to feel his residence in the great house anything but a restraint he could not help believing that he had hastened his mothers death and could only bow his head meekly under his brothers reproaches alike for that and for his folly and imprudence and the disgrace he had brought on the family  and now youll be currying favour and cutting out every one else had been a sting which added fresh force to alexiss desire to escape from his kinsmans house to sleep at home as soon as his brother had gone and richard had seen enough of sir jasper and of mr white to be anxious to return to his office at leeds as soon as possible and to regulate his affairs beyond their reach  alexis knew that he had avoided a duty in not working out his three months term and likewise that his earnings were necessary to the family all the more for his sister being laid aside  he knew that he hardly deserved to resume his post and he merely asked permission so to do and it was granted at once but curtly and coldly  mr flight had asked if he had not found the going among the other clerks very trying  i had other things to think of said alexis sadly then recalling himself  yes jones did sneer a little but the others stopped that  they knew i was down you see  and you mean to go on  if i may  that and for my sister to get better is all i can dare to hope  my madness and selfishness have shown me unworthy of all that i once dreamt of  in that resolution it was assuredly best to leave him only giving him such encouragement and sympathy as might prevent that more dangerous reaction of giving up all better things and sir jasper impressed on mr flight the only friend who could have aided him in fulfilling his former aspirations that mr white had in a manner purchased the youth by buying his discharge and that interference would not only be inexpedient but unjust  the young clergyman chafed a little over not being allowed to atone for his neglect but sir jasper was not a person to be easily gainsayed  nor could there be any doubt that mr white was a good man though in general so much inclined to reserve his hand that his actions were apt to take people by surprise at last as they had never guessed his intentions and he had a way of sucking peoples brains without in the least letting them know what use he meant to make of their information  the measures he was taking for the temporal intellectual and spiritual welfare of the people at the works would hardly have been known except for the murmurs of mrs stebbing although without their knowing what he was about with them mr stebbing himself mr hablot miss mohun to say nothing of alexis the foremen and the men and their wives had given him the groundwork of his reforms meantime he came daily to inquire for kalliope and lavished on her all that could be an alleviation greatly offending mrs halfpenny by continually proffering the services of a hospital nurse  a silly tawpie that would be mair trouble than half a dozen sick as she chose to declare  she was a born autocrat and ruled as absolutely in no l as in her nursery ordering off the three young ones to their schools in spite of mauras remonstrances and appeals to lady merrifield who agreed with nurse that the girl was much better away and occupied than where she could be of very little use  indeed mrs halfpenny banished every one from the room except mrs lee and alexis whom she would allow to take her place while she stalked to il lido for her meals and the duties she would not drop as to rest she always in times of sickness seemed to be made of cast iron and if she ever slept at all it was in a chair while alexis sat by his sister in the evening  the fever never ran very high but constant vigilance was wanted from the extreme exhaustion and faintness  there was no violent delirium but more of delusion and distress nor was it easy to tell when she was conscious or otherwise for she hardly spoke and as yet the doctor forbade any attempt to rouse her more than was absolutely needful  they were only to give nourishment watch her and be patient  a few months ago gillian would have fussed herself into a frantic state of anxiety and selfreproach but her parents when her mother had once heard as much outpouring as she thought expedient would not permit what sir jasper called perpetual harping  you have to do your duties all the same and not worry your mother and all the family with your feelings he said  she thought it very unkind and went away crying  nobody could hinder her from thinking about kalliope she said to herself and think she did at her prayers and when the bulletins came in but the embargo on discussion prevented her from being so absolutely engrossed as in weaker hands she might have been and there was a great deal going on to claim her attention  for one thing the results of the cambridge examination showed that while emma norton and a few others had passed triumphantly she had failed and conscience carried her back to last autumns disinclination to do just what aunt jane especially recommended  she cried bitterly over the failure for she had a feeling that success there would redeem her somewhat in her parents eyes but here again she experienced the healing kindness of her father  he would not say that he should not have been much pleased by her success but he said failure that taught her to do her best without perverseness was really a benefit and as arithmetic and mathematics had been her weakest points he would work at them with her and mysie for an hour every morning  it was somewhat formidable but the girls soon found that what their father demanded was application and that inattention displeased him much more than stupidity  his smile though rare was one of the sweetest things in the world and his approbation was delightful and gave a stimulus to the entire days doings  mysie was more than ever in dread of being handed over to the rotherwoods though her love for poor fly and pity for her solitude were so strong  she would have been much relieved if she had known what had passed when the offer was seriously made lord rotherwood insisted that his wife should do it  then they will believe in it he said  i do not know why you should say that she returned always dutifully blinding herself to that which all their intimates knew perfectly well  however perhaps from having a station and dignity of her own together with great simplicity lady merrifield had from her first arrival got on so well with her hostess as not quite to enter into janes sarcastic descriptions of her efforts at cordiality and it was with real warmth that lady rotherwood begged for mysie as a permanent companion and adopted sister to phyllis who was to be taken back to london after easter and in the meantime spent every possible moment with her cousins  tears at the unkindness to lonely fly came into lady merrifields eyes as she said  i cannot do it victoria i do not think i ought to give away my child even if i could  it is not only our feelings added sir jasper but it is our duty to bring up our own child in her natural station and though we know she would learn nothing but good in your family i cannot think it well that a girl should acquire habits and be used to society ways and of life beyond those which she can expect to continue  they both cried out at this lord rotherwood with a halting declaration of perfect equality which his lady seconded with a dexterous reference to connections  we will not put it on rank then said sir jasper but on wealth with you maria must become accustomed to much that she could not continue and had better not become natural to her  i know there are great advantages to manners and general cultivation in being with you and we shall be most thankful to let her pay long visits and be as much with phyllis as is consistent with feeling her home with us but i cannot think it right to do more  but with introductions pleaded lady rotherwood she might marry well  with her family and connections she would be a match for any one  i hope so said sir jasper but at the same time it would not be well for her to look on such a marriage as the means of continuing the habits that would have become second nature  poor mysie exclaimed lord rotherwood bursting out laughing at the idea and at lady merrifields look as she murmured my mysie  you misunderstand me said the marchioness composedly  i was as far as possible from proposing marriage as a speculation for her  i know you were said sir jasper  i know you would deal by maria as by your own daughter and i am very grateful to you lady rotherwood but i can only come back to my old decision that as providence did not place her in your rank of life she had better not become so accustomed to it as to render her own distasteful to her  exactly what i expected said lord rotherwood  yes returned his wife with an effort of generosity and i believe you are right jasper though i am sorry for my little solitary girl and i never saw a friend so perfectly suitable for her as your mysie  they may be friends still said lord rotherwood and we will be grateful to you whenever you can spare her to us  perhaps added sir jasper all the more helpful friends for seeing different phases of life  and said his wife with one of her warm impulses i do thank you victoria for so loving my mysie  as if any one could help it after last winter said that lady and an impromptu kiss passed between the two mothers much to the astonishment of the marquis who had never seen his lady so moved towards any one  the merrifields were somewhat on the world for sir jasper on going to silverfold and corresponding with the trustees of the landlord had found that the place could not be put in a state either of repair or sanitation such as he approved without more expense than either he or the trustees thought advisable and he decided on giving it up and remaining at il lido till he could find something more suitable  the children who had been there during the special homemaking age bewailed the decision and were likely always to look back on silverfold as a sort of paradise but the elder ones had been used to changes from infancy and had never settled down and their mother said that place was little to her as long as she had her jasper by her side and as to the abstract idea of home as a locality that would always be to her under the tuliptree and by the pond at the old court at beechcroft just as her abstract idea of church was in the old family pew with the carved oak panels before the restoration in which she had been the most eager of all  thus a fortnight passed and then the fever was decidedly wearing off but returning at night  kalliope still lay weak languid silent fainting at any attempt to move her not apparently able to think enough to ask how time passed or to be uneasy about anything simply accepting the cares given to her and lying still  one morning however alexis arrived in great distress to speak to sir jasper not that his sister was worse as he explained but richard had been selling the house  the younger ones at home had never troubled themselves as to whose property the three houses in ivinghoe terrace were  perhaps kalliope knew but she could not be asked but the fact was that captain white had been so lost sight of that he had not known that this inheritance had fallen to him under the will of his grandfather who was imbecile at the time of his flight  on his deathbed the captain had left the little he owned to his wife and she had died intestate as richard had ascertained before leaving home so that he as eldest son was heir to the ground  he had written to kalliope a letter which alexis had opened informing her that he had arranged to sell the houses to a mr gudgeon letting to him their own till the completion of the legal business necessary and therefore desiring his brothers and sisters to move out with their lodgers if not by lady day itself thus giving only a weeks spare notice at latest by old lady day  is he not aware of your sisters state  i do not imagine that he has read the letter that i wrote to him he was very much displeased with me and somewhat disposed to be angry at my sisters fainting and to think that we were all trying to work on his feelings  he used to be rather fond of maura so i told her to write to him but he has taken no notice and he can have no conception of kalliopes condition or he would not have addressed his letter to her  i came to ask if you would kindly write to him how impossible it is to move her  you had better get a certificate from dr dagger  either i or lady merrifield will meet him and see to that  that will serve both to stay him and the purchaser  that is another misfortune  this gudgeon is the chief officer or whatever they call it of the salvation army  i knew they had been looking out for a place for a barracks and could not get one because almost everything belongs to lord rotherwood or to mr white  sir jasper could only reply that he would see what could be done in the matter and that at any rate kalliope should not be disturbed  accordingly lady merrifield repaired to ivinghoe terrace for the doctors visit and obtained from him the requisite certificate that the patient could not be removed at present  he gave it saying however to lady merrifields surprise that though he did not think it would be possible to remove her in a weeks time yet after that he fully believed that she would have more chance of recovering favourably if she could be taken out of the small room and the warm atmosphere beneath the cliffsthough of course all must depend on her state at the time  meantime there was a council of the gentlemen about outbidding the salvation army  lord rotherwood was spending already as much as he could afford in the days of agricultural depression on the improvements planned with mr white  that individual was too good a man of business to fall as he said into the trap and make a present to that scamp richard of more than the worth of the houses and only mr flight was ready to go to any cost to keep off the salvation army but the answer was curt  richard knew he had no chance with mr white and did not care to keep terms with him  mr richard white begs to acknowledge the obliging offer of the rev augustine flight and regrets that arrangements have so far progressed with mr gudgeon that he cannot avail himself of it  was this really regret or was the measure out of spite  only the widest charity could accept the former suggestion and even sir jasper merrifields brief and severe letter and dr daggers certificate did not prevent a letter to alexis warning him not to make their sisters illness a pretext for unreasonable delay  what was to be done  kalliope was still unfit to be consulted or even informed and she had been hitherto so entirely the real head and manager of the family that alexis did not like to make any decision without her and even the acceptance of the st wulstans choristership for theodore had been put off for her to make it look to his outfit and all that only the woman of the family could do for them  and here they were at a loss for a roof over their heads and nowhere to bestow the battered old furniture of which richard magnanimously renounced his sixth share while she who had hitherto toiled thought managed and contrived for all the other four without care of their own still lay on her bed sensible indeed and no longer feverish but with the perilous failure of heart renewed by any kind of exertion or excitement a sudden movement or a startling sound in the street and mrs halfpenny guarding her as ferociously as ever and looking capable of murdering any one of her substitutes if they durst hint a word of their perplexities  happily she asked no questions she was content when allowed to be kissed by the others and to see they were well  nature was enforcing repose and so far her senses was all as in a dream bound up  alexis remembered that it had been somewhat thus at leeds when after nursing all the rest she had succumbed to the epidemic but then the mother had been able to watch over her and had been a more effective parent to the rest than she had since become  the first practical proposal was mrs lees  they thought of reversing the present position and taking a small house where their present hosts might become their lodgers  moreover miss mohun clenched the affair about theodore and overcame alexiss scruples while lady merrifield having once or twice looked in and been smiled at and thanked by kalliope undertook to prepare her for his farewell  alexis and maura both declared that she would instantly jump up and want to begin looking over his socks but she got no further than  dear boy  it is the sort of thing i always wished for him  people are very good  but his things  oh yes dearie ye need not fash yourself  ive mended them as i sat by you and packed them all  lie still  they are all right  there was an atmosphere of the royal wardours about mrs halfpenny which was at once congenial and commanding and kalliopes mind at once relinquished the burthen of socks shirts and even the elbows of the outgrown jacket nor did any of the family ever know how the deficiencies had been supplied  and when theodore well admonished came softly and timidly for the parting kiss his face quivering all over with the effort at self control she lay and smiled but with a great crystal tear on each dark eyelash and her thin transparent fingers softly stroked his cheeks as the low weak voice said  be a good boy dearspeak truth  praise god well  write ill write when i am better  it was the first time she had spoken of being better and they told theodore to take comfort from it when all the other three walked him up to the station     chapter xxi  beauty and the beast    in the search for a new abode mrs lee was in much difficulty for it was needful to be near st kenelms and the only vacant houses within her means were not desirable for the reception of a feeble convalescent moreover mr gudgeon grumbled and inquired and was only withheld by warnings enhanced by the police from carrying the whole charivari of the salvation army along ivinghoe terrace on sunday afternoon  perhaps it was this perhaps it was the fact of having discussed the situation with the two miss mohuns that made mr white say to alexis there are two rooms ready for your sister as soon as dagger says she can be moved safely  the person who nurses her had better come with her and you may as well come back to your old quarters  alexis could hardly believe his ears but mr white waved off all thanks  the mohun sisters were delighted and triumphant and jane came down to talk it over with her elder sister auguring great things from that man who loved to deal in surprises  that is true said sir jasper  what does that mean jasper said his wife  it sounds significant  i certainly should not be amazed if he did further surprise us all has it never struck you how that noontide turn of adelines corresponds with his walk home from the readingroom  lady merrifield looked rather startled but jane only laughed and said my dear jasper if you only knew ada as well as i do  yes i have seen far too many of those little affairs to be taken in by them  poor ada  i know exactly how she looks but she is only flattered like a pussycat waggling the end of its tailit means nothing and never comes to anything  the thing that is likely and hopeful is that he may adopt those young people as nephews and nieces  might it not spoil them said lady merrifield  oh  i did not mean that  they might work with him still  however there is no use in settling about that  the only thing to be expected of him is the unexpected  and the thing to be done added her sister is to see how and when that poor girl can be got up to cliff house  to the general surprise dr dagger wished the transit to take place without loss of time  a certain look of resigned consternation crossed kalliopes face on being informed of her destiny but she justified mrs halfpennys commendation of her as the maist douce and conformable patient in the world for she had not energy enough even to plead against anything so formidable and she had not yet been told that ivinghoe terrace was her home no longer  the next day she was wrapped in cloaks and carried downstairs between her brother and mrs halfpenny laid on a mattress in the merrifield waggonette which went up the hill at a foots pace and by the same hands with her old friend the caretakers wife going before was taken upstairs to a beautiful large room with a window looking out on vernal sky and sea  she was too much exhausted on her arrival to know anything but the repose on the fresh comfortable bed whose whiteness was almost rivalled by her cheek and mrs halfpenny ordered off alexis who was watching her in great anxiety  however when he came back after his afternoons work it was to find that she had eaten and slept and now lay with her eyes open in quiet interested admiration of a spacious and pleasant bedroom such as to be a great novelty to one whose life had been spent in cheap lodging houses  the rooms had been furnished twenty years before as a surprise intended for the wife who never returned to occupy them and though there was nothing extraordinary in them there was much to content the eyes accustomed to something very like squalidness for had not kalliopes lot always been the least desirable chamber in the family quarters  at any rate from that moment she began to recover ate with appetite slept and woke to be interested and to enjoy theodores letter of description of st wulstans and even to ask questions alexis was ready to dance for joy when she first began really to talk to him and could not forbear imparting his gladness to the miss mohuns that very evening as well as to mr white and running down after dinner with the good news to maura mrs lee and lady merrifield  dinners with mr white had on his first sojourn in that house been a great penance though there were no supercilious servants for all the waiting was by the familiar housekeeper mrs osborne who had merely added an underling to her establishment on her masters return but alexis then had been utterly miserable feeling guilty and ashamed as one only endured on sufferance out of compassion because his brother cast him out and fresh from the sight of his mothers dying bed a terrible experience altogether which had entirely burnt out and effaced his foolish fit of romantic calflove and rendered him much more of a man  now though not a month had passed he seemed to be on a different footing  he was doing his work steadily and the hope of his sisters recovery had brightened him  mr white had begun to talk to him to ask him questions about the doings of the day and to tell him in return some of his own experiences in italy and in the earlier days of the town maura came up to see her sister every day and tranquillised her mind when the move was explained and anxiety as to the transport of all their worldly goods began to set in  mrs lee had found a house where she could place two bedrooms and a sittingroom at the disposal of the whites if things were to continue as before and no hint had been given of any change or of what was to happen when the three months notice given to kalliope and alexis should have expired  by the easter holidays mrs halfpenny began to get rather restless as to the overlooking of the boys wardrobes and indeed she thought so well of her patients progress as to suggest to mr white that the lassie would do very well if she had her sister to be with her in the holidays and she herself would come up every day to help at the getting up for kalliope was now able to be dressed and to lie on a couch in the dressingroom where she could look out over the bay and she had even asked for some knitting  and really miss gillian you could not do her much harm if you came up to see her said the despot  so you may come this very afternoon if yell be douce and not fash her with any of your cantrips  gillian did not feel at all in a mood for cantrips as she slowly walked up the broad staircase and was ushered into the dressing room cheerful with bright fire and april sunshine and with a large comfortable sofa covered with a bright rug where kalliope could enjoy both window and fire without glare  the beauty of her face so much depended on form and expression that her illness had not lessened it  gillian had scarcely seen her since the autumn and the first feeling was what an air of rest and peace had succeeded the worn harassed look then almost perpetual  there was a calmness now that far better suited the noble forehead dark pencilled eyebrows and classical features in their clear paleness and with a sort of reverence gillian bent over her to kiss her and give her a bunch of violets  then when the thanks had passed gillian relieved her own shyness by exclaiming with admiration at a beautiful watercoloured copy of an early italian fresco combining the nativity and adoration of the magi that hung over the mantelpiece  is it not exquisite returned kalliope  i do so much enjoy making out each head and dwelling on them  look at that old shepherds simple wonder and reverence and the little child with the lamb and the contrast with the wise man from the east whose eyes look as if he saw so much by faith  can you see it from there asked gillian who had got up to look at these and further details dwelt on by kalliope  yes  not at first but they come out on me by degrees  it is such a pleasure and so kind of mr white to have put it there  he had it hung there mrs halfpenny told me instead of his own picture just before i came in here  well he is not a badlooking man but it is no harm to him or his portrait to say that this is better to look at  it quite does me good  and see pointing to a photograph of the arch of titus hung on the screen that shielded her from the door he sends in a fresh one by alexis every other day  how very nice  he really seems to be a dear old man  dont you think so  i am sure he is wonderfully kind but i have only seen him that once when he came with sir jasper and then i knew nothing but that when sir jasper was come things must go right  of course but has he never been to see you now that you are up and dressed  no he lavishes anything on me that i can possibly want but i have only seen him oncenever here  it is like beauty and the beast  oh no no  dont say that  well george stebbing really taught fergus to call him a beast and youkallyi wont tease you with saying what you are  i wish i wasnt it would be all so much easier  never mind  i do believe the stebbings are going away  does maura never see him  she has met him on the stairs and in the garden but she has her meals here  i trust by the time her easter holidays are over i may be fit to go back with her  but i do hope i may be able to copy a bit of that picture first though any way i can never forget it  to go on as before exclaimed gillian with an interrogative sigh of wonder  if that notice of dismissal can be revoked said kalliope  but would you like itmust you  i should like to go back to my girls said kalliope and things come into my head now i am doing nothing that i want to work out if i might  so you see it is not at all a pity that i must  and why is it must said gillian wistfully  you have to get well first  yes i know that but you see there are maura and petros  they must not be thrown on alexis poor dear fellow  and if he could only be set free he might go on with what he once hoped for though he thinks it is his duty to give all that entirely up now and work obediently on  but i know the longing will revive and if i only could improve myself and be worth more it might still be possible  only you must not begin too soon and work yourself to death  hardly after such a rest said kalliope  it is not work i mind but worryand then a sadder look crossed her for a moment and she added i am so thankful  thankful echoed gillian  yes indeed  for sir jaspers coming and saving us at that dreadful moment and my being able to keep up as long as dear mamma wanted me and then mrs halfpenny being spared by dear lady merrifield to give me such wonderful care and kindness and little theodore being so happily placed and this restsuch a strange quiet rest as i never knew before  oh it is all so thankworthyand the great tears came to dim her eyes  it seems sent to help me to take strength and courage for the future  he hath helped me hitherto  and you are better  yes much better  quite comfortable as long as i am quite still  and content to be still  yes im very lazy  it was a tired voice and gillian feared her halfhour was nearly over but she could not help saying  do you know i think it will be all nicer now  mr white is doing so much and mr stebbing hates it so that mrs stebbing says he is going to dissolve the partnership and go away  then it would all be easier  it seems too good to be true  and that man mr white  he must do something for you  he ought  oh no  he has done a great deal already and has not been well used  dont talk of that  i believe he is awfully rich  you know he is building an institute for the workmen and a whole row of model cottages  yes alexis told me  what a difference it will make  i hope he will build a room where the girls can dine and rest and read or have a piano it would be so good for them  you had better talk to him about it  i never see him and i should not dare  ill tell my aunts  he always does what aunt ada tells him  is that really all you wish  oh i dont wish for anything muchi dont seem able to care now dear mamma is where they cease from troubling and i have alec again  well i cant help having great hopes  i cant see why that man should not make a daughter of you  then you would travel and see mountains and pictures and everything  oh should you not like that  like  oh one does not think about liking things impossible  and for the rest it is nonsense  i should not like to be dependent and i ought not  you dont think what is to come next  no it would be taking thought for the morrow would it not  i dont want to while i cant do anything it would only make me fret and i am glad i am too stupid still to begin vexing myself over it i suppose energy and power of considering will come when my heart does not flutter so  in the meantime i only want to keep quiet and i hope thats not all laziness but some trust in him who has helped me all this time  miss gillian youve clavered as long as is good for miss white and here are the whole clanjamfrie waiting in the road for you  now be douce my bairn and mind you are not in the woods at home and dont let the laddies play their tricks with miss primrose  i must go said gillian hastily kissing kalliope  the others were going to call for me  when lady phyllis was riding with her father she spied a wonderful field of daffodils and a valley full of moss at a place called clipston two miles off and we are all going to get some for the decorations  ill send you some  goodbye  the clanjamfrie as mrs halfpenny called it mustered strong and gillians heart leapt at the resumption of the tumultuous family life as she beheld the collection of girls boys dogs and donkeys awaiting her in the approach and in spite of the two governesses presence her mind misgave her as to the likelihood of regard to the hint that her mother had given that she hoped the elder ones would try to be sober in their ways and not quite forget what week it was it was in their favour that jasper now in his last term at school was much more of a man and less of a boy than hitherto and was likely to be on the side of discretion so that he might keep in order that always difficult element wilfred whose two years of preparatory school as yet made him only more ingenious in the arts of teasing and more determined to show his superiority to petticoat government  he had driven fergus nearly distracted by threatening to use all his mineralogical specimens to make ducks and drakes and actually confusing them together so that fergus repented of having exhibited them and rejoiced that aunt jane had let them continue in her lumberroom till they could find a permanent home  wilfred had a shot for mrs halfpenny when she came down with gillian and looked for primrose to secure that there were no interstices between the silk handkerchief and fur collar  ha ha old small change dont you wish you may get itas primrose proved to be outside the drive on one of the donkeys youve got nothing to do but gnaw your fists at us like old giant pope  for shame wilfred said jasper  my mother did primroses throat nurse so she is all right  bad form observed lord ivinghoe shaking his head  im not going to eton replied wilfred audaciously  i should hope notin a tone of ineffable contempt not for wilfreds person but his manners and therewith his lordship exclaimed whos that as maura came flying down with gillians forgotten basket  oh thats maura white said valetta  i say isnt she going with us  oh no she has to look after her sister  dont you think we might take her gill said fly  she never gets any fun  i dont think she ought to leave kalliope today fly for nurse is going down to il lido and besides aunt jane said we must not take all rockquay with us  no they would not let us ask kitty and clement varley said fergus disconsolately  i am sure she is five times as pretty as your kitty returned ivinghoe  she is a regular stunner  whereby it may be perceived that a year at eton had considerably modified his lordships correctness of speech if not of demeanour  be it further observed that in spite of the escort of the governesses the young people were as free as if those ladies had been absent for as jasper observed the donkeys neutralised them  miss elbury being a bad walker rode one and miss vincent felt bound to keep close to primrose upon the other and as neither animal could be prevailed on to moderate its pace they kept far ahead of all except valetta who was mounted on the pony intended for lady phyllis but disdained by her until she should be tired  lord ivinghoes admiration of maura was received contemptuously by wilfred who was half a year younger than his cousin and being already in his own estimation a wykehamist had endless rivalries with him  she  shes nothing but a cad  her sister is a shopgirl and her brother is a quarryman  she does not look like it observed ivinghoe while mysie and fly with one voice exclaimed that her father was an officer in the royal wardours  a private first said wilfred with boyhoods reiteration  cads and quarrymen all of themthe whole boiling old white and all though he has got such a stuckup house  nonsense will said fly  why mr white has dined with us  a patent of nobility said jasper smiling  i dont care said wilfred if other people choose to chum with old stonemasons and convicts i dont  wilfred that is too bad said gillian  it is very wrong to talk in that way  oh said the audacious wilfred we all know who is gills jack  shut up will cried fergus flying at him  i told you not to  but wilfred bounded up a steep bank and from that place of vantage went on  didnt she teach him greek and wasnt he spoony and didnt she send back his valentine so that  fergus was scrambling up the bank after him enraged at the betrayal of his confidence and shouting inarticulately while poor gillian moved on overwhelmed with confusion and fly uttered the cutting words perfectly disgusting  ay so it was cried the unabashed wilfred keeping on at the top of the bank and shaking the bushes at every pause  so he broke down the rocks and ran away with the tin and enlisted and went to prison  such a sweet young man for gill  poor gillian was her punishment never to end  that scrape of hers hitherto so tenderly and delicately hinted at and which she would have given worlds to have kept from her brothers now shouted all over the country  sympathy however she had if that would do her any good  mysie and fly came on each side of ivinghoe assuring him in low eager voices of the utter nonsense of the charge and explaining ardently and jasper with one bound laid hold of the tormentor dragged him down and holding his stick over him said  now wilfred if you dont hold your tongue and not behave like a brute i shall send you straight home  its quite true growled wilfred  ask her  what does that signify  im ashamed of you  ive a great mind to thrash you this instant  if you speak another word of that sort i shall  now then there are the governesses trying to stop to see whats the row  i shall give you up to miss vincent if you choose to behave so like a spiteful girl  a sixthform youth was far too great a man to be withstood by one who was not yet a public schoolboy at all and wilfred actually obeyed while jasper added to fergus  how could you be such a little ass as to go and tell him all that rot  it was true grumbled fergus  the more reason not to go cackling about it like an old hen or a girl  your own sister  im ashamed of you both  mind i shall thrash you if you mention it again  poor fergus felt the accusation of cackling unjust since he had only told wilfred in confidence and that had been betrayed but he had got his lesson on family honour and he subsided into his wonted lookout for curious stones while gillian was overtaken by jasper whether willingly or not she hardly knewbut his first word was little beast  you didnt hurt him i hope said gill accepting the invitation to take his arm  oh no  i only threatened to make him walk with the governesses and the donkeys  asses and savants to the centre said gillian like the orders to the french army in egypt  but whats all this about  you wanted me to look after you  is it that alexis  oh japs  mamma knows all about it and papa  it was only that he was ridiculous because i was so silly as to think i could help him with his greek  you  with his greek  i pity him  yes  i found he soon knew too much for me said gillian meekly but indeed japs it wasnt very bad  he only sent me a valentine and aunt jane says i need not have been so angry  a cat may look at a king said jasper loftily  it is a horrid bad thing for a girl to be left to herself without a brother worth having  so gillian got off pretty easily and after all the walk was not greatly spoilt  they coalesced again with the other three who were tolerably discreet and found the debate on the white gentility had been resumed  ivinghoe was philosophically declaring that in these days one must take up with everybody so it did not matter if one was a little more of a cad than another he himself was fag at eton to a fellow whose father was an oilman and who wasnt half a bad lot  an oilman ivy said his sister i thought he imported petroleum  well its all the same  i believe he began as an oilman  we shall have fergus reporting that hes a petroleuse put in jasper  no a petroleuse is a woman  i like mr white said fly but gillian you dont think it is true that he is going to marry your aunt jane  there was a great groan and japs observed  some one told us rockquay was a hotbed of gossip and we seem to have got it strong  where did this choice specimen come from fly demanded ivinghoe in his manner most like his mother  fly nodded her head towards her governess in the advanced guard  she had a cousin to tea with her and they thought i didnt know whom they meant and they said that he was always up at rockstone  well he is and aunt jane always stands up for him said gillian but that was because he is so good to the workpeople and aunt ada took him for some grand political friend of cousin rotherwoods  aunt jane said jasper  why she is the very essence and epitome of old maids  yes said gillian  if it came to that she would quite as soon marry the postman  thats lucky said ivinghoe  one can swallow a good deal but not quite ones own connections  in fact said jasper you had rather be an oilmans fag than a quarrymanswhat is itfirst cousin once removed in law  it is much more likely said gillian as they laughed over this that kalliope and maura will be his adopted daughters only he never comes near them  wherewith there was a halt  miss elbury insisted that phyllis should ride the banks began to show promise of flowers and in the search for violets dangerous topics were forgotten and wilfred was forgiven  they reached the spot marked by fly a field with a border of sloping broken ground and brushwood which certainly fulfilled all their desires steeply descending to a stream full of rocks the ground white with wood anemones long evergreen trails of periwinkles and blue flowers between primroses clustering under the roots of the trees daffodils gilding the grass above and the banks verdant with exquisite feathermoss  such a springtide wood was joy to all especially as the first cuckoo of the season came to add to their delights and set them counting for the augury of happy years which proved so many that mysie said they would not know what to do with them  i should said ivinghoe  i should like to live to be a great old statesman as lord palmerston did and have it all my own way wouldnt i bring things round again  perhaps they would have gone too far suggested jasper and then you would have to gnaw your hand like giant pope as wilfred says  catch me while i could do something better  if one only lived long enough speculated fergus one might find out what everything was made of and how to do everything  i wonder if the people did before the flood when they lived eight or nine hundred years said fly  perhaps that is the reason there is nothing new under the sun suggested valetta as many a child has before suggested  but then said mysie they got wicked  and then after the flood it had all to be begun over again said ivinghoe  let me see methuselah lived about as long as from william the conqueror till now  i think he might have got to steam and electricity  and dynamite said gillian  oh i dont wonder they had to be swept away if they were clever and wicked both  and i suppose they were said jasper  at least the giants and that they handed on some of their ability through ham to the egyptians and all those queer primeval coons whose works we are digging up  from the conquest till now repeated gillian  im glad we dont live so long now  it tires one to think of it  but we shall said fly  yes said mysie but then we shall be rid of this nasty old self that is always getting wrong  that little ladys nasty old self does so as little as any ones jasper could not help remarking to his sister and fly pouncing on the first purple orchis spike amid its blackspotted leaves cried  at any rate these dear things go on the same without any tiresome inventing  except gods just at first whispered mysie  and the gardeners do invent new ones said valetta  invent  no they only fuss them and spoil them and make ridiculous names for them said fly  these darling creatures are ever so much better  look at primrose there  yes said gillian as she saw her little sister in quiet ecstasy over the sparkling bells of the daffodils one would not like to live eight hundred years away from that experience  but mamma cares just as much still as primrose does said mysie we must get some for her own self as well as for the church  mine are all for mamma proclaimed primrose and just then there was a shout that a birds nest had been founda ringousels nest on the banks  fly and her brother shared a collection of birds eggs and were so excited about robbing the ousels of a single egg that gillian hoped that fergus would not catch the infection and abandon minerals for eggs which would be ever so much worseonly a degree better than butterflies towards which wilfred showed a certain proclivity  i shall be thirteen before next holidays he observed after making a vain dash with his hat at a sulphur butterfly looking like a primrose flying away  mamma wont allow any killing collection before thirteen years old explained mysie  she says explained gillian by that time one ought to be old enough to discriminate between the lawfulness of killing the creatures for the sake of studying their beauty and learning them and the mere wanton amusement of hunting them down under the excuse of collecting  i say exclaimed valetta who had been exploring above here is such a funny old house  there was a rush in that direction and at the other end of the wide homefield was perceived a picturesque gray stone house with large mullioned windows a dilapidated low stone wall with what had once been a handsome gateway overgrown with ivy and within big double daffodils and white narcissus growing wild  its like the halls of ivor said mysie awestruck by the loneliness no dog nor horse nor cow not even a goose  and what a place to sketch cried miss vincent  oh gillian we must come here another day  oh may we gather the flowers exclaimed the insatiable primrose  those poetic narcissuses would be delicious for the choir screen added gillian  poetic narcissuspoetic grandmother said wilfred  its old butter and eggs  i say cried mysie  look ivyi know that pair of fighting lionsaint these some of your arms over the door  by which you mean a quartering of our shield said ivinghoe of course it is the clipp bearing  or two lions azure regardant combatant their tails couped  two blue kilkenny cats who have begun with each others tails commented jasper  ivinghoe glared a little but respected the sixth form and gillian added  they clipped them  then did this place belong to our ancestors  poetic grandmother really said mysie  great grandmother corrected ivinghoe  to be sure  it was from the clipps that we got all this rockstone estate  and i suppose this was their house  what a shame to have deserted it  oh it has been a farmhouse said fly  i heard something about farms that wouldnt let  then is it yours cried valetta and may we gather the flowers  and maynt we explore asked mysie  oh what fun  holloa exclaimed wilfred transfixed as if he had seen the ghosts of all the clipps  for just as valetta and mysie threw themselves on the big bunches of hepatica and the white narcissus a roar worthy of the cliptailed lions proceeded from the window and the demand who is picking my roses  primrose in terror threw herself on gillian with a little scream wilfred crept behind the walls but after the general start there was an equally universal laugh for between the stout mullions of the oriel window lord rotherwoods face was seen and sir jaspers behind him  great was the jubilation and there was a rush to the tall door up the dilapidated steps where curls of fern were peeping out but the gentlemen called out that only the backdoor could be opened and the intention of a real grand exploration was cut short by miss elburys declaring that she was bound not to let phyllis stay out till six oclock  fly in her usual goodhumoured way suppressed her sighs and begged the others to explore without her but the general vote declared this to be out of the question  fly had too short a time to remain with her cousins to be forsaken even for the charms of the halls of ivor or the rival beasts castle as gillian called it which after all would not run away  but it might be let said mysie  yes ive got a tenant in agitation said lord rotherwood mischievously  never mind i dare say he wont inquire what you have done with his butter and eggs  so with a parting salute to the ancestral halls the cavalry was set in order big panniers full of moss and flowers disposed on the donkeys fly placed on her pony and every maiden taking her basket of flowers jasper and ivinghoe alone being amiable or perhaps trustworthy enough to assist in carrying  flys pony demurred to the extra burthen so jasper took hers and when gillian declared herself too fond of her flowers to part with them ivinghoe astonished miss vincent on whom some stones of ferguss as well as her own share of flowers had been bestowed by taking one handle of her most cumbrous basket  sir jasper and lord rotherwood rode together through the happy young troop on the homeward way  perhaps ivinghoe was conscious of a special nod of approval from his father  on passing rock house the youthful public was rather amused at his pausing and saying  arent you going to leave some flowers there  oh yes said gillian  i have a basket on purpose  and i have some for maura said valetta  valettas was an untidy bunch gillians a dainty basket where white violets reposed on moss within a circle of larger blossoms  thats something like quoth ivinghoe  he lingered with them as if he wanted to see that vision again but only the caretaker appeared and promised to take the flowers upstairs  maura afterwards told how they were enjoyed and they knew of kalliopes calm restfulness in holy week thoughts and paschal joys  it was on easter tuesday that mr white first sent a message asking to see his guest now of nearly three weeks  he came in very quietly and gentlyperhaps the sight of the room he had prepared for his young wife was in itself a shock to him and he had lived so long without womankind that he had all a lonely mans awe of an invalid  he took with a certain respect the hand that kalliope held out as she said with a faint flush in her cheeks  i am glad to thank you sir  you have been very good to me  i am glad to see you better he said with a little embarrassment  i ought to be in this beautiful air and with these lovely things to look at and she pointed to the reigning photograph on the stand the facade of st marks  you should see it as i did  and he began to describe it to her she putting in a question or two here and there which showed her appreciation  you know something about it already he said  yes when i was quite a little girl one of the officers in the royal wardours brought some photographs to malta and told me about them  but he said recalling himself that is not my object now  your brother says he does not feel competent to decide without you  and he laid before her two or three prospectuses of grammar schools  it is time to apply he added if that little fellowpeter you call him dont youis to begin next term  petros  oh sir this is kindness  i desired that the childrens education should be attended to said mr white  i did not intend their being sent to an ordinary national school  indeed said kalliope i do not think much time has been lost for they have learnt a good deal there but i am particularly glad that petros should go to a superior school just now that he has been left alone for he is more lively and sociable than theodore and it might be less easy for him to keep from bad companions  the pros and cons of the several schools were discussed and hurstpierpoint finally fixed on  never mind about his outfit added mr white  ill give that fellow down in bellevue an order to rig him out  he is a sharp little sturdy fellow who will make his way in the world  indeed i trust so now that his education is secured  it is another load off my mind said kalliope with a smile of exceeding sweetness and gratitude her hands clasped and her eyes raised for a moment in higher thankfulnessa look that so enhanced her beauty that mr white gazed for a moment in wonder  the next moment however the dark eyes turned on him with a little anxiety and she said  one thing more sir  perhaps you will be so kind as to relieve my mind again  that notice of dismissal at the quarters end  was it not in some degree from a mistake  an utter mistake my dear he said hastily  never trouble your head about it  then it does not hold  certainly not  and i may go back to my office as soon as i am well enough  is that your wish  yes sir  i love my work and my assistants and i think i could do better if a little more scope could be allowed me  very well we will see about thatyou have to get well first of all  i am so much better that i ought to go home  mr lee is quite ready for me  nonsense  you must be much stronger before dagger would hear of your going  after this mr white came to sit with kalliope for a time in the course of each day bringing with him something that would interest her and seeming gratified by her responsiveness quiet as it was for she was still very feeble and exertion caused a failure of breath and fluttering of heart that were so distressing that ten days more passed before she was brought downstairs and drawn out in the garden in a chair where she could sit on the sheltered terrace enjoying the delicious spring air and soft seabreezes sometimes alone sometimes with the company of one friend or another  gillian and aunt jane had with the full connivance of mr white arranged a temporary entrance from one garden to the other for the convenience of attending to kalliope and here one afternoon miss mohun was coming in when she heard through the laurels two voices speaking to the girl  as she moved forward she saw they were the elder and younger stebbings and that kalliope had risen to her feet and was leaning on the back of her chair  while she was considering whether to advance kalliope heard her and called in a breathless voice miss mohun oh miss mohun come  miss mohun  you will do us the justice began mr stebbing speaking more to her indignant face and gesture than to any words  miss white is not well she said  you had better leave her to me  and as they withdrew through the house kalliope sank back in her chair in one of those alarming attacks of deadly faintness that had been averted for many days past  happily an electric bell was always at hand and the housekeeper knew what remedies to bring  kalliope did not attempt a word for many long minutes though the colour came back gradually to her lips  her first words were  thank you  oh i did hope that persecution was over  my poor child  dont tell me unless you like  onlyit wasnt about your work  oh no the old story  but he brought his fatherto say he consentedand wished itnow  there was no letting her say any more at that time but it was all plain enough  this had been one more attempt of the stebbing family to recover their former power kalliope was assumed to be mr whites favoured niece frank could make capital of having loved her when poor and neglected and his parents were ready to back his suit  the father and son had used their familiarity with the house to obtain admittance to the garden without announcement or preparation and had pressed the siege with a confidence that could only be inspired by their own selfopinion  kalliope had been kept up by her native dignity and resolution and had at first gently then firmly declined the arguments persuasions promises and final reproaches with which they beset hereven threatening to disclose what they called encouragement and assuring her that she need not reckon on mr white for the general voice declared him likely to marry again and then where would she be  i dont know what would have become of me if you had not come she said  and when she had rested long enough and crept into the house and alexis had come home to carry her upstairs it was plain that she had been seriously thrown back and she was not able to leave her room for two or three days  mr white was necessarily told what had been the cause of the mischief  he smiled grimly  ay ay master frank thought he would come round the old man did he  he will find himself out  ha ha a girl like that in the house is like a honeypot near a wasps nest and the little sister will be as bad  didnt i see the young lord smart little prig as he looks holding an umbrella over her with a smile on his face as much as to say i know who is a pretty girl no one to look after them either  but maybe they will all find themselves mistaken and his grim smile relaxed into a highly amiable one  miss mohun was not at all uneasy as to the young lord  an eton boys admiration of a pretty face did not amount to much even if ivinghoe had not understood noblesse oblige too well to leave a young girl unsheltered  besides he and all the rest were going away the next day  but what did that final hint mean     chapter xxii  the maiden all forlorn    one secret was soon out even before the cruel parting of fly and mysie which it greatly mitigated  clipston was to be repaired and put in order to be rented by the merrifields  it was really a fine old substantial squires house though neglected and consigned to farmers for four generations  it had great capabilitiesa hall up to the roof wainscoted roomsat present happy huntinggrounds to boys and terriersa choked fountain numerous windows walled up in the days of the tax on light and never reopened and moreover a big stone barn with a cross on the gable and evident traces of having once been a chapel  the place was actually in rockstone parish and had a hamlet of six or seven houses for which cottage services were held once a week but the restoration of the chapel would provide a place for these and it would become a province for lady merrifields care while sir jasper was absolutely entreated both by lord rotherwood and the rector of rockstone to become the valuable layman of the parish nor was he at all unwilling thus to bestow his enforced leisure  it was a beautiful place  the valley of daffodils already visited narrowed into a ravine where the rivulet rushed down from moorlands through a ravine charmingly wooded and interspersed with rock  it would give country delights to the children and remove them from the gossip of the wateringplace society and yet not be too far off for those readingroom opportunities beloved of gentlemen  the young people were in ecstasies only mourning that they could not live there during the repairs and that those experienced in the nature of workmen hesitated to promise that clipston would be habitable by the summer vacation  in the meantime most of the movables from silverfold were transported thither and there was a great deal of walking and driving to and fro planning for the future and revelling in the spring outburst of flowers  schoolroom work had begun again and lady merrifield was hearing mysie read the geruasalemme liberata while miss vincent superintended primroses copies and gillians chalks were striving to portray a bust of sophocles when the distant sounds of the piano in the drawingroom stopped and valetta came in with words always ominous  aunt jane wants to speak to you mamma  lady merrifield gathered up her work and departed while valetta addressing the public said somethings up  oh cried primrose sofi hasnt run away again  i hope kalliope isnt worse said mysie anxiously  i guess said valetta somebody said something the other day  something proving us the hotbeds of gossip muttered gillian  you had better get your german exercise valetta said miss vincent  mysie you have not finished your sums  and a sigh went round but valetta added one afterclap  aunt jane lookedi dont know how  whereat gillian nodded her head and looked up at miss vincent who was as curious as the rest but restrained the manifestation manfully  meantime lady merrifield found her sister standing at the window and without turning round the words were uttered  jasper was right lily  you dont mean it  yes he is after herwith a long breath  mr white  yesthen sitting down  i did not think much of it before  they always are after ada more or lessand she likes it but it never has come to anything  why should it now  it has  at least it has gone further than ever anything did before except charlie scott that ridiculous boy at beechcroft that william was so angry with and who married somebody else  you dont say that he has proposed to her  yes he hasthe man  by a letter this morning and i could see she expected itnot that thats any wonder  but my dear she cant possibly be thinking of it  well i should have said it was impossible but i see she has not made up her mind  poor dear ada  it is too bad to laugh but she does like the having a real offer at last and a great italian castle laid at her feet  but he isnt a gentleman  i dont mean only his birthand i know he is a good man reallybut jasper said he could feel he was not a gentleman by the way he fell on richard white before his sister  i know  i know  i wonder if it would be for her happiness  then she has not answered him  no or rather i left her going to write  she wont accept him certainly now but i believe she is telling him that she must have time to consider and consult her family  she must know pretty well what her family will say  fancy william fancy emily  fancy reginald  yes oh yes  but adai must say itshe does like to prolong the situation  it is not fair on the poor man  well she will act as she chooses but i think she really does want to see what amount of opposition no not that but of estrangement it would cause  did you see the letter  yes no doubt you will too  i told her i should come to you and she did not object  i think she was glad to be saved broaching the subject for she is half ashamed  i should have thought she would have been as deeply offended at the presumption as poor gillian was with the valentine  lily my dear fortytwo is not all one with seventeen especially when theres an estate with an italian countship attached to it though im sure id rather marry alexis than this man  he is a gentleman in grain  oh jenny you are very severe  im afraid it is bitterness lily so i rushed down to have it all out with you and make up my mind what part to take  it is very hard on you my dear after you have nursed and waited on her all these years  it is the little titillation of vanityexactly like the ada of sixteen nay of six that worries me and makes me naughty said jane dashing off a tear  oh lily how could i have borne it if you had not come home  but what do you mean about the part to take  well you see lily i really do not know what i ought to do  i want to clear my mind by talking to you  i am afraid it would make a great difference to you in the matter of means  i dont mean about that but i am not sure whether i ought to stand up for her  you see the man is really good at heart and religious and he is taking out this chaplain  the climate mountains and sea might really suit her health and she could have all kinds of comforts and luxuries and if she can get over his birth and the want of fine edge of his manners i dont know that we have any right to set ourselves against it  i should have thought those objections would have weighed most of all with her  and i do believe that if the whole family are unanimous in scouting the very idea she will give it up  she is proud of mohun blood and the rotherwood connection and all and if there were a desperate oppositionwell she would be rather flattered and give in but i am not sure that she would not always regret it and pine after what she might have had  rotherwood likes the man  likebut thats not liking him to marry his cousin  rotherwood will not be the person most shocked  no  we shall have a terrible time however it ends  oh  i wish it was all over  do you think she really cares for the manloves him in fact  my dear lily if ada ever was in love with anybody it was with harry may and that was all pure mistake  i never told anybody but i believe it was that which upset her health  but they are both too old to concern themselves about such trifles  he does not expect it  i have seen good strong love in a woman over forty  yes but this is quite another thing  a lady of the house wanted thats the motive  i should not wonder if he came home as much to look for a ladywife as to set the stebbings to rights or if not he is driven to it by having the whites on his hands  i dont quite see that  i was going to ask you how it would affect them  well you see though she is perfectly willing and anxious to begin again poor dear kally really cant  she did try to arrange a design that had been running in her head for a long time and she was so bad after it that dr dagger said she must not attempt it  then though she is discreet enough for anything mr white is not really her uncle and could not take her about with him alone or even with maura so i gather from some expressions in his letter that he would like to take her out with them spend the summer at rocca marina and let her have a winters study at florence  then i suppose she might come back and superintend on quite a different footing  so he wants ada as a chaperon for kalliope  that is an element in the affair and not a bad one and i dont think ada will object  she wont be left entirely to his companionship  my dear jane  then im sure she ought not to marry him cried lady merrifield indignantly  here comes jasper  may i tell him  you will whether you may or not  and what sir jasper said was             who married the maiden all forlorn   at which both sisters though rather angry could not help laughing and lady merrifield explained that they had always said the events had gone on in a concatenation like the house that jack built from gillians peep through the rails  however he was of opinion that it was better not to make a strenuous opposition  adeline is quite old enough to judge for herself whether the incongruities will interfere with her happiness he said and this is really a worthy man who ought not to be contemned  violent contradiction might leave memories that would make it difficult to be on affectionate terms afterwards  yes said jane that is what i feel  thank you jasper  now i must go to my district  happily those things run on all the same for the present  but when she was gone sir jasper told his wife that he thought it ought to be seriously put before adeline that jane ought to be considered  she had devoted herself to the care of her sister for many years and the division of their means would tell seriously upon her comfort  if it were a matter of affection there would be nothing to say he observed but nobody pretends that it is so and surely jane deserves consideration  i should think her a much more comfortable companion than mr white said lady merrifield  i cant believe it will come to anything  whatever the riches or the castle at rocca marina may be ada would in a worldly point of view give up a position of some consideration here and i think that will weigh with her  as soon as possible lady merrifield went up to see her sister and found her writing letters in a great flutter of importance  it was quite plain that the affair was not to be quashed at once and that whether the suit were granted or not all the family were to be aware that adeline had had her choice  warned by her husband lady merrifield guarded the form of her remonstrances  oh yes dear lily i know  it is a sacrifice in many points of view but think what a field is open to me  there are all those english workmen and their wives and families living out there and mr white does so need a lady to influence them  you have not done much work of that kind  besides i thought this chaplain was married  yes but the moral support of a lady at the head must be needful said ada  it is quite a work  perhaps so said her sister who had scarcely been in the habit of looking on ada as a great moral influence  but have you thought what this will be to jane  really lily it is a good deal for janes sake  she will be so much more free without being bound to poor meand adas head went on one side  you know she would never have lived here but for me and now she will be able to do what she pleases  not pecuniarily  oh it will be quite possible to see to all that  besides think of the advantage to her schemes  oh yes dear jenny it will be a wrench to her of course and she will miss me but when that is once got over she will feel that i have acted for the best  nor will it be such a separation he means always to spend the summer here and the winter and spring at florence or rocca marina  it was grand to hear the italian syllables roll from adelines tongue  you know he could take the title if he pleased  i am sure i hope he will not do anything so ridiculous  oh no of course not  but it was plain that the secret consciousness of being countess of rocca marina was an offset against being plain mrs white and adeline continued there is another thingi do not quite see how it can be managed about kalliope otherwise poor girl  it was quite true that the care of kalliope would be greatly facilitated by mr whites marriage but what was absurd was to suppose that ada would have made any sacrifice for her sake or any one elses and there was something comical as well as provoking in this pose of devotion to the public good  you are decided then  oh no  i am only showing you what inducements there are to give up so much as i should do hereif i make up my mind to it  theres only one inducement i should think valid for a moment  yesbridling a little  but lily you always had your romance we dont all meet with a jasper at the right moment andandthe maid of athens drooped her eyelids and ingenuously curved her lips i do think the poor man has it very much at heart  then you ought not to keep him in suspense  and youyou really are not against it lily rather in a disappointed tone as if she expected to have her own value enhanced  i think you ought to do whatever is most right and just by him and everybody else  if you really care for the man enough to overlook his origin and his occasional betrayals of it and think he will make you better and happier take him at once but dont pretend to call it a sacrifice or for anybodys sake but for your own and any way dont trifle with him and his suspense  lady merrifield spoke with unwonted severity for she was really provoked  but lily i must see what the others saywilliam and emily  i told him that william was the head of our family  if you mean to be guided by them well and good if not i see no sense in asking them  after all the family commotion fell short of what was expected by either of the sisters  the eldest brother mr mohun of beechcroft court wrote to the lady herself that she was quite old enough to know what was for her own happiness and he had no desire to interfere with her choice if she preferred wealth to station  to lady merrifield his letter began it is very well it is no worse and as jasper vouches for this being a worthy man and of substantial means there is no valid objection  i shall take care to overhaul the settlements and if possible i must make up poor janes income  the sister lady henry grey in her dowager seclusion at brighton contented herself with a general moan on the decadence of society and the levelling up that made such an affair possible  she had been meditating a visit to rockquay to see her dear lilias who by the bye had run down to her at brighton for a day out of the stay in london but now she would defer it till this matter was over  it would be too trying to have to accept this stonemason as one of the family  as to colonel mohun being one of the younger division of the family there was no idea of consulting him and he wrote a fairly civil little note to adeline hoping that she had decided for the best and would be happy while to the elder of the pair of sisters he said so ada has found her crooked stick at last  i always thought it inevitable  keep up heart old jenny and hold on till her majesty turns me off and then we will see what is to be done  perhaps this cool acquiescence was less pleasing to adeline mohun than a contest that would have proved her value and importance and her brother williams observation that she was old enough to know her own mind was the cruellest cut of all  on the other hand there was no doubt of her swains devotion  if he had been influenced in his decision by convenience or calculation he was certainly by this time heartily in love  not only was adeline a handsome graceful woman whose airs and affectations seemed far more absurd to those who had made merry over them from childhood than to a stranger of an inferior grade but there was a great charm to a man able to appreciate refinement in his first familiar intercourse with thorough ladies jane began to be touched by the sight of his devotion and convinced of his attachment and sometimes wondered with lady merrifield whether adeline would rise to her opportunities and responsibilities or be satisfied to be a petted idol  one difficulty in this time of suspense was that the sisters had no right to take into their confidence the young folks who were quite sharpeyed enough to know that something was going on and not being put on honour were not withheld from communicating their discoveries to one another in no measured words though fortunately they had sense enough especially under the awe of their father not to let them go any further than mysie who was entertaining because she was shocked at their audacious jokes and speculations all at first on the false scent of their elder aunt who certainly was in a state of excitement and uncertainty enough to throw her off the even tenor of her way and excite some suspicion  when she actually brought down a number of the contemporary review instead of friendly work for the edification of her gfs gillian tried not to look too conscious when some of the girls actually tittered in the rear and she absolutely blushed when aunt jane deliberately stated that ascension day would fall on a tuesday  so gillian averred as she walked up the hill with jasper and mysie  it seemed a climax to the diversion she and jasper had extracted from it in private both wearing punchs spectacles for the nonce and holding such aberrations as proof positive  mysie on the other hand was much exercised  do you think she is in love then  oh yes  people always do those things in love  besides the sofi hasnt got a single white hair in her and you know what that always means  i cant make it out  i cant think how aunt jane can be in love with a great man like that  his voice isnt nice you know  not even as sweet as bully bottoms suggested gillian  youre a chit said jasper or youd be superior to the notion of love being indispensable  when people are so very old said mysie in a meditative voice perhaps they cant but aunt jane is very goodand i thought it was only horrid worldly people that married without love  trust your good woman for looking to the main chance said jasper who was better read in trollope and mrs oliphant than his sisters  tis not main chance said gillian  think of the lots of good she would do  what a recreation room for the girls and what schools she would set up at rocca marina  depend upon it its for that  i suppose it is right if aunt jane does it said mysie  well done mysie  so aunt jane is your pope  no shes the king that can do no wrong said gillian laughing  wrongi didnt say wrongbut things arent always real wrong that arent somehow quite right said mysie with the bewildered reasoning of perceptions that outran her powers of expression  mysies speeches for instance said jasper  oh japs what did i say wrong  dont tease her japs  he didnt mean morally but correctly  the three were on their way up the hill when they met primrose who had accompanied mrs halfpenny to see kalliope and who was evidently in a state of such great discomposure that they all stood round to ask what was the matter but she hung down her head and would not say  hoots toots  i tell her she need not make such a work about it said mrs halfpenny  the honest man did but kiss her and no harm for her uncle that is to be  hes a nasty man  and he snatched me up  and he is all scrubby and tobaccoey and i wont have him for an uncle cried primrose  i hope he is not going to proceed in that way said gillian sotto voce to mysie  people always do snatch up primroses said jasper  dont japs  i dont like marble men  i wish they would stay marble  you dont approve of the transformation  oh japs is it true  mysie you know the statue at rotherwood where pigmylion made a stone figure and it turned into a woman  yes but it was a woman and this is a man  mysie began an exposition of classic fable to her little sister while mrs halfpenny explained that this came of christian folk setting up heathen idols in their houses as twas a shame for decent folk to look at let alone puir bairnies while jasper and gillian gasped in convulsions of laughter and bandied queries whether their aunt were the statue pigmylion had animated as nothing could be less statuesque than she whether the reverse had taken place as primrose observed and she had been the pygmalion to awaken the soul in the man of marble  here however mrs halfpenny became scandalised at such laughter in the open street and perceiving some one in the distance she carried off primrose and enjoined the others to walk on doucely and wiselike  gillian was on her way to visit kalliope and make an appointment for her mother to take her out for a drive but as they passed the gate at beechcroft out burst valetta and fergus quite breathless  oh gill gill  mr white is in the drawingroom and he has brought aunt ada the most beautiful box you ever saw with all the stoppers made of gold   and he says i may get all the specimens i like at rocca marina shouted fergus  ivory brushes and such a ringsparkling up to the ceiling added valetta  but val ferg whom did you say demanded the elders coming within the shadow of the copper beeches  aunt ada said valetta theres a great a engraved on all those dear lovely bottles andoh they smell  aunt ada  oh i thought  what did you think gill said aunt jane coming from the grass plat suddenly on them  oh aunt jane i am so glad cried gillian  i thoughtand she blushed furiously  they made asses of themselves said jasper  they said it was you added mysie  miss mellon told miss elbury she added in excuse  me  no i thank you  so you are glad gillian  oh yes aunt  i couldnt have borne for you to do anythingqueer and there was a look in gillians face that went to janes heart and under other circumstances would have produced a kiss but she rallied to her line of defence  my dear you must not call this queer  mr white is very much attached to your aunt ada and i think he will make her very happy and give her great opportunities of doing good  thats just what gillian said when she was afraid it was you said mysie  i suppose thats it  and that makes it real right  and the golden stoppers said valetta innocently but almost choking jasper with laughter which must be suppressed before his aunt  may one know it now asked gillian sensible of the perilous ground  yes my dears you must have been on tenterhooks all this time for of course you saw there was a crisis and you behaved much better than i should have done at your age but it was only a fait accompli this very day and we couldnt tell you before  when he brought down the golden stoppers jasper could not help saying  no no you naughty boy  he would not have dared to bring it in before he came before luncheonall that came after  oh my dear that dressingcase is perfectly awful  i wouldnt have such a burthen on my mindforfor all the orphans in london  i hope there are no banditti at rocca marina  only accepted today  how did he get all his great as engraved said jasper practically  he could not have had many doubts said gillian  does kalliope know  i cannot tell i think he has probably told her  he must have met primrose there said jasper  poor prim  and the offence and the pigmylion story were duly related much to aunt janes amusement  but she said i think that the soul in the marble man is very real and very warm and dear children dont get into the habit of contemning him  laugh i suppose you must i am afraid it must look ridiculous at our age but please dont despise  i am going down to your mother  may i come with you said gillian  i dont think i can go to kally till i have digested this a little and if you are going to mamma she wont drive her out  jane was much gratified by this volunteer though jasper did suggest that gill was afraid of primroses treatment  he went on with the other three to clipston while gillian exclaimed  oh aunt jane shall not you be very lonely  not nearly so much so as if you were not all here said her aunt cheerfully  when you bemoaned your sisters last year we did not think the same thing was coming on me  phyllis and alethea  it was a very different thing said gillian besides though i hated it so much i had got used to being without them  and to tell you the truth gill nothing in that way ever was so bad to me as your own mother going and marrying and now you see i have got her back againand more too  aunt janes smile and softened eyes told that the young niece was included in the more too and gillian felt a thrill of pleasure and affection in this proof that after all she was something to the aunt towards whom her feelings had so entirely changed  she proceeded however to ask with considerable anxiety what would be done about the whites kalliope especially and in return she was told about the present plan of kalliopes being taken to italy to recover first and then to pursue her studies at florence so as to return to her work more capable and in a higher position  oh how exquisite cried gillian  but how about all the others  the very thing i want to see about and talk over with your mother i am sure she ought to go and it will not even be wasting time for she cannot earn anything  talking over things with lady merrifield was however impeded for behold there was a visitor in the drawingroom  aunt and niece exchanged glances of consternation as they detected a strangers voice through the open window and gillian uttered a vituperative whisper  i do believe it is that dreadful fangs then hoping her aunt had not heardcaptain henderson i mean  he threatened to come down after us and now he will always be in and out and we shall have no peace  he has got nothing on earth to do   gillians guess was right  the neat trim soldierly figure with a long fair moustache and pleasant gray eyes was introduced to miss mohun as captain henderson one of my brother officers by sir jasper who stood on the rug talking to him  looks and signs among the ladies were token enough that the crisis had come and lady merrifield soon secured freedom of speech by proposing to drive her sister to clipston while sir jasper asked his visitor to walk with him  you will be in haste to sketch the place he said before the workmen have done their best to demolish its beauty  as for gillian she saw her aunt hesitating on account of a parochial engagement for that afternoon and as it was happily not beyond her powers she offered herself as a substitute and was thankfully accepted  she felt quite glad to do anything obliging towards her aunt jane and in a mood very unlike last years grudging service it was only reading to the mothers meeting since among the good ladies there prevailed such a strange incapacity of reading aloud that this part of the business was left to so few that for one to fail either in presence or in voice was very inconvenient  all were settled down to their needlework with their babies disposed of as best they might be  mr hablot had finished his little lecture and the one lady with a voice had nearly exhausted it and there was a slight sensation at the absence of the unfailing miss mohun when gillian came in with the apologies about going to drive with her mother  and as she described it afterwards didnt those wretched beings all grin and titter even the ladies who ought to have had more manners and that old miss mellon who is a real growth of the hotbed of gossip simpered and supposed we must look for such things now and though i pretended not to hear my cheeks would go and flame up as red asthat tasconia just with longing to tell them aunt jane was not so ridiculous and so i took hold of for half a crown and began to read it as if i could bite them all  she read herself into a state of pacification but did not attempt to see kalliope that day being rather shy of all that might be encountered in that house especially after working hours  the next day however lady merrifields services were required to chaperon the coy betrothed in an inspection of cliff house and furniture which was to be renovated according to her taste and gillian was to take that time for a visit to kalliope whom she expected to find in the garden  the usual corner was however vacant and mr white was heard making a growl of foolish girl  doesnt know which way her bread is buttered  maura however came running up and said to gillian please come this way  she is here  what has she hidden herself for demanded mr white  i thought she might have been here to welcome thismiss adeline  she is not very well today faltered maura  oh ay fretting  well i thought she had more sense  gillian followed maura who was no sooner out of hearing than she began it is too bad of him to be so cross  kally really is so upset  she did not sleep all night and i thought she would have fainted quite away this morning  oh dear has he been worrying her  she is very glad and happy of course about miss ada and he wont believe it because he wants her to go out to italy with them for all next winter  and wont she  oh what a pity  she said she really could not because of us she could not leave us petros and all without a home  she thought it her duty to stay and look after us  and then he got cross and said that she was presuming on the hope of living in idleness here and making him keep us all but she would find herself mistaken and went off very angry  oh horrid how could he  i believe if kally could have walked so far she would have gone down straight to mr lees  she wanted to but she was all in a tremble and i persuaded her not though she did send me down to ask mrs lee when she can be ready  then when alexis came home mr white told him that he didnt in the least mean all that and would not hear of her going away though he was angry at her being so foolish but he would give her another chance of not throwing away such advantages  and alexis says she ought not  he wants her to go and declares that he and i can very well manage with mrs lee and look after petros and that she must not think of rushing off in a huff for a few words said in a passion  so between the two she was quite upset and couldnt sleep and oh if she were to be ill again  by this time they were in sight of kalliope lying back in a basket chair shaded by the fence of the kitchengarden and her weary face and trembling hand showed how much this had shaken her in her weakness  she sent maura away and spoke out her troubles freely to gillian  i thought at first my duty was quite clear and that i ought not to go away and enjoy myself and leave the others to get on without me  alec would find it so dreary and though mr and mrs lee are very good and kind they are not quite companions to him then maura has come to think so much about people being ladies that i dont feel sure that she would attend to mrs lee and the same with petros in the holidays  if i cant work at first still i can make a home and look after them  but it is only one winter and alexis thinks you ought and oh what it would be and how you would get on  that is what puzzles me  alexis thinks mr white has a right to expect me to improve myself and not go on for ever making white jessamines with malachite leaves and that he can look after maura and petros  i see too that i ought to try to recover or i might be a burthen on alexis for ever and hinder all his better hopes then theres the not liking to accept a favour after mr white said such things though i ought not to think about it since he made that apology but it is a horrid feeling that i ought not to affront him for the sake of the others  altogether i do feel so tossed  i cant get back the feeling i had when i was ill that i need not worry for that god will decide  and there were tears in her eyes  cant you ask some ones advice said gillian  if i were sure they quite understood  my head is quite tired with thinking about it  not many moments had passed before there were steps that made kalliope start painfully and maura appeared piloting another visitor  it was miss mohun who had escaped from the survey of the roomsso far uneasy at what she had gathered from mr white that she was the more anxious to make the offer previously agreed to  my dear she said i am afraid you look tired  they have worried her and knocked her up said gillian indignantly  i see  kally my dear we are connections now you know and i have heard of mr whites plan  it made me think whether you would find the matter easier if you let me have maura while you are away to cheer my solitude  then i could see that she did her lessons and between all gillians brothers we could see that petros was happy in the holidays  oh miss mohun how can i be grateful enough  there is an end of all difficulties  and when the inspecting party came round and adeline bent to kiss the white weary but no longer distressed face and kindly said we shall see a great deal of each other i hope she replied with an earnest thank you and added to mr white miss mohun has made it all easy to me sir and i am very grateful  ay ay  youre a good girl at the bottom and have some sense     chapter xxiii  fangs    events came on rapidly that spring  mr white was anxious that his marriage should take place quicklyafraid perhaps that his prize would escape him and be daunted by the passive disapproval of her family though this was only manifested to him in a want of cordiality  this being sincere people they could not help and that outbreak to kalliope had made the sisters so uneasy that they would have willingly endured the ridicule of a broken engagement to secure adeline from the risks of a rough temper where gentlemanly instincts were not inbred  adeline however knew she had gone too far to recede though she would willingly have delayed in enjoyment of the present homage and shrinking from the future plunge away from all her protectors though the strong manly will overpowered hers and made her submit to the necessities of the case and fix a day early in july she clung the more closely to her sisters and insisted on being accompanied by jane on going to london to purchase the outfit that she had often seen in visions before  so miss mohuns affairs were put in commission gillian taking care of them and the two sisters were to go to mrs craydon once as marianne weston their first friend out of their own family and now a widow with a house in london well pleased at any recall of old times though inclined like all the rest to speak of poor ada  lord rotherwood was as his cousins had predicted less disgusted than the rest as in matters of business he had been able to test the true worth that lay beneath the blemishes of tone and of temper and his wife thought the italian residence and foreign tincture made the affair much more endurable than could have been expected  she chose an exquisite teaservice for their joint wedding present but she would not consent to let lady phyllis be a bridesmaid though the marquis discovering that her eldest brother hated the idea of giving her away to the stonemason offered not to put too fine a point on it but to act the part of cousin phoenix  bridesmaids would have been rather a difficulty but then the deep mourning of kalliope and maura made a decided reason for excluding them and miss adeline who knew that a quiet wedding would be in much the best taste resolved to content herself with two tiny maidens primrose and the contemporary hablot her own goddaughter who being commonly known as belle made a reason for equipping each in the colour and with the flowers of her name and the idea was carried out with great taste  valetta thought it hard that an outsider should be chosen  the young merrifields had the failing of large families in clannish exclusiveness up to the point of hating and despising more or less all who interfered with their enjoyment of one another and of their own ways  the absence of society at silverfold had intensified this farouche tone and the dispersion instead of curing it had rendered them more bent on being alone together  worst of all was wilfred who had been kept at home very inconveniently by some recurring delicacy of brain and eyes and who at twelve years old was enough of an imp to be no small torment to his sisters  valetta was unmercifully teased about her affection for kitty varley and maura white and whenever he durst there were attempts at stings about alexis until new game offered itself on whom no one had any mercy  captain henderson was as much in the way as a man could be who knew but one family in the place and had no resource but sketching  his yellow moustache was to be seen at all manner of unexpected and unwelcome times  if that great honour a walk with papa was granted out he popped from marine hotel or a seat in the public gardens evidently lying in ambush to spoil their walk  or he was found teteatete with mamma before the fiveoclock tea talking no doubt raphaels correggios and stuff as in the royal wardour days  even at clipston or in the coves on the beach he was only too apt to start up from some convenient post for sketching  he really did draw beautifully and mysie would have been thankful for his counsels if public opinion had not been so strong  moreover kitty varley conveyed to valetta the speculations of rockstone whether gillian was the attraction  now val said mysie how can you listen to such nonsense  you said so before and it wasnt nonsense  it wasnt aunt jane  no but it was somebody  everybody does marry somebody but it is no use for us to think about it for it always turns out just the contrary to all the books one ever read so theres no going by anything and i dont believe it right to talk about it  why not  every one does  all the good teachings say one should not talk of what one does not want ones grownups to hear  oh but then one would never talk of anything  oh val  i wont be sure but i dont believe i should mind mammas hearing all i say  yes but youve never been to school and i heard bee varley say she never saw anybody so childishly simple for her age  this brought the colour into mysies face but she said  id rather be simple than talk as mamma does not like and val do on no account tell gillian  i havent  and dont dont tell wilfred or you know how horrid he would be  there was a telltale colour in valettas cheeks by which mysie might have discerned that valetta had not resisted the charm of declaring that she knew something even though this was sure to lead to tortures of various kinds from wilfred until it was extracted  still the youth as yet was afraid to do much worse than look preternaturally knowing at his sister and give hints about fangs holding fast and the like but quite enough to startle her into something between being flattered and indignant  she was scarcely civil to the captain and felt bound to express her dislike on every possible occasion though only to provoke a grin from wilfred and a giggle from valetta  lady merrifields basketcarriage and little rough pony had been brought from silverfold and she took kalliope out for quiet drives whenever it was possible but a day of showers having prevented this she was concerned to find herself hindered on a second afternoon gillian offered to be her substitute  you know i always drive you mamma  these are worse hills than at silverfold and i dont want you to come down by the seawall  i am sure i would not go there for something among all the stupid people  if you keep to the turnpike you cant come to much harm with bruno  that is awfullyi mean horribly dusty  theres the cliff road towards arnscombe  that is safe enough  i dont think you could come to much real damage but remember that for kally a start or an alarm would be really as hurtful as an accident to a person in health  poor old bruno could hardly frighten a mouse said gillian  only take care and dont be enterprising  gillian drove up to the door of cliff house and kalliope took her seat  it was an enjoyable afternoon with the fresh clearness of june sunshine after showers great purple shadows of clouds flitting over the sea dimpled by white crests of wave that broke the golden path of sunshine into sparkling ripples while on the other side of the cliff road lay the open moorland full of furze stunted in growth but brilliant in colour and relieved by the purple browns of blossoming grasses and the white stars of stitchwort  this is delicious murmured kalliope with a gesture of enjoyment  much nicer than down below  oh yes it seems to stretch ones very soul  and the place is so big and wide that no one can worry with sketching  yes it defies that said kalliope laughing  so facaptain henderson wont crop up as he does at every sketchable place  didnt you know he was here  yes alexis told me he had seen him  everybody has seen him i should think he is always about with nothing to do but that everlasting sketching  he must have been very sorry to be obliged to retire  horrid  it was weak and he might have been in egypt well out of the way  no i didnt mean thatas kalliope looked shockedbut he might have been getting distinction and promotion  he used to be very kind said kalliope in a tone of regretful remonstrance  it was he who taught me first to draw  he  what facaptain henderson  yes when i was quite a little girl and he had only just joined he found me out before our quarters at gibraltar trying to draw an old spaniard selling oranges and he helped me and showed me how to hold my pencil  i have got it stillthe sketch  then he used to lend me things to copy and give me hints tilloh till my father said i was too old for that sort of thing  then you know my father got his commission and i went to school at belfast  and you have never seen him since  scarcely  sometimes he was on leave in my holidays and you know we were at the depot afterwards but i shall always feel that all that i have been able to do since has been owing to him  and how you will enjoy studying at florence  oh think what it would be if i could ever do a reredos for a church  i keep on dreaming and fancying them and now there really seems a hope  is that arnscombe church  yes you know it has been nicely restored  we had the columns to do  the reredos is alabaster i believe and we had nobody fit to undertake that  i so longed for the power  i almost saw it  have you seen what it is  no i never had time  i suppose it would be too tiring for you now but we could see the outside  gillian forgot that arnscombe whose blunt gray spire protruded through the young green elms lay in a little valley through which a stream rushed to the sea  the lane was not very steep but there were loose stones  bruno stumbled he was down the carriage stood still and the two girls were out on opposite sides in a moment gillian crying out  dont be frightenedno harm doneas she ran to the ponys head he lay quite still with heaving sides and she felt utterly alone and helpless in the solitary road with an invalid companion whom she did not like to leave  i am afraid i cannot run for help said kalliope quietly though breathlessly but i could sit by the horse and hold his head while you go for help  i dont like  oh heres some one coming  can i be of any use  most welcome soundthough it was actually captain henderson the ubiquitous wheeling his bicycle up the hill knapsack of sketching materials on his back  miss merrifield  miss white  i trust no one is hurt  oh no thank you unless it is the poor pony  kally sit down on the bank i insist  oh i am so glad you are come  can you sit on his head while i cut the traces  gillian did that comfortable thing till released when the pony scrambled up again but with bleeding knees hip and side though the captain did not think any serious harm was done but it was even more awkward at the moment that both the shafts were broken  what is to be done sighed gillian  miss white cant walk  can i run down to the village to get something to take her home  the place did not look likely to supply any conveyance better than a rough cart said their friend  it is quite impossible to put the poor pony in anyhow  i dont mind walking in the least but you know how ill she has been  i see  only one thing to be done said the captain who had already turned the carriage round by the stumps of the shafts you must accept me in lieu of your pony  oh yes thank you cried gillian eagerly  i can lead poor bruno and take care of your bicycle  jump in kally  kalliope who had wisely abstained from adding a useless voice to the discussion here demurred  she could not think of such a thing they could very well wait in the carriage while captain henderson went on to the town on his bicycle and sent out a midge  but there were showers about and a damp feeling in the lane  both the others thought this perilous besides that there might be rude passengers to laugh at their predicament and captain henderson protested that the weight was nothing  he prevailed at last and she allowed him to hand her into the basket when she could hardly stand and wrap the dustcloth about her  thus the procession set forth gillian with poor drooping brunos rein in one hand and the other on the bicycle and the captain gallantly drawing the carriage with kalliope seated in the midst  he tramped on so vigorously as quite to justify his declaration that it was no burthen to him  it was not a frequented road and they met no one in the least available to do more than stare or ask a question or two until as they approached the town and rockstone church was full in view who should appear before their eyes but sir jasper wilfred carrying on his back a huge kite that had been for many evenings in course of construction and fergus acting as trainbearer  thus came on the first moment of gillians explanation as sir jasper took the poor pony from her and held counsel over the damage with many hearty thanks to captain henderson  i am sure sir no one could have shown greater presence of mind than the young ladies said that gentleman and her fathers i am glad to hear it would have gratified gillian the more but for the impish grimace with which wilfred favoured her behind kalliopes impassive back  the kitefliers turned not without an entreaty from the boys that they might go on alone and fly their kite  no no boys said their fathernot here we shall have the kite pulling you into the sea over the cliffs  i must take the pony home but i will come if possible tomorrow  much disappointed they went dolefully in the rear grumbling sotto voce their conviction that there would be no wind tomorrow and that it was all fangss fault in some incomprehensible manner  at cliff house kalliope was carefully handed out by sir jasper trying but with failing voice to thank captain henderson and declaring herself not the worse though her hand shook so much that the general was not content without giving her his arm up the stairs and telling maura that he should send mrs halfpenny up to see after her  the maimed carriage was left in the yard and captain henderson then took charge of his iron horse and the whole male party proceeded to the livery stables so that gillian was able to be alone when she humbly repeated to her mother the tale parents have so often to hear of semidisobedience leading to disaster but with the selfreproach and sorrow that drew the sting of displeasure pity for bruno grief for her mothers deprivation and anxiety for kalliope might be penance and rebuke sufficient for a bit of thoughtlessness  lady merrifield made no remark but there was an odd expression in her face when she heard who had come so opportunely to the rescue  sir jasper brought a reassuring account of the poor little steed which would be usable again after a short rest and the blemish was the less important as there was no intention of selling him  mrs halfpenny too reported that her patient was as quiet as a lamb she wasnt one to fash herself for nothing and go into screaming cries but kenned better what was fitting for one born under her majestys colours  so there was nothing to hinder amusement when at dinner sir jasper comically described the procession as he met it  kalliope white looking only too like minerva or some of those greek goddess statues they used to draw about sitting straight and upright in her triumphal car drawn by her votary while poor gillian came behind with the pony on one side and the bicycle on the other very much as if she were conducting the wheel on which she was to be broken as an offering to the idol  i think said mysie captain henderson was like the two happy sons in solons story who dragged their mother to the temple  only they died of it said gillian  and nobody asked how the poor mother felt afterwards added lady merrifield  i thought they all had an apotheosis together said sir jasper let us hope that devotion may have its reward  there was a little lawn outside the drawingroom windows at il lido lady merrifield was sitting just within and her husband had just brought her a letter to read when they heard wilfreds impish voice  jackno not jackfangs  but fangss name is jack so it will do as well said valettas voice  hurrahso it is  jack  hush wilfredthis is too foolish came gillians tones in remonstrance             jack and jill went up the hill              to draw   to draw  oh thats lovely interrupted valetta  he is always drawing said gillian with an odd laugh  he was brought up to it  first teeth and then picturs and then oh myladies home from the wash went on wilfred  but go on will entreated valetta             jack and jill went up the hill              to draw a piece of water   no no put in wilfredthats wrong               to draw the sergeants daughter           fangs dragged down unto the town              and jill came moaning after   i didnt moan  oh you dont know how disconsolate you looked  moaning you know because her fangs had to draw the other young womaneh gill  fangs always leave an aching void you know  you ridiculous boy  im sure i wish fangs would leave a void  it wouldnt ache  the two parents had been exchanging glances of something very like consternation and of the mute inquiry on one side were you aware of this sort of thing and an emphatic shake of the head on the other  then sir jaspers voice exclaimed aloud  children we hear every word you say and are shocked at your impertinence and bad taste  there was a scatter  wilfred and valetta who had been pinioning gillian on either side by her dress released her and fled into the laurels that veiled the guineapigs but their fathers long strides pursued them and he gravely said  i am very sorry to find this is your style of socalled wit  it was only chaff said valetta the boldest in right of her girlhood  very improper chaff  i am the last person to object to harmless merriment but you are both old enough to know that on these subjects such merriment is not harmless  everybody does it whined valetta beginning one of her crying fits  i am sorry you have been among people who have led you to think so no nicelyminded girl will do so nor any brother who wishes to see his sisters refined rightfeeling women  go in valettai cant suffer this howling  go i say  your mother will talk to you  now wilfred do you wish to see your sisters like your mother  theyll never be that if they live to a hundred  do not you hinder it then and never let that insulting nickname pass your lips again  wilfreds defence as to universal use in the family was inaudible and he was allowed to slouch away  gillian had fled to her mother entreating her to explain to her father that such jests were abhorrent to her  but you know mamma if i was cross and dignified wilfred would enjoy it all the more and be ten times worse  quite true my dear  papa will understand but we are sorry to hear that nickname  it was an old royal wardour name mamma  harry and claude both used it andoh lots of the young officers  that does not make it more becoming in you  nno  but oh mamma he was very kind today  but i do wish it had been anybody else  and her colour rose so as to startle her mother  why my dear i thought you would have been glad that a stranger did not find you in that plight  but it makes it all the worse  he does beset us mamma and it is hard on me after all the other nonsense  lady merrifield burst out laughing  my dear child he thinks as much of you as of old halfpenny  oh mamma are you sure said gillian still hiding her face  it was not silliness of my own but kitty varley told val that everybody said ither sister and miss mohun and all  why cant he go away and not be always bothering about this horrid place with nothing to do  how thankful i shall be to have you all safe at clipston  but mamma cant you keep him off us  valettas sobbing entrance here prevented more but while explaining to her the causes of her fathers displeasure her mother extracted a good deal more of the gossip to which she finally returned answer  there is no telling the harm that is done by chattering gossip in this way  you might have learnt by what happened before what mistakes are made  what am i to do valetta  i dont want to hinder you from having friends and companions but if you bring home such mischievous stories i shall have to keep you entirely among ourselves till you are older and wiser  i nevernever will believeanybody who says anybody is going to marry anybody sobbed valetta desperately and incoherently  certainly no one who knows nothing about the matter  there is nothing papa and i dislike much more than such foolish talk and to tease your sister about it is even worse but i will say no more about that as i believe it was chiefly wilfreds doing  itoldwill murmured valetta  mysie begged me not but i had done it  how much you would have saved yourself and everybody else if you had let the foolish word die with you  now goodnight my dear  bathe your eyes well or they will be very uncomfortable tomorrow and do try to cure yourself of roaring when you cry  it vexes papa so much more  another small scene had to follow with the boy who was quite willing to go off to bed having no desire to face his father again though his mother had her fears that he was not particularly penitent for what fellows always did when people were spooning  he could only be assured that he would experience unpleasant consequences if he recurred to the practice but wilfred had always been the problem in the family  the summer twilight was just darkening completely and lady merrifield had returned to the drawingroom and was about to ring for lights when sir jasper came in through the window saying  no question now about renewal  angelic features more than angelic calmness and dignity  ha you there young ladies he added in some dismay as two white dresses struck his eye  theres no harm done said lady merrifield laughing  i was thinking whether to relieve gillians mind by telling her the state of the case and mysie is to be trusted  oh mamma then it is kalliope exclaimed gillian already relieved for even love could not have perceived calmness and dignity in her sitting upon brunos head  has she ever talked about him asked lady merrifield  no except today when i said i hoped she was safe from him on that road  she said he had always been very kind to her and taught her to draw when she was quite a little girl  just so said lady merrifield  well when she was a little older poor mr white who was one of the most honourable and scrupulous of men took alarm and saw that it would never do to have the young officers running after her  it was an uncommonly awkward position added sir jasper with such a remarkablelooking girl and a foolish unmanageable mother  it made poor whites retirement the more reasonable when the girl was growing too old to be kept at school any longer  and has he been constant to her all these years  how nice cried mysie  after a fashion said lady merrifield  he made me the receptacle of a good deal of youthful despair  all the lads did said her husband  but he got over it and it seemed to have passed out of his life however he asked after the whites as soon as we met him in london and now he tells me that he never forgot kalliopeher face always came between him and any one whom his mother threw in his way and he came down here knowing her history and with the object of seeing her again  and he has not till now  no  besides the absolute need of keeping her quiet it would not exactly do for him to visit her while she is alone with maura at cliff house and i wished him first to see her casually amongst us for i dreaded her not fulfilling his ideal  oh  when i think of her at fourteen or fifteen with that exquisite bloom and the floating wavy hair i see a very different creature from what she is now  peach or ivory carving said sir jasper  yes she is nobler finer altogether and has gained in countenance greatly but he may not think so and i should like her to be looking a little less ill  well i cant help hoping he will be disappointed and be too stupid to care for her exclaimed gillian  indeed said her father in a tone of displeased surprise  he is so insignificant he does not seem to suit with her said gillian in a tone of defence and there does not seem to be anything in him  that only shows the effect of nursing prejudice by using foolish opprobrious nicknames  henderson was a good officer he has shown himself an excellent son always sacrificing his own predilections for the sake of duty  he is a rightminded religious sensible man his own master and with no connections to take umbrage at miss whites position  it is no commonplace man who knows how to honour her for it  nothing could be a happier fate for her and you will be no friend to her if you use any foolish terms of disparagement of him because he does not happen to please your fancy  i am sure gillian will do no such thing now that she understands the case said her mother  oh no indeed said gillian  it was only a first feeling  and you will allow for a little annoyance papa added lady merrifield  we really have had a great deal of him and he does spoil the childrens walks with you  sir jasper laughed  i agree that the sooner this is over the better  you need have no doubts as to the first view now that gillian has effected the introduction  no words can do justice to her beauty though by the bye he must have contemplated her through the back of his head  well wont that do  cant he be sent off for the present for as to lovemaking now with all the doubts and scruples in the way it would be the way to kill her outright  you must take that in hand my ladyit is past me  come girls give us some music  the two girls went up at bedtime to their room mysie capering and declaring that here was real true nice love like people in stories and gillian still bemoaning a little that whatever papa might say facaptain henderson would always be too poor a creature for kalliope  if i was quite sure it was not only her beauty added gillian philosophically  lady merrifield went up to cliff house as early as she could the next day  she found her patient there very white and shaken but not so much by the adventure of yesterday as by a beautiful bouquet of the choicest roses which lay on the table before her sofa left by captain henderson when he had called to inquire after her  what ought i to do dear lady merrifield she asked  they came while i was dressing and i did not know  you mean about a message of thanks  yes my dear father was so terribly displeased when i wore a rose that he gave me before the great review at belfast that i feel as if i ought not to touch these and yet it is so kind and after all his wonderful kindness yesterday  the hand on the side and the trembling lip showed the painful fluttering of heart and the voice died away  my dear things are very different now  take my word for it your father could not be displeased for a moment at any kindness between you and captain henderson  ten years ago he was a very young man and his parents were living and your father was bound in honour and for your sake too to prevent attentions from the young officers  oh yes i know it would have been shocking to have got into that sort of thing  but now he is entirely at his own disposal and a man of four or fiveandthirty who has gone through a great deal and i do not think that to send him a friendly message of thanks for a bunch of flowers to his old fellowsoldiers daughter would be anything but what captain white would think his due  oha sigh of reliefplease tell him dear lady merrifield and she stretched out her hand for the flowers and lovingly cooled her cheek with their petals and tenderly admired them singly venturing now to enjoy them and even caress them  lady merrifield ventured on no more but she carried off ultimately hopeful auguries for the gentleman who had been watching for her very anxious to hear her report  she was however determined on persuading him to patience reinforcing her assurances with dr daggers opinion that though kalliopes constitution needed only quiet and rest entirely to shake off the effects of the overstrain of that terrible halfyear yet that renewed agitation would probably entail chronic heartcomplaint and she insisted that without making any sign the lover should go out of reach for several months making for instance the expedition to norway of which he had been talking he could not understand at first that what he meant to propose would not be the best means of setting that anxious heart at rest and lady merrifield had to dwell on the swarm of conscientious scruples and questions that would arise about saddling him with such a family and should not be put to rest as easily as he imagined  at last by the further representation that she would regard her mothers death as far too recent for such matters to occupy her and by the assertion of the now fixed conviction that attentions from him at present could only agitate and distress her harmfully and bring on her malicious remarks the captain was induced to believe that rocca marina or florence would be a far better scene for his courtship and to defer it till he could find her there in better health  he was brought at last to promise to leave rockquay at once and dispose of himself in norway if only lady merrifield would procure him one meeting with kalliope in which he solemnly promised to do nothing that could startle her or betray his intentions  lady merrifield managed it cunningly  it had been already fixed that kalliope should come down to a brief twelveoclock service held at st kenelms for invalids there to return thanks for her recovery in what she felt as her own church and she was to come to il lido and rest there afterwards  resolving to have no spectators lady merrifield sent off the entire family for a picnic at clipston promising them with some confidence that they would not be haunted by captain henderson and that she would come in the waggonette bringing fergus as soon as he was out of school drink tea and fetch home the tired  sir jasper went too telling her with a smile that he was far too shy to assist her in acting chaperon  dragon you had better sayi mean to put on all my teeth and claws  these were not however very visible at the church door when she met kalliope who had come down in a bathchair but was able afterwards to walk slowly to il lido  perhaps captain henderson was however aware of them for kalliope had no knowledge of his presence in the church or in the street somewhat in the rear nor did he venture to present himself till there had been time for luncheon and for rest and till kalliope had been settled in the cool eastern window under the verandah with an indian cushion behind her that threw out her profile like a cameo  then as if to call on lady merrifield captain henderson appeared armed according to a wise suggestion with his portfolio and there was a very quiet and natural overlooking of his drawings which evidently gave kalliope immense pleasure quite unsuspiciously precautions had been taken against other visitors and all went off so well and happily that lady merrifield felt quite triumphant when the waggonette came round and after picking up fergus she set kalliope down at her own door with something like a colour in her cheeks and lips and thanks for a happy afternoon and the great pleasure in seeing one of the dear old royal wardours again  but oh mamma said gillian feeling as if the thorn in her thoughts must be extracted are you sure it is not all her beauty  her beauty no doubt began it and gratifies the artist eye but i am sure his perseverance is due to appreciation of her noble character said lady merrifield  oh mamma would he if she had been ever so good and no prettier than other people  dont pick motives so my child her beauty helps to make up the sum and substance of his adoration and she would not have the countenance she has without the goodness  let that satisfy you     chapter xxiv  conclusion    the wedding was imminent by this time  the sisters returned from london the younger looking brilliant and in unusual health and the elder fagged and weary  shopping or rather looking on at shopping had been a far more wearying occupation than all the schools and districts in rockquay afforded  and besides the being left alone there was the need of considering her future  the family had certainly expected that a rich and open handed man like mr white would bethink him that half what was sufficient for two was not enough for one to live in the same style and would have resigned his brides fortune to her sister but as a rule he never did what was expected of him and he had perhaps been somewhat annoyed by mr mohuns pertinacity about settlements showing a certain distrust of commercial wealth  at any rate all he did was to insist on paying handsomely for mauras board but still miss mohun believed she should have to give up the pretty house built by themselves and go into smaller quarters more especially as it was universally agreed that adeline must have mrs mount with her and mrs mount would certainly be miserable in foreign parts unless her daughter went with her  it was demonstrated that the remaining means would just suffice to keep up beechcroft but jane knew that it could be only done at the cost of her subscriptions and charities and she merely undertook to take no measures till winterthe rockquay season  sir jasper who thought she behaved exceedingly well about it authorised an earnest invitation to make her home at clipston but though she was much gratified she knew she should be in his way and perhaps in that of the boys and it was too far from the work to which she meant to devote herself even more completely when it would be no longer needful to be companionable to a semiinvalid fond of society  however just then her brother the colonel came at last for his long leave  he knew that his retirement was only a matter of months and declared his intention of joining forces with her if she would have him and in the meantime he was desirous of contributing his full share in keeping up the home  nor did jane feel it selfish to accept his offer for she knew that clipston would give him congenial society and shooting and that there was plenty of useful layman work for him in the town and that old reggie should wish to set up his staff with her raised her spirits so that cheerfulness was no longer an effort  the wedding was to be very quiet  only just after the day was finally fixed mrs merrifields long decay ended unexpectedly and sir jasper had to hasten to london and thence to the funeral at stokesley  she was a second wife and he her only son so that he inherited from her means that set him much more at his ease with regard to his large family than he had ever been before  the intention that lady merrifield should act mistress of the house at the wedding breakfast had of course to be given up and only primroses extreme youth made it possible to let her still be a bridesmaid  so the whole party together with the whites were only spectators in the background and the procession into church consisted of just the absolutely needful personsthe bride in a delicate nondescript coloured dress such as none but a french dressmaker could describe and covered with transparent lace like as mysie averred a hedgeback full of pignut flowers the justice of the comparison being lost in the ugliness of the name and as all rockquay tried to squeeze into the church to see and admire the beauty was not thrown away  no tears were shed there but afterwards in her own familiar room between her two sisters adeline white shed floods of tears and clinging to janes neck asked how she could ever have consented to leave her extracting a promise of coming to her in case of illness nothing but a knock at the door by valetta with a peremptory message that mr white said they should be late for the train induced her to dry her tears and tear herself away  kalliope and maura remained with miss mohun during the bridal journey to scotland and by the time it was ended the former had shaken off the invalid habits and could hardly accept the doctors assurance that she ought not to resume her work though she was grateful for the delights before her and the opportunities of improvement that she was promised at florence  her health had certainly been improved by frank stebbings departure for america  something oozed out that made miss mohun suspect that he had been tampering with the accounts and then it proved that there had been a crisis and discovery which mr white had consented to hush up for his partners sake  alexis had necessarily known of the investigation and disclosure but had kept absolute silence until it had been brought to light in other ways and the culprit was beyond seas  mr stebbing was about to retire from the business but for many reasons the dissolution of the partnership was deferred  alexis was now in a post of trust with a larger salary  he lodged at mrs lees and was in a manner free of miss mohuns house but he spent much of his leisure time in study being now able to pay regularly for instruction from the tutor who taught at mrs edgars school  maura asked him rather pertly what was the use of troubling himself about latin and greek if he held himself bound to the marble works  it is not troubleit is rest he said and at her gasp besides marble works or no one ought to make the best of ones self  by the time mr and mrs white came back from scotland the repairs at clipston had been accomplished and the merrifields had taken possession  it all was most pleasant in that summer weather going backwards and forwards between the houses the sunday coming into church and lunching at aunt janes where valetta and primrose stayed for mrs hablots class and were escorted home by macrae in time for evening service at clipston where their mother gillian and mysie reigned over their little school  there was a kind of homely ease and family life such that adeline once betrayed that she sometimes felt as if she was going into banishment  however there was no doubt that she enjoyed her husbands pride in and devotion to her as well as all the command of money and choice of pretty things that she had obtained and she looked well handsome and dignified  still it was evident that she was very glad of kalliopes companionship and that the pair were not on those exclusively intimate terms that would make a third person de trop  by sir jaspers advice lady merrifield did not mention the possibility of a visit from captain henderson who would come upon mr white far better on his own merits and had better not be expected either by adeline or kalliope  enthusiastic letters from both ladies described the delights of the journey which was taken in a leisurely sightseeing manner and as to rocca marina it seemed to be an absolute paradise  mr white had taken care to send out an english upholsterer so that insular ideas of comfort might be fulfilled within  without the combination of mountain and sea the vineclad terraces the chestnut slopes the magical colours of the barer rocks the coastline trending far away the azure mediterranean with the whitesailed feluccas skimming across it filled kalliope with the more transport because it satisfied the eyes that had unconsciously missed such colouring scenes ever since her early childhood  the english workmen and their families hailed with delight an english lady  the chaplain and his wife were already at work among them and their little church only waiting for the bride to lay the first stone  the accounts of kalliopes walks as mrs whites deputy among these people of her scrambles and her sketching made her recovery evident adeline had just been writing that the girl was too valuable to both herself and mr white ever to be parted with when captain henderson came back from norway and had free permission from lady merrifield to put his fate to the touch  english tourists who know how to behave themselves were always welcome to enliven the seclusion of rocca marina and admire all of which adeline was as proud as mr white himself  recommendations to its hospitality did not fail and the first of adelines long letters showed warm appreciation of this pleasant guest who seemed enchanted with the spot  next mrs whites sagacity began to suspect his object and there ensued kalliopes letter full of doubts and scruples unable to help being happy but deferring her reply till she should hear from lady merrifield whether it could be right to burthen any man with such a family as hers  the old allegiance to her fathers commanding officer as well as the kindness she had received seemed to make her turn to ask their approval as if they were her parents and of course it was heartily given sir jasper himself writing to set before her that john henderson was no suddenly captivated youth unable to calculate consequences but a man of longtried affection and constancy free from personal ties and knowing all her concerns  the younger ones all gave promise of making their own way and a wise elder brother was the best thing she could give them  even richard might be the better for the connection and sir jasper had taken care that there should be some knowledge of what he was  there was reason to think that all hesitation had been overcome even before the letters arrived  for it appeared that captain henderson had fraternised greatly with mr white and that having much wished for an occupation he had decided to become a partner in the marble works bringing the artknowledge and taste that had been desirable and kalliope hoped still to superintend the mosaic workers  it was agreed that the marriage had far better take place away from rockquay and it was resolved that it should be at florence and that the couple should remain there for the winter studying art and especially florentine mosaic and return in the spring when the stebbings would have concluded their arrangements and vacated their house  mr white in great delight franked out alexis and maura to be present at the wedding and a longing wish of kalliopes that mr flight would officiate was so far expressed that lady merrifield mentioned it to him  he was very much moved for he had been feeling that his relations with the whites had been chiefly harmful though as alexis now assured him his notice had been their first ray of comfort in their changed life at rockquay  the experience had certainly made him older and wiser  mrs whiteor as her nieces could not help calling her among themselves the contessa di rocca marinaurged that her sister jane should join the company and bring gillian to act as the other bridesmaid  this after a little deliberation was accepted and the journey was the greatest treat to all concerned  mr flight the only one of the party who had travelled before in the sense of being a tourist was amused by the keen and intense delight of miss mohun as well as the younger ones in all they beheld and he steered them with full experience of hotels and of what ought to be visited so as to be an excellent courier  as to rocca marina where they spent a few days no words would describe their admiration though they brought home a whole book of sketches to back their descriptions  they did not however bring back maura  mrs white had declared that she must remain to supply the place of her sister  she was nearly fifteen years old and already pretty well advanced in her studies she would pick up foreign languages the chaplain would teach her when at rocca marina and music and drawing would be attainable in the spring at florence moreover mr white promised to regard her as a daughter  another point was settled  alexis had worked in earnest for eight months and had convinced himself that the marble works were not his vocation though he had acquitted himself well enough to induce mr white to offer him a share in the business and he would have accepted it if needful  he had however made up his mind to endeavour to obtain a scholarship at oxford and captain henderson promised that whether successful in this or not he should be enabled to keep his terms there  mr white could not understand how a man could prefer being a poor curate to being a rich quarrymaster but his wife and the two sisters had influence enough to prevent him from being offended and this was the easier because theodore had tastes and abilities that made it likely that he would be thoroughly available at the works  what shall be said of the return to rockstone  mr flight came home first then after many happy days of appreciative sightseeing aunt jane and gillian  they had not been ashamed of being british spinsters with guidebooks in their hands nor on the other hand had they been obliged to see what they did not care about and mr white had put them in the way of the best mode of seeing what they cared about and above all the vicissitudes of travel even in easy going modern fashion had made them one with each other according to janes best hopes  it was declared that the aunt looked five years younger for such recreation as she had never known before and she set to work with double energy  when in may captain and mrs henderson took possession of the pretty house that had been fitted up for them though miss mellon might whisper to a few that she had only been one of the mosaic hands there was not much inclination to attend to the story among the society to which lady merrifield introduced her  these acquaintances would gladly have seen more of her than she had time to give them between family claims and home cares her attention to the artistic side of the business for which she had not studied in vain and her personal and individual care for the young women concerned therein  for years to come even it was likely that visitors to rockstone would ask one another if they had seen that remarkably beautiful mrs henderson  mrs white reigning there in the summer in her fine house and gardens though handsome as ever had the good sense to resign the palm of beauty and be gratified with the admiration for one whom she accepted as a protegee and appendage whose praise reflected upon herself  and cliff house under the new regime was a power in rockstone with its gardenparties drawingroom meetings on behalf of everything good and desirable its general superintendence and promotion of all that could aid in the welfare of the place  there was general rejoicing when it was occupied  adeline in better health than she had enjoyed since her early girlhood and feeling her consequence both in italy and at rockstone was often radiant always kind and friendly and ready with patronage and assistance  her sisters wondered at times how absolute her happiness was they sometimes thought she said too much about it and about her dear husbands indulgence in her letters to be quite satisfactory and when she came to rockstone there was an effusiveness of affection towards her family an unwillingness to spare her sisters or nieces from her side an earnest desire to take one back to italy with her that betrayed something lacking in companionship  jane detected likewise such as the idolising husband felt this attachment a little over much  it was not quite possible to feel him one with her family or make him feel himself one  he would always be company with them  he had indeed been invited to beechcroft court but it was plain that the visit had been stiff and wearisome to both parties even more so than that to rotherwood where there was no reason to look for much familiarity  in the same way to reginald mohun who had been obliged to retire as full colonel mr white was so absolutely distasteful that it was his sisters continual fear that he would encourage the young peoples surreptitious jokes about their marble uncle  sir jasper always feeling accountable for having given the first sanction did his best for the brotherinlaw but in spite of regard there was no getting over the uncongeniality that would always be the drop in adelines cup  the perfect ease and confidence of family intercourse would alter on his entrance  nobody got on with him so well as captain harry may  for i do not speak to that dull elf who cannot figure to himself the great family meeting that came to pass when the colonists came homehow sweet and matronly aunt phyllis looked how fresh and bright her daughters were and how surprised valetta was to find them as well instructed and civilised as herself though she did not like primrose expect to see them tattooed  one of the party was no other than dolores mohun she had been very happy with her father for three years  they had been at kotorua at the time of the earthquake and dolores had acquired much credit for her reasonableness and selfpossession but there had been also a young lady not much above her own age who had needed protection and comfort and the acquaintance there begun had ended in her father deciding on a marriage with a pretty gentle creature as unlike the wife of his youth as could be imagined  dolores had behaved very well as her aunt phyllis warmly testified but it was a relief to all parties when the proposal was made that immediately after the wedding she should go home under her aunts escort to finish her education  she had learnt to love and trust aunt phyllis but to be once more with aunt lily and mysie was the greatest peace and bliss she could conceive  and she was a very different being from the angular defiant girl of those days which seemed so long ago  there is no need to say more at present of these old friends  there is no material for narrative in describing how the calm decay of dr may in old age was cheered by the presence of his sailor son nor in the scenes where the brothers sisters and friends exchanged happy recollections brightened each others lives with affection and stimulated one another in serving god in their generation    the end
