31794578	flip a california romance   by bret harte     chapter i   just where the track of the los gatos road streams on and upward like the sinuous trail of a fiery rocket until it is extinguished in the blue shadows of the coast range there is an embayed terrace near the summit hedged by dwarf firs at every bend of the heatladen road the eye rested upon it wistfully all along the flank of the mountain which seemed to pant and quiver in the ovenlike air through rising dust the slow creaking of dragging wheels the monotonous cry of tired springs and the muffled beat of plunging hoofs it held out a promise of sheltered coolness and green silences beyond sunburned and anxious faces yearned toward it from the dizzy swaying tops of stagecoaches from lagging teams far below from the blinding white canvas covers of mountain schooners and from scorching saddles that seemed to weigh down the scrambling sweating animals beneath but it would seem that the hope was vain the promise illusive when the terrace was reached it appeared not only to have caught and gathered all the heat of the valley below but to have evolved a fire of its own from some hidden craterlike source unknown nevertheless instead of prostrating and enervating man and beast it was said to have induced the wildest exaltation the heated air was filled and stifling with resinous exhalations the delirious spices of balm bay spruce juniper yerba buena wild syringa and strange aromatic herbs as yet unclassified distilled and evaporated in that mighty heat and seemed to fire with a midsummer madness all who breathed their fumes they stung smarted stimulated intoxicated it was said that the most jaded and footsore horses became furious and ungovernable under their influence wearied teamsters and muleteers who had exhausted their profanity in the ascent drank fresh draughts of inspiration in this fiery air extended their vocabulary and created new and startling forms of objurgation it is recorded that one bibulous stagedriver exhausted description and condensed its virtues in a single phrase gin and ginger this felicitous epithet flung out in a generous comparison with his favorite drink rum and gum clung to it ever after  such was the current comment on this vale of spices like most human criticism it was hasty and superficial no one yet had been known to have penetrated deeply its mysterious recesses it was still far below the summit and its wayside inn it had escaped the intruding foot of hunter and prospector and the inquisitive patrol of the county surveyor had only skirted its boundary it remained for mr lance harriott to complete its exploration his reasons for so doing were simple he had made the journey thither underneath the stagecoach and clinging to its axle he had chosen this hazardous mode of conveyance at night as the coach crept by his place of concealment in the wayside brush to elude the sheriff of monterey county and his posse who were after him  he had not made himself known to his fellowpassengers as they already knew him as a gambler an outlaw and a desperado he deemed it unwise to present himself in a newer reputation of a man who had just slain a brother gambler in a quarrel and for whom a reward was offered he slipped from the axle as the stagecoach swirled past the brushing branches of fir and for an instant lay unnoticed a scarcely distinguishable mound of dust in the broken furrows of the road then more like a beast than a man he crept on his hands and knees into the steaming underbrush here he lay still until the clatter of harness and the sound of voices faded in the distance had he been followed it would have been difficult to detect in that inert mass of rags any semblance to a known form or figure a hideous reddish mask of dust and clay obliterated his face his hands were shapeless stumps exaggerated in his trailing sleeves and when he rose staggering like a drunken man and plunged wildly into the recesses of the wood a cloud of dust followed him and pieces and patches of his frayed and rotten garments clung to the impeding branches twice he fell but maddened and upheld by the smarting spices and stimulating aroma of the air he kept on his course  gradually the heat became less oppressive once when he stopped and leaned exhaustedly against a sapling he fancied he saw the zephyr he could not yet feel in the glittering and trembling of leaves in the distance before him again the deep stillness was moved with a faint sighing rustle and he knew he must be nearing the edge of the thicket the spell of silence thus broken was followed by a fainter more musical interruptionthe glassy tinkle of water a step further his foot trembled on the verge of a slight ravine still closely canopied by the interlacing boughs overhead a tiny stream that he could have dammed with his hand yet lingered in this parched red gash in the hillside and trickled into a deep irregular welllike cavity that again overflowed and sent its slight surplus on it had been the luxurious retreat of many a spotted trout it was to be the bath of lance harriott without a moments hesitation without removing a single garment he slipped cautiously into it as if fearful of losing a single drop his head disappeared from the level of the bank the solitude was again unbroken only two objects remained upon the edge of the ravinehis revolver and tobacco pouch  a few minutes elapsed a fearless blue jay alighted on the bank and made a prospecting peck at the tobacco pouch it yielded in favor of a gopher who endeavored to draw it toward his hole but in turn gave way to a red squirrel whose attention was divided however between the pouch and the revolver which he regarded with mischievous fascination then there was a splash a grunt a sudden dispersion of animated nature and the head of mr lance harriott appeared above the bank it was a startling transformation not only that he had by this wholesale process washed himself and his light drill garments entirely clean but that he had apparently by the same operation morally cleansed himself and left every stain and ugly blot of his late misdeeds and reputation in his bath his face albeit scratched here and there was rosy round shining with irrepressible good humor and youthful levity his large blue eyes were infantine in their innocent surprise and thoughtlessness dripping yet with water and panting he rested his elbows lazily on the bank and became instantly absorbed with a boys delight in the movements of the gopher who after the first alarm returned cautiously to abduct the tobacco pouch if any familiar had failed to detect lance harriott in this hideous masquerade of dust and grime and tatters still less would any passing stranger have recognized in this blond faun the possible outcast and murderer and when with a swirl of his spattering sleeve he drove back the gopher in a shower of spray and leaped to the bank he seemed to have accepted his felonious hidingplace as a mere picnicking bower  a slight breeze was unmistakably permeating the wood from the west looking in that direction lance imagined that the shadow was less dark and although the undergrowth was denser he struck off carelessly toward it as he went on the wood became lighter and lighter branches and presently leaves were painted against the vivid blue of the sky he knew he must be near the summit stopped felt for his revolver and then lightly put the few remaining branches aside  the full glare of the noonday sun at first blinded him when he could see more clearly he found himself on the open western slope of the mountain which in the coast range was seldom wooded the spiced thicket stretched between him and the summit and again between him and the stage road that plunges from the terrace like forked lightning into the valley below he could command all the approaches without being seen not that this seemed to occupy his thoughts or cause him any anxiety his first act was to disencumber himself of his tattered coat he then filled and lighted his pipe and stretched himself fulllength on the open hillside as if to bleach in the fierce sun while smoking he carelessly perused the fragment of a newspaper which had enveloped his tobacco and being struck with some amusing paragraph read it half aloud again to some imaginary auditor emphasizing its humor with an hilarious slap upon his leg  possibly from the relaxation of fatigue and the bath which had become a vapor one as he alternately rolled and dried himself in the baking grass his eyes closed dreamily he was awakened by the sound of voices they were distant they were vague they approached no nearer he rolled himself to the verge of the first precipitous grassy descent there was another bank or plateau below him and then a confused depth of olive shadows pierced here and there by the spiked helmets of pines  there was no trace of habitation yet the voices were those of some monotonous occupation and lance distinctly heard through them the click of crockery and the ring of some household utensil it appeared to be the interjectional half listless half perfunctory domestic dialogue of an old man and a girl of which the words were unintelligible their voices indicated the solitude of the mountain but without sadness they were mysterious without being aweinspiring they might have uttered the dreariest commonplaces but in their vast isolation they seemed musical and eloquent lance drew his first sighthey had suggested dinner  careless as his nature was he was too cautious to risk detection in broad daylight he contented himself for the present with endeavoring to locate that particular part of the depths from which the voices seemed to rise it was more difficult however to select some other way of penetrating it than by the stage road theyre bound to have a fire or show a light when its dark he reasoned and satisfied with that reflection lay down again presently he began to amuse himself by tossing some silver coins in the air then his attention was directed to a spur of the coast range which had been sharply silhouetted against the cloudless western sky something intensely white something so small that it was scarcely larger than the silver coin in his hand was appearing in a slight cleft of the range  while he looked it gradually filled and obliterated the cleft in another moment the whole serrated line of mountain had disappeared the dense dazzling white encompassing host began to pour over and down every ravine and pass of the coast lance recognized the seafog and knew that scarcely twenty miles away lay the oceanand safety the drooping sun was now caught and hidden in its soft embraces a sudden chill breathed over the mountain he shivered rose and plunged again for very warmth into the spiceladen thicket the heated balsamic air began to affect him like a powerful sedative his hunger was forgotten in the languor of fatigue he slumbered when he awoke it was dark he groped his way through the thicket a few stars were shining directly above him but beyond and below everything was lost in the soft white fleecy veil of fog whatever light or fire might have betokened human habitation was hidden to push on blindly would be madness he could only wait for morning it suited the outcasts lazy philosophy he crept back again to his bed in the hollow and slept in that profound silence and shadow shut out from human association and sympathy by the ghostly fog what torturing visions conjured up by remorse and fear should have pursued him what spirit passed before him or slowly shaped itself out of the infinite blackness of the wood none as he slipped gently into that blackness he remembered with a slight regret some biscuits that were dropped from the coach by a careless luncheonconsuming passenger that pang over he slept as sweetly as profoundly as divinely as a child     chapter ii   he awoke with the aroma of the woods still steeping his senses his first instinct was that of all young animals he seized a few of the young tender green leaves of the yerba buena vine that crept over his mossy pillow and ate them being rewarded by a half berrylike flavor that seemed to soothe the cravings of his appetite the languor of sleep being still upon him he lazily watched the quivering of a sunbeam that was caught in the canopying boughs above then he dozed again hovering between sleeping and waking he became conscious of a slight movement among the dead leaves on the bank beside the hollow in which he lay the movement appeared to be intelligent and directed toward his revolver which glittered on the bank amused at this evident return of his larcenous friend of the previous day he lay perfectly still the movement and rustle continued but it now seemed long and undulating lances eyes suddenly became set he was intensely keenly awake it was not a snake but the hand of a human arm half hidden in the moss groping for the weapon in that flash of perception he saw that it was small bare and deeply freckled in an instant he grasped it firmly and rose to his feet dragging to his own level as he did so the struggling figure of a young girl  leave me go she said more ashamed than frightened  lance looked at her she was scarcely more than fifteen slight and lithe with a boyish flatness of breast and back her flushed face and bare throat were absolutely peppered with minute brown freckles like grains of spent gunpowder her eyes which were large and gray presented the singular spectacle of being also freckledat least they were shot through in pupil and cornea with tiny spots like powdered allspice her hair was even more remarkable in its tawny deerskin color full of lighter shades and bleached to the faintest of blondes on the crown of her head as if by the action of the sun she had evidently outgrown her dress which was made for a smaller child and the too brief skirt disclosed a bare freckled and sandy desert of shapely limb for which the darned stockings were equally too scant lance let his grasp slip from her thin wrist to her hand and then with a goodhumored gesture tossed it lightly back to her  she did not retreat but continued looking at him in a halfsurly embarrassment  i aint a bit frightened she said im not going to run awaydont you fear  glad to hear it said lance with unmistakable satisfaction but why did you go for my revolver  she flushed again and was silent presently she began to kick the earth at the roots of the tree and said as if confidentially to her foot  i wanted to get hold of it before you did  you didand why  oh you know why  every tooth in lances head showed that he did perfectly but he was discreetly silent  i didnt know what you were hiding there for she went on still addressing the tree and looking at him sideways under her white lashes i didnt see your face  this subtle compliment was the first suggestion of her artful sex it actually sent the blood into the careless rascals face and for a moment confused him he coughed so you thought youd freeze on to that sixshooter of mine until you saw my hand  she nodded then she picked up a broken hazel branch fitted it into the small of her back threw her tanned bare arms over the ends of it and expanded her chest and her biceps at the same moment this simple action was supposed to convey an impression at once of ease and muscular force  perhaps youd like to take it now said lance handing her the pistol  ive seen sixshooters before now said the girl evading the proffered weapon and its suggestion dad has one and my brother had two derringers before he was half as big as me  she stopped to observe in her companion the effect of this capacity of her family to bear arms lance only regarded her amusedly presently she again spoke abruptly  what made you eat that grass just now  grass echoed lance  yes there pointing to the yerba buena  lance laughed i was hungry look he said gayly tossing some silver into the air do you think you could get me some breakfast for that and have enough left to buy something for yourself  the girl eyed the money and the man with halfbashful curiosity  i reckon dad might give ye suthing if he had a mind ter though ez a rule hes down on tramps ever since they run off his chickens ye might try  but i want you to try you can bring it to me here  the girl retreated a step dropped her eyes and with a smile that was a charming hesitation between bashfulness and impudence said so you are hidin are ye  thats just it your heads level i am laughed lance unconcernedly  yur aint one o the mccarty gangare ye  mr lance harriott felt a momentary moral exaltation in declaring truthfully that he was not one of a notorious band of mountain freebooters known in the district under that name  nor ye aint one of them chicken lifters that raided hendersons ranch we dont go much on that kind o cattle yer  no said lance cheerfully  nor ye aint that chap ez beat his wife unto death at santa clara  lance honestly scorned the imputation such conjugal ill treatment as he had indulged in had not been physical and had been with other mens wives  there was a moments further hesitation on the part of the girl then she said shortly  well then i reckon you kin come along with me  where asked lance  to the ranch she replied simply  then you wont bring me anything to eat here  what for you kin get it down there lance hesitated i tell you its all right she continued ill make it all right with dad  but suppose i reckon id rather stay here persisted lance with a perfect consciousness however of affectation in his caution  stay away then said the girl coolly only as dad perempted this yer woods  preempted suggested lance  perempted or preempted as you like continued the girl scornfullyez hes got a holt on this yer woods ye might ez well see him down thar ez here for here hes like to come any minit you can bet your life on that  she must have read lances amusement in his eyes for she again dropped her own with a frown of brusque embarrassment come along then im your man said lance gayly extending his hand  she would not accept it eying it however furtively like a horse about to shy hand me your pistol first she said  he handed it to her with an assumption of gayety she received it on her part with unfeigned seriousness and threw it over her shoulder like a gun this combined action of the child and heroine it is quite unnecessary to say afforded lance undiluted joy  you go first she said  lance stepped promptly out with a broad grin looks kinder as if i was a prisoner dont it he suggested  go on and dont fool she replied  the two fared onward through the wood for one moment he entertained the facetious idea of appearing to rush frantically away just to see what the girl would do but abandoned it its an even thing if she wouldnt spot me the first pop he reflected admiringly  when they had reached the open hillside lance stopped inquiringly this way she said pointing toward the summit and in quite an opposite direction to the valley where he had heard the voices one of which he now recognized as hers they skirted the thicket for a few moments and then turned sharply into a trail which began to dip toward a ravine leading to the valley  why do you have to go all the way round he asked  we dont the girl replied with emphasis theres a shorter cut  where  thats telling she answered shortly  whats your name asked lance after a steep scramble and a drop into the ravine  flip  what  flip  i mean your first nameyour front name  flip  flip oh short for felipa  it aint flipperits flip and she relapsed into silence  you dont ask me mine suggested lance  she did not vouchsafe a reply  then you dont want to know  maybe dad will you can lie to him  this direct answer apparently sustained the agreeable homicide for some moments he moved onward silently exuding admiration  only added flip with a sudden caution youd better agree with me  the trail here turned again abruptly and reentered the canyon lance looked up and noticed they were almost directly beneath the bay thicket and the plateau that towered far above them the trail here showed signs of clearing and the way was marked by felled trees and stumps of pines  what does your father do here he finally asked flip remained silent swinging the revolver lance repeated his question  burns charcoal and makes diamonds said flip looking at him from the corners of her eyes  makes diamonds echoed lance  flip nodded her head  many of em he continued carelessly  lots but theyre not big she returned with a sidelong glance  oh theyre not big said lance gravely  they had by this time reached a small staked inclosure whence the sudden fluttering and cackle of poultry welcomed the return of the evident mistress of this sylvan retreat it was scarcely imposing further on a cooking stove under a tree a saddle and bridle a few household implements scattered about indicated the ranch like most pioneer clearings it was simply a disorganized raid upon nature that had left behind a desolate battlefield strewn with waste and decay the fallen trees the crushed thicket the splintered limbs the rudely tornup soil were made hideous by their grotesque juxtaposition with the wrecked fragments of civilization in empty cans broken bottles battered hats soleless boots frayed stockings castoff rags and the crowning absurdity of the twistedwire skeleton of a hooped skirt hanging from a branch the wildest defile the densest thicket the most virgin solitude was less dreary and forlorn than this first footprint of man the only redeeming feature of this prolonged bivouac was the cabin itself built of the halfcylindrical strips of pine bark and thatched with the same material it had a certain picturesque rusticity but this was an accident of economy rather than taste for which flip apologized by saying that the bark of the pine was no good for charcoal  i reckon dads in the woods she added pausing before the open door of the cabin oh dad her voice clear and high seemed to fill the whole long canyon and echoed from the green plateau above the monotonous strokes of an axe were suddenly pretermitted and somewhere from the depths of the closeset pines a voice answered flip there was a pause of a few moments with some muttering stumbling and crackling in the underbrush and then the sudden appearance of dad  had lance first met him in the thicket he would have been puzzled to assign his race to mongolian indian or ethiopian origin perfunctory but incomplete washings of his hands and face after charcoal burning had gradually ground into his skin a grayish slatepencil pallor grotesquely relieved at the edges where the washing had left off with a border of a darker color he looked like an overworked christy minstrel with the briefest of intervals between his performances there were black rims in the orbits of his eyes as if he gazed feebly out of unglazed spectacles which heightened his simian resemblance already grotesquely exaggerated by what appeared to be repeated and spasmodic experiments in dyeing his gray hair without the slightest notice of lance he inflicted his protesting and querulous presence entirely on his daughter  well whats up now yer ye are calling me from work an hour before noon dog my skin ef i ever get fairly limbered up afore its dad and oh dad  to lances intense satisfaction the girl received this harangue with an air of supreme indifference and when dad had relapsed into an unintelligible and as it seemed to lance a halffrightened muttering she said coolly  yed better drop that axe and scoot round getten this stranger some breakfast and some grub to take with him hes one of them san francisco sports out here trout fishing in the branch hes got adrift from his party has lost his rod and fixins and had to camp out last night in the gin and ginger woods  thats just it its allers suthin like that screamed the old man dashing his fist on his leg in a feeble impotent passion but without looking at lance why in blazes dont he go up to that there blamed hotel on the summit why in thunder but here he caught his daughters large freckled eyes full in his own he blinked feebly his voice fell into a tone of whining entreaty now look yer flip its playing it rather low down on the old man this yer running in o tramps and desarted emigrants and castashore sailors and forlorn widders and ravin lunatics on this yer ranch i put it to you mister he said abruptly turning to lance for the first time but as if he had already taken an active part in the conversationi put it as a gentleman yourself and a fairminded sportin man if this is the square thing  before lance could reply flip had already begun thats just it dye reckon being a sportin man and an a 1 feller hes goin to waltz down inter that hotel rigged out ez he is dye reckon hes goin to let his partners get the laugh outer him dye reckon hes goin to show his head outer this yer ranch till he can do it square not much go long dad youre talking silly  the old man weakened he feebly trailed his axe between his legs to a stump and sat down wiping his forehead with his sleeve and imparting to it the appearance of a slate with a difficult sum partly rubbed out he looked despairingly at lance in course he said with a deep sigh you naturally aint got any money in course you left your pocketbook containing fifty dollars under a stone and cant find it in course he continued as he observed lance put his hand to his pocket youve only got a blank check on wells fargo  co for a hundred dollars and youd like me to give you the difference  amused as lance evidently was at this his absolute admiration for flip absorbed everything else with his eyes fixed upon the girl he briefly assured the old man that he would pay for everything he wanted he did this with a manner quite different from the careless easy attitude he had assumed toward flip at least the quickwitted girl noticed it and wondered if he was angry it was quite true that ever since his eye had fallen upon another of his own sex its glance had been less frank and careless certain traits of possible impatience which might develop into manslaying were coming to the fore yet a word or a gesture of flips was sufficient to change that manner and when with the fretful assistance of her father she had prepared a somewhat sketchy and primitive repast he questioned the old man about diamondmaking the eye of dad kindled  i want ter know how ye knew i was making diamonds he asked with a certain bashful pettishness not unlike his daughters  heard it in frisco replied lance with glib mendacity glancing at the girl  i reckon theyre gettin sort of skeert down therethem jewelers chuckled dad yet its in nater that their figgers will have to come down its only a question of the price of charcoal i suppose they didnt tell you how i made the discovery  lance would have stopped the old mans narrative by saying that he knew the story but he wished to see how far flip lent herself to her fathers delusion  ye see one night about two years ago i had a pit o charcoal burning out there and tho it had been a smouldering and a smoking and a blazing for nigh unto a month somehow it didnt charcoal worth a cent and yet dog my skin but the heat o that er pit was suthin hidyus and frightful ye couldnt stand within a hundred yards of it and they could feel it on the stage road three miles over yon tother side the mountain there was nights when me and flip had to take our blankets up the ravine and camp out all night and the back of this yer hut shriveled up like that bacon it was about as nigh on to hell as any sample ye kin get here now mebbe you think i built that air fire mebbe youll allow the heat was just the natral burning of that pit  certainly said lance trying to see flips eyes which were resolutely averted  thets whar youd be lyin that yar heat kem out of the bowels of the yearthkem up like out of a chimbley or a blast and kep up that yar fire and when she cools down a month after and i got to strip her there was a hole in the yearth and a spring o bilin scaldin water pourin out of it ez big as your waist and right in the middle of it was this yer he rose with the instinct of a skillful raconteur and whisked from under his bunk a chamois leather bag which he emptied on the table before them it contained a small fragment of native rock crystal halffused upon a petrified bit of pine it was so glaringly truthful so really what it purported to be that the most unscientific woodman or pioneer would have understood it at a glance lance raised his mirthful eyes to flip  it was cooled suddintstunted by the water said the girl eagerly she stopped and as abruptly turned away her eyes and her reddened face  thats it thats just it continued the old man thars flip thar knows it she aint no fool lance did not speak but turned a hard unsympathizing look upon the old man and rose almost roughly the old man clutched his coat thats it ye see the carbons just turning to dimens and stunted and why cos the heat wasnt kep up long enough mebbe yer think i stopped thar that aint me thars a pit out yar in the woods ez hez been burning six months it haint in course got the advantages o the old one for its natral heat but im keeping that heat up ive got a hole where i kin watch it every four hours when the time comes im thar dont you see thats me thats david fairleythats the old manyou bet  thats so said lance curtly and now mr fairley if youll hand me over a coat or a jacket till i can get past these fogs on the monterey road i wont keep you from your diamond pit he threw down a handful of silver on the table  thers a deerskin jacket yer said the old man that one o them vaqueros left for the price of a bottle of whiskey  i reckon it wouldnt suit the stranger said flip dubiously producing a muchworn slashed and braided vaqueros jacket but it did suit lance who found it warm and also had suddenly found a certain satisfaction in opposing flip when he had put it on and nodded coldly to the old man and carelessly to flip he walked to the door  if youre going to take the monterey road i can show you a short cut to it said flip with a certain kind of shy civility  the paternal fairley groaned thats it let the chickens and the ranch go to thunder as long as theres a stranger to trapse round with go on  lance would have made some savage reply but flip interrupted you know yourself dad its a blind trail and as that ere constable that kem out here hunting french pete couldnt find it and had to go round by the canyon like ez not the stranger would lose his way and have to come back this dangerous prospect silenced the old man and flip and lance stepped into the road together they walked on for some moments without speaking suddenly lance turned upon his companion  you didnt swallow all that rot about the diamond did you he asked crossly  flip ran a little ahead as if to avoid a reply  you dont mean to say thats the sort of hog wash the old man serves out to you regularly continued lance becoming more slangy in his ill temper  i dont know that its any consarn o yours what i think replied flip hopping from boulder to boulder as they crossed the bed of a dry watercourse  and i suppose youve piloted round and drynussed every tramp and dead beat youve met since you came here continued lance with unmistakable ill humor how many have you helped over this road  its a year since there was a chinaman chased by some irishmen from the crossing into the brush about yer and he was too afeered to come out and nigh most starved to death in thar i had to drag him out and start him on the mountain for you couldnt get him back to the road he was the last one but you  do you reckon its the right thing for a girl like you to run about with trash of this kind and mix herself up with all sorts of rough and bad company said lance  flip stopped short look if youre goin to talk like dad ill go back  the ridiculousness of such a resemblance struck him more keenly than a consciousness of his own ingratitude he hastened to assure flip that he was joking when he had made his peace they fell into talk again lance becoming unselfish enough to inquire into one or two facts concerning her life which did not immediately affect him her mother had died on the plains when she was a baby and her brother had run away from home at twelve she fully expected to see him again and thought he might sometime stray into their canyon that is why then you take so much stock in tramps said lance you expect to recognize him  well replied flip gravely there is suthing in that and theres suthing in this some o these chaps might run across brother and do him a good turn for the sake of me  like me for instance suggested lance  like you youd do him a good turn wouldnt you  you bet said lance with a sudden emotion that quite startled him only dont you go to throwing yourself round promiscuously he was halfconscious of an irritating sense of jealousy as he asked if any of her proteges had ever returned  no said flip no one ever did it shows she added with sublime simplicity i had done em good and they could get on alone dont it  it does responded lance grimly have you any other friends that come  only the postmaster at the crossing  the postmaster  yes hes reckonin to marry me next year if im big enough  and what do you reckon asked lance earnestly  flip began a series of distortions with her shoulders ran on ahead picked up a few pebbles and threw them into the wood glanced back at lance with swimming mottled eyes that seemed a piquant incarnation of everything suggestive and tantalizing and said  thats telling  they had by this time reached the spot where they were to separate look said flip pointing to a faint deflection of their path which seemed however to lose itself in the underbrush a dozen yards away thers your trail it gets plainer and broader the further you get on but you must use your eyes here and get to know it well afore you get into the fog goodby  goodby lance took her hand and drew her beside him she was still redolent of the spices of the thicket and to the young mans excited fancy seemed at that moment to personify the perfume and intoxication of her native woods half laughingly half earnestly he tried to kiss her she struggled for some time strongly but at the last moment yielded with a slight return and the exchange of a subtle fire that thrilled him and left him standing confused and astounded as she ran away he watched her lithe nymphlike figure disappear in the checkered shadows of the wood and then he turned briskly down the halfhidden trail his eyesight was keen he made good progress and was soon well on his way toward the distant ridge  but flips return had not been as rapid when she reached the wood she crept to its beetling verge and looking across the canyon watched lances figure as it vanished and reappeared in the shadows and sinuosities of the ascent when he reached the ridge the outlying fog crept across the summit caught him in its embrace and wrapped him from her gaze flip sighed raised herself put her alternate foot on a stump and took a long pull at her toobrief stockings when she had pulled down her skirt and endeavored once more to renew the intimacy that had existed in previous years between the edge of her petticoat and the top of her stockings she sighed again and went home     chapter iii   for six months the sea fogs monotonously came and went along the monterey coast for six months they beleaguered the coast range with afternoon sorties of white hosts that regularly swept over the mountain crest and were as regularly beaten back again by the leveled lances of the morning sun for six months that white veil which had once hidden lance harriott in its folds returned without him for that amiable outlaw no longer needed disguise or hidingplace the swift wave of pursuit that had dashed him on the summit had fallen back and the next day was broken and scattered before the week had passed a regular judicial inquiry relieved his crime of premeditation and showed it to be a rude duel of two armed and equally desperate men from a secure vantage in a seacoast town lance challenged a trial by his peers and as an already prejudged man escaping from his executioners obtained a change of venue regular justice seated by the calm pacific found the action of an interior irregular jury rash and hasty lance was liberated on bail  the postmaster at fishers crossing had just received the weekly mail and express from san francisco and was engaged in examining it it consisted of five letters and two parcels of these three of the letters and the two parcels were directed to flip it was not the first time during the last six months that this extraordinary event had occurred and the curiosity of the crossing was duly excited as flip had never called personally for the letters or parcels but had sent one of her wild irregular scouts or henchmen to bring them and as she was seldom seen at the crossing or on the stage road that curiosity was never satisfied the disappointment to the postmastera man past the middle agepartook of a sentimental nature he looked at the letters and parcels he looked at his watch it was yet early he could return by noon he again examined the addresses they were in the same handwriting as the previous letters his mind was made up he would deliver them himself the poetic soulful side of his mission was delicately indicated by a pale blue necktie a clean shirt and a small package of gingernuts of which flip was extravagantly fond  the common road to fairleys ranch was by the stage turnpike to a point below the gin and ginger woods where the prudent horseman usually left his beast and followed the intersecting trail afoot it was here that the postmaster suddenly observed on the edge of the wood the figure of an elegantlydressed woman she was walking slowly and apparently at her ease one hand held her skirts lightly gathered between her gloved fingers the other slowly swung a riding whip was it a picnic of some people from monterey or santa cruz the spectacle was novel enough to justify his coming nearer suddenly she withdrew into the wood he lost sight of her she was gone he remembered however that flip was still to be seen and as the steep trail was beginning to tax all his energies he was fain to hurry forward the sun was nearly vertical when he turned into the canyon and saw the bark roof of the cabin beyond at almost the same moment flip appeared flushed and panting in the road before him  youve got something for me she said pointing to the parcel and letters completely taken by surprise the postmaster mechanically yielded them up and as instantly regretted it theyre paid for continued flip observing his hesitation  thats so stammered the official of the crossing seeing his last chance of knowing the contents of the parcel vanish but i thought ez its a valooable package maybe ye might want to examine it to see that it was all right afore ye receipted for it  ill risk it said flip coolly and if it aint right ill let ye know  as the girl seemed inclined to retire with her property the postmaster was driven to other conversation we aint had the pleasure of seeing you down at the crossing for a month o sundays he began with airy yet pronounced gallantry some folks let on you was keepin company with some feller like bijah brown and you were getting a little too set up for the crossing the individual here mentioned being the county butcher and supposed to exhibit his hopeless affection for flip by making a long and useless divergence from his weekly route to enter the canyon for orders flip did not deem it necessary to reply then i allowed how ez you might have company he continued i reckon theres some city folks up at the summit i saw a mighty smart fashnble gal cavorting round had no end o style and fancy fixins thats my kind i tell you i just weaken on that sort o gal he continued in the firm belief that he had awakened flips jealousy as he glanced at her wellworn homespun frock and found her eyes suddenly fixed on his own  strange i aint got to see her yet she replied coolly shouldering her parcel and quite ignoring any sense of obligation to him for his extraofficial act  but you might get to see her at the edge of the gin and ginger woods he persisted feebly in a last effort to detain her if youll take a pasear there with me flips only response was to walk on toward the cabin whence with a vague complimentary suggestion of droppin in to pass the time o day with her father the postmaster meekly followed  the paternal fairley once convinced that his daughters new companion required no pecuniary or material assistance from his hands relaxed to the extent of entering into a querulous confidence with him during which flip took the opportunity of slipping away as fairley had that infelicitous tendency of most weak natures to unconsciously exaggerate unimportant details in their talk the postmaster presently became convinced that the butcher was a constant and assiduous suitor of flips the absurdity of his sending parcels and letters by post when he might bring them himself did not strike the official on the contrary he believed it to be a master stroke of cunning fired by jealousy and flips indifference he deemed it his dutyusing that facile form of cowardly offensivenessto betray flip  of which she was happily oblivious once away from the cabin she plunged into the woods with the parcel swung behind her like a knapsack leaving the trail she presently struck off in a straight line through cover and underbrush with the unerring instinct of an animal climbing hand over hand the steepest ascent or fluttering like a bird from branch to branch down the deepest declivity she soon reached that part of the trail where the susceptible postmaster had seen the fascinating unknown assuring herself she was not followed she crept through the thicket until she reached a little waterfall and basin that had served the fugitive lance for a bath the spot bore signs of later and more frequent occupancy and when flip carefully removed some bark and brushwood from a cavity in the rock and drew forth various folded garments it was evident she had used it as a sylvan dressingroom here she opened the parcel it contained a small and delicate shawl of yellow china crepe flip instantly threw it over her shoulders and stepped hurriedly toward the edge of the wood then she began to pass backward and forward before the trunk of a tree at first nothing was visible on the tree but a closer inspection showed a large pane of ordinary window glass stuck in the fork of the branches it was placed at such a cunning angle against the darkness of the forest opening that it made a soft and mysterious mirror not unlike a claude lorraine glass wherein not only the passing figure of the young girl was seen but the dazzling green and gold of the hillside and the faroff silhouetted crests of the coast range  but this was evidently only a prelude to a severer rehearsal when she returned to the waterfall she unearthed from her stores a large piece of yellow soap and some yards of rough cotton sheeting these she deposited beside the basin and again crept to the edge of the wood to assure herself that she was alone satisfied that no intruding foot had invaded that virgin bower she returned to her bath and began to undress a slight wind followed her and seemed to whisper to the circumjacent trees it appeared to waken her sister naiads and nymphs who joining their leafy fingers softly drew around her a gently moving band of trembling lights and shadows of flecked sprays and inextricably mingled branches and involved her in a chaste sylvan obscurity veiled alike from pursuing god or stumbling shepherd within these hallowed precincts was the musical ripple of laughter and falling water and at times the glimpse of a lithe briercaught limb or a ray of sunlight trembling over bright flanks or the white austere outline of a childish bosom  when she drew again the leafy curtain and once more stepped out of the wood she was completely transformed it was the figure that had appeared to the postmaster the slight erect graceful form of a young woman modishly attired it was flip but flip made taller by the lengthened skirt and clinging habiliments of fashion flip freckled but through the cunning of a relief of yellow color in her gown her piquant brownshot face and eyes brightened and intensified until she seemed like a spicy odor made visible i cannot affirm that the judgment of flips mysterious modiste was infallible or that the taste of mr lance harriott her patron was fastidious enough that it was picturesque and perhaps not more glaring and extravagant than the color in which spring herself had once clothed the sere hillside where flip was now seated the phantom mirror in the tree fork caught and held her with the sky the green leaves the sunlight and all the graciousness of her surroundings and the wind gently tossed her hair and the gay ribbons of her gypsy hat suddenly she started some remote sound in the trail below inaudible to any ear less fine than hers arrested her breathing she rose swiftly and darted into cover  ten minutes passed the sun was declining the white fog was beginning to creep over the coast range from the edge of the wood cinderella appeared disenchanted and in her homespun garments the clock had struckthe spell was past as she disappeared down the trail even the magic mirror moved by the wind slipped from the tree top to the ground and became a piece of common glass     chapter iv   the events of the day had produced a remarkable impression on the facial aspect of the charcoalburning fairley extraordinary processes of thought indicated by repeated rubbing of his forehead had produced a high light in the middle and a corresponding deepening of shadow at the sides until it bore the appearance of a perfect sphere it was this forehead that confronted flip reproachfully as became a deceived comrade menacingly as became an outraged parent in the presence of a third party anda postmaster  fine doins this yer receivin clandecent bundles and letters eh he began flip sent one swift withering look of contempt at the postmaster who at once becoming invertebrate and groveling mumbled that he must get on to the crossing and rose to go but the old man who had counted on his presence for moral support and was clearly beginning to hate him for precipitating this scene with his daughter whom he feared violently protested  sit down cant ye dont you see youre a witness he screamed hysterically  it was a fatal suggestion witness repeated flip scornfully  yes a witness he gave ye letters and bundles  werent they directed to me asked flip  yes said the postmaster hesitatingly in course yes  do you lay claim to them she said turning to her father  no responded the old man  do you sharply to the postmaster  no he replied  then said flip coolly if youre not claimin em for yourself and you hear father say they aint his i reckon the less you have to say about em the better  thars suthin in that said the old man shamelessly abandoning the postmaster  then why dont she say who sent em and what they are like said the postmaster if theres nothin in it  yes echoed dad flip why dont you  without answering the direct question flip turned upon her father  maybe you forget how you used to row and tear round here because tramps and such like came to the ranch for suthin and i gave it to em maybe youll quit tearin round and letting yourself be made a fool of now by that man just because one of those tramps gets up and sends us some presents back in turn  twasnt me flip said the old man deprecatingly but glaring at the astonished postmaster twasnt my doin i allus said if you cast your bread on the waters it would come back to you by return mail the fact is the govment is gettin too highhanded some o these bloated officials had better climb down before next leckshen  maybe continued flip to her father without looking at her discomfited visitor yed better find out whether one of those officials comes up to this yer ranch to steal away a gal about my own size or to get points about diamondmaking i reckon he dont travel round to find out who writes all the letters that go through the post office  the postmaster had seemingly miscalculated the old mans infirm temper and the daughters skillful use of it he was unprepared for flips boldness and audacity and when he saw that both barrels of the accusation had taken effect on the charcoal burner who was rising with epileptic rage he fairly turned and fled the old man would have followed him with objurgation beyond the door but for the restraining hand of flip  baffled and beaten nevertheless fate was not wholly unkind to the retreating suitor near the gin and ginger woods he picked up a letter which had fallen from flips pocket he recognized the writing and did not scruple to read it it was not a love epistleat least not such a one as he would have writtenit did not give the address nor the name of the correspondent but he read the following with greedy eyes   perhaps its just as well that you dont rig yourself out for the benefit of those dead beats at the crossing or any tramp that might hang round the ranch keep all your style for me when i come i cant tell you when its mighty uncertain before the rainy season but im coming soon dont go back on your promise about lettin up on the tramps and being a little more hightoned and dont you give em so much its true i sent you hats twice i clean forgot all about the first but i wouldnt have given a tendollar hat to a nigger woman who had a sick baby because i had an extra hat id have let that baby slide i forgot to ask whether the skirt is worn separately i must see the dressmaking sharp about it but i think youll want something on besides a jacket and skirt at least it looks like it up here i dont think you could manage a piano down there without the old man knowing it and raisin the devil generally i promised you id let up on him mind you keep all your promises to me im glad youre gettin on with the sixshooter tin cans are good at fifteen yards but try it on suthin that moves i forgot to say that i am on the track of your big brother its a three years old track and he was in arizona the friend who told me didnt expatiate much on what he did there but i reckon they had a high old time if hes above the earth ill find him you bet the yerba buena and the southern wood came all rightthey smelt like you say flip do you remember the lastthe very lastthing that happened when you said goodby on the trail dont let me ever find out that youve let anybody else kiss   but here the virtuous indignation of the postmaster found vent in an oath he threw the letter away he retained of it only two factsflip had a brother who was missing she had a lover present in the flesh  how much of the substance of this and previous letters flip had confided to her father i cannot say if she suppressed anything it was probably that which affected lances secret alone and it was doubtful how much of that she herself knew in her own affairs she was frank without being communicative and never lost her shy obstinacy even with her father governing the old man as completely as she did she appeared most embarrassed when she was most dominant she had her own way without lifting her voice or her eyes she seemed oppressed by mauvaise honte when she was most triumphant she would end a discussion with a shy murmur addressed to herself or a single gesture of selfconsciousness  the disclosure of her strange relations with an unknown man and the exchange of presents and confidences seemed to suddenly awake fairley to a vague uneasy sense of some unfulfilled duties as a parent the first effect of this on his weak nature was a peevish antagonism to the cause of it he had long fretful monologues on the vanity of diamondmaking if accompanied with a pestering by interlopers on the wickedness of concealment and conspiracy and their effects on charcoalburning on the nurturing of spies and adders in the family circle and on the seditiousness of dark and mysterious councils in which a grayhaired father was left out it was true that a word or look from flip generally brought these monologues to an inglorious and abrupt termination but they were none the less lugubrious as long as they lasted in time they were succeeded by an affectation of contrite apology and selfdepreciation dont go out o the way to ask the old man he would say referring to the quantity of bacon to be ordered its natral a young gal should have her own advisers the state of the flour barrel would also produce a like selfabasement unless yere already in correspondence about more flour ye might take the opinion o the first tramp ye meet ez to whether santa cruz mills is a good brand but dont ask the old man if flip was in conversation with the butcher fairley would obtrusively retire with the hope he wasnt intrudin on their secrets  these phases of her fathers weakness were not frequent enough to excite her alarm but she could not help noticing they were accompanied with a seriousness unusual to him he began to be tremulously watchful of her returning often from work at an earlier hour and lingering by the cabin in the morning he brought absurd and useless presents for her and presented them with a nervous anxiety poorly concealed by an assumption of careless paternal generosity suthin i picked up at the crossin for ye today he would say airily and retire to watch the effect of a pair of shoes two sizes too large or a fur cap in september he would have hired a cheap parlor organ for her but for the apparently unexpected revelation that she couldnt play he had received the news of a clue to his longlost son without emotion but lately he seemed to look upon it as a foregone conclusion and one that necessarily solved the question of companionship for flip in course when youve got your own flesh and blood with ye ye cant go foolin around with strangers these autumnal blossoms of affection i fear came too late for any effect upon flip precociously matured by her fathers indifference and selfishness but she was good humored and seeing him seriously concerned gave him more of her time even visited him in the sacred seclusion of the diamond pit and listened with faroff eyes to his fitful indictment of all things outside his grimy laboratory much of this patient indifference came with a capricious change in her own habits she no longer indulged in the rehearsal of dress she packed away her most treasured garments and her leafy boudoir knew her no more she sometimes walked on the hillside and often followed the trail she had taken with lance when she led him to the ranch she once or twice extended her walk to the spot where she had parted from him and as often came shyly away her eyes downcast and her face warm with color perhaps because these experiences and some mysterious instinct of maturing womanhood had left a story in her eyes which her two adorers the postmaster and the butcher read with passion she became famous without knowing it extravagant stories of her fascinations brought strangers into the valley the effect upon her father may be imagined lance could not have desired a more effective guardian than he proved to be in this emergency those who had been told of this hidden pearl were surprised to find it so jealously protected     chapter v   the long parched summer had drawn to its dusty close much of it was already blown abroad and dissipated on trail and turnpike or crackled in harsh unelastic fibres on hillside and meadow some of it had disappeared in the palpable smoke by day and fiery crests by night of burning forests the besieging fogs on the coast range daily thinned their hosts and at last vanished the wind changed from northwest to southwest the salt breath of the sea was on the summit and then one day the staring unchanged sky was faintly touched with remote mysterious clouds and grew tremulous in expression the next morning dawned upon a newer face in the heavens on changed woods on altered outlines on vanished crests on forgotten distances it was raining  four weeks of this change with broken spaces of sunlight and intense blue aerial islands and then a storm set in all day the summit pines and redwoods rocked in the blast at times the onset of the rain seemed to be held back by the fury of the gale or was visibly seen in sharp waves on the hillside unknown and concealed watercourses suddenly overflowed the trails pools became lakes and brooks rivers hidden from the storm the sylvan silence of sheltered valleys was broken by the impetuous rush of waters even the tiny streamlet that traversed flips retreat in the gin and ginger woods became a cascade  the storm drove fairley from his couch early the falling of a large tree across the trail and the sudden overflow of a small stream beside it hastened his steps but he was doomed to encounter what was to him a more disagreeable objecta human figure by the bedraggled drapery that flapped and fluttered in the wind by the long unkempt hair that hid the face and eyes and by the grotesquely misplaced bonnet the old man recognized one of his old trespassersan indian squaw  clear out er that come make tracks will ye the old man screamed but here the wind stopped his voice and drove him against a hazel bush  me heap sick answered the squaw shivering through her muddy shawl  ill make ye a heap sicker if ye dont vamose the ranch continued fairley advancing  me wantee wangee girl wangee girl give me heap grub said the squaw without moving  you bet your life groaned the old man to himself nevertheless an idea struck him ye aint brought no presents hev ye he asked cautiously ye aint got no pooty things for poor wangee girl he continued insinuatingly  me got heap cache nuts and berries said the squaw  oh in course in course thats just it screamed fairley youve got em cached only two mile from yer and youll go and get em for a half dollar cash down  me bring wangee girl to cache replied the indian pointing to the wood honest injin  another bright idea struck mr fairley but it required some elaboration hurrying the squaw with him through the pelting rain he reached the shelter of the corral vainly the shivering aborigine drew her tightly bandaged papoose closer to her square flat breast and looked longingly toward the cabin the old man backed her against the palisade here he cautiously imparted his dark intentions to employ her to keep watch and ward over the ranch and especially over its young mistressclear out all the tramps ceptin yourself and ill keep ye in grub and rum many and deliberate repetitions of this offer in various forms at last seemed to affect the squaw she nodded violently and echoed the last word rum now she added the old man hesitated she was in possession of his secret he groaned and promising an immediate installment of liquor led her to the cabin  the door was so securely fastened against the impact of the storm that some moments elapsed before the bar was drawn and the old man had become impatient and profane when it was partly opened by flip he hastily slipped in dragging the squaw after him and cast one single suspicious glance around the rude apartment which served as a sittingroom flip had apparently been writing a small inkstand was still on the board table but her paper had evidently been concealed before she allowed them to enter the squaw instantly squatted before the adobe hearth warmed her bundled baby and left the ceremony of introduction to her companion flip regarded the two with calm preoccupation and indifference the only thing that touched her interest was the old squaws draggled skirt and limp neckerchief they were flips own long since abandoned and cast off in the gin and ginger woods secrets again whined fairley still eying flip furtively secrets again in coursein coursejiss so secrets that must be kep from the ole man dark doins by ones own flesh and blood go on go on dont mind me flip did not reply she had even lost the interest in her old dress perhaps it had only touched some note in unison with her revery  cant ye get the poor critter some whiskey he queried fretfully ye used to be peart enuff before as flip turned to the corner to lift the demijohn fairley took occasion to kick the squaw with his foot and indicate by extravagant pantomime that the bargain was not to be alluded to before the girl flip poured out some whiskey in a tin cup and approaching the squaw handed it to her its like ez not continued fairley to his daughter but looking at the squaw that shell be huntin the woods off and on and kinder looking after the last pit near the madronos yell give her grub and licker ez she likes well dye hear flip are ye moonin agin with yer secrets whats gone with ye  if the child were dreaming it was a delicious dream her magnetic eyes were suffused by a strange light as though the eye itself had blushed her full pulse showed itself more in the rounding outline of her cheek than in any deepening of color indeed if there was any heightening of tint it was in her freckles which fairly glistened like tiny spangles her eyes were downcast her shoulders slightly bent but her voice was low and clear and thoughtful as ever  one o the big pines above the madrono pit has blown over into the run she said its choked up the water and its risin fast like ez not its pourin over into the pit by this time  the old man rose with a fretful cry and why in blames didnt you say so first he screamed catching up his axe and rushing to the door  ye didnt give me a chance said flip raising her eyes for the first time with an impatient imprecation fairley darted by her and rushed into the wood in an instant she had shut the door and bolted it in the same instant the squaw arose dashed the long hair not only from her eyes but from her head tore away her shawl and blanket and revealed the square shoulders of lance harriott flip remained leaning against the door but the young man in rising dropped the bandaged papoose which rolled from his lap into the fire flip with a cry sprang toward it but lance caught her by the waist with one arm as with the other he dragged the bundle from the flames  dont be alarmed he said gayly its only  what said flip trying to disengage herself  my coat and trousers  flip laughed which encouraged lance to another attempt to kiss her she evaded it by diving her head into his waistcoat and saying theres father  but hes gone to clear away that tree suggested lance  one of flips significant silences followed  oh i see he laughed that was a plan to get him away ah she had released herself  why did you come like that she said pointing to his wig and blanket  to see if youd know me he responded  no said flip dropping her eyes its to keep other people from knowing you youre hidin agin  i am returned lance but he interrupted its only the same old thing  but you wrote from monterey that it was all over she persisted  so it would have been he said gloomily but for some dog down here who is hunting up an old scent ill spot him yet and he stopped suddenly with such utter abstraction of hatred in his fixed and glittering eyes that she almost feared him she laid her hand quite unconsciously on his arm he grasped it his face changed  i couldnt wait any longer to see you flip so i came here anyway he went on i thought to hang round and get a chance to speak to you first when i fell afoul of the old man he didnt know me and tumbled right in my little game why do you believe he wants to hire me for my grub and liquor to act as a sort of sentry over you and the ranch and here he related with great gusto the substance of his interview i reckon as hes that suspicious he concluded id better play it out now as ive begun only its mighty hard i cant see you here before the fire in your fancy toggery flip but must dodge in and out of the wet underbrush in these yer duds of yours that i picked up in the old place in the gin and ginger woods  then you came here just to see me asked flip  i did  for only that  only that  flip dropped her eyes lance had got his other arm around her waist but her resisting little hand was still potent  listen she said at last without looking up but apparently talking to the intruding arm when dad comes ill get him to send you to watch the diamond pit it isnt far its warm and  what  ill come after a bit and see you quit foolin now if youd only have come here like yourselflikelikea white man  the old man interrupted lance would have just passed me on to the summit i couldnt have played the lost fisherman on him at this time of year  ye could have been stopped at the crossing by high water you silly said the girl it was this grammatical obscurity referred to the stage coach  yes but i might have been tracked to this cabin and look here flip he said suddenly straightening himself and lifting the girls face to a level with his own i dont want you to lie any more for me it aint right  all right ye neednt go to the pit then and i wont come  flip  and heres dad coming quick  lance chose to put his own interpretation on this last adjuration the resisting little hand was now lying quite limp on his shoulder he drew her brown bright face near his own felt her spiced breath on his lips his cheeks his hot eyelids his swimming eyes kissed her hurriedly replaced his wig and blanket and dropped beside the fire with the tremulous laugh of youth and innocent first passion flip had withdrawn to the window and was looking out upon the rocking pines  he dont seem to be coming said lance with a halfshy laugh  no responded flip demurely pressing her hot oval cheek against the wet panes i reckon i was mistaken youre sure she added looking resolutely another way but still trembling like a magnetic needle toward lance as he moved slightly before the fire youre sure youd like me to come to you  sure flip  hush said flip as this reassuring query of reproachful astonishment appeared about to be emphasized by a forward amatory dash of lances hush hes coming this time sure  it was indeed fairley exceedingly wet exceedingly bedraggled exceedingly sponged out as to color and exceedingly profane it appeared that there was indeed a tree that had fallen in the run but that far from diverting the overflow into the pit it had established back water which had forced another outlet all this might have been detected at once by any human intellect not distracted by correspondence with strangers and enfeebled by habitually scorning the intellect of its own progenitor this reckless selfishness had further only resulted in giving rheumatics to that progenitor who now required the external administration of opodeldoc to his limbs and the internal administration of whiskey having thus spoken mr fairley with great promptitude and infantine simplicity at once bared two legs of entirely different colors and mutely waited for his daughter to rub them if flip did this all unconsciously and with the mechanical dexterity of previous habit it was because she did not quite understand the savage eyes and impatient gestures of lance in his encompassing wig and blanket and because it helped her to voice her thought  yell never be able to take yer watch at the diamond pit tonight dad she said and ive been recknin you might set the squaw there instead i can show her what to do  but to flips momentary discomfiture her father promptly objected mebbee ive got suthin else for her to do mebbee i may have my secrets tooeh he said with dark significance at the same time administering a significant nudge to lance which kept up the young mans exasperation no shell rest yer a bit just now ill set her to watchin suthin else like as not when i want her flip fell into one of her suggestive silences lance watched her earnestly mollified by a single furtive glance from her significant eyes the rain dashed against the windows and occasionally spattered and hissed in the hearth of the broad chimney and mr david fairley somewhat assuaged by the internal administration of whiskey grew more loquacious the genius of incongruity and inconsistency which generally ruled his conduct came out with freshened vigor under the gentle stimulation of spirit on an evening like this he began comfortably settling himself on the floor beside the chimney ye might rig yerself out in them new duds and fancy fixins that that sacramento shrimp sent ye and let your own flesh and blood see ye if thats too much to do for your old dad ye might do it to please that digger squaw as a christian act whether in the hidden depths of the old mans consciousness there was a feeling of paternal vanity in showing this wretched aborigine the value and importance of the treasure she was about to guard i cannot say flip darted an interrogatory look at lance who nodded a quiet assent and she flew into the inner room she did not linger on the details of her toilet but reappeared almost the next moment in her new finery buttoning the neck of her gown as she entered the room and chastely stopping at the window to characteristically pull up her stocking the peculiarity of her situation increased her usual shyness she played with the black and gold beads of a handsome necklacelances last giftas the merest child might her unbuckled shoe gave the squaw a natural opportunity of showing her admiration and devotion by insisting upon buckling it and gave lance under that disguise an opportunity of covertly kissing the little foot and ankle in the shadow of the chimney an event which provoked slight hysterical symptoms in flip and caused her to sit suddenly down in spite of the remonstrances of her parent ef you cant quit gigglin and squirmin like an injin baby yourself yed better git rid o them duds he ejaculated with peevish scorn  yet under this perfunctory rebuke his weak vanity could not be hidden and he enjoyed the evident admiration of a creature whom he believed to be halfwitted and degraded all the more keenly because it did not make him jealous she could not take flip from him rendered garrulous by liquor he went to voice his contempt for those who might attempt it taking advantage of his daughters absence to resume her homely garments he whispered confidentially to lance  ye see these yer fine dresses ye might think is presents praps flip lets on they are praps she dont know any better but they aint presents theyre only samples o dressmaking and jewelry that a vain conceited shrimp of a feller up in sacramento sends down here to get customers for in course im to pay for em in course he reckons im to do it in course i calkilate to do it but he neednt try to play em off as presents he talks suthin o coming down here sportin hisself off on flip as a fancy buck not ez long ez the old mans here you bet thoroughly carried away by his fancied wrongs it was perhaps fortunate that he did not observe the flashing eyes of lance behind his lank and lustreless wig but seeing only the figure of lance as he had conjured him he went on thats why i want you to hang around her hang around her ontil my boyhim thats comin home on a visitgets here and i reckon hell clear out that yar sacramento counterjumper only let me get a sight o him afore flip does eh dye hear dog my skin if i dont believe the dd injins drunk it was fortunate that at that moment flip reappeared and dropping on the hearth between her father and the infuriated lance let her hand slip in his with a warning pressure the light touch momentarily recalled him to himself and her but not until the quickwitted girl had had revealed to her in one startled wave of consciousness the full extent of lances infirmity of temper with the instinct of awakened tenderness came a sense of responsibility and a vague premonition of danger the coy blossom of her heart was scarce unfolded before it was chilled by approaching shadows fearful of she knew not what she hesitated every moment of lances stay was imperiled by a single word that might spring from his suppressed white lips beyond and above the suspicions his sudden withdrawal might awaken in her fathers breast she was dimly conscious of some mysterious terror without that awaited him she listened to the furious onslaught of the wind upon the sycamores beside their cabin and thought she heard it there she listened to the sharp fusillade of rain upon roof and pane and the turbulent roar and rush of leaping mountain torrents at their very feet and fancied it was there she suddenly sprang to the window and pressing her eyes to the pane saw through the misty turmoil of tossing boughs and swaying branches the scintillating intermittent flames of torches moving on the trail above and knew it was there  in an instant she was collected and calm dad she said in her ordinary indifferent tone theres torches movin up toward the diamond pit likely its tramps ill take the squaw and see and before the old man could stagger to his feet she had dragged lance with her into the road     chapter vi   the wind charged down upon them slamming the door at their backs extinguishing the broad shaft of light that had momentarily shot out into the darkness and swept them a dozen yards away gaining the lee of a madrono tree lance opened his blanketed arms enfolded the girl and felt her for one brief moment tremble and nestle in his bosom like some frightened animal well he said gayly what next flip recovered herself youre safe now anywhere outside the house but did you expect them tonight lance shrugged his shoulders why not hush returned the girl theyre coming this way  the four flickering scattered lights presently dropped into line the trail had been found they were coming nearer flip breathed quickly the spiced aroma of her presence filled the blanket as he drew her tightly beside him he had forgotten the storm that raged around them the mysterious foe that was approaching until flip caught his sleeve with a slight laugh why its kennedy and bijah  whos kennedy and bijah asked lance curtly  kennedys the postmaster and bijahs the butcher  what do they want continued lance  me said flip coyly  you  yes lets run away  half leading half dragging her friend flip made her way with unerring woodcraft down the ravine the sound of voices and even the tumult of the storm became fainter an acrid smell of burning green wood smarted lances lips and eyes in the midst of the darkness beneath him gradually a faint gigantic nimbus like a lurid eye glowed and sank quivered and faded with the spent breath of the gale as it penetrated their retreat the pit whispered flip its safe on the other side she added cautiously skirting the orbit of the great eye and leading him to a sheltered nest of bark and sawdust it was warm and odorous nevertheless they both deemed it necessary to enwrap themselves in the single blanket the eye beamed fitfully upon them occasionally a wave of lambent tremulousness passed across it its weirdness was an excuse for their drawing nearer each other in playful terror  flip  well  what did the other two want to see you too  likely said flip without the least trace of coquetry theres been a lot of strangers yer off and on  perhaps youd like to go back and see them  do you want me to  lances reply was a kiss nevertheless he was vaguely uneasy looks a little as if i were running away dont it he suggested  no said flip they think youre only a squaw its me theyre after lance smarted a little at this infelicitous speech a strange and irritating sensation had been creeping over himit was his first experience of shame and remorse i reckon ill go back and see he said rising abruptly  flip was silent she was thinking believing that the men were seeking her only she knew that their attention would be directed from her companion when it was found out he was no longer with her and she dreaded to meet them in his irritable presence  go she said tell dad somethings gone wrong in the diamond pit and say im watching it for him here  and you  ill go there and wait for him if he cant get rid of them and they follow him there ill come back here and meet you anyhow ill manage to have dad wait there a spell  she took his hand and led him back by a different path to the trail he was surprised to find that the cabin its window glowing from the fire was only a hundred yards away go in the back way by the shed dont go in the room nor near the light if you can dont talk inside but call or beckon to dad remember she said with a laugh youre keeping watch of me for him pull your hair down on your eyes so this operation like most feminine embellishments of the masculine toilet was attended by a kiss and flip stepping back into the shadow vanished in the storm  lances first movements were inconsistent with his assumed sex he picked up his draggled skirt and drew a bowie knife from his boot from his bosom he took a revolver turning the chambers noiselessly as he felt the caps he then crept toward the cabin softly and gained the shed it was quite dark but for a pencil of light piercing a crack of the rude illfitting door that opened on the sittingroom a single voice not unfamiliar to him raised in halfbrutal triumph greeted his ears  a name was mentionedhis own his angry hand was on the latch one moment more and he would have burst the door but in that instant another name was uttereda name that dropped his hand from the latch and the blood from his cheeks he staggered backward passed his hand swiftly across his forehead recovered himself with a gesture of mingled rage and despair and sinking on his knees beside the door pressed his hot temples against the crack  do i know lance harriott said the voice do i know the dd ruffian didnt i hunt him a year ago into the brush three miles from the crossing didnt we lose sight of him the very day he turned up yer at this ranch and got smuggled over into monterey aint it the same man as killed arkansaw bobbob ridleythe name he went by in sonora and who was bob ridley eh who why you dd old fool it was bob fairleyyour son  the old mans voice rose querulous and indistinct  what are ye talkin about

he told me he was your son told me how he ran away from you how you were livin somewhere in the mountains makin gold or suthin else outer charcoal he told me who he was as a secret he never let on he

ruin your gal as he had killed your boy i knew that he knew it too  liar  the door fell in with a crash there was the sudden apparition of a demoniac face still half hidden by the long trailing black locks of hair that curled like medusas around it a cry of terror filled the room three of the men dashed from the door and fled precipitately the man who had spoken sprang toward his rifle in the chimney corner but the movement was his last a blinding flash and shattering report interposed between him and his weapon  the impulse carried him forward headlong into the fire that hissed and spluttered with his blood and lance harriott with his smoking pistol strode past him to the door already far down the trail there were hurried voices the crack and crackling of impending branches growing fainter and fainter in the distance lance turned back to the solitary living figurethe old man  yet he might have been dead too he sat so rigid and motionless his fixed eyes staring vacantly at the body on the hearth before him on the table lay the cheap photographs one evidently of himself taken in some remote epoch of complexion one of a child which lance recognized as flip  tell me said lance hoarsely laying his quivering hand on the table was bob ridley your son  my son echoed the old man in a strange faroff voice without turning his eyes from the corpsemy sonisisis there pointing to the dead man hush didnt he tell you so didnt you hear him say it deaddeadshotshot  silence are you crazy man repeated lance tremblingly that is not bob ridley but a dog a coward a liar gone to his reckoning hear me if your son was bob ridley i swear to god i never knew it now ororthen do you hear me tell me do you believe me speak you shall speak  he laid his hand almost menacingly on the old mans shoulder fairley slowly raised his head lance fell back with a groan of horror the weak lips were wreathed with a feeble imploring smile but the eyes wherein the fretful peevish suspicious spirit had dwelt were blank and tenantless the flickering intellect that had lit them was blown out and vanished  lance walked toward the door and remained motionless for a moment gazing into the night when he turned back again toward the fire his face was as colorless as the dead mans on the hearth the fire of passion was gone from his beaten eyes his step was hesitating and slow he went up to the table  i say old man he said with a strange smile and an odd premature suggestion of the infinite weariness of death in his voice you wouldnt mind giving me this would you and he took up the picture of flip the old man nodded repeatedly thank you said lance he went to the door paused a moment and returned goodby old man he said holding out his hand fairley took it with a childish smile hes dead said the old man softly holding lances hand but pointing to the hearth yes said lance with the faintest of smiles on the palest of faces you feel sorry for any one thats dead dont you fairley nodded again lance looked at him with eyes as remote as his own shook his head and turned away when he reached the door he laid his revolver carefully and indeed somewhat ostentatiously upon a chair but when he stepped from the threshold he stopped a moment in the light of the open door to examine the lock of a small derringer which he drew from his pocket he then shut the door carefully and with the same slow hesitating step felt his way into the night  he had but one idea in his mind to find some lonely spot some spot where the footsteps of man would never penetrate some spot that would yield him rest sleep obliteration forgetfulness and above all where he would be forgotten he had seen such places surely there were manywhere bones were picked up of dead men who had faded from the earth and had left no other record if he could only keep his senses now he might find such a spot but he must be careful for her little feet went everywhere and she must never see him again alive or dead and in the midst of his thoughts and the darkness and the storm he heard a voice at his side lance how long you have been    left to himself the old man again fell into a vacant contemplation of the dead body before him until a stronger blast swept down like an avalanche upon the cabin burst through the illfastened door and broken chimney and dashing the ashes and living embers over the floor filled the room with blinding smoke and flame fairley rose with a feeble cry and then as if acted upon by some dominant memory groped under the bed until he found his buckskin bag and his precious crystal and fled precipitately from the room lifted by this second shock from his apathy he returned to the fixed idea of his lifethe discovery and creation of the diamondand forgot all else the feeble grasp that his shaken intellect kept of the events of the night relaxed the disguised lance the story of his son the murder slipped into nothingness there remained only the one idea his nightly watch by the diamond pit the instinct of long habit was stronger than the darkness or the onset of the storm and he kept his tottering way over stream and fallen timber until he reached the spot a sudden tremor seemed to shake the lambent flame that had lured him on he thought he heard the sound of voices there were signs of recent disturbancefootprints in the sawdust with a cry of rage and suspicion fairley slipped into the pit and sprang toward the nearest opening to his frenzied fancy it had been tampered with his secret discovered the fruit of his long labors stolen from him that very night with superhuman strength he began to open the pit scattering the halfcharred logs right and left and giving vent to the suffocating gases that rose from the now incandescent charcoal at times the fury of the gale would drive it back and hold it against the sides of the pit leaving the opening free at times following the blind instinct of habit the demented man would fall upon his face and bury his nose and mouth in the wet bark and sawdust at last the paroxysm past he sank back again in his old apathetic attitude of watching the attitude he had so often kept beside his sylvan crucible in this attitude and in silence he waited for the dawn  it came with a hush in the storm it came with blue openings in the broken up and tumbled heavens it came with stars that glistened first and then paled and at last sank drowning in those deep cerulean lakes it came with those cerulean lakes broadening into vaster seas whose shores expanded at last into one illimitable ocean cerulean no more but flecked with crimson and opal dyes it came with the lightly lifted misty curtain of the day torn and rent on crag and pine top but always lifting lifting it came with the sparkle of emerald in the grasses and the flash of diamonds in every spray with a whisper in the awakening woods and voices in the traveled roads and trails  the sound of these voices stopped before the pit and seemed to interrogate the old man he came and putting his finger on his lips made a sign of caution when three or four men had descended he bade them follow him saying weakly and disjointedly but persistently my boymy son robertcame homecame home at lasthere with flipboth of themcome and see  he had reached a little niche or nest in the hillside and stopped and suddenly drew aside a blanket beneath it side by side lay flip and lance dead with their cold hands clasped in each others  suffocated said two or three turning with horror toward the broken up and still smouldering pit  asleep said the old man asleep ive seen em lying that way when they were babies together dont tell me dont say i dont know my own flesh and blood so so so my pretty ones he stooped and kissed them then drawing the blanket over them gently he rose and said softly good night
