bottomless swamp   it was construction foreman cassidy who gave the place its name when he answered his employers laconic telegram stirling the great contractor frequently expressed himself with forcible terseness but when he flung the message across to his secretary as he sat one morning in his private room in an ottawa hotel the latter raised his eyebrows questioningly he knew his employer in all his moods and he was not in the least afraid of him there was though most of those who did business with him failed to perceive it a vein of almost extravagant generosity in stirlings character  well said the latter isnt the thing plain enough  the secretary smiled  oh yes he said still im not sure theyll send it over the wires in quite that form  his employer agreed to the modification he suggested and the message as despatched to cassidy read simply why are you stopping  after that the famous contractor busied himself about other matters until he got the answer no bottom to this swamp  then his indignation boiled over as it sometimes did for stirling was a thicknecked redfaced man with a fiery temper and an indomitable will he had undertaken a good deal of difficult railroad work in western canada and never yet had been beaten what was more to the purpose he had no intention of being beaten now or even delayed by a swamp that had no bottom he had grappled with hard rock and sliding snow had overcome professional rivals and had made his influence felt by politicians and though he had left middleage behind he still retained his full vigor of body and freedom of speech when he had explained what he thought of cassidy he turned again to his secretary  arrange for a private car he said ill go along tomorrow and make them jump  the secretary who fancied there would be trouble in the construction camp during the next few days felt inclined to be sorry for cassidy as he went out to make the necessary arrangements for his employers journey west  stirling had spent a busy morning when he met his daughter ida and her friends at lunch he did not belong to ottawa his offices were in montreal but as ottawa is the seat of the government he had visited it at the request of certain railroad potentates and other magnates of political influence with him he had brought his daughter and three of her english friends for ida had desired to show them the capital he had no great opinion of the man and the two women in question he said that they made him tired and sometimes in confidence to his secretary he went rather further than that but at the same time he was willing to bear with them if the fact that he did so afforded ida any pleasure ida stirling was an unusually fortunate young woman in so far at least as that she had only to mention any desire that it was in her fathers power to gratify he was a strenuous man whose work was his life subtle where that work was concerned when force which he preferred was not advisable but crudely direct and simple as regards almost everything else  im going west across the rockies tomorrow he said well have a private car on the pacific express youd better bring these folk along and show them the mountain province  ida was pleased with the idea and stirling and his party started west on the morrow  in the meanwhile construction foreman cassidy was spending an anxious time he was redhaired and irascible canadian by adoption and hibernian by descent a man of no ideas beyond those connected with railroad building which was however very much what one would have expected for the chief attribute of the men who are building up the western dominion is their power of concentration though there were greater men above cassidy who would get the credit it was due chiefly to his grim persistency that the branch road had been blasted out of the mountainside made secure from sliding snow and flung on dizzy trestles over thundering rivers until at last it reached the swamp which in his own simple words had no bottom  there are other places like it in the mountain province of british columbia giant ranges whose peaks glimmer with the cold gleam of nevermelting snow shut in the valley great pine forests clothe their lower slopes and a greenstained river leaps roaring out of the midst of them the new track wound through their shadow a double riband of steel until it broke off abruptly where a creek that poured out of the hills had spread itself among the trees the latter dwindled and rotted and black depths of mire lay among their crawling roots forming what is known in that country as a muskeg there was a deep blue lake on the one hand and on the other scarped slopes of rock that the tract could not surmount and for a time cassidy and his men had floundered kneedeep and often deeper among the roots while they plied the ax and saw then they dumped in carload after carload of rock and gravel but the muskeg absorbed it and waited for more it was apparently insatiable and for cassidy drove them savagely the mens tempers grew shorter under the strain until some who had drawn a sufficient proportion of their wages to warrant it rolled up their blankets and walked out reviling him still most of them stayed with the task and toiled on sullenly in the mire under a scorching heat for it was summer in the wilderness  affairs were in this condition when clarence weston crawled out of the swamp one evening and sat down on a cedar log before he followed his comrades up the track though he supposed that supper would shortly be laid out in the sleepingshanty the sunlight that flung lurid flecks of color upon the western side of the fir trunks beat upon his dripping face which though a little worn and grim just then was otherwise a pleasant face of the fair english type in fact though he had been some years in the country englishman was unmistakably stamped upon him he was attired scantily and simply in a very old blue shirt and trousers which also had once been blue of duck and just then he was very weary and more than a little lame  he had cut himself about the ankle when chopping a week earlier and though the wound had partly healed his foot was still painful there were also a good many other scars and bruises upon his body for the cost of building a western railroad is usually heavy still he had an excellent constitution and was while not particularly brilliant as a rule at least whimsically contented in mind his comrades called him the kid or the english kid perhaps on account of a certain delicacy of manner and expression which he had somehow contrived to retain though he had spent several years in logging camps and his age was close onto twentyfive  while he sat there with the shovel that had worn his hands hard lying at his feet cassidy who had not recovered from the interview he had had with stirling that morning strode by hot and out of temper and then stopped and swung round on him  too stiff to get up hustle before the mosquitoes eat you when suppers ready he said  weston glanced down at his foot  i was on the gravel bank all afternoon its steep seemed to wrench the cut  well said cassidy ive no kind of use for a man who doesnt know enough to keep himself from getting hurt you have got to get that foot better right away or get out  he shook a big hard fist at the swamp  howm i going to fill up that pit with a crowd of stiffs and deadbeats like those im driving now you make me tired  he did not wait for an answer to the query but plodded away and weston sat still a few minutes longer with a wry smile in his eyes he resented being overdriven though he was more or less used to it and now and then he found his superiors vitriolic comments upon his efforts almost intolerably galling still he had sense enough to realize that the remedy open to him was a somewhat hazardous one because while it would be easy to walk out of the construction camp industrial activity just then was unusually slack in the mountain province besides he was willing to admit that there were excuses for cassidy and there was a certain quiet tenacity in him he was also aware that the man with little money has generally a good deal to bear for weston was one who could learn by experience though that faculty was not one that hitherto had characterized the family from which he sprang  none of the westons had ever been remarkable for geniusa fact of which they were rather proud than otherwise they had for several generations been content to be men of local importance in a secluded nook of rural england which is not the kind of life that is conducive to original thought or enterprising action they had chosen wives like themselves from among their neighbors and it was perhaps in several respects not altogether fortunate for clarence weston that his mother had been ultraconservative in her respect for traditions since he had inherited one side of her nature still in her case at least the respect had been idealistic and the traditions of the highest and though she had died when he was eighteen she had instilled into him a certain delicacy of sentiment and a simple chivalrous code that had somewhat hampered him in the rough life he had led in the canadian dominion  as a very young man he had quarreled with his father over a matter trifling in itself but each had clung to his opinions with the obstinacy of men who have few ideas to spare and clarence had gone out to seek his fortune in western canada he had naturally failed to find it and the first discovery that there was apparently nobody in that wide country who was ready to appraise either his mental attainments or his bodily activity at the value of his board was a painful shock to the sanguine lad that first year was a bad one to him but he set his teeth and quietly bore all that befell him the odd brutal task paid for at half the usual wages the frequent rebuffs the long nights spent shelterless in the bush utter weariness and often downright hunger it was a hard school but it taught him much and he graduated as a man strong and comely of body and resolute of mind what was more he had though he scarcely realized it after all only left behind in england a cramped life embittered by a steady shrinkage in the rent roll and as steady an increase in taxation and expenses his present life was clean and governed by a code of crude and austere simplicity his mothers spirit was in him and being what he was there were things he could not do he did not attempt to reason about them the knowledge was borne in upon him instinctively  he rose by and by and for he was hungry limped on to the sleepingshanty of the construction gang it was built of logs and roofed with rough cedar shingles handsplit on the spot the sun beat hot upon them and they diffused a faint aromatic fragrance refreshing as the scent of vinegar into the long unfloored room which certainly needed something of the kind it reeked with stale tobaccosmoke the smell of cookery and the odors of frowsy clothes a row of bunks filled with spruce twigs and old brown blankets ran down one side of it a very rude table down the other and a double row of men with bronzed faces in dusty garments sat about the latter eating voraciously fifteen minutes was at the outside the longest time they ever wasted on a meal  that evening however they were singularly short of temper for cassidy had driven them mercilessly all day and though not usually fastidious the supper was not to their liking the hash was burnt the venison for one of them had shot a deer had been hung too long while the dessert a great pie of desiccated fruits had been baked to a flinty hardness that was the last straw for in the mountain province the lumber and railroad gangs as a rule work hard and live well and when the cans of green tea had been emptied the growls culminated in a call for the cook  he came forward and stood before them a little shaky grayhaired wreck of a man with the signs of indulgence plain upon him whisky is scarce in that country but it is obtainable and grenfell generally procured a good deal of it the man was evidently in a state of apprehension and he shrank back a little when a big grimfaced chopper ladled out a great plateful of the burnt stew from a vessel on the stove  now he said youve been spoiling supper too often lately and i guess weve got to teach you plain cookery sit right down and get that hash inside you  the man protested that he had had his supper before they came in whereupon the other seized him by the shoulders and thrust him down roughly into a seat at the table  well he said youve got to have a little more if its good enough for us boys its not going to hurt him  there was a murmur of concurrence when he looked around at the rest and the cook seeing no help for it made a valiant attempt to eat a little of the greasy mess then he revolted from it and glanced at his companions supplicatingly  i cant do it boys youll let me off he pleaded  none of the rest showed any sign of relenting they were inclined to be pitiless then and the rude justice of the choppers idea appealed to them  when youve cleaned up that plate said one  the victim made a second futile attempt and after waiting some minutes for him to proceed they decided that it was too hot in the shed so conveying him outside they seated him on a great fir stump sawed off several feet above the ground with the plate beside him then they took out their pipes and sat around to enjoy the spectacle as a rule there is very little cruelty in men of their kind but they were very human and the cook had robbed them of a meal somewhat frequently of late besides they had smarted all day under cassidys bitter tongue and they felt that they must retaliate upon somebody no one said anything for several minutes and then the big chopper once more approached his victim  now he said since you have to go through with it you may as well start in if you dont ill put the blame stuff down your throat  it was perhaps no more than justice for the cook was paid well but there was one man in the assembly to whom this did not altogether appeal the victim was frail and helpless a wateryeyed limp bundle of nerves with nevertheless a pitiful suggestion of outward dignity still clinging to him though his persecutors would have described him aptly as a whisky tank the former fact was sufficient for weston who did not stop to think out the matter but rose and strode quietly toward the fir stump  i think this thing has gone far enough boys youll have to let him off he said  no sir said the big chopper hes going right through anyway its not your trouble light out before we rope you in too  weston did not move until three or four more strode forward hastily when he stooped for an ax that lay handy and swung it round his head it came down with a crash on the plate and the hash was scattered over the withered redwood twigs then while a growl expressive of astonishment as well as anger went up the chopper scraped up part of the stew with red soil and fir twigs mixed in it  he has got to eat it and then ill tend to you youll see that they dont get away boys he said  weston clearly had no intention of attempting to do so and the cook would have found it hopeless for the rest closed round the stump in a contracting ring while they knew that cassidy had been summoned to stirlings car they were unaware that there were other spectators of the little drama two young women had however just emerged from among the towering firs that hemmed in the muskeg one was attired elaborately in light garments and a big hat that appeared very much out of place in that aisle of tremendous forest but there was a difference between her and her companion the latter knew the bush and was dressed simply in a closefitting robe of gray she held herself well and there was something that suggested quiet imperiousness in her attitude and expression this was perhaps not altogether unnatural for hitherto when ida stirling desired anything that her fathers money could obtain her wish was gratified she laid her hand warningly on her companions arm and drew her back into the shadow of the firs  i really dont think we need go away she said they wont notice us and you will probably see something that is supposed to be characteristically western though im not sure that it really is  the meaning of the scene was tolerably plain to both of them the little cleared space formed a natural amphitheater walled in by somber ranks of pines and standing higher they could see over the heads of the clustering men there was no difficulty in identifying the victim the persecutor and the champion for weston stood stripped to blue shirt and trousers with the big ax in his hand and his head thrown back a trifle gazing with curiously steady eyes at the expectant faces before him then as two or three of the men drew in closer he raised his free hand  this thing lies between jake and me and im open to deal with him he said still ive got the ax here if more of you stand in  the man scarcely raised his voice but it was clear that he was quietly and dangerously resolute indeed his attitude rather pleased some of the rest for there was a fresh murmuring and a cry of give the kid a show  then and nobody was afterward quite certain who struck first the trial by combat suddenly commenced there are very few rules attached to it in that country where men do not fight by formula but with the one purpose of deciding the matter in the quickest way possible and in another moment the two had clinched they fell against the tree stump and reeled clear again swaying gasping and striking when they could it is probable that the canadian was the stronger man but as it happened his antagonist had been born among the dales of northern england where wrestling is still held as an art in a few minutes he hurled the chopper off his feet and a hoarse clamor went up through which there broke a shout  the kid has him  then the two men went down together heavily and rolled over and over until cassidy came running down the track and burst through the ring of onlookers in one hand he carried a peevie a big wooden lever with an iron hook on it such as men use in rolling fir logs he belabored the pair with it impartially and it was evident that he was not in the least particular as to whether he hurt them or not loosing their hold on each other they staggered to their feet with the red dust thick on their flushed faces  cassidy flourished the peevie  now he cried is it fighting ye want  there was a burst of laughter and the assembly broke up when cassidy hustled the chopper off the field the cook with commendable discretion had slipped away quietly in the meanwhile and the two young women whom nobody had noticed turned back among the firs the girl in the elaborate draperies laughed  i suppose it was a little brutal and we shouldnt have stayed she said still in a sense the attitude of the one they called the kid was rather fine i could have made quite a striking sketch of him  ida stirling made no direct reply to this but as she found afterward the scene had fixed itself on her memory still it was not the intent men or the stately clustering pines that she recalled most clearly it was the dominant central figure standing almost statuesque with head tilted slightly backward and both hands clenched on the big ax haft  the man they were tormenting must have done something to vex them they really are not quarrelsome she said     chapter ii  the packer   weston was engaged with several others flinging gravel into a flat car with a longhafted shovel the next morning when cassidy strode up the track and though the men already had been working hard they quickened the pace a little when they saw him he could tell at a glance whether a man were doing his utmost and nothing less would satisfy him he knew also exactly how many cubic yards of soil or gravel could be handled by any particular gang if the quantity fell short there was usually trouble however he said nothing to the others that morning but beckoned weston aside and stood a moment or two looking at him with a grimly whimsical twinkle in his eyes  weston had not suffered greatly during the struggle of the previous evening but there was a discolored bruise on one of his cheeks and a big lump on his forehead he was glad to stand still a moment for he had been shoveling gravel for several hours and that is an occupation that conduces to an unpleasant stiffness about the waist he was however somewhat puzzled by the redhaired cassidys sardonic grin  well said the latter with an air of reflection i guess you might do if you got a piece of raw steak from the cook and tied it around your face  for what asked weston sharply  for a packer the bosss friends are going camping in the bush  weston did not answer immediately for in that country where roads are still singularly scarce packing usually means the transporting of heavy loads upon ones back the smaller ranchers are as a rule adept at it and when it is necessary as it sometimes is will cheerfully walk over a mountain range with a big sack of flour or other sundries bound upon their shoulders four or five leagues is not considered too great a distance to pack a bushel or two of seed potatoes or even a table for the ranch and weston who had reasons for being aware that work of the kind is at least as arduous as shoveling gravel did not feel greatly tempted by the offer cassidy seemed to guess what he was thinking  its a soft thing im putting you on to as a special favor he explained it will be upriver most of the way and ive got a couple of siwash to pole the canoes all you have to do is the cooking make camp and tend to miss stirlings friends when they go fishing he waved his hand and added as though to clinch the argument ive known people of that kind to give a man that pleased them ten dollars  westons face flushed a little but he said he would go and the next day the party started upriver in two indian canoes besides weston and the darkskinned siwash packers it consisted of four a tall elderly man called kinnaird with the stamp of a military training plain upon him his little quiet wife his daughter who was somewhat elaborately dressed and ida stirling kinnaird and his daughter traveled in the larger canoe with the indians and the camp gear and mrs kinnaird and miss stirling with weston in the other  though weston was more or less accustomed to the work he found the first few hours sufficiently arduous it is not an easy matter to propel a loaded canoe against a strong stream with a single paddle and it is almost as difficult to pole her alone while there were two long portages to make when the craft and everything in them had to be hauled painfully over a stretch of very rough boulders kinnaird took his share in it and weston was quite willing to permit him to do so but the latter was floundering toward the canoes alone with a heavy load on his shoulders when he came to a sharply sloped and slippery ledge of rock it was very hot in the deep valley and the white stones and flashing river flung up a blaze of light into his eyes while he limped a little under his burden for his foot was still painful he had no idea that anybody was watching him and when he slipped and falling heavily rolled down part of the slope scattering the packages about him he relieved his feelings with a few vitriolic comments upon the luxurious habits of the people who had compelled him to carry so many of their superfluous comforts through the bush then he set about gathering up the sundries he had dropped first of all he came upon a ladys parasol white outside and lined with green he regarded it with a rueful smile when he had tried and failed to open it  trouble ahead he commented it cost eight or nine dollars anyway and now its broken  then he came to a rather big valise which swung open and poured out part of its contents when he lifted it by the handle they seemed to consist of voluminous folds of delicate fabric and lace and he was gazing at them and wondering how they were to be got back into the bag when he heard a voice behind him  will you kindly put that down it said  weston dropped the bag in his astonishment and swinging around suddenly he saw miss stirling standing in the shadow of a great cedar he had been too busy during the journey up the river to pay much attention to her but now it occurred to him that she was not only pretty but very much in harmony with her surroundings the simple closefitting gray dress which though he did not know this had cost a good many dollars displayed a pretty and not overslender figure and fitted in with the neutral tinting of the towering fir trunks and the sunlit boulders while the plain white hat with bentdown brim formed an appropriate setting for the delicatelycolored face beneath it still weston scarcely noticed any particular points in miss stirlings appearance just then for he was subconsciously impressed by her personality as a whole there was something in her dress and manner that he would have described vaguely as style though it was a style he had not often come across in the west where he had for the most part lived in the bush she was evidently a little younger than himself but she had the quiet air of one accustomed to command which as a matter of fact was the case  then he wondered with a slight uneasiness whether she had heard all that he said when he fell down he fancied that she had for there was the faintest trace of amusement in her eyes they met his own steadily though he was not sure whether they were gray or blue or a very light brown indeed he was never quite sure of this for they changed curiously with the light  then she came toward him and looked at the valise  it was locked when i gave it to you she said with a trace of severity  well answered weston it doesnt seem to be locked now i think i remember noticing that you left the key in it but its gone it must have fallen out ill look for it  he looked for some time and failing to find it walked back to the girl  im afraid its in the river he said still you see the bag is open  that replied miss stirling is unfortunately evident i want it shut  weston glanced at the protruding garments with which she seemed to be busy  im very sorry he said i dare say i could squeeze these things back into it  he was going to do so when miss stirling took the bag away from him  no she said a trifle quickly i dont think you could  then it occurred to weston that his offer had perhaps not been altogether tactful and he was sensible of a certain confusion at which he was slightly astonished he did not remember having been readily subject to fits of embarrassment when in england though there he had never served as porter to people of his own walk in life turning away he collected a waterproof carryall a big rubber ground sheet another parasol a sketching stool and a collapsible easel which also appeared to be damaged then as he knelt down and roped them and the valise together he looked at the girl  im afraid miss kinnaird will be a little angry for i think that easel thing wont open out he said im awfully sorry  now awfully sorry is not a western colloquialism and the girl looked at him attentively she liked his voice and she rather liked his face which since he had not been called the kid for nothing was ingenuous she laughed a little then she remembered something she had noticed  well she observed i suppose you couldnt help it that load was too heavy and arent you a little lame  not always said weston i cut my foot a little while ago if it hadnt been for that i shouldnt have fallen down and broken miss kinnairds things  and mine  and yours admitted weston as i said im particularly sorry still if you will let me have the bag afterward i can perhaps mend the lock you see i assisted a general jobbing mechanic  ida stirling flashed a quick glance at him he had certainly a pleasant voice and his manner was whimsically deferential  why didnt you stay with him she asked mending plows and wagons must have been easier than trackgrading  westons eyes twinkled  he said i made him tired and the fact is i mended a clock that is i triedit was rather a good one when i got hold of it  the girl laughed and the laugh set them on good terms with each other then she said  that load is far too heavy for you to climb over these boulders with when you have an injured foot you can give me the valise at least  no said weston resolutely this is a good deal easier than shoveling gravel as well as pleasanter and the foot really doesnt trouble me very much besides if i hadnt cut it cassidy wouldnt have sent me here  he was however mistaken in supposing that the construction foreman had been influenced only by a desire to get rid of a man who was to some extent incapacitated as a matter of fact miss stirling who had been rather pleased with the part he had played two days ago had when her father insisted on her taking a white man as well as the indians given cassidy instructions that he should be sent still she naturally did not mention this and indeed said nothing of any account while they went on to the canoes  it was slacker water above the rapid and all afternoon they slid slowly up on deep winding reaches of the still green river sometimes it flashed under dazzling sunshine but at least as often they moved through the dim shadow of towering pines that rolled rank on rank somber and stately up the steep hillside while high above them all rose tremendous ramparts of eternal snow then as the sun dipped behind the great mountain wall the clean aromatic fragrance of pine and fir and cedar crept into the cooling air and a stillness so deep that it became almost oppressive descended upon the lonely valley the splash of pole or paddle broke through it with a startling distinctness and the faint gurgle at the bows became curiously intensified the pines grew slower blacker and more solemn filmy trails of mist crawled out from among the hollows of the hills and the still air was charged with an elixirlike quality when weston ran his canoe ashore  while he and the indians set about erecting a couple of tents he saw miss kinnaird standing near him and gazing up across the misty pines toward the green transparency that still hung above the bluewhite gleam of snow  this she said to miss stirling is really wonderful one cant get hold of it at once its tremendous  the smallest of the pines rose two hundred feet above her and they ran up until they dwindled to insignificance far aloft at the foot of a great scarp of rock that rose beyond them for a thousand feet or so and then gave place in turn to climbing fields of snow  the girl who was an artist drew in her breath  switzerland and norway its like them bothand yet it grips you harder than either she added i suppose its because there are no hotels or steamers probably very few white people have ever been here before  i really dont think many have said ida stirling  then miss kinnaird laughed softly as she glanced at her attire  i must take off these fripperies theyre out of key she said one ought to wear deerskins or something of that kind here  weston heard nothing further and remembered that after all the girls sentiments were no concern of his it was his business to prepare the supper and wait on the party and he set about it darkness had descended upon the valley when he laid the plates of indurated ware on a strip of clean white shingle and then drawing back a few yards sat down beneath the first of the pines in case they needed anything further a fire blazed and crackled between two small logs felled for the purpose and rolled close together and its flickering light fell upon him and those who sat at supper except at times when it faded suddenly and the shadows closed in again he was then attired picturesquely in a fringed deerskin jacket dressed by some of the blackfeet across the rockies kinnaird who had once or twice glanced in his direction gazed hard at him  have you ever been in india he asked  no sir said weston in a formal manner though sir is not often used deferentially in western canada  kinnaird appeared thoughtful  well he said i cant help thinking that i have come across you somewhere before i have a good memory for faces and yours is familiar  i have never seen you until today said weston i dont remember your name either  the curious thing persisted kinnaird is that while i cant quite locate you i am almost sure i am right what makes me feel more certain is that though you were younger then you have grown into the man i should have expected you to then he laughed anyway its clear that you dont remember me  he turned to the others and miss kinnaird asked for more coffee after which weston who brought it sat still again to wait until he could take away the plates it was evident that his presence placed no restraint on the conversation at length he became suddenly intent kinnaird was contrasting canada and england for miss stirlings benefit  of course he said we have nothing like this but in the north at least we have odd bits of rugged grandeur where the wildness of the hills about one is emphasized by the green fertility of the valleys there is a typical place where we spent a few months last year that i should like you to see if you come back with us as you half promised we will take you there  weston leaned forward a little for he had still a curious tenderness for the land of the fells and dales in which he had been born he did not know that ida stirling who had watched him closely when kinnaird addressed him had now fixed her eyes on him again the latter turned to her as he proceeded  the old house he said would make a picture in itself with its little stoneribbed windows and the much older square tower and curtain wall that form one wing there is a terraced garden in front and a stream comes frothing out of a wooded ghyll at the foot of it  weston started for there was no doubt that the house kinnaird described was the one in which he had been born as it happened the firelight fell upon his intent face as he waited for the answer when miss stirling who had missed his start asked a question  the people who owned it were friends of yours  no said kinnaird i never saw them i took the place through an agency for the rough shooting and as a change from london they had to let it and live in a neighboring town the result of slack management and agricultural depression i believe  weston set his lips he had written home once rejecting a proposition made him and his people had afterward apparently forgotten him he had made up his mind that he would not trouble them again at least while he toiled as a trackgrader or a hired man but now when it seemed that trouble had come upon them he regretted many things  kinnaird signed to him that he might take away the plates and he gathered them up scarcely conscious of what he was doing and then stumbled and dropped the pile of them though made of indurated fiber they fell with a startling clatter and kinnaird looked at him sharply as he picked them up but in another few moments he had vanished beyond the range of the firelight into the shadows of the bush  ida stirling had however noticed enough to arouse a young womans curiosity especially as there was a suggestion of romance in it and before she went to sleep she thought a good deal about the man she had never seen until two days ago     chapter iii  the model   the morning broke clear and still across the scented bush and miss kinnaird and ida stirling who had been awakened early by the wonderful freshness in the mountain air strolled some distance out of camp for a time they wandered through shadowy aisles between the tremendous trunks breathing in sweet resinous odors and then soon after the first sunrays came slanting across a mountain shoulder they came out upon a head of rock above the river a hemlock had fallen athwart it and they sat down where they could look out upon a majestic panorama of towering rock and snow  arabella kinnaird gazed at it intently when she had shaken some of the dew from the frills and folds of her rather bedraggled skirt  it will never be quite the same again she observed evidently in reference to the latter and then waved one hand as though to indicate the panorama for she was usually voluble and disconnected in her conversation this as i said last night is wonderfulin fact it almost oppresses one it makes one feel so little and im not sure that i like that though no doubt it does one good  her companion smiled  arent you going to paint it she asked  miss kinnaird pursed up her face which was a trick she had  oh she said i dont know after all portraiture is my specialty and this silent grandeur is a little beyond my interpretation  she paused and added the next few words in an authoritative manner as though she had a truth of some consequence to deliver  the difficulty is that you really cant interpret anything until you are quite sure what it means you see im feverishly restless by temperament and accustomed to indulge in all kinds of petty purposeless activities they are petty though the major calls them dutiessocial dutiesand being im afraid a rather frivolous person in spite of my love of art they appeal to me  ida said nothing it was not necessary and as a rule not advisable to encourage arabella kinnaird when she commenced as she sometimes described it to talk seriously and she rattled on  my dear im all appreciation and graciously pleased with the wonders that you are showing me but still this valley strikes me as being short of something its too calm and quiet even eden was not complete until man appeared in it though as usual he made trouble shortly afterward it is a thing he has kept on doing ever since  ida laughed  im not sure youre sticking to historical facts she said  facts returned her companion dont count for much with me i deal in impressions and sometimes i feel full of them i could astonish everybody if i could get them out but that of course is the difficulty feeling unfortunately isnt quite the same thing as power of expression still you asked me what i thought about these mountains and im trying to tell you you have brought it on yourself you see the keytone of this place is an almost overwhelming tranquillity one rather shrinks from that kind of thing when one is not used to it and longs to do something to disturb it its a natural impulse when you see a smooth sheet of ice you generally look for a big stone with which to smash it  she swung around and favored her companion with a glance of critical scrutiny and there was no reason why ida stirling should shrink from it she sat leaning forward looking out at the mountains with steady eyes that had a halfsmile in them her attitude was reposeful and her face quiet but there was something in both that faintly suggested a decided character  i dont think im readily disturbed she said  no answered her companion reflectively but the disturbance will no doubt come youre in harmony with the keytone of this valley but too much serenity isnt good for me and its probable that nobody ever retains it very long theres always the disturbing element in a world thats full of men it was as i remarked man who brought trouble into paradise  miss kinnaird was addicted to talking a good deal of nonsense and she frequently wearied her listeners but there was a certain shrewdness in her and at times she got near the truth indeed her companion afterward decided that she had done so in this case ida stirling had met many rising young men and some who had made their mark but none of them had aroused in her the faintest thrill of unrest or passion so far the depths of her nature had remained wholly unstirred one could almost have told it from her laugh as she answered her companions last observation  i thought it was womans curiosity she said and then remembered suddenly that on the previous evening she had certainly been a trifle curious about the strange packer from the railroad gang  miss kinnaird made no reply to this but in a moment she stretched out a pointing hand  now she said the disturbing element is obtruding itself  farther down the river there was a flash of something white amidst the pale green shimmer of the flood ida rose but her companion beckoned her to sit down again  oh she said a trifle impatiently dont be prudish hes ever so far off and ive never had an opportunity to study anybody swimming  it was of course weston who supposed himself far enough from camp not to be troubled by spectators swimming with a powerful sidestroke upstream ida sat down again and both of them watched him as he drew a little nearer so many times every minute his left arm swept out into the sunlight as he flung it forward with farstretched palm it fell with the faintest splash and there was a little puff of spray as his head dipped and the water washed across his lips then the white limbs flashed amidst the green shining of the river and the long lithe form contracted gleaming as a salmon gleams when it breaks the surface with the straining line the still river rippled and a sunbronzed face shot halfclear again miss kinnaird watched the swimmers progress with open appreciation  dancing she said didactically isnt to be compared with that its the essence of rhythmic movement i must certainly study swimming i wish hed come right on  ida was not sure that she agreed with her and just then weston swinging suddenly around went down into the green depths and shooting up with white shoulders high above the water swept away again downstream miss kinnaird rose as he did so and turned back toward the camp  that packer is rather fine considered as a muscular animal she said  ida smiled at this somewhat sardonically  in your country you wouldnt think of regarding him as anything else doesnt being an artist emancipate one from the conventional point of view  no replied miss kinnaird reflectively it doesnt that is when you do not paint for your livingwhich of course alters everything  then her eyes twinkled as she favored her companion with a passable imitation of her fathers didactic tone and manner  as the major says social distinctions are necessary safeguards and cannot lightly be disregarded if they were not they could not have existed as long as they have  she laughed  in the case of a man who has inherited his station and his possessions she added it is a very natural and comfortable creed  ah said ida my father worked in a sawmill  she spoke quietly but there was something in her voice that warned her companion that there were subjects upon which they might have a clash of opinion in the east there is pride of possession but the pride of achievement which is perhaps more logical is more common in the west  it was an hour later when weston laid breakfast before them and ida who regarded him unobtrusively with careful attention decided that arabella kinnaird was right the packer with his lean symmetrical litheness his pleasant english face his clear eyes and his clean bronzed skin was certainly wellfavored physically and she began to wonder whether her companion could not have gone further in her comments until she remembered again that the commencement of a good many troubles is probably womans curiosity  the canoes were launched after breakfast and it was afternoon when they pitched camp beside a still blue lake then major kinnaird strolled away with a troutrod to a neighboring rapid and mrs kinnaird went to sleep in a hammock her daughter got out her sketchbook and sitting down among the boulders bade ida summon weston he came and stood looking at them inquiringly picturesque in his wide hat and his fringed deerskin jacket miss kinnaird pursed up her face  i want to make a sketch of you you have rather a good head she said  weston gazed at her a moment in astonishment and then a twinkle crept into his eyes her matteroffact brusqueness which made it perfectly plain that his views in the matter did not count might have roused a sense of opposition in some men but he had acquired a wide toleration in western canada  shall i stand here miss he asked  no said the girl a little farther to the right where the sunlight falls upon the trunks behind you but you mustnt look wooden that will do still youll have to take off that jacket its frippery  the suspicion of a flush crept into westons face but after all a loose blue shirt and duck trousers are considered dress enough in the bush of the pacific slope and he discarded the offending jacket miss kinnaird however was not quite satisfied  cant you take up that ax and look as if you were ready to use it she said oh no that is far too much like a waxwork hold up your head a little now dont move any more than you can help i think that will do  weston stood as he was for the best part of an hour he felt inclined to wonder why he did it as he had not found shoveling gravel anything like so difficult then miss kinnaird informed him that as she desired to make a study of the background she would not keep him any longer and he strolled away to the waterside where after stretching himself wearily he lay down and took out his pipe he had not been there long when ida who came out from among the trees sat down on one of the boulders not far from him  you must have been horribly cramped but it didnt strike miss kinnaird or she wouldnt have kept you there so long she said  no answered weston reflectively i dont think it would strike miss kinnaird shes english isnt she  of course but arent you english too  westons eyes twinkled  i am still i dont want you to think that its merely because miss kinnaird comes from the same country that i do that i didnt expect her to realize that to stand posed for an hour or so is apt to cramp one  ida laughed it evidently was clear to him that miss kinnaird regarded him as a packer and nothing else and had decided that he had probably grown used to physical discomfort ida was however rather pleased to see that he accepted the fact goodhumoredly and did not resent it she was in no way astonished that he should answer her as he had for in the west a man may speak naturally to any young woman who addresses him without feeling called on to remember the distinctions of caste  i wonder she said whether you would tell me what caused the trouble you were mixed up in two or three nights ago  westons face grew slightly flushed for he was still in certain respects somewhat ingenuous but he told her simply what had led up to the affray  after all you could hardly blame the boys he added they had had a hard day and it was not the first time grenfell had done them out of their supper  still he had spoiled your supper too said ida if you couldnt blame them why did you interfere  it was rather a difficult question weston could not very well tell her even had he quite realized it that there was in him a vein of rudimentary chivalry that had been carefully fostered by his mother the males of the weston line had clung to traditions but they had for the most part been those of the georgian days when very little refinement of sentiment was expected from the country gentleman the traditions agnes weston had held by however went back to an earlier age she had been high church and imaginative a woman of impracticable as well as somewhat uncomfortable ideals and finding her husband proof against them she had done what she could with her son the result was a somewhat happy one for in the kid as his comrades termed him her fantasies and extravagances had been toned down by the very prosaic common sense of the weston male line they were fullfleshed hardriding englishmen who lived on beef and beer though weston was naturally not aware of it there were respects in which ida stirling was like his mother ida however usually kept her deeper thoughts to herself which mrs weston had seldom done but she shaped her life by them and they were wholesome  well he said diffidently it was quite a humiliating situation for the old man he was a person of some consequence oncea rather famous assayer and mineralogistand i think he felt it  that is not what i asked you said ida with a trace of dryness  weston spread out his hands as though to excuse himself  then he said they were all against him and i think jakei mean the big chopperwould have forced the stuff down his throat it was horribly burnt there are and he hesitated things one really has to do  his companion nodded she liked his diffidence which while very evident was wholly genuine and the faint color in his face gave him an appearance of boyish candor  even when the odds against you are quite steep she said in the case we are discussing the result was no doubt that bruise on your face then she changed the subject if he was a famous mineralogist why is he cooking in a railroad camp  everybody knows said weston the usual troublewhisky  the girl made a little gesture of comprehension that had in it also a hint of disgust and then seeing that he would say nothing further until she gave him a lead she spoke again  what brought you out here she inquired  weston had been asked the same question several times before and had never answered it in fact he did not know why he did so now  i quarreled with my people in one respect anyway i dont regret it its rather a beautiful country  he sat with his wide hat tilted back and the sun on his face looking out upon the blue lake between the towering pines their shadows floated in it and tremendous slopes of rock ran up toward the gleaming snow on the farther side the bush lay very silent under the scorching sun and it was filled with the heavy odors of the firs in which there was a clogging honeylike sweetness  its a little difficult to understand why you seem to be content with trackgrading one would fancy it to be unusually hard work said the girl  oh yes agreed weston laughing still you see i dont intend to remain a trackgrader indefinitely  no said ida inquiringly what do you mean to do  weston saw that she was interested and he was still young enough to be willing to discuss his own plans and projectsthough for that matter one comes across older men who can talk of nothing else  this country is full of gold and silver he said other men strike it now and then and i really dont see why i shouldnt  when they do havent they usually to sell it for almost nothing to somebody who gets up a company besides do you know anything about prospecting  weston laughed  a little its my one dissipation and its rather an expensive one you have to work for months to save enough to buy a camp outfit and provisions and if you mean to stay any time in the ranges you have to hire a horse then you come back in rags with a bagful of specimens that prove to be of no use at all and you go to work again  you have done that often  three or four times  then asked ida isnt it foolish to go back again  weston looked at her a moment hesitatingly and then made a little gesture of deprecation  it sounds absurd of course but i have a fancy that if i keep it up long enough i shall strike gold you see im a waterfinder anyway  a waterfinder  weston nodded  its an old english idea water evidently used to be scarcer there and even now there are places where good wells arent plentiful you go along with a hazel twig and it dips when you cross water running underground that is if you have the gift in you anybody cant do it you think that quite foolish dont you  ida really did though she did not seem to admit it  have you ever tried the gift out here she asked  on the prairie quite often a good deal of it is burnt up and dry i generally found water  you turned thepowerto account i meanyou mademoney out of it  there was a sudden change in westons face  no he said i never took a cent  but why  well replied the man slowly my mother had some oldworld belief and she said it was a special gift she knew i had it she said a thing of that kind should never be used for money  but havent all those who claimed special powerspriests magicians medicinemenalways been willing to sell them  her companions eyes twinkled  well i dare say they have still you see its possible that they never really had the gifts they claimed at all now icanfind water and i have a notion that i can find the precious metals too quite absurd isnt it  ida thought it was but the quiet confidence behind his whimsical manner appealed to her he was it seemed a man of simple character and few ideas but she knew that he had nerve and vigor and after all the western dominion is the land of strenuous alldaring simple men besides she had watched the resolution flash into his young face when he stood facing the angry crowd of trackgraders with the ax in his hand and she had seen very much the same tenacity and steadfastness stamped on the faces of successful men her father was one and he was a man who had scarcely been educated and was certainly devoid of any complexity of character stirling had made his mark by smashing down opposition and when that was not possible grimly holding on and bearing the blows dealt him there was as she recognized something to be said in favor of that kind of man  then kinnaird came up through the bush with his rod and a few troutlings dryshod and immaculate in a jacket that fitted him like a uniform and ida went back to camp with him she fancied however that her father or weston who sat still and filled his pipe again would have come back with a heavy fish or at least thornrent and dripping wet     chapter iv  idas first ascent   the party had spent another day or two beside the lake when one drowsy afternoon kinnaird who sat on the hot white shingle by the waters edge with a pair of glasses in his hand sent for weston miss kinnaird and ida stirling were seated among the boulders not far away  i understand that the river bends around the range and the crest of the first rise seems no great height he said there is evidentlya bench i think you call itbefore you come to the snow and the ascent should be practicable for a lady take these glasses and look at it  weston who took the glasses swept them along the hillside across the lake it rose very steeply from the waters edge but the slope was uniform and as a good deal of it consisted apparently of lightlycovered rock and gravel the pines were thinner and there was less undergrowth than usual far above him the smooth ascent broke off abruptly and though he could not see beyond the edge there certainly appeared to be a plateau between it and the farther wall of rock and snow  i think one could get up so far without very much trouble sir he said  that replied kinnaird is how it strikes me my daughter is rather a good mountaineer and miss stirling is just as anxious to make the ascent i may say that we have had some experience in switzerland not to mention the hills among the english lakes do you know anything about climbing  no sir said weston not as it is understood in switzerland anyway i dont suppose theres an iceax in the country and i never saw a party roped still i have been up seven or eight thousand feet several times  what were you doing asked miss kinnaird  weston saw the faint twinkle in ida stirlings eyes and fancied that he understood it very few of the inhabitants of that country climb for pleasure and it is difficult to obtain any of the regulation mountaineering paraphernalia there but when the wandering prospector finds a snowcrested range in his way he usually scrambles over it and carries his provisions and blankets along with him the fact that there are no routes mapped out and no chalets or club shelters to sleep in does not trouble men of that kind  once or twice we were on the gold trail he said another time i packed for a couple of englishmen who were looking for mountain goats  get any kinnaird asked sharply  no sir we didnt even see one said weston and again he noticed miss stirlings smile  well said kinnaird we are breaking camp tomorrow and my idea is that mrs kinnaird should go on with the baggage in the canoes the rest of us will follow the bench and after working around the head of the big spur yonder come down again to the water by the other slope you are of course willing to make the ascent with us  i am under your orders said weston still i shouldnt advise it  why  it was rather difficult to answer weston could not tell the major that he considered him a little too old for that work or that he was dubious about his daughters stamina and courage he had seen selfconfident strangers come down from those mountains dressed in rags with their boots torn off their bleeding feet besides he felt reasonably sure that as he was not a professional guide any advice that he might feel it wise to offer would not be heeded  i have heard that there is thick timber on the other slope he said its generally rather bad to get through  kinnaird who never had been in really thick timber dismissed the matter with a smile  we will start at six tomorrow and endeavor to get down to camp again on the other side in the afternoon you will arrange about provisions  weston said that he would do so but he was not exactly pleased when he watched the major climb the hillside immediately behind them with his glasses to plot out the route it seemed very probable that once he had fixed on one he would adhere to it at any cost and perhaps the more persistently if the course in question appeared inadvisable to his companions weston did not pretend to be a great judge of character but kinnaird who it seemed had held command in india struck him as that kind of man his wife was a little placid lady whose bodily vigor and any resolution of character she might once have possessed had apparently evaporated under the indian sun and as far as weston had noticed she invariably agreed with whatever was said when he waited on them at supper their talk was of the easier ascents in switzerland and in the mountains of his own land whose names rang like music in his earsthe striding edge the great gable needle and saddleback crags the needle was certainly difficult to climb but the striding edge on a still day was a secure promenade compared with some of the ledges along which he had seen western prospectors struggle with a months supplies  supper which as usual was prepared about six oclock had been over an hour or two when after waiting for an opportunity he found ida alone beside the lake  cant you persuade these people not to go miss stirling he asked  the girl smiled  no she said i think you ought to recognize that  then cant you make some excuse for stopping behind with mrs kinnaird  why  weston made a little gesture  it will probably be a tough climb id rather you didnt go  dusk was creeping up the hillside but there was still a little light among the misty pines and the girl flashed a quick glance at him he seemed diffident but it was evident that he did not wish her to go and once more she felt that he aroused her curiosity  that she observed is not exactly an answer why should i stay below  weston was relieved at this for it seemed preferable to him that she should be the one to raise the personal side of the question  well he said for one thing my employer is your father  it occurred to the girl that the qualification might as well have been left out it was too suggestive since it conveyed the impression that the fact he had mentioned was not the only one that influenced him but she had noticed already that weston was not a finished diplomatist she became more curious as to why he was especially concerned about her safety though as a matter of fact he could not have told her because he did not know  major and miss kinnaird are his guests she observed  weston recognized the reproof in this and stood silent a moment or two until she spoke again  are you afraid my nerve may not prove equal to miss kinnairds she asked  weston smiled and answered without reflection  no he said that certainly wasnt troubling me when the pinch comes you could be relied on  he was conscious that he had gone too far and as often happens in such cases immediately went further  there is something about you that makes me sure of it  well said ida coldly it is very probable that the pinch wont come at all  she turned away and left him and weston frowned at the supper dishes he had carried down to the lake  i dare say that looked very much like a gratuitous impertinence fromthe packer he observed  he awakened at four the next morning and the mists were steaming among the pines when the indians ferried the party across the lake then for a couple of hours they went up steadily between apparently endless ranks of climbing pines with odd streams of loose gravel sliding down beneath their feet kinnaird led the way the girls came behind him climbing well and weston brought up the rear with an ample supply of provisions and a couple of big blankets strapped on his shoulders he explained that the blankets would do to sit on but knowing a little about those mountains he was somewhat dubious about their getting down again that afternoon the load was heavy and by and by his injured foot commenced to grow painful  then they left the last of the dwindling pines behind and pushed on along a slope that was strewn with shattered rock and debris which made walking arduous then they reached a scarp of rock ground smooth by the slipping down of melting snow and when they had crossed that their difficulties began the scarp broke off on the verge of an almost precipitous rift and a torrent that seemed drawn out into silklike threads roared in the depths of it a few pines were sprinkled about the slopes of the gully and one or two of them which had fallen lay athwart the creek  they stopped for a few minutes upon a dizzy ledge of rock from which they looked far down across battalions of somber trees upon the gleaming lake below here weston was guilty of an indiscretion he admitted afterward that he ought to have known that a man used to command in india who claimed some acquaintance with alpine climbing was not likely to be advised by him  i believe we could get down sir and there are several logs across the creek he said we must get over it somehow and the gully will probably run into a canon lower down  that remarked kinnaird dryly is perfectly evident it is however my intention to follow up the gully  weston was conscious that ida stirling was glancing at him but his face remained expressionless and as he suggested nothing further they went on again the mountain slope had been steadily growing steeper beneath them and they had not yet reached the bench they went up for another hour and then came out upon the expected strip of plateau in the midst of which the gully died out the plateau however lay on the northern side of a great peak and was covered with slushy snow kinnaird looked somewhat dubiously at the latter which seemed deep in the hollows  the snow will have gone once we get around the western shoulders he said it must be almost as near to get down from that side and the canoes will have gone on by now still its rather a long time since breakfast  he glanced at the girls and appeared relieved when ida said  i think we would better push on a little further before we stop for lunch  they plunged into a snowdrift to the knees and when they had floundered through it for thirty yards or so weston sank suddenly well over his waist he flung himself forward and with the help of kinnaird wriggled clear but when they looked down there was empty blackness beneath the hole he had made  its a snowbridge i think sir he said the creeks running under it anyway i didnt touch anything solid with my feet  kinnairds face grew graver  if youre right he observed it would be wiser to work around  they spent an hour doing it and then crossing kneedeep they sat down on a ledge of jutting rock while weston laid out a simple meal it was very cold in the shadow of the peak and a bitter wind that seemed to be gathering strength whistled eerily about the desolation of rock and snow they were wet to the knees and weston fancied that the girls cheerfulness was a trifle forced he was ready to admit that he was somewhat stiff and weary for he had carried the provisions and the heavy blankets that the girls had now tucked round them  the latter commenced to flag when they started again and as it happened the strip of bench they followed rapidly narrowed in and grew rougher until it became little more than a sloping ledge with the hillside dropping almost sheer away from it it was strewn with great fragments that had fallen from the wall of rock above and banks of snow lay packed between them in the hollows every now and then one or another of the party sank deep on stepping down from some ledge of slippery stone they were on the northern side of a spur of the higher range though they were approaching the angle where it broke off and fell in a steep declivity facing west this point they had to turn before they reached the spot from which kinnaird purposed descending to the river they made very slow progress while the shadow of the peaks grew blacker and longer across the hills at length when they had almost reached the corner kinnaird stopped to consider and the girls sat down with evident alacrity this time he looked at weston and his manner implied that he was willing to consider any views that he or the others might express  im afraid that i have been a little at fault he admitted in fact i quite expected that we would be down again by this time it is now well on in the afternoon and as we have probably covered about twothirds of the distance it would not be advisable to go back as we came up  that said arabella kinnaird decisively is unthinkable  she turned to weston who nodded  anyway the canoes have gone on which means that there would be nothing to eat until we came up with them he said it must be eight or nine miles by water from our last camp to where they are to wait for us and the ladies couldnt go so far through the thick timber in the valley  kinnaird looked beneath him  well i dont think anybody could get straight down from here he said  it was clearly beyond the power of those who were with him as they quite realized a few yards away the hillside fell almost precipitously for perhaps a thousand feet to the tops of the pines below part of it was smooth rock but long banks of gravel lay resting in the hollows at so steep a slope that it was evident that a footstep would be sufficient to dislodge them indeed without that every now and then some of them broke away and plunged down into the valley close behind the party a wall of crags rose sheer for a hundred feet at least kinnaird glanced up at them with a frown  i fancy we should find another level strip above he said but since we cant get up the only thing to do is to push on from what i saw through my glasses when i went up the lake there is certainly an easier slope once we get around the corner  they went on wearily with the wall of rock creeping out nearer and nearer to the edge of the declivity and it became quite clear to weston that the girls strength was rapidly failing still he quietly urged them on for it was now becoming a somewhat momentous question whether they could get down before darkness fell and as a rule the white mists settle heavily upon those ranges with the dusk then the margin between rock and declivity almost disappeared and weston looking down on the somber treetops felt reasonably certain that there was now another wall of crags between the foot of the slope and them  i suppose you are quite sure sir that the face of the hill is less steep around the corner in front of us he asked  i am replied kinnaird i traced out the route with my glasses from the head of the lake where i was wrong was in not heading for higher level the bench i intended to follow is clearly above us  weston glanced at ida and noticed that her face was very weary and a trifle gray but she smiled at him reassuringly and they floundered on until the wall of rock pushed them right out to the edge of the declivity they clung to it here and there with their hands while they felt for a foothold among the banks of gravel suddenly ida slipped and clutched at weston her hand fell upon the package of provisions that he had slung behind his shoulders with a strip of deerhide and for she was of full stature and not particularly slender it broke away then there was a roar of sliding stones and weston dropping on his knees flung an arm about the girl she fell as he did it and they slid down together a yard or so before he drove one foot deep into the gravel and brought himself up then he risked a glance at her  dont look down he commanded sharply  her face was set and white but she met his gaze and in her eyes there was something that suggested confidence in him he felt that he could be sure of her nerve but whether her strength or his would suffice for the scramble back was another matter and he was horribly afraid kinnaird lying flat down held out his hand and in a moment or two weston and the girl stood with the others close beneath the rock he did not know how they got there he was quivering all through and the perspiration of tense effort dripped from him while he stood there gasping the packet of provisions which had apparently rested for a few moments among the gravel dislodged by his efforts to climb up rolled down the slope and he watched it rush downward until he turned his eyes away it was too horribly suggestive but his gaze was drawn back again against his will and he saw the package vanish suddenly that made it quite clear that the slope ended in another wall of crags  he did not remember whether ida or the others said anything to him but they crept on again almost immediately clinging to the rock and scarcely venturing to glance down at the climbing forest which now appeared to lie straight beneath them but very far away a cold wind stung their faces the rocks above rose higher but there was at least no snow beneath their feet and they moved on yard by yard scarcely daring to breathe at times until at length kinnaird cried out in a voice that was hoarse with exultation  we are over the worst  then weston gasped with sincere relief for it was clear that they had crept around the perilous corner the wall of rock receded and the slope became less steep in front of them it was however strewn with massy fragments and debris carried down by the snow and the sun that flung a warm light upon it hung just clear of the peaks across the valley there was no doubt that his companions were worn out and he fancied that the girls could scarcely drag themselves along but they had now no provisions and it was clearly advisable to get down at least as far as the timber where one could make a fire before darkness fell and they pushed on arabella kinnaird scrambling over a pile of ragged stones came down heavily she cried out as she did so and then rising with some difficulty immediately sat down again with her face awry  its my knee she said faintly  kinnaird scrambled toward her but she waved him back  go on with the packer she said  kinnaird and weston proceeded a little farther down the slope which was practicable though very steep and when ida called them back arabella smiled ruefully  its horribly bruised and im afraid ive twisted a ligament or something of that kind she said at least i cant put any weight on it  there was an expressive silence for the next few moments and kinnaird gazed down into the valley with consternation in his eyes the sun had dipped behind the peaks by this time and the great hollow was growing dim and hazy the river was blotted out and even the climbing forest seemed indistinct  could you get along on my arm he asked  no said arabella sharply i dont think i could put my foot on the ground  weston said nothing though he realized that the situation was becoming serious they had had no more than one hasty meal since early morning and they were worn out it was also as he knew very cold up on the hills at night while he considered the matter kinnaird stretched out a pointing hand  look he said  a trail of filmy vapor crawled out athwart the lower pines and covered them as it rolled rapidly upward while they watched it the depths of the valley were filled and became a dim white plain that extended its borders as it ascended long billows of vapor rolled out from its edges and slid up the hollows blotting out the somber ranks of climbing pines one by one until all had gone and rock scarp and rugged peak rose isolated from a vast sweep of mist it crawled up the slope where they sat and then stopped and came no higher leaving the rampart of rock and snow behind them to glimmer coldly blue and gray against the clear green radiance of the evening sky kinnaird looked at weston as if willing to entertain any suggestion  its clear that we cant get down he said  weston nodded  i fancy that i could reach the timber sir he said ill bring up a load of branches to make a fire  he loosed the blankets from his shoulders and floundering down the slope was lost in the vapor     chapter v  idas confidence   an hour passed and it was growing dark when weston scrambled up the hillside emptyhanded  theres a slope between us and the timber sir thats too steep to get down he announced i worked along the edge of it until the light failed me and the mist got very thick  you did quite right to come back said kinnaird we shall have to stay here what do you suggest  weston looked around him carefully  theres a little hollow under the ledge yonder you should keep fairly warm there close together with the blankets over you  kinnaird demurred to this but weston drawing him aside spoke forcibly and at length he made a sign of acquiescence  well he said no doubt youre right after all the great thing is to keep the warmth in us where are you going  ill find a burrow somewhere within call said weston quietly  he was busy for some little time scraping stones out from the hollow beneath the ledge and then he built a rough wall of the larger ones on two sides of it after that they got miss kinnaird there with some difficulty and when she and the others had crept into the shelter and wrapped the blankets round them he turned away and stretched himself out beneath the largest stone he could find for an hour he lay there smoking and then put his pipe away he had not much tobacco and it occurred to him that he might want the little that remained on the morrow  in the meanwhile it had grown bitterly cold and one never feels the cold so much as when a days arduous exertion has exhausted the natural heat of the body weston was also very hungry and after beating his numbed hands he thrust them inside his deerskin jacket they had probably reached no great height but summer was only commencing and it was evidently freezing indeed the nights had been cold enough when he lay well wrapped up in the sheltered valley still the mist at least climbed no higher the stars were twinkling frostily and opposite him across the valley a great graywhite rampart ran far up into the dusky blue he watched it for a while and then it seemed to grow indistinct and hazy and when some time afterward he opened his eyes again he saw that there was no mist about the slopes beneath  then as he looked about him stiff with cold he noticed that a halfmoon had sailed up above the peaks its elusive light lay upon the slope but ledge and stone seemed less distinct than their shadows which were black as ebony after that he commenced a struggle with himself for numbed as he was he did not want to move which is one of the insidious effects of cold it cramps its victims volition as well as his body and makes him shrink from any attempt at the muscular effort which would make it easier for him to resist it after all the endurance of bitter frost is rather a question of moral than physical strength as every prospector who has crossed the snowbound altitudes on the gold trail knows  he forced himself to get up and stood still shivering in every limb while a bitter wind struck through him as he gathered his resolution together then stripping off his deerskin jacket he flung it over one arm as he turned toward his companions shelter kinnaird was awake and his daughter cried out drowsily when weston stood looking down at him  its clearing and i think i could get down he said it would be better if miss stirling came with me  yes said kinnaird reflectively i think she ought to go  there was however a difficulty when ida rose to her feet and stood looking about her half awake she could not speak distinctly but she seemed bent on staying then kinnaird made a sign to weston who quietly slipped his arm within the girls and drew her away she went with him some little distance too dazed to resist and then snatching her arm free turned upon him white with cold and anger  what right have you or major kinnaird she began but weston checked her with a little forceful gesture  i at least have none at all he admitted in a way however i suppose im responsible for the safety of the whole party could you have done miss kinnaird any good by staying  cold and half dazed as she was a moments reflection convinced ida that she could have done very little beyond helping to keep her companion warm weston who did not wait for her answer went on  now he said severely do you feel as comfortable as usual or are you almost too cold to move  the girl admitted that the latter was the case and weston spread out his hands  well he said it will be at least another six hours before the first sunlight falls on that ledge besides as you may remember you have had only one meal since early yesterday morning and i shall be especially fortunate if i can get back here with the indians by noon major kinnaird and his daughter must stay but that doesnt apply to you are you still quite sure you have any cause to be angry with me  ida looked at him with a little flash in her eyes  oh she said i suppose youre right still is it necessary to make the thing so very plain  weston laughed  i just want you to realize that you are in my hands until we reach level ground he replied in the meanwhile i should like you to put on this jacket  he held out the warm deerhide garment and the girl flashed a covert glance at him he stood close by her in loose blue shirt and thin duck trousers and as far as she could see by the moonlight his face was pinched and blue with cold  i wont she said  weston pursed up his face whimsically he seldom shone where diplomacy was advisable as a rule he endeavored to bring about the end he had in view by the most direct means available in the present instance he felt very compassionate toward his companion and recognized only the necessity of getting her back to camp where there was food and shelter as soon as possible still it not infrequently happened that his severely simple procedure proved successful  well he said since i dont intend to wear it well leave it here ill leave you for a minute or two while i prospect for an easier route than the one by which i came up  he flung down the jacket and striding away disappeared while ida shivered as she glanced about her she could no longer see the shelter she had left and she stood alone in the midst of a tremendous desolation of rock and snow with the valley yawning a vast dusky pit beneath her feet it was appallingly lonely and she was numb with cold while since she was sure that she could not climb back to her companions unassisted there was only one person on whom she could rely and that was the packer who had insisted on her doing what he thought fit when he came back she had put on the jacket but he had sense enough to make no sign of having noticed it  i can see our way for the next few hundred feet he said  the way did not prove an easy one but they went down with the gravel sliding beneath them and now and then a mass of debris they had loosened rushing past it occurred to ida that weston limped somewhat awkwardly and once or twice she fancied that she saw his face contract as they scrambled over some shelf of jutting stone but they pushed on cautiously until they came to a precipitous descent ida sat down gasping when her companion stopped and gazed with an instinctive shrinking into the gulf below she could now see the climbing pines black beneath the moon and the river shining far away in the midst of them but they seemed to go straight down she was very weary and scarcely felt able to get up again but in a minute or two weston held out his hand  i fancy that this ridge dies out somewhere to the left well follow the crest of it until we can get around the end he said  they went on very cautiously though there were times when ida held her breath and was glad of the firm grasp that her companion laid on her arm she would not look down into the valley and when she glanced aside at all it was up at the gleaming snow on the opposite side of it she seemed to be walking in midair cut off from the comfortable security of the solid earth below and she found the clamor of falling water that came faintly up to her vaguely reassuring there had been an almost appalling silence where she had left her companions beneath the frozen peaks but now one could hear the hoarse fret of a rapid on the river and this was a familiar sound that she welcomed  still her weariness gained on her and her limbs grew heavier until she could scarcely drag herself along westons limp became more perceptible too but he went on with an almost cruel persistency and forced her forward with his hand on her arm sometimes he spoke to her and though his voice was strained his words were cheering and compassionate  at length the descent they skirted became less steep and scrambling down over a broken slope they presently reached the timberstraggling juniper and little scattered firs that by and by grew taller and closer together and though the peril was over it was then that their real difficulties commenced the slope was so steep that they could scarcely keep a footing and now and then they fell into the trees there were places where these grew so close together that they could scarcely force a passage through and others where they had gone down before a screaming gale and lay piled in a tangled chaos over which it was almost impossible to flounder it was dark in the timber and they could not see the broken ends of the branches that rent their clothing but they went on somehow down and down until when they reached a clearer space where the moonlight shone through ida sank down limply on a fallen tree her skirt was rent to tatters and one shoe had been torn almost to pieces  i simply cant go on she said  weston leaned against a neighboring fir looking down at her very compassionately though she noticed that his face on which the moonlight fell was somewhat drawn and gray  try to think he said  i cant replied ida i only want to sleep  her companion moved forward and quietly laid his hand on her arm as though to urge her to rise  dont you understand how it is your friends are up yonder in the frost with nothing to eat i have to take the indians back for them  then you must go on the girl said faintly  weston shook his head  no he declared not without you thats out of the question if there were no other reason we should have to come back here for you and i expect that in the daylight we shall find a shorter way up it will be noon anyway before we get there and you wouldnt wish to keep your friends waiting longer  ida rose with an effort and clung heavily to his arm when they crept downward again but the light grew a little clearer as they proceeded and the sound of the river rang louder in their ears then in the gray of the morning they staggered out upon the bank of the river walking half awake ida floundered among the boulders and through a horrible maze of whitened driftwood cast up by the stream farther on they fortunately found stretches of smooth sand and they plodded over these and through little pools though she afterward fancied that weston carried her across some of the deeper ones  the sun was high when they saw the two canoes drawn up on the bank and a few moments later mrs kinnaird appeared among the firs she ran toward them stumbling in a ludicrous fashion amidst the boulders and then stopped a few yards away and gazed at ida the girl could scarcely stand from weariness and her dress clung about her wet with the riverwater and rent to tatters there was fear in the little ladys eyes  where are they she asked  weston stepped forward limping and his face was set and gray  up yonder and quite safe he said miss kinnaird has hurt her knee nothing serious but it hurts her to walk i came for the indians to help her down again  he raised his hand restrainingly  there is no cause for alarm get miss stirling something to eat and leave the rest to me  he turned away abruptly and limped past them toward the camp when mrs kinnaird and ida reached it he was hastily getting together provisions and the indians were already hewing down two slender firs when they stood waiting each with a stout fir pole on his shoulder he turned to the anxious lady who seemed bent on going with him  its quite out of the question for you to undertake that climb well be back again in a few hours with the major and miss kinnaird he said  ida went up to him and touched his arm and for no very evident reason the color crept into her face when he looked at her inquiringly  cant the indians find the way themselves she asked you are scarcely fit to go  weston shook his head  i must manage it somehow he said they have nothing to eat up yonder and the indians might not find them until its dark again  he broke off for a moment with a forced smile  try to reassure mrs kinnaird and then go to sleep as soon as you can  in another minute he had limped away and mrs kinnaird found the girl looking down with a very curious expression at a little smear of blood on a smooth white stone there were further red spots on the shingle and they led forward in the direction in which the rescue party had gone  oh she said he told me he had cut his foot and he couldnt have waited long enough to eat anything  then she gasped once or twice for she was worn out to the verge of a breakdown and mrs kinnaird who saw how white her face was growing slipped an arm about her and led her back toward the tent  the afternoon passed very slowly with the little anxious lady and every now and then she crept softly out of the tent and gazed expectantly up the steep hillside still each time she did it there was nothing that she could see except the long ranks of somber firs and the oppressive silence was broken only by the sound of the river  then she slipped back quietly into the tent where ida lay in a restless sleep now and then the girl moved a little and once or twice she murmured unintelligibly it was very hot for the sunrays struck down upon the canvas between the firs whose clogging honeylike sweetness was heavy in the air  by and by however it grew a little cooler as the shadow of the great dark branches crept across the tent then they moved out upon the dazzling river and slowly covered it mrs kinnaird rising once more in an agony of impatience stumbled against one of the tent supports the crutch and ridgepoles rattled and ida opened her eyes  oh she said drowsily you neednt be anxious he is quite sure to bring them back  she apparently tried to rouse herself and failing went to sleep again but she left mrs kinnaird a little comforted the latter was observant and she felt that ida stirling had a reason for her confidence which she fancied was not lightly given  the sunlight had however faded off the valley when she rose for the last time from the seat she had found outside the tent for there was no doubt now that a faint patter of feet on stones mingled with the clamor of the river almost as she did so a few plodding figures appeared beneath the firs and she saw that two of them carried a litter between them then she saw her husband walking very wearily and she ran forward with a little cry she grasped one of the poles between which a sagging blanket hung and weston who held the ends of them looked at her  miss kinnaird isnt hurt much he said harshly dont stop us now  then she heard her daughters voice bearing out this assurance and she went back with the plodding men while her husband stumbled along wearily at her side in a minute or two weston calling to one of the indians laid down his end of the poles and staggering away sat down heavily none of them troubled themselves about him and ida who had risen when she heard their voices helped to convey miss kinnaird into the tent in the meanwhile one of the indians growled to his comrade when he found the fire out and stolidly proceeded to relight it while weston lay with his back against a fir and watched him with halfclosed eyes the siwash however proved that he was capable of preparing a meal and when it was finished arabella who appeared much fresher than the major proceeded to relate her adventures to ida and her mother  it was rather horrible up on the range and i was almost afraid they wouldnt get me down she said i dont know how they did it im sure parts of the way were simply awful they had to cut the little trees down for yards at a time to get my blanket litter through and there were places so steep that they could scarcely crawl down the indians of course had to be relieved now and then and my father and the packer took turns with them  she looked at the major with a smile  when it was especially steep i preferred an indian and the packer once you know you dropped me but nothing seemed to disconcert that young man he must have been horribly worn out for he had been up twice but he was so steady and reassuringly quiet i suppose a man of his kind would appreciate twenty dollars he really deserves it  ida frowned and remembered the trail of blood on the white stones when the packer had started kinnaird made a little abrupt movement  im afraid that i was forgetting all about the man in my relief at getting you safely down he said we owe him a good deal and ill go out presently and thank him but theres another matter your knee ought to be attended to  that commenced a discussion but arabella persisted that she would get over the injury if she didnt walk for a few days  then kinnaird summoned one of the indians to clear away the meal the brownskinned darkhaired man appeared in the entrance of the tent and spoke haltingly in english  they wait he said pointing to the supper plates want piece shirthandkerchief packer mans boot full of blood  those he addressed looked at one another and kinnaird rising went out hastily     chapter vi  kinnaird strikes camp   it was about the middle of the next afternoon when ida stirling walking slowly along the riverbank came upon weston sitting with his back to a tree he wore no boot on one foot which was wrapped in bandages and when he would have risen ida checked him with a sign and sat down not far away  is it too hot in the tent he asked  ida flashed a swift glance at him he seemed perfectly contented and very much at his ease and it was a little difficult to believe that this was the sharpvoiced mart who had ordered her to put on his jacket early on the previous morning now he was smiling languidly and there was a graceful carelessness that was almost boyish in his manner which made it a little easier to understand why his comrades had called him the kid she was rather pleased with it  no she said at least that was not what brought me out the major has gone fishing mrs kinnaird has gone to sleep and arabella appears a little cross  weston nodded  its excusable he said how is miss kinnairds knee  i dont think its very bad how is your foot it doesnt seem to have affected your temper  weston laughed  id forgotten all about it in some respects i feel a little obliged to it you see for once in a while its rather nice to have nothing to do and know that ones wages wont immediately stop besides to be waited on is a pleasant change  idas eyebrows straightened a trifle as they sometimes did when she was not exactly pleased it is by no means an unusual thing in the west for a packer or a ranch hand to converse with his employers or their friends on familiar terms and it occurred to her that it was a trifle superfluous for him to insist on reminding her of his status when she was willing to forget it still she was quite aware that this man had not always been a packer and she was conscious of an increasing curiosity concerning his past  that is an unusual experience with you she asked  oh yes said weston anyway during the last few years  she was foiled again for she could not press the question more closely and sitting still in the shadow she looked up between the dark fir branches at the line of gleaming snow and the great rock rampart beneath which they had crept  were you ever up so high before she ventured  yes said weston i believe so but never for pleasure in fact i think some of the ranges we crossed on the gold trail must have been considerably higher i told you that prospecting is one of my weaknesses  you did agreed ida its one i could never understand though i have spent some time in this province every now and then it seems that the rancher must leave his clearing and wander off into the bush as you admitted he generally comes home dressed in rags and very seldom brings anything with him why do you do it  weston laughed in a rather curious fashion  oh he said dont you know did you never feel even in winter in montreal when you had skatingrinks tobogganslides snowshoe meets and sleighrides to keep you amused that it was all growing tiresome and very stale havent you felt that you wanted somethingsomething you hadnt got and couldnt definethough you might recognize it when you found it  once more idas eyebrows straightened he was going rather deeper than she had supposed him capable though she was not altogether unacquainted with the restlessness he had described weston glanced at her face and nodded  well he said thats very much what happens to the rancher and the trackgrader every now and then and when it does he goes up into the bushprospecting still i think you were wrong when you said that we seldom bring back anything did you bring nothing down with you from the quiet and the glimmering moonlight up yonder above the timber line  his companion looked up across the climbing forest to the desolation of rock and snow through which she had wandered with him a little while ago it had been her first ascent and she now felt the thrill of achievement and remembered how she had come down that apparently endless slope in the darkness the feat looked almost impossible by daylight then she remembered also how her nerves had tingled and the curious sense of exaltation that had come over her as she crept along the dizzy edge of the great rock scarp in the moonlight far above the unsubstantial ghosts of climbing trees for the time being it had proved stronger than weariness or the sense of personal danger and she had a vague fancy that the memory of it would always cling to her  yes she said i think i brought down something or rather it attached itself to me what is it  weston spread out his hands with a boyish laugh  how should i know its glamour and mystery perhaps still though the prospector knows it everybody cant feel it one must have sympathy it would make itself felt by you  the girls face checked him she felt that there was a subtle bond of mutual comprehension between her and this stranger but she was not prepared to admit it to him and he recognized that he had perhaps gone further than was advisable  still he continued though its plainest up on the high peaks the bush is full of it you can recognize it everywhere listen  ida did so she heard the hoarse fret of the river and the faint elfin sighing high up in the top of the firs  it was the old earth music and it drowned the recollection of social conventions and caste distinctions it was the same to camppacker and rich contractors daughter as ida listened it seemed to stir the primitive impulses of her human nature she took alarm and stopped her ears to it  is it wise to listen she asked it leads to nothing but restlessness  it seldom leads to any material benefit weston admitted after all i think one has to be a vagabond before one can properly appreciate it  you seem sure of that idas curiosity to know more of him would not permit her to avoid the personal application  im afraid there must be a little of the vagabond in me said weston with a smile once i walked into winnipeg without a dollar and was fortunate in hiring myself to add up figures in a big flourmill the people for whom i worked seemed quite pleased with the way i did it and paid me reasonably i lived in a big boardinghouse like a rabbitwarren through the thin partitions i could hear the people all about me stirring in their sleep at night i went to the mill in a crowded car every morning and up to the office in an elevator i stayed with it just a month and then i broke out  broke out said ida  threw the flourmill peoples pens across the office you see i was getting sick for room and air i presented the concern with my last weeks stipend and a man at the boardinghouse with my city clothes  what did you do then  took the trail there was limitless prairie straight on in front of me i walked for days and slept at night wherever i could find a bluff i could hear the little grasses whispering when i lay halfawake and it was comforting to know that there were leagues and leagues of them between me and the city i drove a team for a farmer most of that season then i went on to a track that they were strengthening and straightening in this province it ran between the rock and the river and the snow hadnt gone we worked waistdeep in it part of the time and thawed out every stick of giantpowder at the fire the construction boss was a hustler and he drove us mercilessly we toiled rawhanded wornout and savage and he drove us all the harder when one of the boys tried to brain him  and you never longed to be back in the office at the flourmill  weston laughed  didnt you find those sleighrides skatingrinks and even the trips west in your fathers private car grow exceedingly tame  ah said ida you must remember that i have never known anything else  then you have only to wait a little its quite certain that you wont be able to say that some day  it seemed to ida inadvisable to pursue the subject further though she was not sure that he wished to do so  how did you expend your energy after you left the track she asked  i dont quite remember drove horses went about with a thrashing outfit hewed logs for bridgesbut havent i talked too long about myself you have told me nothing ofmontreal  ida risked a chance shot  dont you know that kind of life it must be very much the same as the one your people lead in england it doesnt count that their amusements are slightly different  weston foiled her again  well he said with an air of reflection i dont quite think it is but perhaps im prejudiced i wheeled scrapiron at the rollingmills when i was in montreal  he leaned farther back against the tree with a little whimsical smile it was pleasant to appear as a modern ulysses in the eyes of a very pretty girl but he had as she was quick to recognize taken up the role unconsciously  where are you going next she asked  i shall probably go off prospecting if i can raise the money that is partly why i hope that major kinnaird will keep me as long as he camps out in the bush  ida laughed  i think you may count on that he is rather pleased with you in fact i heard him say that if hed had you in india he would have made a capable sergeant of you  she saw a shadow creep into his face and wondered what had brought it there for she did not know that in his younger days he had thought of sandhurst then seeing that he did not answer she rose  well she said arabella is probably wanting me  he watched her move away among the great fir trunks and then took out his pipe with a little sigh still he had or so he fancied sense enough to refrain from allowing his thoughts to wander in her direction too frequently and soothed by the murmur of the river he presently went to sleep when he awakened it was time to see that the indians got supper ready  during the evening stirling reached the camp and when the siwash who had poled his canoe up the river had drawn it out they sat down somewhat limply on the shingle for he had as usual traveled with feverish haste he stayed until the next day which was rather longer than any of them expected and it was not by accident that he came upon weston alone before he went away the latter was then engaged in lighting a fire and his employer sat down on a fir branch and quietly looked him over  foot getting better he asked  i think it is said weston  stirling nodded  i understand that you have been of some service to these people and theyre my daughters friends he said is there anything i can do for you  no replied weston i dont think there is  the contractor looked at him steadily for a moment or two  well he said if anything strikes you theres no reason why you shouldnt let me know feeling anxious to get back to the track  westons eyes twinkled  i dont think i am  then you may stay right where you are and take care of my daughter if she wants to climb mountains or shoot rapids its to be done but youll fix things so it can be done safely youre in charge of this outfit and not that major man  stirling was never addicted to mincing matters but weston could not quite repress a grin  it would make things a little difficult if major kinnaird understands that he said  then you must see that he doesnt you can fix it somehow its up to you  he rose as if there were nothing more to be said and then as he moved away he turned and waved his hand  ill have you moved up a grade on the payroll  he started down the river in another halfhour and left weston thoughtful he had never seen his employer before but it was evident that the latter had made a few inquiries concerning him and had been favorably informed  for another fortnight weston tactfully carried out his somewhat difficult task and then it was with a curious sense of regret that he stood one evening in a little roadside station major kinnaird was apparently counting the pile of baggage some little distance away his wife and daughter were in the stationroom and ida and weston stood alone where the track came winding out of the misty pines she glanced from him to the forest and there was just a perceptible hint of regret in her voice  it has been very pleasant and in one way im almost sorry we are going to vancouver she said thisand she indicated the wall of hillside and the shadowy bushgrows on one  weston nodded gravely  it does he said you have been up among the high peaks and youll never quite forget them even in the cities now and then youll feel them drawing you back again  the girl laughed perhaps because she realized that the memory of the last few weeks would remain with her she also remembered that he had said that the stillness among the white peaks and in the scented bush was filled with a glamour that seized on one  well she confessed i may come back with other friends some day and in that case we shall certainly ask for you as guide i want to say as major kinnaird did that we owe a good deal to you i am only sorry that the trip is over  then her tone changed a little and weston supposed that she was unwilling to make too great an admission  there are so many little discomforts you have saved us  yes he agreed a trifle dryly i suppose there are however i shall probably have gone away when you come back again  he broke off for a moment and then turned toward her quietly  still he said i seem to feel that i shall see you again some day  his voice was perfectly steady but though the light was fading fast ida saw the glint in his eyes and she answered conventionally  of course she said that would be a pleasure  then she spoiled it by a laugh when she saw the smile creep into her companions eyes for it was clear to both of them that the formal expression was in their case somewhat out of place they realized that there was more that might have been said and it was a slight relief when the shriek of a whistle came ringing down the track and a roar of wheels grew louder among the shadowy pines then the great mountain locomotive and the dusty cars came clanking into the station stopped a few moments and rolled away again and weston was left with the vision of a whiterobed figure in a fluttering dress that leaned out from a car platform looking back at the gleaming snow and then turned a moment to wave a hand to him  it was an hour later and the big nickeled lamps were lighted when arabella kinnaird looked up at her companion as she sat in a lurching car while the great train swept furiously down the fraser gorge  now she exclaimed i remember that packer has been puzzling me his face was familiar the same thing struck the major as you heard him say  well inquired ida a little too indifferently  her companion laughed  you overdo it it would be wiser to admit that you are curious the major said hed seen him somewhere and so he has in a way you remember his talking about the old north country hall he took for the shooting well the owners had left that young mans photograph among some other odds and ends in what they probably called the library  ida had no doubt upon the matter for she recalled the curious intentness of westons face as he sat in the firelight listening to kinnairds description of the house in question still she was not prepared to display her interest  well she inquired again  arabella kinnaird made a sign of impatience  cant you see they wouldnt have had his photograph unless he had been a friend of the family or a relative i wonder whether he told you his real name  he didnt  it doesnt matter said miss kinnaird i feel tolerably sure it is weston and that is the name of the people who own the place you dont appear to understand that the fact has its significance  how asked ida  you havent been in england or youd understand the people who live in those old places are often very poor but a certain number of them have something that the people who have only money would give a good deal to possess as a matter of fact though distinctly human in most respects they aredifferent  ida laughed  oh she said ive naturally heard of that its quite an old notion and didnt originate with you english people didnt the roman emperors claim to have the imperial purple in their veins still out here when we speak of a man appreciatively we say his blood isred  and thats the color of packer westons  a faint gleam crept into idas eyes as she remembered the whitefaced man who had limped out of camp one morning almost too weary to drag himself along  well she said i think you ought to know when he went back up the range for you he left a trail of it behind him  her companion had no opportunity for answering for major kinnaird came back from the smoking end of the car just then and when he spoke to ida his daughter took up a book she had laid down  in the meanwhile a mountain locomotive and a train of flat cars came clanking into the station where weston waited swinging himself onto one he took his place among the men who sat on the rails with which the car was loaded then as the big locomotive slowly pulled them out some of his new companions vituperated the stationagent for stopping them and one came near braining him with a deftlyflung bottle when he retaliated there were a good many more men perched on the other cars and weston concluded from the burst of hoarse laughter that reached him through the roar of wheels that all of them were not wholly sober they had been recruited in vancouver and included a few runaway sailormen one told him that they were going into the ranges to fill up a muskeg and he expressed his opinion of the meanness of the company for not sending them up in a colonist train and offered to throw weston off the car if he did not agree with him he explained that he had already pitched off two of his companions  weston endeavored to pacify him but failing in this and in an attempt to crawl over the couplings into the adjoining car he reluctantly grappled with the man and succeeded in throwing him into a corner then one of the others rose and stood over his prostrate comrade with a big billet of firwood that had been used to wedge the rails  i cant sleep with all this circus going on he said gruffly make any more trouble and off you go  the other man apparently decided to lie still and his comrade turned to weston  guess the construction boss isnt going to find them tally out right tomorrow he observed weve lost quite a few of them coming up the line  he went to sleep again soon afterward and weston was left in peace in front of him the great locomotive snorted up the climbing track hurling clouds of sparks aloft misty pines went streaming by the chill night wind rushed past the cars banged and clanked and now and then odd bursts of harsh laughter or discordant singing broke through the roar of wheels it was very different from the deep tranquillity of the wilderness and the quiet composure of the people with whom he had spent the last few weeks but as ida stirling had suggested westons blood was red and he was still young enough to find pleasure in every fresh draught of the wine of life it was something to feel himself the equal in bodily strength and animal courage of these strongarmed men who were going to fill up the muskeg     chapter vii  grenfells mine   it was saturday evening and weston sat on a ledge of the hillside above the silent construction camp endeavoring to mend a pair of duck trousers that had been badly torn in the bush he held several strips of a cotton flourbag in one hand and was considering how he could best make use of them without unduly displaying the bold lettering of the brand though in the bush of that country it was not an unusual thing for a man to go about labeled early riser or somebodys excelsior his companions had trooped off to the settlement about a league away and a row of flat cars stood idle on the track which now led across the beaten muskeg on the farther side of the latter the tall pines lay strewn in rows but beyond the strip of clearing the bush closed in again solemn shadowy and almost impenetrable there was a smell of resinous woodsmoke in the air but save for the distant sound of the river everything was very still  weston looked up sharply as a patter of approaching footsteps rose out of the shadows behind him some of the men were evidently coming back from the settlement earlier than he had expected in a few minutes three or four of them appeared among the trees and he recognized them as some of his friends small ranchers who had as often happens on the pacific slope been forced to leave their lonely halfcleared holdings and go out to earn the money that would keep them through the winter two of them were apparently assisting another man along between them and when they drew nearer weston saw that the latter was grenfell the cook  guess its bout time somebody else took care of you said one when they came up sit right down he added neatly shaking grenfell off his feet and depositing him unceremoniously at westons side  another of the men sat down close by and grenfell waved his hand to the others as they moved away  bless you youre good boys he said  the man who remained grinned at weston  weve packed the blame old deadbeat most three miles if tom hadnt promised to see him through id have felt tempted to dump him into the river the boys were trying to fill him up at the sprotson house  grenfell who did not appear to hear him thrust a hand into his pocket and pulling out a few silver coins counted them deliberately  twofoursix he said six dollars to face an unkind world with it isnt very much  he sighed and turned to weston  you know ive got to quit  thats right interposed the other man cassidys had most enough of him he never could cook anyway and the boys are getting thin last thing he did was to put the indurated plates on the stove to warm filled the thing right up and left them when he came back the plates had gone  weston who had been sent to work some distance from the camp that day and had not heard of this mishap felt sorry for grenfell the man evidently had always been somewhat frail and now he was past his prime indulgence in deleterious whisky had further shaken him he could not chop or ply the shovel and it was with difficulty that his companions had borne his cooking while it seemed scarcely likely that anybody would have much use for him in a country that is run by the young and strong he sat still regarding the money ruefully  six of themand they charge you one for a meal and a drink or two he said if i hadnt known where there was quartz streaked right through with wire gold i might have felt discouraged then he straightened himself resolutely seems to me its time i went up and looked for it again  how can you know where it is when you have to look for it the other man inquired  grenfell glanced at him severely  im not drunkits my knees he pointed out dont cast slurs on me i was once professor ofmineralogical chemist and famous assayer too biggest mining men in the country consulted me  the trackgrader nodded as he glanced at weston  i guess he was he said we had a man from back east on this section who had heard of him  then he turned to grenfell  go ahead and explain about the mine  im not sure that thats quite straight weston objected if he does know anything of the kind  oh said his companion im not on if he ever did know i guess he has forgotten it long ago he has been forgetting right along whether he put salt in the hash or not and each time he wasnt sure he did it again thats one of the things that made the trouble  grenfell stopped him with a gesture  im going to talk dont interrupt mr weston was once or twice a good friend to me and you have seen me through a few times lately now i know a quartz lead thats run through with wire gold quite rich enough to mill at a profit but i cant go up and look for it in the bush myself when i walk any distance my knees get shaky make you firm offereven shares to come up with me  where is it  grenfell turned and glanced toward the dim line of snow that gleamed high up above the forests in the north  theres a lakethe lake of the shadowsverneille called it that he said dreamily it lies in a hollow of the range with the black firs all round theres a creek at one side with a clear pool where it bends and i came there one day very hot and hungry with the boots worn off me i thinkand by his tense face he seemed to be trying earnestly to remember somethingwe were quite a few days crossing that range and our provisions were running put when we hit the valley  well prompted the trackgrader when he stopped  i crawled down to the pool to drink there were pebbles in it and a ledge above there were specks in the pebbles and specks that showed plainer in the ledge the stones were shot with the metal when i broke one or two of those i took out  he fumbled inside his pocket and produced a little bag from which he extracted a few broken bits of rock weston to whom he passed them could see that little threads of metal ran through them youre quite sure its gold the other man inquired  am i sure  grenfell smiled compassionately  i was professorbut guess ive told you that already  the lead inquired the other man  outcrop a few yards of it then it dips on a slight inclination and evidently runs back toward the range an easy drive for an adit stayed there two days verneille and i quite sure about that gold  westons face grew intent  you recorded it  we staked a claim and started back but verneille couldnt find a deer and when we first hit the valley provisions were running out there was a mist in the ranges and whichever way we headed we brought up on crags and precipices then we went up to look for another way across and got into the snow i never knew how i got outor where verneille went but when i struck a prospectors camphe wasnt with me  the trackgrader nodded he had been born among the ranges and knew that the prospectors who went out on the gold trail did not invariably come back he had heard of famishing men staggering along astonishing distances halfasleep or too dazed to notice where they were going he and weston had done so themselves for that matter  you told the prospector about the lead weston inquired  if i did he never found the mine i was scarcely sensible when i reached his camp and i lay there very ill until he went on and left me with half a deer hed shot after that i nearly gave out again making the settlements  well said the trackgrader wheres the lake  grenfell spread out his hands  i dont know i went up to look for it three or four times several years ago  he broke off abruptly and there was silence for a minute or two strange as the thing appeared it was not altogether an unusual story all the way from california to the frozen north one now and then may hear of men who struck a rich quartz or silver lead in the wilderness and coming down to record it signally failed to find it again what is stranger still there are mines that have been discovered several times by different men none of whom was ever afterward able to retrace his steps at any rate if one accomplished it he never came back to tell of his success for the bones of many prospectors lie unburied in the wilderness indeed when the wanderers who know it best gather for the time being in noisy construction camp or beside the snapping fire where the new wagon road cleaves the silent bush they tell tales of lost quartzreefs and silver leads as fantastic as those of the geniiguarded treasures of the east and the men who have been out on the gold trail generally believe them  on the surface grenfells task seemed easy he had to find a lonely lake cradled in a range and there are as the maps show three great ranges running roughly north and south in the pacific province still in practice it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins for that wild land has been aptly termed a sea of mountains they seem piled on one another peak on peak and spur on spur and among their hollows lie lonely lakes and frothing rivers almost without number while valley and hillslopes are usually shrouded in tremendous forest to the line where the dwindling pines meet the gleaming snow weston was of course aware of this and he felt somewhat naturally that it complicated the question  then grenfell turned to him and his companion  ive made you my offera thirdshare each he said are you coming  the trackgrader shook his head  no he replied i guess not im making good wages here so long as i can keep from riling cassidy theyre sure then he grinned at weston its your call  weston sat silent for a full minute but his heart was beating faster than usual and he glanced up from the piles of gravel and blackened fir stumps by the track to the gleaming snow a sudden distaste for the monotonous toil with the shovel came upon him and he felt the call of the wilderness besides he was young enough to be sanguine although for that matter older men worn by disappointments and toilsome journeys among the hills have set out once more on the gold trail with an optimistic faith that has led them to their death ambition awoke in him and he recognized now that the week or two spent in kinnairds camp had rendered it impossible for him to remain a trackgrader at length he turned to grenfell  well he said if youre still in the same mind tomorrow ill come still if you think better of it you can cry off then  his sense of fairness demanded that for he would not bind a man whose senses were it seemed reasonable to suppose not particularly clear grenfell evidently understood him and drew himself up with an attempt at dignity  my heads quite right when im sitting down its my knees he said want to put the thing through nowhalfshare each well call it a bargain  the trackgrader nodded to weston  i guess you neednt stand off he said he knows what hes doing  they shook hands on it and then proceeded to discuss ways and means it was clear that they might be some time in the wilderness and would need provisions new boots blankets a rifle and a tent and all of these things are dear in that country they recognized that it would be advisable also to take a horse or mule weston did not think that any of the bush ranchers would hire them one as horses are not always brought back from such journeys this would render it necessary to buy one and to meet this expenditure grenfell had six dollars and weston not very much more  while they were considering what items they could leave out two or three men came up the trail from the settlement which led close by and one of them threw weston a couple of letters  mailcarrier rode in before we left and i guessed id bring them along he said  there was scarcely light enough to see by and weston had some little difficulty in reading the letters one was from stirling and ran      start on monday for winnipeg i want a talk with you and may     make a proposition enclose order that will frank you over the     cpr  weston gazed at it with a thoughtful face winnipeg was a very long way off and it was tolerably clear that stirling perhaps influenced by something his daughter or major kinnaird had said meant to offer him promotion still though he did not know exactly why he shrank from accepting any favor from miss stirlings father and besides that he had already pledged himself to grenfell he laid down the letter and opened the second one out of this he took an order on one of the hbc settlement stores dated at the vancouver station it was marked duplicate and read      to agent ansons forks station      provide mr weston with whatever he may require in the shape     of blankets provisions and any sundries in your stock for a     prospecting trip  a sheet of paper had been laid beside it and westons face flushed as he read wont you accept this with the good wishes of your late companions  it was evidently from miss stirling for it was a womans writing and he did not think an englishwoman would have said wont you as she had done he could recognize the delicacy with which she had refrained from offering him money or even stipulating any definite sum in the order and it was evident that she had taken some trouble to arrange the matter with the h b c agent at vancouver the thing had been done in kindness and yet it hurt him he could have accepted it more readily from anybody else on the other hand he remembered that she had known him only as a trackgrader and that he was as a matter of fact nothing else he could not send the order back without appearing ungracious or disposed to assert that he was of her own station then another thought struck him  i dont think they knew my name they called me clarence he said somebody must have thought it worth while to write cassidy  he had forgotten his companions and when grenfell looked at him inquiringly he laughed  its something i was thinking of he said handing the order across grenfell gazed at it with unqualified satisfaction  this straightens everything out he said  im not quite sure it does returned weston dryly in fact in some respects it rather complicates the thing that however is a point that doesnt concern you  his companion who appeared to concur in this glanced with evident regret at the six dollars which still lay beside him  if id known that the order was in the mail the boys would have had to carry me every rod of the way back to camp he said its not the first time that ive been sorry i practiced economy  weston left him shortly afterward and went back with the other man toward the shanty  the chances seem too steep for you suggested weston  well i guess he did strike that gold but i shouldnt be too sure of it its quite likely that he fancied the whole thing you cant count on the notions of that kind of man  he broke off for a moment and appeared to consider  theres another point the old tank has no nerves left and hes no use on his legs guess youll have to carry him over the range  weston fancied that this was probable and the trackgrader who turned away to speak to another man left him in a thoughtful mood     chapter viii  in the ranges   a month had passed when weston stood one morning outside the tent he scarcely expected that he or his comrade would sleep in again it was pitched beside a diminutive strip of boggy natural prairie under the towering range though the latter was then shrouded in sliding mist out of which the climbing firs raised here and there a ragged spire or somber branch the smoke of the cookingfire hung in heavy blue wreaths about the tent and a thick rain beat into the faces of the men  the few weeks they had spent in the wilderness had made a change in them grenfell had clearer eyes and skin and was steadier on his legs for he had slaked his thirst with riverwater for some time now weston was a little leaner and his face was grimmer than it had been for the whimsical carelessness had faded out of it both of them were dressed largely in rags and their stout boots were rent and they were already very wet though that was no great matter as they were used to it there are a good many rivers among those ranges and no bridges they were then glancing at the horse which was cropping the harsh grass of the swamp it was of the cayuse indian breed and not particularly valuable but it could be sold for something if they succeeded in taking it back to the settlements this however did not appear to weston very probable  short hobbles suggested grenfell theres grass enough to last awhile and its likely that well strike this way back its a long way to the settlements and therell be quite a load of provisions and things to pack  they had made a cache of most of their provisions the previous night after searching in vain for a route by which they could lead the horse over the range in front of them but weston shook his head  no he said we may not come back this way after all and a horse is pretty sure to get a hobble of any kind foul round something in the bush i cant have the beast held up to starve  well said grenfell i guess you understand what leaving it loose means  weston did he recognized that if they ever regained that valley they would have to push on for the settlements through a most difficult country under a heavy load and even then leave behind them many things which might have ministered to their comfort still he was resolute  the beast could find its food somehow if we left it loose and its quite probable that it would work down along the back trail to the settlements when the grass round here gets scarce he said in any case well give it a chance for its life  grenfell made a sign of acquiescence  have it your way if we ever come back to this cache again and im played out as i probably will be youll have the pleasure of packing down everything we want  weston did not answer but there was a little satisfied smile in his eyes as he watched the horse wander away unhampered into the rain after this they sat down to a very simple meal then they strapped their packs on their shouldersa thick blanket each a small bag of flour some salt pork and green tea and while grenfell carried the light ax weston slung a fryingpan a kettle and a pannikin about him as well as a rifle for there are blacktail deer in that country and they could not be sure that their provisions would last the journey through the prospector soon discovers how much a man can do without and it is a good deal more than men bred in the cities would suppose the oddments rattled and banged about westons shoulders as he went up the steep slope through the thick timber and by the time they had cleared the latter grenfell was visibly distressed and both of them realized that their difficulties had commenced  any one unaccustomed to the country would probably have considered the devious march that they already had made arduous enough but they had at least for the most part followed the valleys and crossed only a few low divides and it was evident now that their way led close up to the eternal snow there was a rock scarp in front of them up part of which they went on their hands and knees when they reached the summit of this the slightly more level strip along which they floundered was strewn with shattered rock and gravel that had come down from the heights above with the thaw in the spring and it was with difficulty that they made a mile an hour the gold trail is usually long and arduous but the prospector is content to have it so for once it is made easier the poor mans day has gone then the men of the cities set up their hydraulic monitors or drive their adits and the freelance who disdains to work for them rolls up his old blankets and pushes out once again into the waste  they made supper at sunset among the last of the dwindling pines and then lay awake shivering part of the night for a nipping wind came down from the snow and they were very wet and cold it rained again the next day and most of the following one still they spent the two days crawling along the farther side of the range for when they had struggled through the snow in a rift between two peaks a great wall of rock that fell almost sheer cut them off from the next valley somewhat to westons astonishment grenfell now showed little sign of flagging he seemed intent and eager and when they stopped gasping where the rock fell straight down beneath their feet to the thick timber that climbed from a threadlike river he sat down and gazed steadily below him  theyre hemlocks along that bend he asked pointing to a ridge of somber green that rose above the water  yes said weston i think they are  grenfell straightened himself suddenly  my sights not as good as yours but i seemed to know they must be can you make out any douglas firs in the thicker timber  yes said weston excitedly theres a spire or two higher than the rest you recognize the place  his companion sat still with signs of tension in his face and it was clear that he was racking his befogged brain the few weeks of abstinence and healthful toil had made a change in him but one cannot in that space of time get rid of the results of years of indulgence and under stress of excitement the man became confused and fanciful  im not sure im trying to think he said laying a lean trembling hand on westons arm did you never feel that there was something you ought to recollect about a spot which you couldnt have seen before  weston was in no mood to discuss questions of that kind though the curious sensation was not altogether unfamiliar to him  theres only one way you could have known there was hemlock yonder he asserted  grenfell looked up at him with a dry smile  you have to remember that i have been up in the ranges several times parts of them are very much alike  after that weston sat very still for several minutes though he found it exceedingly difficult he had more than once during the last few weeks doubted that grenfell had ever found the quartzreef at all for it seemed quite possible that he had as the trackgrader suggested merely fancied that he had done so and the mans manner had borne out that supposition cut off from the whisky he had now and then fallen into fits of morbid moodiness during which he seemed very far from sure about the gold this had naturally occasioned weston a good deal of anxiety he had thrown up his occupation and sunk his last dollar in the venture and the finding of the quartzreef would he commenced to realize open up to him alluring possibilities at length his companion spoke slowly  if the river runs across the valley to the opposite range a mile higher this is the way i came down when i found the gold he said  weston scrambled to his feet floundering in haste along the edge of the crag he stopped some sixty yards farther on with a little quiver running through him from that point he could see that the river ran straight across to the opposite wall of rock he flung up his arms with an exultant shout then they went on eagerly when grenfell joined him  yes said the latter when he had glanced below i must have seen it the time i struck the gold only then i came down the valley  they pushed on toward sunset a thick rain once more came down and filmy mists wreathed themselves about the hills and by and by filled up the valley and the strip of mountainside along which the two lonely men plodded rose isolated from a sea of woolly vapor they held on however until when the dusk commenced to creep up the white peak above them weston stopped with a little start there was a curious huddled object in a crevice of the rocks not far in front of him  do you see that he asked what can it be  grenfell gazed at the thing steadily and then turned to his companion  i think its verneille he said  they came a little nearer and saw that he was right for presently grenfell stooped and picked up a discolored watch it had fallen away from the moldering rags but it had a solid case and when at length he succeeded in opening it he recognized the dial he gazed at it with a softening face and then slipped it into his pocket  he was a good comrade a man with long patience and i think he had a good deal to bear from me he said  in the meanwhile weston stood still with the rain on his face and his battered hat in his hand verneille lay in a cleft of the rocks where it seemed he had crawled when he broke down on his last weary march but the sun and the rain had worked their will and there was very little left of him indeed part of the bony structure had rolled clear of the shreds of tattered rags grenfell gazed at him fixedly and neither of the men said anything for the next minute or two the peak above them was fading in the growing night and the stillness of the great desolation seemed intensified by the soft patter of the rain then weston roused himself with an effort for there was something to be done  we cant leave him lying there he said there is a little soil among the stones its a pity we didnt bring the shovel  the shovel was in the cache with one or two other prospectors tools which as the reef they desired to find was uncovered in one place they had not thought it worth while to carry over that high ridge so they set to work in silence with the rifle butt and their naked hands fortunately the stones were large and the soil beneath them soft and in about twenty minutes they were ready for the rest of their task it was one from which they shrank but they accomplished it and grenfell straightened himself wearily as they laid the last stone on the little mound  its all we can do but i should feel considerably better if i could get a hard drink now he said  then he made a little forceful gesture  after all hes well out of it that man was white all through  it was verneilles only epitaph pronounced most incongruously with the same breath that expressed his comrades longing for whisky but perhaps it was sufficient for when one is called a white man it implies a good deal in that country nobody it seemed knew where he came from or whether there was any one who belonged to him but he had done his work and they had found him sitting high on the lonely range to point the way that might have been of no great service if it were only treasure to which the gold trail led but in the unclaimed lands the prospector scouts a little ahead of the march of civilization after him come the axmen the ploughmen and the artisans and orchards and mills and oatfields creep on a little farther into the wilderness civilization has its incidental drawbacks but in the west at least its advance provides those who need them with new homes and food and when one comes to think of it in other respects it is usually the dead men who have pushed on in advance who point the way  a part only of the significance of that fact occurred to grenfell when the two men had plodded slowly on and left the little pile of stones behind and that was naturally the part applicable to his particular case  this makes the thing quite certain he said were on the trail  it was not astonishing that weston had deduced as much already  have you any idea where you separated he inquired  no said grenfell wrinkling his forehead as though thinking hard ive often tried to remember as i told you we started out from the lake with scarcely any provisions left and we couldnt find a deer i was played out and halfdazed but for a time we pushed on together then one day i found myself in the thick timber alone verneille must have kept the range and i was in the valley i was very sick when i struck the prospectors camp and when i came round i had only the haziest memory of the journey  if we can find a spot where the valley dies out into the range it will probably be where you left him said weston it would give us a point to work from in the meanwhile we want a place to camp  they went down to the first of the timber and spreading their blankets in a cranny of the rocks built a great fire soon after darkness fell weston who made the fire filled the blackened kettle with water from the creek and grenfell who crouched beside the snapping branches also left him to prepare the supper they had been on their feet since sunrise and it was evident that he was very weary he recovered a little when he had eaten but he leaned back against the wet rock with a furrowed face when weston took out his pipe  abstinence has its drawbacks he said shivering in the bitter wind which whirled the stinging smoke about them with a very small measure of whisky one could be warm and content he glanced back into the darkness that hid the towering peaks verneilles to be enviedhes well out of it  you said that before said weston in whose veins life ran hot and strong  i did his companion replied with a little hollow laugh youll find out some day that i was right he was dead when he fell to pieces in the wind and weather  of course said weston with a trace of impatience for grenfells halfmaudlin observations occasionally jarred on him but the latter still looked at him with a curious smile  keep clear of drugs and whisky its good advice he said you may go a long way before you die  id feel a little more sure of it if we could find the mine it would give you a lift up too  grenfell shook his head  it could never lift me back to where i was he said could it give me the steady nerves and the brain i used to have there was a time when scarcely a big mine was started in the west before they sent their specimens to me what could success offer me now besides a few more years of indulgence and an opportunity for drinking myself into my grave in comfort and with comparative decency  weston supposed that this was the effect of weariness but his comrade straightened himself a little and his uncertain gaze grew steadier  theres one thing it can do he went on it can show those who remember him as he was that grenfell the assayer and mineralogist can still look round a mineral basin and tell just where the gold should be  weston was no geologist but he had seen enough of it to recognize that prospecting is an art men certainly strike a vein or alluvial placer by the merest chance now and then but the trained man works from indication to indication until though he is sometimes mistaken he feels reasonably sure as to what waits to be uncovered by the blasting charge or shovel grenfells previous account of the discovery had however not made quite plain the fact that he had adopted the latter course  you told me you found the quartz by accident when you went to drink at a creek he said any green hand might have done the same  grenfell laughed  the point is that i knew there was gold in the valley i told you we stayed there until the provisions had almost run out i wanted material proofand i was satisfied when i found that little strip of outcrop  a little strip you said the lead ran right back to the hill and one could follow it with an adit  it does although i havent seen it the adit would dip a little the things quite certain  weston once more became sensible of the misgivings that not infrequently had troubled him his comrade he believed really had been a famous mineralogist but now he was a frail and broken man with a halfmuddled brain who could not be trusted to keep the fire going beneath the pots while he cooked a meal he was also a prey to maudlin fancies and it seemed quite possible that the mine was no more than a creation of his disordered imagination there were only two things that partly warranted his belief in ita fragment of quartz and the presence of the dead man on the lonely range though weston admitted that there was a certain probability of grenfells having deluded verneille too he had however pledged himself to look for the lead and that at least he meant to do the search in the meanwhile was sufficient to occupy him as he was one who escaped a good many troubles by confining his attention to the task in hand  well he said dismissing the matter from his mind ill turn out at sunup and when weve had breakfast well go on again  he lay down near the snapping fire and drawing up the blanket to keep the rain from his face was sound asleep in a few minutes grenfell however sat awake for a long time shivering in the whirling smoke and now and then glancing curiously at his companion     chapter ix  a fruitless search   they had wandered far through the ranges and camped beside several lonely lakes none of which however proved to be the one for which they were searching when weston rose one morning from his lair among the dewy fern he did it reluctantly for during the past week he had carried grenfells load as well as his own and it would have pleased him to lie still a little longer his shoulders were aching and the constant pressure of the packstraps had galled them cruelly but in one respect it would not have troubled him if his burden had been heavier for their provisions were running out rapidly there was a river close by but he no longer felt the least inclination for a morning swim or indeed for any occupation that was not obviously necessary he had lived very sparingly of late and had contrived that grenfell got rather more than his share of the cutdown rations it was clear to him that the older mans strength was rapidly failing  he kicked the embers of the fire together and after laying on a few resinous billets split the night before placed an inch or two of pork in the fryingpan and then carefully shook out a double handful of flour from the almostempty bag this he beat up with water and poured into the hot pan when the pork was done he watched it until it hardened a little on one side when he flung it up into the air and caught it in the pan again there is an art in making palatable flapjacks out of nothing but flour and water when the meager breakfast was ready he awakened grenfell who sat up grumbling  its time we made a start this is our last day said weston  grenfell who did not answer made his toilet by buttoning his jacket and stretching himself after which he blinked at his companion with watery eyes  there are no marble basins or delicately perfumed soaps in the bush he said  weston laughed  i dont remember having seen them at the muskeg camp in the meanwhile breakfasts ready im sorry there isnt a little more of it  his companion glanced at the fryingpan  a scrap of rancid pork and a very small flapjackburnt at that to think that human intelligence and mans force of will should be powerless without a sufficiency of such pitiable things its humiliating  then with a grimace of disgust he stretched out his hand for the blackened pannikin  green tea is a beverage that never appealed to me and i feel abject this morning now if i had a little bourbon whisky i could laugh at despondency and weariness that golden liquid releases the mind from the thraldom of the wornout body  it depends on ones knees said weston with a trace of dryness yours have a habit of giving out unexpectedly and i shouldnt like to carry you up this valley anyway breakfasts ready and we have to find that lake today or give up the search  they set about breakfast and again it happened that grenfell got rather more than his share then weston who carried also the heavy rifle strapped the double burden on his shoulders and they started on their march walking wearily the valley that they followed like most of the others was choked with heavy timber and they pressed on slowly through the dim shadow of great balsams hemlocks and douglas firs among which there sprang up thickets of tall green fern that were just then dripping with the dew the stiff fronds brushed the moisture through the rags they wore and wet them to the skin but they were used to that it was the fallen trees that troubled them most these lay in stupendous ruin with their giant branches stretching far on either side and where tangled thickets rendered a detour inadmissible it now and then cost them half an hours labor with the ax to hew a passage through then there were soft places choked with willows where little creeks wandered among the swampgrass in which they sank to the knees but they pushed on resolutely with the perspiration dripping from them until well on in the afternoon  once or twice weston wondered why he had held on so long it was some time since they had found verneille lying high upon the desolate range and this was still the only thing which seemed to bear out his comrades story the latter had only a few very hazy recollections to guide him and during the last week he had not come upon anything in the shape of a mountain spur or frothing creek that appeared to fit in with them there was however a vein of tenacity in weston and he was quietly bent on going on to the endthat is until there were no more provisions left than would carry them back to the cache marching on considerably less than half rations  they had made perhaps two leagues with infinite difficulty when toward the middle of the afternoon they came upon a spur of the range that ran out into the valley weston decided that they could probably see some distance across the timber from the crest of it so they climbed up painfully they were gasping when they reached a ledge of rock a little below the summit but that was not why they sat down both shrank from the first momentous glimpse into the head of the valley for if there were no lake there they had thrown away their toil and must drag themselves back to the settlements defeated and broken men it is hard to face defeat when one is young and perhaps harder still when one is old and has nothing to fall back on grenfell expressed part of his thoughts when he turned to his companion  we shall decide the thing in a few more minutes he said i suppose we couldnt risk going on a little farther tomorrow  weston shook his head resolutely though he felt the same temptation it was in one sense curious that the older man should defer to him  no said weston we should have turned back several days ago it will be a tough march to reach the cache now  grenfell made a little gesture  well he said well go up and see  they went up part of the way on their hands and knees and then though the slope was less steep both of them hung back when they neared the crest of the divide there was still a faint probability that their journey had not been futile and they clung to it desperately grenfell went first and when he reached the crest stood stone still with his back to weston who held his breath as he scrambled after him then grenfell turning a little toward him suddenly flung out a pointing hand  the head of the valley stretched away beneath them but there was no gleam from a lonely lake in the midst of it from hillside to hillside the close ranks of somber firs ran unbroken  westons face grew hard and grim  thats the end he said hoarsely there is nothing for it but to take the back trail  then the strength seemed to melt out of grenfell and he sat down limply  it was the belief that i should find that lake some day that has kept me on my feet the last eight years he said except for that i should have gone under long ago now its hardly likely that i shall ever get back here again  he turned and blinked at weston with halfclosed eyes  you cant understand you have the world before you he said  weston fancied that he could understand in part at least his comrade was an old and frail and friendless man for whom nobody in that country was as they say there likely to have any use and the fact that he probably had himself to blame for it did not make things easier weston forgot that he also was a man without an occupation and his face grew sympathetic but in a few minutes grenfell seemed to pull himself together  well he said well take the back trail  they followed it for a week but the distance that they covered diminished day by day grenfell would insist on sitting down for half an hour or so at regular intervals and when they faced a steep ascent weston had to drag him the man seemed to have fallen to pieces now that the purpose that had sustained him had failed and his comrade who carried a double burden and undertook all that was necessary each time they made camp grew more and more anxious every day for though they did not eat enough to keep the strength in them their provisions were almost exhausted nor could he find a deer and it became a momentous question whether they could reach the cache before the last handful of flour was gone still they held on along the back trail with the burst boots galling their bleeding feet wornout haggard and ragged until one day on the slope of the range they lost the trail and when evening was drawing in they held a consultation  there was a valley a creek came frothing down not far from them a narrow steepsided cleft rent through stupendous rocks and the white ridge high above it seemed familiar weston gazed at the latter thoughtfully  we could get up that way and therell be good moonlight tonight he said if that snowridge lies where i think it does theres a ravine running down through the neck of the high spur and once we strike the big dip its a straight trail to the cache if we started now we ought to get there tomorrow  he broke off for a moment and opened the almostempty bag  in fact we have to  grenfell made a sign of acquiescence and by and by they rose and forced a passage through the timber into the ravine then they went up and up through the creek and beside it crawling over fallen trees and dragging themselves across slippery shelves of rock until though still very steep the way grew a trifle easier it was grenfells last effort and weston had no courage left to cheer him on at times he stumbled beside him and then went on and sat down gasping to wait until his comrade came up with him again it was a week since they had made more than half a meal and much longer since they had eaten a sufficient one they were famishing wornout and a trifle fanciful while the light was dying fast and a great wall of mountains beyond which the cache lay still rose in front of them  dusk crept up from the valley and overtook them as they climbed then passed ahead and blotted out the battalions of somber pines the little breeze that had sighed among the latter died away and the hoarse clamor of the creek intensified the deep silence that wrapped dusky hillside and lonely valley then a halfmoon sailed out above the dim white peaks and its pale radiance gleamed on frothing water and dripping stone and showed the two men still climbing they drew their breath heavily the sweat of effort dripped from them but they toiled upward with tense faces and aching limbs the cache could not be very far away and they realized that if once they lay down they might never commence the march again  by and by the creek seemed to vanish and its roar died away while after that they wandered still ascending apparently for hours among dim spires of trees until the path once more dipped sharply beneath their feet they had traversed a wider shallower valley between the spur and the parent range weston was afterward quite sure of that for it had a great shadowy wall of rock on one hand of it  we are coming down upon the cache we have crossed the neck he said  they blundered downward walking now with halfclosed eyes and sometimes for a few moments with them shut altogether at times they fell over boulders and into thickets of rotting branches that lay around fallen trees but though their senses had almost deserted them they were certainly going down the pines grew taller and thicker withered twigs and needles crackled beneath their feet though in places they plunged downward amidst a rush of slipping gravel still halfdazed as he was weston was puzzled it seemed to him that the gully they were descending was longer than it should have been it ought to have led them by that time out on a plateau from which the hillside fell to the hollow where they had made the cache he did not however mention this to grenfell  by degrees the dim black trees grew hazier and less material they appeared unsubstantial shadows of firs and pines and he resented the fact that they barred his passage when he blundered into one or two of them there was a creek somewhere but it was elusive flashing here and there in the uncertain moonlight and vanishing again once or twice he thought he had left it behind and was astonished when shortly afterward he stumbled into it to the knees he had a distressful stitch in his side which though he had been conscious of it for several hours was growing almost insupportable sometimes he called to grenfell who seldom answered him just to break the oppressive silence it seemed to enfold and crush him in spite of the clamor of the creek which indeed he scarcely heard no man he fancied had crept through those solitudes before but several times he felt almost sure that he saw shadowy figures flitting among the trees and grenfell declared that he heard the clank of cowbells weston was not astonished though he knew that no cattle had ever crossed that range  at last in the gray dawn they came to a little opening where the ground was soft it seemed familiar and both of them stopped they certainly had seen before something very much like the slope of rock that rose in front of them weston blinking about him discovered in the quaggy mould two footprints half filled with water he called to grenfell who leaned on his shoulder while he stooped to see them more clearly then he discovered two more footprints a little farther away they were fresh and evidently had not been made by the man who left the others suddenly he straightened himself with a harsh laugh  that is where we went up last night we are back again he said  grenfell gazed at him stupidly  but we went through the valley between the range and the spur he insisted i remember it we must have done so  westons face showed drawn and grim in the creeping light  if you went over all the range by daylight you would never find that valley again it will have vanished altogether like the lake  but i camped beside the lake  well said weston we floundered through the valley and we have come back to where we started thats a sure thing what do you make of it  grenfell admitted that it was beyond him  it doesnt count for much in any case we cant make the cache nowand im going to sleep he said  weston let his pack drop and unrolling their blankets they stretched themselves out beneath a great black pine they had made their last effort and their strength was spent there was it seemed no escape in the meanwhile mind and body craved for sleep     chapter x  the hotelkeeper   the sun was high in the heavens when weston awakened ravenous with an almost intolerable stitch in his side he rose with a stagger and then sat down again while his face went awry and took out his pipe he had still a very little tobacco left and he fancied that it might deaden the pangs of hunger then he glanced at grenfell who lay fast asleep close by with his blanket falling away from him the mans face was half buried among the withered needles which were thick in his unkempt hair and he lay huddled together grotesque and unsightly in ragged disarray weston vacantly noticed the puffiness of his cheeks and the bagginess beneath his eyes the stamp of indulgence was very plain upon him and the younger man who had led a simple strenuous life was sensible of a certain repulsion from him  he realized also that were he alone it was just possible that before his strength failed him altogether he might reach the spot where they had cached their provisions and for several minutes he grappled with the question whether he should make the attempt then he brushed aside the arguments that seemed to warrant it and admitted that in all probability grenfell would have succumbed before he could get back again after all this outcast who had led him into the wilderness on a fruitless search was his comrade and they had agreed to share and share alike that grenfell had at the most only a few years of indulgence still in front of him did not affect the question the specious reasons which seemed to prove that he would be warranted in deserting his comrade would not fit in with his simple code which avoiding all side issues laid down very simply the things one could not do  rising stiffly he laid the flourbag which he had not shaken absolutely empty by grenfells side and taking from his pocket an indelible pencil that he happened to have with him he moistened the point of it and scrawled a message across a piece of the almostempty package in which they had carried their tea  gone to look for a deer it read and he laid a stone on it where grenfell could not fail to see it  then he took up the repeating rifle and lurching downhill plunged into the forest both the blacktail deer and the muledeer are to be met with in that country but somewhat strange to say they are as a rule more plentiful round the smaller settlements than in the wilderness and they are always singularly difficult to see the inexperienced sportsman cannot invariably discern one when it is pointed out to him and the bush deer very seldom stand silhouetted against the sky their pale tinting blends with that of the fir trunks and the tall fern and they seem to recognize the desirability of always having something near them that breaks their continuity of outline besides to hunt in the thick bush needs the keenest powers of observation of both ear and eye and an infinite patience of which a wornout famishing white man is very rarely capable when one steps on a dry twig or sets a thicket crackling it is necessary to lie still for minutes or to make a long detour before again taking up the line of approach to a likely spot and that morning weston blundered noisily into many an obstacle his eyes were unusually bright and fiercely keen but his wornout limbs would not quite obey him  he lay still among the undergrowth about the rocky places where the deer come out to sun themselves clear of the dewwet fern and crawled into quaggy swamps where the little black bear feeds but he could find no sign of life when he strained his ears to listen there was only the sound of falling water or the clamor of a hidden creek sight was of almost as little service among those endless rows of towering trunks between which the tall fern and underbrush sprang up there was no distance scarcely even an alternation of light and shadow the vision was narrowed in and confused by the unchanging sameness of the great gray colonnade  still weston persisted in his search though it was not patience but the savageness of desperation that animated him he would not go back emptyhanded if he struggled on until he dropped  it was late in the afternoon before his search was rewarded he had reached a strip of slightly clearer ground when he heard a faint rustle and he stiffened suddenly in strungup attention there was he remembered a great hemlock close behind him but he recognized that any movement might betray his presence and standing very still he slowly swept his eyes across the glade a curious hard glint crept into them when they rested on one spot where something that looked very much like a slender forked branch rose above a thicket then a small patch of slightly different color from the thicket appeared close beneath and though he knew that this might send the deer off he sank slowly down until he could sit on his drawnback right foot he could not be sure of the steadiness of his hands and he wanted a support for the rifle though every nerve in him seemed to thrill it was done deliberately and he found that he could see almost as clearly from the lower level  then he waited with the rifle in his left hand and that elbow on his knee until there was a faint crackling and a slightly larger patch of fur emerged from the thicket he held his breath as he stiffened his left fingers on the barrel and dropped his cheek on the butt there would he knew be only one shot a long one and while it was not particularly easy to get the sight on that little patch it was considerably handier to keep it there besides he was not sure that the rear slide was high enough for the light was puzzling it might very well throw him a foot out in the elevation  he crouched haggard ragged savageeyed steadying himself with a strenuous effort while the little bead of foresight wavered it moved upward and back again half an inch or so while his finger slowly contracted on the trigger then as it swung across the middle of the patch he added the last trace of pressure he saw a train of sparks leap from the jerking muzzle and felt the butt jar upon his shoulder still as is almost invariably the case with a man whose whole force of will is concentrated on holding the little sight on a living mark he heard no detonation he recognized however the unmistakable thud of the bullet smashing through soft flesh and that was what he listened for  as he sprang to his feet jerking another cartridge from the magazine there was a sharp crackling amidst the thicket and a rustling of the fern a blurred shape that moved with incredible swiftness sailed into the air and vanished as he fired again the smoke blew back into his eyes and there was a low rustling that rapidly grew fainter he ran to the thicket and found what he had expecteda few red splashes among the leaves where the deer was hit he did not know but he braced himself for an effort for he fancied that he could follow the trail  it proved a long and difficult one but as he worked along it smashing through thickets and crawling over fallen trees the red sprinkle still showed among the leaves and it did not seem possible that the deer could go very far still by this time the light was growing dim and he pressed on savagely with the perspiration dripping from him in an agony of suspense even his weariness was forgotten though he reeled now and then  at length when he reached the head of a slope there was a crackling amidst the underbrush and once more a halfseen shape rose out of it the rifle went to his shoulder and though he had scarcely expected the shot to be successful the object in front of him collapsed amidst the fern he could no longer see it but whipping out the big knife that he carried in his belt he ran toward the spot where it had appeared the ground seemed to be falling sharply and he recognized that there was a declivity not far away  the deer rose once more and though only a yard or two away he could scarcely see it his eyes seemed clouded and he was gasping heavily whether he dropped the rifle with intent or stumbled and let it slip he never knew but in another moment he had flung himself upon the deer with the long knife in his hand then his feet slipped and he and the beast rolled down a slope together the blade he gripped struck soil and stones but at length he knew that it had gone in to the hilt in yielding flesh and with a tense effort he buried it again after that he staggered clear halfdazed but exultant with a broad crimson stain on the rags he wore the beasts limbs and body quivered once or twice and then it lay very still  weston took out his pipe and lay down with his back against a tree for all the power seemed to have gone out of him and he did not seem able to think of anything the pipe was empty before it dawned on him that his comrade was famishing and there was still a task in hand he set about it and though it was far from heavy he had some difficulty in getting the dressed deer upon his shoulders how he reached camp with it he never knew but he fell down several times before he did so and the soft darkness had crept up from the valley when he staggered into the flickering glow of a fire his face was drawn and gray and there was blood and soil on his tattered clothing he dropped the deer and collapsed beside the fire  now he said hoarsely its up to you to do the rest  grenfell set about it in wolfish haste hacking off great strips of flesh with patches of hide still attached to them and it was only when he flung them halfraw out of the fryingpan that weston roused himself fresh bush venison is not a delicacy even when properly cooked and there are probably very few civilized men who would care to consume much of it the muscular fiber resembles cordage and strong green tea is no doubt not the most desirable beverage to accompany it but grenfell and weston ate it in lumps and were asleep within five minutes after they lay down gorged to repletion beside the sinking fire it is generally understood that a famishing person should be supplied with nourishment sparingly but in the wilderness the man in that condition eats as much as he conveniently can and usually sleeps for about twelve hours afterward in any case the sun was high the next day when weston awoke feeling except for his muscular weariness as fresh as he had ever felt in his life he roused grenfell with his foot  get up he said we have to consider what to do  grenfell blinked at him with a grin  consider he ejaculated i know the first thing is to eat breakfast then well lie down again until its time for supper  they did as he suggested for there was meat enough to last until they found the cache this they managed to do two days later somewhat to westons astonishment they found also the horse still feeding on the strip of natural prairie and as the beast and the buried camp gear it could now carry back represented their whole worldly wealth this was a source of gratification to both of them the man without an occupation or a dollar in his pocket does not as a rule find life very easy  they made the first settlement on the railroad safely and weston hearing that a new sawmill had been started in a neighboring valley set out the next morning in search of it leaving grenfell to dispose of the camp gear and the horse the manager of the sawmill was however marking trees in the bush and as weston had to wait some time before he learned that no more hands were wanted it was evening before he reached the little wooden hotel where he had left his comrade it had a veranda in front of it and he stopped when he reached the steps for it was evident from the hoarse clamor and bursts of laughter which came out of the open windows that something quite unusual was going on then a man came down the steps chuckling and weston who stopped him inquired the cause of the commotion  two or three of the boys we have no great use for are going out tonight to the copper vein the dryhurst people are opening up said the stranger your partner has been setting up the drinks for them  weston was not pleased at this but the other piece of information the man gave him was interesting  are they taking on men he asked  anybody who can shovel sent down to vancouver for men a day or two ago  then said weston why didnt this hotelkeeper tell me instead of sending me across to the sawmill  his informant laughed  jake he said is most too mean to live he strikes you a dollar for your breakfast and another for supper though anybody else would give you a square meal for a quarter guess that may have something to do with it  weston nodded  its very probable he said theyre evidently getting angry about something inside there whats the trouble  guess its your partner said the other man with a grin it seems jake bought a horse from him but youd better go in and see i decided to pull out when one of them got an ax struck me it would be kind of safer in my shanty  he went down the stairway and as weston went up a raucous voice reached him  the money it said the money or the horse you hear me hand out the blame money  weston pushed open the door and stopped just inside it the room was big and as usual crudely furnished with uncovered walls and floor and a stove in the midst of it a bar ran along part of one side and a man in a white shirt was just then engaged in hastily removing the bottles from it another man in blue shirt and duck trousers stood beside the stove and he held a big ax which he swung suggestively it was evident that several of the others were runaway sailormen who have since the days of caribou usually been found in the forefront when there were perilous wagon bridges or dizzy railroad trestles to be built in the mountain province there was however nothing english in their appearance  he wants his horse oh bring it out sang the man with the ax  there was a howl of approval from the cluster of men who sat on a rough fir table but the man behind the bar raised an expostulating hand  boys he said you have got to be reasonable i bought that horse if the deadbeat who made the deal with me wants it back all he has to do is to produce the money  then grenfell who leaned on the table drew himself up and made a gesture of protest he was as ragged and unkempt as ever  ive been called a deadbeat and i want it taken back he said its slander im a celebrated mineralogist and assayer tell you how the deep leads run analyze you anything for example well proceed to put this hotelkeeper in the crucible and see what we get its thirty parts hoggish selfsufficiency and ten parts ignorance forty more rank dishonesty and ten of insatiable avarice ten more of gobackwhenyougetupandfacehim cant even bluff a drunken man ive no use for him  there was a burst of applause but weston fancied that the hotelkeepers attitude was comprehensible in view of the fact that the drunken man had a big ax in his hand crossing the room he seized grenfells shoulder  sit down he said sternly have you sold that man my horse  he has sure said one of the others set us up the drinks afterward we like him hes a white man  how much weston asked  twenty dollars  then the man with the ax who appeared to feel that he was being left out of it swung the heavy blade  we want our horse he said trot the blame thing out  one of the others thereupon raised a raucous voice and commenced a ditty of the deep sea which was quite unquotable weston silenced him with some difficulty and turned to the rest  boys he said has the man yonder spent twenty dollars on drinks today  they were quite sure that he had not he had they admitted set up a round or two but they were not the boys to impose upon a stranger and in proof of this several of them asked the hotelkeeper what he had received from them then weston turned to the latter  now he said well try to straighten this thing out but ive no intention of being victimized its quite clear that the boys dont seem in a humor to permit that either  youve got us solid one of them assured him all you have to do is to sail right ahead burn up the blame hotel sling him out of the window anything you like  well said weston addressing the hotelkeeper while i dont know what your tariff is its quite evident to me after what the others have said that my partner couldnt very well have spent more than five or six dollars well call it eight to make more certain and ill pacify him if youll hand me twelve  twelve dollars sang the axman or the horse bring them out  its worse than holding up a train complained the hotelkeeper still ill part with it for the pleasure of getting rid of you  he did so and when weston who pocketed the money inquired when the next eastbound train left one of the others recollected that it was in rather less than half an hour some of them got up with a little difficulty and grenfell looked at weston deprecatingly  you mustnt hurry me he observed my knees have given out again  they set out in a body two of them assisting grenfell who smiled at the men assembled in the unpaved street to witness their departure there were eight of them altogether including the man who still carried the ax which it transpired later belonged to the hotelkeeper the soft darkness fell and the white mists crawled up the hillside as laughing harshly they plodded through the little wooden town they were wanderers and vagabonds but they were also men who had faced the stinging frost on the ranges and the blinding snow they had held their lives lightly as they flung the tall wooden bridges over thundering cañons or hewed room for the steel track out of their black recesses with toil incredible flood and frost falling trees and giantpowder that exploded prematurely had as yet failed to crush the life out of them and after all it is perhaps men of their kind who have set the deepest mark upon the wilderness     chapter xi  in the moonlight   it was as far as outward appearances went a somewhat disreputable company that had assembled in the little station when the whistle of the atlantic train came ringing up the track and weston would have been just as much pleased if the agent had provided a little less illumination several big lamps had just been lighted though there was a bright moon in the sky and grenfell who was dressed for the most part in thornrent rags sat on a pile of express freight amidst a cluster of his new comrades discoursing maudlin philosophy the other man who still clung to the hotelkeepers ax was recounting with dramatic force how he had once killed a panther on vancouver island with a similar weapon and when he swung the heavy blade round his head there was a momentary scattering of the crowd of loungers who had as usual gathered to see the train come in  yes sir i split that beast right up first time he said im a chopper youd have seen the pieces fly if id sailed into that hotel bar a little while ago  weston fancied that this was probable for the man was dexterous and there was applause when he set the bright blade whirling and passed the haft from hand to hand most of the loungers could do a good deal with the ax themselves and the lean muscular demonstrator made rather a striking figure as he stood poised in statuesque symmetry under the lamplight with the bright steel flashing about him  in the meantime weston leaned on the pile of cases and packages somewhat moodily after paying for his ticket and grenfells to the station nearest the coppermine he had about four dollars in his pocket and he did not know what he should do if no employment were offered him when he got there he had no doubt that he could provide for himself somehow but grenfell was becoming a responsibility he felt that he could not cast the man adrift and it seemed scarcely likely that anybody would be anxious to hire him still grenfell was his comrade and they had borne a good deal together during their journey in the wilderness that counted for something there was also another matter that somewhat troubled weston he was not unduly careful about his personal appearance but he had once been accustomed to the smoother side of life in england and his clothing was now almost dropping off him the storekeeper whom he had interviewed that morning had resolutely declined to part with a single garment except for money down and after an attempt to make at least part of the damage good with needle and thread weston found the effort useless and abandoned it  then two great locomotives came snorting out of the shadows that wrapped the climbing track and he grasped the shoulder of his comrade who did not appear disposed to get up there was a little pointed badinage between those who were starting for the mine and the loungers and in the midst of it the big cars rolled into the station weston started and his face grew darkly flushed for two whiteclad figures leaned out over the guardrail of one of the platforms and for a moment he looked into ida stirlings eyes there was no doubt that she had recognized him and he remembered the state of his attire and became uneasily conscious that grenfell who clung to his shoulder was swaying on his feet he knew that a man is usually judged by his company and it was clear that nothing that she might have noticed was likely to prepossess miss stirling in his favor the car however swept past him and with some difficulty he got grenfell into another farther along the train then while his companions exchanged more compliments with the loungers the big locomotives snorted and the dusty cars lurched on again  they naturally traveled colonist and when grenfell stretched himself out on a maple board it became evident that he had forgotten his blanket weston threw his own over him and the old man blinked at his young companion with watery eyes  you stood by me youre white he said and added with a little patronizing gesture im not going to desert you  after that he apparently went to sleep and weston who felt no inclination for the company of the others went out and sat on one of the car platforms glad for the time being to be rid of him  there was a moon in the sky and the silvery light streamed down on towering hillside and battalions of flitting pines the great train swept on clattering and clanking and dust and fragments of ballast whirled about the lonely man still the rush of the cool night wind was exhilarating and his mind was busy though his thoughts were not altogether pleasant the few weeks he had spent in ida stirlings company had reawakened ambition in him and that was why he had set out with grenfell in search of the mine though he had not reproached his comrade and had indeed only half believed in the quartz lead the failure to find it had been a blow there was in that country as he knew no great prospect of advancement for a man without a dollar and though he realized that it had not troubled him greatly until a little while ago he now shrank from the thought of remaining all his life a wandering railroad or ranching hand he had also a great desire for miss stirlings good opinion although he scarcely expected her to think of him except as one who had proved a capable guide  he knew that he could never quite forget the night they had made the hazardous descent together and her courage and quiet composure under stress and strain had had their effect on him the imperious anger with which she had turned on him when he forced her away from miss kinnaird had also stirred him curiously he could still when he chose see her standing in the moonlight with a flash in her eyes questioning his authority to prevent her from snaring her companions peril she was he felt one who would stand by her friends he was young and the fact that she had seen him supporting the lurching grenfell at the station troubled him  he had smoked his pipe out twice when he heard the vestibule door click and he started when he looked up for ida stirling stood beside him her light dress fluttered about her and she stood with one hand resting on the rail there was no doubt that she recognized him and when he rose and took off his shapeless hat she looked at him steadily for a moment or two he wondered whether he were right in his surmises as to why she did this and though his forehead grew a trifle hot he decided that he could not blame her appearances had certainly been against him  i am going to join mrs kinnaird she is in the car behind the sleeper and that is farther along she said  weston moved so that she might step across to the adjoining car but she did not seem to notice this and leaned on the rail close beside him  the train is very hot with the lamps lighted she said  weston understood this to mean that she was disposed to stay where she was and talk to him awhile which suggested that she was to some extent reassured about his condition  yes he returned it is in fact i felt it myself the smell of the pines is a good deal pleasanter  there was nothing original in the observation and though the roar of wheels made it a trifle difficult to hear he was careful as to how he modulated his voice perhaps he was superfluously careful for he saw a smile creep into idas eyes  you seem amused he said and for they stood in the moonlight the blood showed in his face  why did you speaklike that his companion asked  weston looked at her gravely and then made a little deprecatory gesture  it was very stupid i dare say still you see you were out on the platform when the train came into the station  there was something that puzzled him in idas expression  well she admitted i really had my fancies for a moment or two though i blamed myself afterward i should have known better  it was rather a big admission but she said nothing else and it was weston who broke the silence  i have to thank you for the prospecting outfit he said  the girl flashed a quick glance at him  it was partly major kinnairds idea you made use of it  weston smiled  grenfell and i did that explains the state of my attire you see we have just come down from the bush  then somewhat to her astonishment he took out his watch and pointed to the guard it was of plain plaited leather and had she fancied probably cost about twentyfive cents  i dont know whether this could be considered part of a prospecting outfit but they had a bunch of them in the store he said i felt i should like some trifle that i could wear to remember our trip in the ranges i thought you wouldnt mind  a momentary trace of embarrassment became visible in his companions face the man was a bush packer and she had seen him in somewhat disreputable company but she was ready to admit that he had aroused her curiosity she could be honest and she would have admitted it as readily had she never heard from arabella kinnaird of his connection with the old hall in england she looked at him with a little laugh  oh she said everybody likes to be remembered and im no exception in that respect there is really no reason why you shouldnt have bought the guard  weston who felt that he had gone quite far enough merely bent his head in a manner that as she naturally noticed the average bush packer would not have adopted it was she who first spoke again  you were successful in your search she asked  weston laughed  do i look like a man who has just found a goldmine  well said the girl with a twinkle in her eyes i came across two successful prospectors in vancouver not long ago and there was really nothing to suggest it in their appearance so you didnt find the mine wont you tell me about your journey  its quite a story wont the others miss you  ida turned toward him suddenly  dont you mean more than that  well admitted weston slowly i think i did perhaps it was a liberty  it was said ida and though she laughed there was a little flash in her eyes major kinnaird and his wife are english and it is quite possible that they would not be pleased to hear that i had come out to talk with you on the platform of a car still in canada we have our own notions as to what is fitting and that i consider it perfectly natural that i should do so is quite sufficient for me i do not defer to anybodys opinion as to how i should treat my friends now unless you have any more convincing excuses you may tell me about the search for the mine  weston did so and for the mere pleasure of having her near him he made rather a long tale of it she stood where the vestibule of the car in front partly sheltered her from the rush of the cold night wind swaying lightly to the jolting of the platform as the great train sped on among the pines still her light dress which gleamed white in the moonlight fluttered about her and now and then flowed against her companion the simple tale of stress and effort borne and made was one that went well with the snorting of the big locomotives toiling up the climbing track and the rhythmic roar of wheels flung back by primeval forest or towering wall of rock the girl had imagination enough to realize it  oh she said one likes to hear of such things  then she noticed the gauntness of his bronzed face and how lean he was  still she added it has left its mark on you you failed to find the mineit wasnt your faultwhat are you going to do now  some day said weston i shall go back and search again  he had made the resolution only that moment but she saw the sudden glint in his eyes  it was in the meanwhile i meant she said  i am going a little way up the track with my partner to a coppermine  ah said the girl reflectively i suppose you feel that you must take that man  what else could i do with him  idas eyes softened curiously after the scene at the station she fancied that she understood the responsibility that he had taken upon himself  and suppose they dont want you at the mine  in that case we should go on again somewhere else  of course your partner who can earn nothing will go with you  then she spoke almost sharply  how much money have you in your joint possession  three or four dollars said weston  again she turned toward him with a flush on her face  now she said i think you can disregard trivial conventionalities wont you let me lend you some  no replied weston quietly i shall not forget that you offered it but im afraid its quite out of the question  she knew that he meant it and though she greatly desired to lessen his difficulties she was for no reason that was very apparent at the moment pleased with his answer then she changed the subject  can your partner cook she asked  no answered weston smiling he certainly cant i and a good many more of the boys know that from experience  ah said ida reflectively that destroys another chance well i am glad that i have seen you but i think i must join mrs kinnaird now  she held out the hand she had laid on the rail it happened that as she did it the train swung around a curve the car slanted sharply and she swayed with the effort to keep her balance in another moment westons arm was around her waist then there was empty blackness beneath them as the cars sped out upon a slender trestle and the roar of a torrent came up from below through the clash and clatter and clamor of the wheels there was probably no risk at all for there were rails on either side of them but the girl who had almost lost her footing was glad of the mans steadying hand and did not draw herself away until the big locomotives were speeding smoothly on beneath the shadowy pines again then she drew back a pace or two  thank you she said quietly  weston took off his battered hat and stepping across the platform opened the door of the adjoining car when she had passed through it he sat down and took out his pipe with a curious little thrill running through him and his nerves tingling  ida also felt her face grow a trifle hot and though she was as composed as usual when she joined mrs kinnaird her thoughts were busy for some time afterward the man she admitted had done no more than was warranted but there was no disguising the fact that his supporting grasp had had a disconcerting effect on her then she dismissed the thoughts of that and remembered with compassion how lean and worn he looked there was also something that stirred her sympathy in the idea of his saddling himself with the care of a helpless comrade who had no real claim on him though that was she decided after all the kind of thing one would expect from him then recognizing that this was admitting a good deal she endeavored to interest herself in what mrs kinnaird was saying  it was late at night when the train stopped again and weston did not know that when he and his companions alighted at a little desolate station among the ranges the blind of one window in the big sleeper was drawn aside in a few moments the train went on but ida stirling did not sleep for some time afterward she had had a momentary glimpse of a ragged man standing with the lamplight on his lean face and a hand laid reassuringly on the shoulder of his halfdazed companion     chapter xii  the coppermine   the red sun had risen above the dusky firs on a shoulder of the range when weston and his companions reached the coppermine it consisted of an opening in the forest which clothed the hillside with the black mouth of an adit in the midst of it and a few big mounds of debris beside which stood a rude log shanty the men who had just come out of the latter gazed at the strangers with undemonstrative curiosity and when saying nothing they trooped away to work the new arrivals sat down to wait until the mining captain should make his appearance in the meanwhile one of them amused himself by throwing stones at a smaller log building with a galvanized roof which stood among the firs he looked at the others for applause when he succeeded in hitting it  let up said a comrade the boss lives in there  the man flung another stone a larger one which rang upon the iron roof  well he said i guess that ought to fetch him  it evidently did so for the door of the shanty opened and a man attired in shirt and trousers came out he was a big lean man somewhat hard of face and he favored the assembly with a glance of quiet scrutiny for he was as it happened acquainted with the habits of the free companions  getting impatient boys he asked and his voice which was curiously steady had in it a certain unmistakable ring it suggested that he was one accustomed to command well what do you want  a job said one of westons companions  the man looked at him with no great favor  quite sure it isnt money you cant have one without the other here  then grenfell rose and waved his hand  the explanation i may observe is unnecessary in this country you dont get money anywhere without first doing a good deal for it unfortunately it sometimes happens that you dont get it then  how long is it since you did anything worth counting asked the captain  one of grenfells companions pulled him down before he had a chance to reply  now you sit right down before you spoil things he said you cant put up a bluff on that kind of man you dont know enough  the miner glanced at them again with a little grim smile  well he said you may stay there until ive started the boys in the adit then i will come back and talk to you  he moved away and one of those he left relieved his feelings by hurling another stone which crashed upon the iron roof of the shanty  thats a hustlera speederup he said you cant monkey with him  they waited for about an hour before the man came back and sitting down on a fir stump called them up one by one weston was reassured to see that each was despatched in turn to the log building where he presumed the tools were kept but he and grenfell were left to the last and he was somewhat anxious when he walked toward the stump the man who sat there glanced at his attire  been up against it lately he inquired  weston admitted that this was the case and the other smiled dryly  can you chop and shovel he asked  weston said that he could and the miner appeared to consider  well he said ill put you on at mentioning terms which weston fancied were as favorable as he was likely to get still youll have to hustle and we charge usual tariff for board you may start in  weston glanced toward grenfell who was still sitting where he had left him  you see he said theres my partner we go together  i cant help that you have my offer i cant have that kind of man on our payroll  weston stood silent for a moment or two he had arrived at the wooden hotel too late for supper the previous evening and as a rule neither blandishments nor money will secure the stranger a meal at an establishment of that kind after the appointed hour as the result he had eaten nothing since noon when the sawmill hands had offered him a share of their dinner and having assisted grenfell along an infamous trail most of the night he was jaded and very hungry now work and food were offered him and there was not a settlement within several leagues of the spot he had however already decided that he could not cast his comrade adrift  well he said perhaps theres a way out of it if youll let him camp with the boys ill be responsible for his board  any relation of yours  no replied weston simply hes just my partner  the other man looked at him curiously and then made what weston fancied was an unusual concession  well he said well fix it you may go along and drill with the boys yonder in the open cut  weston did as he was bidden and spent the rest of the morning alternately holding the jarring drill and swinging a hammer it was strenuous work which demanded close attention for the hammer was heavy and it is far from easy to hit a drill neatly on the head while the man who fails to do so runs the risk of smashing the fingers of the comrade who holds it it was not much more pleasant when he gripped the drill in turn for though the other man stood on a plank inserted in a crevice weston had to kneel on a slippery slope of rock and twist the drill each time the hammer descended the concussion jarred his stiffened hands and arms the distressful stitch also was coming back into his side and once or twice his companion cast an expostulating glance at him  you want to speed up he said guess that boss of ours knows just how much the most is that a man can drill and he has to do it or get out  though it cost him an effort weston contrived to keep his companion going until the dinner hour arrived and he found the work a little easier when he had eaten still he was perplexed about grenfell who did not understand what arrangement he had arrived at with the mine captain grenfell spent the afternoon mending his own and some of westons clothes which badly needed it and the evening meal was over when the latter sat with the others outside the shanty wearing a jacket which his companion had sewed grenfell however was not with them just then by and by the man who had desired to wreck the hotel bar turned to weston  what are you going to do with your partner he asked  i dont quite know said weston in the meanwhile hell stay here  hows he going to raise his board  thats not quite your business said weston quietly  the man laughed goodhumoredly  well he replied in one way i guess it isnt still if you pay your partners board youre going to have mighty little money left mended that jacket didnt he wont you take it off  weston wondered a little at this request but he complied and the man passed the garment around to the others who gravely inspected the sewedup rents and the patches inserted in it  quite neat isnt it he commented  they admitted that it was and the chopper handing the garment back to weston smiled as though satisfied  ive an idea boys he announced  his companions appeared dubious but he nodded quietly  ive got one sure he said now in a general way if theres a store handy ive no use for mending clothes but you have to wash them now and then and it never struck me as quite comfortable to put them on with half the stitching rubbed out of them well washings a thing im not fond of either and its kind of curious that when one man starts in at it everybody wants the coaloil can  they murmured languid concurrence for as he said clothes must be washed and mended now and then and the man who has just finished a long days arduous toil seldom feels any great inclination for the task it usually happens however that when one sets about it his companions do the same and there is sometimes trouble as to who has the prior claim on the big kerosene can in which the garments are generally boiled  well said the chopper ive a proposition to make there are quite a few of us and a levy of thirty or forty cents a weeks not going to hurt anybody while theres a man round here who cant chop or shovel guess he has to live and its a blame hard country boys to that kind of man now its my notion we make the fellow mender and washer to the camp  there was a murmur of applause for when they own any money which however is not frequently the case the free companions are usually openhanded men and weston was not astonished at their readiness to do what they could for his companion he had been in that land long enough to learn that it is the hardhanded drillers and axmen from whom the wanderer and even the outcast beyond the pale is most likely to receive a kindness their wide generosity is exceeded only by the lighthearted valor with which they plunge into some tremendous struggle with flood and rock and snow  make it half a dollar anyway said one of them  then weston stood up with a little flush on his face and a curious look in his eyes  thank you boys but i have to move an objection he said this is a thing that concerns me  sit down commanded one of them sharply its a cold business proposition  they silenced his objections and sent for grenfell who appeared disconcerted for a moment when he heard what they had to say then he laughed somewhat harshly  well he said ill be glad to do it and i dont mind admitting that the offer is a relief to me  they strolled away by and by and grenfell made a little grimace as he looked at weston  when i can tell how the ore should pan out by a glance at the dump and plot just how the vein should run its disconcerting to find that the only way i can earn a living is by washing and mending he said in fact and he spread out his hands the things humiliating  to a certain extent weston sympathized with him the man it seemed had been a famous assayer and now the one capability which was of any use to him was that of neatly mending holes in wornout garments he undertook the task cheerfully however and things went smoothly for a week or two then a stranger who appeared to be a man of authority arrived at the camp he was a young man who looked opinionative and when he first appeared was dressed in city clothes soon after his arrival he strolled around the workings with the man whom weston hitherto had regarded as the manager when he spoke sharply to one or two of the men the driller who worked with weston snorted expressively  colvin puts the work through but thats the top boss he said you can see it all over him learned all about mining back east in the cities and couldnt sink a hole for a stick of giantpowder to save his life been down at vancouver fixing up with the directors what theyre going to tell the stockholders still i guess hes not going to run this companys stock up very much  hows that weston asked  the man lowered his voice confidentially  well he said theres a good deal in mining that you cant learn from books and a little you cant learn at all it has to be given you when youre born colvins a hustler but thats bout all he is and ive a kind of notion they arent going to bottom on the richest of this vein anyway its not my call they wouldnt listen to me  westons gesture might have expressed anything he naturally had been favored with hints of this kind while he followed other somewhat similar occupations for it is not an uncommon thing for the men who toil with the drill and shovel to feel more or less convinced that those set over them are not going about the work in the right way he had also more than once seen this belief proved warranted his companions suggestions however were borne out when he sat smoking with grenfell in the bush after supper  ive been in the adit this afternoon observed the latter colvin sent me along to where they are putting in the heavy timbering he laughed softly well theyre throwing away most of their money  youre sure inquired weston  am i sure expostulated his comrade i need only point out that i ought to be  then said weston reflectively unless they ask your opinion which isnt very probable id say nothing about it some people dont take kindly to being told theyre wrong the thing doesnt affect you anyway  he was a little astonished at the change in his companion for a sparkle crept into grenfells watery eyes and his voice grew sharper  you havent the miners or the engineers instinct its the same as the artists he said he can see the unapproachable beautiful simplicity of perfection and bad work hurts him i dont know that its a crime to throw away money but it is to waste intelligence and effort that could accomplish a good deal properly directed why was man given the power to understand the structure of this material world i may be a wornout whisky wreck but i could tell them how to strike the copper  still said weston dryly id very much rather you didnt i dont think that it would be wise  his companion left him shortly afterward and it was some days later when the subject was reopened then grenfell came to him with a rueful face  ive had an interview with the manager he explained  well said weston sharply what did he say  grenfell shrugged his shoulder  told me to get out of camp right away  just then colvin approached them and his manner was for once slightly deprecatory  it doesnt pay to know more than the boss he said and then he looked at weston he has to get out what are you going to do  he had westons answer immediately  ask you for my time  well said colvin with a gesture of expostulation i guess you know your own business still im quite willing to keep you  weston thanked him and then went with him to his shanty where he was handed a few bills and in another hour he and grenfell had once more strapped their packs upon their shoulders he did not know where he was going or what he would do but he struck into the trail to the railroad and it was dusk when they reached a little wooden settlement he went into the postoffice to make a few inquiries before he decided whether he should stay there that night and the woman who kept it recognizing him as a man from the mine handed him a letter when he opened it he saw somewhat to his astonishment that it was from stirling it was very terse but it informed him that miss stirling and her friends purposed camping among the islands of one of the eastern lakes which was then a rather favorite means of relaxation with the inhabitants of toronto and montreal stirling desired him to accompany the party on terms which appeared very satisfactory and added that if he were acquainted with another man likely to make an efficient camp attendant he could bring him along  weston started a little when he reached the last suggestion for he fancied that it was miss stirling who had made it he leaned on the counter for several minutes thinking hard and then though he was not sure that he acted wisely he started for the station to despatch a telegram as stirling had directed the next morning the agent handed him tickets for himself and grenfell and they set out on the atlantic train     chapter xiii  stirling lets things slide   it was early evening when weston swung himself down from the platform of the colonist car in a little roadside station shut in by the pine bush of ontario there was a wooden hotel beside the track and one or two stores but that was all and the fact that nobody except the stationagent had appeared to watch the train come in testified to the industry or more probably the loneliness of the district while weston stood looking about him a man came out of the office and he was somewhat astonished to find himself face to face with his employer  the smart straw hat and light summer suit did not become the contractor he was fullfleshed and red of face and the artistically cut garments striped in soft colors conveyed a suggestion of ease and leisure which seemed very much out of place on him one could not imagine this man lounging on a sunlit beach or discoursing airily on a cool veranda  got here he said abruptly and then swung around and looked at grenfell this is the other man well he can stay and bring along the baggage theres most a freightcar full theyll give him a wagon and team at the hotel  he indicated a great pile of trunks and cases with a wave of his hand and seeing westons astonishment added with a twinkle in his eyes  my daughter and her friends are camping they have to have these things  weston understood his employers smile this he recognized was a man who could be content with essential things and in all probability had at one time esteemed himself fortunate when he succeeded in obtaining them  hadnt i better help him load them up he asked  no said stirling with a curtness at which weston could not take offense he can put in the evening that way if its necessary it will supple him and i guess he needs it i have a rig ready youre coming along with me  weston took his place in the light fourwheeled vehicle and found it difficult to keep it for the trail was villainous and stirling drove rapidly their way led between shadowy colonnades of towering firs and the fragile twoseated frame bounced and lurched into and out of deep ruts and over the split trees that had been laid flatside downward in the quaggy placeslike a field gun going into action was the best comparison weston could think of the horses however kept their feet and the wheels held fast once when a jolt nearly pitched him from his seat stirling laughed  after the city its a relief to let them out he said i did this kind of thing for a living once the mine was way back in the bush leagues from anywhere and i hired out as special store and despatch carrier there was redhot trouble unless i got through on time when the mail came in  he drove the team furiously at an unguarded log bridge which was barely wide enough to let the wheels pass  its quite a way to the lake yet and we want to make the camp before its dark he explained know anything about sailing a boat  weston said that he did and stirling nodded  thats good he observed somewhat dryly so does the major man  weston ventured to smile at this and once more his employers eyes twinkled  some of you people from the old country are quite hard to amuse though im open to admit that we have a few of the same kind on this side he said my daughter seemed to fancy they wouldnt find a lake camp quite right without a boat so i sent along and bought one at toronto had her put on a flat car and hired half the teams in the district to haul her to the lake now i guess there are men in this country who if they wanted a boat would just take an ax and whipsaw and build one out of the woods  weston laughed he was commencing to understand the man better for he had met other men of stirlings description in canada as a matter of fact they are rather common in the dominion men who have had very little bestowed on them beyond the inestimable faculty of getting what they want at the cost of grim selfdenial and tireless labor still as it was in stirlings case some of them retain a whimsical toleration for those of weaker fiber  its a bush camp weston asked  stirling smiled goodhumoredly  they call it that he said it cost me quite a few dollars youll see when you get there  weston was somewhat relieved when they safely accomplished the first stage of the journey and turning the team over to a man by the waterside paddled off to a big halfdecked boat beautifully built and fitted in toronto stirling who admitted that he knew nothing about such matters sat down aft and lighted a cigar while weston proceeded to get the tall gall mainsail and big single headsail up he was conscious that his companion was watching him closely and when he let go the moorings and seated himself at the tiller the latter pointed up the lake  about a league yetround that long point he said  a moderately fresh breeze came down across the pines and when weston getting in the sheet headed her close up to it the boat slanting sharply leaped forward through the smooth water he sat a little farther to windward and the slant of deck decreased slightly when stirling did the same  you cant head there straight the latter asked  no said weston not with the wind as it is shell lie no higher  well observed stirling shes going anyway that pleases me it helps one to get rid of the city well have a talk in the meanwhile i sent for you before why didnt you come  it was somewhat difficult to answer and weston wrinkled his forehead stiffening his grasp on the tiller  i was fortunate enough to be of some little service to miss stirlings friends on the range and i fancied that because of it you meant to offer me promotion of some kind he said  well queried stirling with his eyes fixed on his companions face  weston hesitated he could not very well tell this man that a vein of probably misguided pride rendered him unwilling to accept a favor from ida stirlings father  i dont think there was any obligation sir he said  that remarked stirling dryly is a kind of feeling that may trip you up some day still you came this time  i did said weston you see the case was rather different you offered to hire me to do a thing im accustomed to its my occupation  his companion made a little sign of comprehension though there was a faintly whimsical smile in his eyes  now youre wondering why i brought you back east all this way  weston admitted it and the contractor fixed his eyes on him  well he said it seems that theres fishing and sailing to be done and im not quite sure about that major man guess hes always had people to wait on him and that doesnt tend to smartness in any one when my daughter and her friends go out on the lake or up the river youll go along with them  this was perhaps a little hard on major kinnaird but weston to some extent sympathized with his employers point of view the contractor was not a sportsman as the term is generally understood but he was a man who could strip a gun make or mend harness or break a horse when he had gone shooting in his younger days it was usually to get something to eat and as a rule he obtained it though he rent his clothes or got wet to the waist in the process he could not sail a boat but if he had been able to do so he would also in all probability have been capable of building one stirling was a man who had never depended very much on others and could if occasion arose dispense with their services he recognized something of the same resourcefulness in weston and because of it took kindly to him  in the meanwhile the breeze had freshened and the boat slanting more sharply commenced to throw the spray all over her as she left the shelter of the woods behind she met the short splashing head sea with streaming bow and the sliding froth crept farther and farther up her lee deck as she smashed through it then as the water found its way over the coaming and poured down into her stirling glanced at his companion  got all the sail she wants he asked is she fit to stand much more of it  she should be safe with another plank in but i was thinking of taking some of the canvas off her now said weston  stirling hitched his twelve stone of flesh farther up to windward  then he said until she puts that plank in you can let her go  a wisp of spray struck him in the face but weston who saw the smile in his eyes was curiously satisfied it suggested in the first place an ample confidence in him which was naturally gratifying and in the second that stirling in spite of his years could take a keen pleasure in that particular form of the conflict between the great material forces and mans nerve and skill it is a conflict that goes on everywhere in the newer lands  for another halfhour weston kept the staggering overcanvased craft on her feet by a quick thrust of the tiller or a slackening of the sheet and his companion appeared oblivious of the fact that he was getting wetter and wetter she was fast and she went through the little curling ridges with an exhilarating rush while the foam swirled higher up her depressed deck and the water flung up by her streaming bows beat in between her shrouds in showers then when half the deck dipped under weston thrust down his helm and the craft rising upright lay with her big mainsail thrashing furiously above her  for ten minutes weston was very busy with it and when he had hoisted it again with a strip along the foot of it rolled up he crouched forward in the spray struggling with the big single headsail which was a much more difficult matter once or twice he went in bodily when the hovedown bowsprit put which he crawled dipped under but he succeeded in tying up the foot of that sail too and scrambled aft again breathless and gasping he noticed that his employer who did not seem to mind it was almost as wet as he was  im sorry but you told me i could let her go he apologized  stirling smiled somewhat dryly  im not blaming you but you dont quite finish wondering why i did it arent you  weston did not admit it but perhaps his face betrayed him for his companion nodded  well he said you told me that you could sail a boat and i wanted to make sure of it seems to me anybody could hold the tiller when shes going easy in smooth water know how i used to choose when i wanted a chopper in the days when i worked along with the boys well i gave the man an ax set him up in front of the biggest tree i could find and made him chop  there could be no doubt about the efficiency of that simple test and weston recognized that it was very much in keeping with his employers character though he fancied that it was one which if rigorously applied everywhere would leave a good many men without an occupation he only laughed however and nothing more was said until the boat reached in shoreward on another tack it carried her round the long point and a deep sheltered bay with dark pine forest creeping close down to the strip of white shingle which fringed the waters edge opened up then as the trees slid past one another a little clearing in the midst of them grew rapidly wider and weston was somewhat astonished to see a very pretty wooden house grow into shape he glanced at stirling  yes said the latter with a suggestion of grim amusement thats the camp  once more weston understood him and as their eyes met man and master smiled both of them knew there were hosts of strenuous hardhanded men growing wheat and raising cattle in that country who would have looked on that camp as a veritable mansion they were however men who had virgin soil to break or stupendous forests to grapple with tasks of which many would reap the benefit and they very seldom troubled much about their personal comfort  after a while weston lowering the headsail dropped the anchor over close to the beach and major kinnaird paddled a canoe off gingerly he was as usual immaculately neat and weston noticed the contrast between him and stirling whose garments had apparently grown smaller with the wetting the latter pitched his valise into the canoe without waiting for weston to see to it and then stood up endeavoring to squeeze some of the water from his jacket  its the only one ive got he said to kinnaird anyway i guess the thing will dry and ive had a sail that has made me feel young again  then they went ashore and weston who was very wet was left shivering in the wind to straighten up the gear until a bush rancher who had been engaged to wait on the party until he arrived paddled off for him the rancher had prepared a satisfactory supper and some time after it was over stirling and mrs kinnaird sat together on the veranda there was at the time nobody in the house the breeze had fallen lighter though a long ripple still lapped noisily upon the beach and a halfmoon had just sailed up above the clustering pines their ragged tops rose against the sky black as ebony but the pale radiance they cut off from the beach stretched in a track of faint silvery brightness far athwart the lake  mrs kinnaird however was not watching the ripple flash beneath the moon for her eyes were fixed on two dusky figures that moved through the shadow toward the waters edge by and by there was a rattle of shingle and presently the black shape of a canoe slid down into the moonlight it rose and dipped with the languid ripple and the two figures in it were silhouetted against the silvery gleam one was a man in a wide hat who knelt and dipped the flashing paddle astern and the other a girl the craft crossed the strip of radiance and vanished round the point after which mrs kinnaird flashed a keen glance at her companion he sat still and his face on which the moonlight fell was almost expressionless but mrs kinnaird fancied he had noticed as much as she had and that he had possibly grasped its significance in case he had not done the latter she felt it her duty to make the matter clear to him  i suppose that is ida in the canoe she said  it seems quite likely replied her companion it couldnt have been your daughter because she went along the beach not long ago with the major and i dont think theres another young lady in the vicinity  then the other must bethe packer  the pause and the slight change of inflection as she said the packer had not quite the effect she had intended stirling himself had once labored with his hands and what was more afterward had a good deal to bear on that account he was not particularly vindictive but he remembered it  yes its weston he said and his companion felt herself corrected but she was at least where major kinnaird was not concerned in her quiet way a persistent woman besides miss stirling who was going with her to england would some day come into considerable possessions and she had a son who found it singularly difficult to live on the allowance his father made him  is it altogether advisable that she should go out with him she asked  stirling smiled somewhat dryly for there was a vein of combativeness in him and she had stirred it  you mean is it safe well i guess shes quite as safe as she would be with me or the major  major kinnaird was a flag officer of a rather famous yacht club said the lady who while she fancied that her companion meant to avoid the issue could not let this pass she was however mistaken in one respect for stirling usually was much more ready to plunge into a controversy than to back out of it  well he said reflectively the other man has earned his living handling sail and people which is quite a different thing  then he leaned toward her with a twinkle in his eyes  madam he added wouldnt you better tell me exactly what you meant  mrs kinnaird had a certain courage and she was endeavoring to do her duty as she understood it  that packer she said is rather a goodlooking man and girls of idas age are sometimes a trifleimpressionable  then somewhat to her astonishment stirling quietly agreed with her  yes he said thats so seems to me it was intended that they should be its part of the scheme  he made a little gesture  well let that point slide anything strike you as being wrong with weston  no said the somewhat startled lady the man is of course reliable wellconducted and attentive but after all when one says that  when you said reliable you hit it its a word that means a good deal but couldnt you say a little more than wellconducted from something your daughter learned by chance his relatives are people of position in the old country that counts for a little though perhaps it shouldnt  once more mrs kinnairds astonishment was very evident  it shouldnt  thats just what i meant if a man is clean of character and has grit and snap in him i dont know that one could reasonably look for anything further i cant see how the fact that his grandfather was this or that is going to affect him the man were talking of has grit i offered him promotion and he wouldnt take it  ah said his companion didnt that strike you as significant  stirling looked thoughtful  well he admitted slowly as a matter of fact it didnt but it does now  he sat silent for almost a minute with wrinkled forehead while mrs kinnaird watched him covertly then feeling the silence embarrassing she made another effort  supposing that my fancies concerning what might perhaps come about are justified she suggested  stirling faced the question  well he said whether theyre justified or not is a thing we dont know yet but i want to say this i have never had reason to worry over my daughter and it seems to me a sure thing that shes not going to give me cause for it now when she chooses her husband shell choose the right one and shell have her fathers money it wont matter very much whether hes rich or not all i ask is that he should be straight and clean of mind and nervy and i guess ida will see to that when she tells me that she is satisfied ill just try to make the most of him  he broke off for a moment and laughed softly  i guess it wouldnt matter if i didnt my girls like her mother and shes likeme when she comes across the right man shell hold fast by him with everything against her if its necessary as her mother did with me  he rose and leaned against a pillar with a curious look in his face  the struggle that her mother and i made has left its mark on me the friends we left in the rut behind us looked for my failure and it seemed then that all the men with money had leagued themselves together to stop me from going on somehow i beat them one by onebig engineers financiers financiers syndicates corporationsworking late and working early sinking every dollar made in another venture and living any way there were no amenities in that fight until those we had against us found that it was wiser to keep clear of me  then with a little forceful gesture he took off his hat  what i am in part at least my girls mother made me shes asleep at last and because of what she bore its up to me to make things smoother for her daughter madam he added turning to his companion with a smile i have to thank you for doing what you must have figured was your duty but in the meanwhile welllet things slide  he turned away and left her before she could answer astonished but a little touched by what she had heard still the gentler impression vanished and when she informed major kinnaird of what had been said she was once more somewhat angry with stirling  it is really useless to reason with him she said the man has wholly preposterous views     chapter xiv  ida asserts her authority   it was a hot afternoon and ida who was tired of fishing sat carefully in the middle of a fragile birch canoe her rod lay unjointed beside her and two or three big trout gleamed in the bottom of the craft while weston who knelt astern leisurely dipped the singlebladed paddle dusky pines hung over the river wrapping it in grateful shadow through which the water swirled crystal clear and the canoe moved slowly downstream across the slack of an eddy farther out the stream frothed furiously among great boulders and then leaped in a wild white rush down a rapid though here and there a narrow strip of green water appeared in the midst of the latter the deep roar it made broke soothingly through the drowsy heat and ida listened languidly while she watched the pines slide past  i wonder what has become of the major she said at length with a little laugh it is too hot for fine casting and he probably has had enough of it after all it really doesnt matter that the fish wont rise  she saw westons smile which made it evident that he was equally content to drift quietly through the cool shadow with the sound of frothing water in his ears then she wondered whether that was his only cause for satisfaction and recognized that if this were not the case she had given him a lead he did not however seem very eager to make the most of it  we might get another fish in the broken water he suggested would you like to try  no said ida i wouldnt  she was a trifle displeased with him the man she felt might at least have ventured to agree with her and there was after all no reason why he should insist on reminding her in one way or another that he was merely her canoe attendant when she was willing to overlook that fact she had once or twice when it was evident that he did not know that she was watching him seen something creep into his eyes when he glanced in her direction he was however for the most part almost unduly cautious in his conversation and she now and then wondered whether his reticence cost him anything  its a pity it isnt always summer afternoon she said  weston looked at her rather curiously though for the next few moments his lips remained set there was a good deal he could have said in that connection but he suppressed it as he had done more than once already when similarly tempted he felt that if he once allowed his sentiments audible expression they might run away with him  oh yes he said i suppose it is  ida wondered whether he was quite insensible to temptation or absurdly diffident for she had now given him two openings and he had answered with only the tritest of remarks she knew he was not stupid but there were times when for no apparent reason he seemed suddenly to retire into his shell she did not know that on these occasions he had laid a somewhat stern restraint upon himself  this land is not quite as grand as british columbia but i think i almost like it better she said still we spent a very pleasant time in the ranges  those ranges could hardly be beaten said weston  he paddled a little more strenuously after this and ida abandoned the attempt to extract any expression of opinion from him she had made sufficient advances and she would go no further  well she said i dont care to fish any longer cant we shoot that rapid  westons answer was given without hesitation it requires nerve and judgment to shoot a frothing rapid just then however the task promised to be a relief to him his companion was very alluring and very gracious now and then and that afternoon he found it remarkably difficult to remember that she was the daughter of his employer and that there were a good many barriers between her and himself  yes he said i think it would be safe enough if youll sit quite still  three or four strokes of the paddle drove the canoe out into the stream and after that all he had to do was to hold her straight this was however not particularly easy for the mad rush of water deflected by the boulders swung her here and there and the channel was studded with foamlapped masses of stone gazing forward intent and strungup he checked her now and then with a feathering backstroke of the paddle while the boulders flashed up toward her out of the spray and the pines ashore reeled by the foam stood high about the hollowed upswept bow and at times boiled a handbreadth above the depressed waist but while the canoe swept on like a toboggan none came in there was more than a spice of risk in it and ida who knew what the result would be if her companions nerve momentarily deserted him now and then glanced over her shoulder when she did so he smiled reassuringly leaning forward with wet hands clenched hard on the flashing paddle she felt that he was to be relied on  then she abandoned herself to the exhilaration of the furious descent watching boulder and eddy stream by while the spray that whirled about her brought the crimson to her face at length the pace grew a little slacker and weston drove the canoe into an eddy where a short rapid divided them from the smooth green strip of water that poured over what could almost be called a fall then she turned toward him with glowing face  that was splendid she exclaimed cant we go right on down the fall  weston ran the canoe in upon the shingle before he answered her  no he said though it cost him an effort not to do as she wished im sorry i cant take you down  ida glanced at the slide of silky green water that leaped out over a shelf of rock and fell through a haze of spray into a whirling pool it did not look altogether attractive and now that she could see it more clearly she rather shrank from it but she was accustomed to having exactly what she wished and her companion had not shown himself quite as ready to meet her views that day as she would have liked an impulse that she did not altogether understand impelled her to persist  the indians go down now and then she said  yes admitted weston i believe they do  then why cant you  weston appeared a trifle embarrassed  it wouldnt be quite safe  you mean to you  the mans face flushed a little he had done a good deal of river work and none of his companions had accused him of lack of nerve but though he had an excellent reason for knowing that the thing was possible he had no intention of shooting the fall  well he said if you like to look at it in that way  ida rose and stepped ashore without taking his proffered hand then she leaned on a boulder while weston sat still in the canoe and for a moment or two they looked at each other the situation was a somewhat novel one to the girl for in spite of the fact that she desired it the packer evidently did not mean to go this alone was sufficient to vex her but there was another cause which she subconsciously recognized that made her resentment deeper it was that this particular man should prove so unwilling to do her bidding  it is quite a long way to the lake and the trail is very rough she said  it is admitted weston who was glad to find a point on which he could agree with her in fact its a particularly wretched trail still you have managed it several times and we have generally left the canoe here  this time said ida we will take it down to the lake i may want it tomorrow you will have a difficult portage unless you go down the fall  weston recognized that this was correct enough for the river was shut in by low crags for the next halfmile at least and he remembered the trouble he had had dragging the canoe when he brought it up he had also had grenfell with him then  well he said if you would rather not walk back it must be managed  i told you i wanted the canoe on the lake tomorrow said the girl  weston was quite aware that there was another canoe which would serve any reasonable purpose already on the beach but he merely made a little sign of comprehension and waited for her to go somewhat to his annoyance however she stood still and he proceeded to drag out the canoe the craft was not particularly heavy but it was long and he had trouble when he endeavored to get it upon his back he had more than once carried the siwash rivercanoes over a portage in this fashion but there is a trick in it and the birch craft was larger and of a different shape he felt that he could have managed it had there been nobody to watch him but to do it while the girl noticed every movement with a kind of sardonic amusement was quite a different matter he was very hot when after a struggle of several minutes he got the craft upon his shoulders and then after staggering a few paces he rammed the bow of it into a tree the shock was too much for him and he went down headforemost with the canoe upon him and it felt quite heavy enough then as the man who attempts the feat has his hands spread out above him that fall is as a rule a very awkward one it was a moment or two before he crawled out from under the craft gasping red in face and somewhat out of temper and he was not consoled by his companions laugh  i am sorry you fell down but you looked absurdly like a tortoise she observed  weston glanced at the canoe disgustedly  miss stirling he said i cant carry this thing while you stand there watching me do you mind walking on into the bush  ida was not in a very complaisant mood and she glanced at him coldly  if my presence annoys you i can of course go on she said  she felt that it was a little paltry when she walked on into the bush but her action had been dictated at least as much by curiosity as by petulance she fancied that she had set the man a task that was almost beyond his strength and knowing that she could release him from it at any time she was anxious to see what he would do she walked on some distance and then sat down to wait until he came up with her and when half an hour had slipped by and he failed to appear she strolled toward the edge of the wall of rock  the river swept furiously down a long declivity just there and the strip of deeper water flown which one could run a canoe was on the opposite shore it would she fancied be almost impossible to reach it from the foot of the rock on which she stood then to her astonishment she saw weston letting the canoe drive down before him close beneath the rock there was a short rope made fast to it and he alternately floundered almost waistdeep through the pools behind the craft and dragged it over some thinlycovered ledge he was very wet and looked savage for his face was set while by the way he moved she fancied for the first time that he had hurt himself in his fall she could not understand how he had got the canoe down to the river and for that matter weston who had attempted it in a fit of anger was never very sure then she became conscious of a certain compunction the thing she felt had gone quite far enough and when he drew level with her she called to him  you neednt take any more trouble i can go on by the trail after all she said  weston looked up  theres no reason why you should do that he replied i cant leave the canoe here anyway and i can take you in a little lower down  he went on without waiting for an answer and though the trail was very rough she had no difficulty in keeping abreast of him along the bank indeed she felt that when he reached the spot where she could join him he would have gone quite far enough in view of the progress he was making once or twice he floundered furiously as the stream swept his feet from under him and there were times when it seemed to require all his strength to prevent the canoe from being rolled over in the white rush of water that poured across some slippery ledge but he slowly plodded on and though she did not know why she was glad that he did so it was she was conscious not altogether because he was executing her command  at length she joined him where the river flowed deep and smooth beneath the pines again and when she had taken her place and he dipped the paddle she turned to him  how did you get the canoe down to the water the rock is very steep  im not quite sure answered weston i think i let it slide anyway i shoved it over the edge it went down too quickly for me to remember exactly what it did im afraid there are a few rather big scratches on it  but how did you get down  the man smiled dryly  i believe i slid with it  it occurred to ida who was commencing to feel a little ashamed of having exerted her authority in such a manner that she could afford to be generous  im sorry i put you to so much trouble she said but why didnt you tell me it would be difficult  weston ceased paddling a moment and looked at her steadily  its my place to do what im told besides you said that you didnt want to go back by the trail  a slight flush crept into idas face  wouldnt it have been better if you had done as i wanted and shot the fall  no said weston resolutely it wouldnt have been safe  there was silence for a minute or two and then ida spoke again  i must admit that i knew the portage would be a little difficult when you were by yourself but i didnt think it would give you quite as much trouble as it has she said still i think you should have told me after alland she seemed to have some difficulty in finding the right wordswe have never asked you to do anything unreasonable  weston understood that what she meant was that she at least had not treated him as a mere camppacker and as she was quick to notice the blood crept into his face her manner which was not conciliatory had also an unsteadying effect on him  well he said with a little laugh there are naturally two or three of my duties which i dont find particularly agreeable but thats a very common thing and you wouldnt expect me to point it out theyre all in the bargainand the others make up for them  she noticed his swift change of expression and did not urge him to explain what he meant  anyway what i have to do is a good deal nicer than handling heavy rails he added with a rather grim smile  ida fancied that this was a clumsy attempt to qualify his previous statement and she said nothing further until they reached the camp mrs kinnaird kept her occupied for the next hour or two and that evening when she was sitting on the veranda she heard grenfell speaking to his comrade not far away  why did you bring that canoe down he asked  miss stirling wanted it said weston  what did she want with it anyway  it was evident from westons voice that he was not anxious to pursue that subject  i dont know he said it paddles easier than the other one  well said grenfell you and i are going to have trouble taking the blame thing up the river again its quite different from coming down i suppose you shot the fall  i didnt  grenfells tone suggested astonishment  you hauled the canoe over the portage what made you do that when you have twice come down the fall  ida started at this and leaned forward eagerly to catch westons answer  i fancied there might be a little risk in it and i had miss stirling with me  ida felt her face grow warm as she remembered that she had twitted him with having less nerve than the indians but grenfell apparently was not yet satisfied  you could have sent the girl on and then have shot the fall he said it would have saved you quite a lot of trouble  oh yes agreed weston who appeared to resent his curiosity still i didnt  grenfell moved away and ida recognized now that in spite of a good deal of provocation weston had acted with laudable delicacy it was clear that his obduracy in the matter of taking her down the fall had been due to a regard for her safety he had also saddled himself with a laborious task to prevent this fact from becoming apparent she fancied that had she been in his place she could have arranged the thing more neatly but after all that did not detract from the delicacy of his purpose and she sat very still with a rather curious expression in her face until grenfell came to announce that supper was ready     chapter xv  the rock pool   ida was quietly gracious to weston during the week that followed his opposition to her wishes at the portage this was not so much because she knew she had been wrong in insisting on his taking her down the fall for after all that matter was a trifling one but it was more because she was pleased by the part that he had played the man it seemed had preferred to face her anger rather than to allow her to run any personal risk and afterward had undertaken a very laborious task to prevent her from discovering why he had borne it this was as far as she would go though she was aware that it left something to be explained  in any case there was a subtle change in her manner toward weston she had never attempted to patronize him but now she placed him almost on the footing of an intimate acquaintance it was done tactfully and naturally but mrs kinnaird noticed it and took alarm why she should do so was not very clear for stirling certainly had not encouraged her to put herself to any trouble on his daughters account but perhaps it was because ida was going to england and she had a wellfavored son it is also possible that being a lady of conventional ideas she acted instinctively and could not help herself that a young woman of extensive possessions should encourage a camppacker was from her point of view unthinkable  for this reason perhaps it was not astonishing that there was for some little time a quiet battle between the two when ida desired to go fishing mrs kinnaird suggested something else or contrived that the packer should be busy failing this she patiently bore discomforts from which she usually shrank and put her companions to a good deal of trouble by favoring them with her company the major naturally did not notice what was going on and she did not enlighten him nor did weston for that matter while arabella stood aside and looked on with quiet amusement it is probable that had ida stooped to diplomacy she would have been beaten but as it was her uncompromising imperiousness stood her in good stead  in any case she went up the river alone with weston on several occasions in spite of mrs kinnaird and one morning the two sat together among the boulders beside a pool not far above the fall there had been heavy rain and the stream which had risen swirled in an angry eddy along the rock that rose close in front of them from that side of the pool a great driftlog peeled white with only stumps of branches left had jammed its thinner top on a halfsubmerged ledge and the great butt which was water borne every now and then smote against the rock the pines along the river were still wet and the wilderness was steeped in ambrosial odors ida sat with thoughtful eyes regarding the endless rows of trunks through which here and there a ray of dazzling sunlight struck but her whole attention was not occupied with that great colonnade  i think you were right when you said that the bush gets hold of one she said i sometimes feel that i dont want to go back to the cities at all  weston smiled though there was something curious in his manner it seemed to suggest that he was trying to face an unpleasant fact  well he said i told you that would probably be the case in one way its unfortunate because i suppose you will have to go you belong to civilization and it will certainly claim you  and dont you  weston made a little whimsical gesture  in the meanwhile i dont quite know where i belong its perplexing  ida noticed the in the meanwhile it had she fancied a certain significance and hinted that by and by he expected to be more sure of his station  you dont wish to go back she asked  no said weston decisively anyway not to the packed boardinghouse and the flourmill even in winter when these rivers are frozen hard and the pines stand white and motionless under the arctic frost this is a good deal nicer  youre getting away from the point said ida laughing i meant to england  weston leaned forward a little looking at her with a curious expression in his eyes  for three or four months in the year england is the most beautiful country in the world he said we havent your great pines and foaming rivers but even in the land from which i come in the rugged north every valley is a garden its all so smooth and green and well cared for one could fancy that somebody loved every inch of itonce you get outside the towns i said the dales were gardensin summer theyre more like paradise  it was evident that the exiles longing for the old land was awake within him and ida nodded sympathetically  wont you go on she begged  ah said weston if i could make you see themthe wonderful green of the larch woods the bronze of the opening oaks and the smooth velvet pastures between the little river and the gleaming limestone at the foot of the towering fell all is trimmed and clipped and cared for down to the level hedgerows and the sod on the roadside banks and every here and there white hamlets with little oldworld churches nestle amongthe trees you see it has grown ripe and mellow while your settlements are crude and new  the girl sat silent a brief space she had read of the old country and seen pictures of it and it seemed to her that his term a garden described parts at least of it rather efficiently  then though he had already assured her that he meant to stay in the bush she wondered whether he never longed to gather a flower of that trim garden in fact it suddenly became a question of some moment to her  you will go back to it some day  no said weston with a little wry smile i dont think so after all why should i  ida was sensible of a certain satisfaction but she desired to make more sure  there must be somebody you would wish to see or somebody who would care to see you  ah said weston the failures are soon forgotten over yonder perhaps its fortunate that it happens so  a shadow crept into his face  no he added unless it is as a successful man it is scarcely likely that i shall go back again  ida glanced at him covertly with thoughtful eyes though his attire was neater than it had been when she had seen him on other occasions he still wore the bush packers usual dress there was however a subtle grace in his manner and though he was by no means a brilliant conversationalist there was something in his voice and the halfwhimsical tricks of fancy which now and then characterized him that made a wide distinction between him and the general hired hand once more it seemed to her that when he had called the old country a garden it was a somewhat apt description for this man had evidently been subjected to careful training and pruning in his youth he was she felt one who had grown up under a watchful eye  well she said with a little laugh perhaps you are wise one could almost fancy that the old land is overcrowded and even on the richest soil one needs light and air  westons smile showed that he could understand her train of thought  i certainly think that some of us are hardier for transplanting he replied it is easier to make a vigorous growth out in the open in the wind and the sun besides over yonder every one is pinched and trimmed back to the same conventional pattern they sacrifice too much for uniformity  still said ida once more harping on the idea that troubled her there are only wild flowers in the wilderness one understands that we have nothing like your peerless english blooms  weston looked at her with a little gleam in his eyes  oh he said one must be honest and even for the credit of the old land i cant admit that it couldnt be when you have your sunlight and your crystal skies it always seems to me that strength is essential to perfect grace and one finds both and sweetness unexcelled out here in canada  he rose and taking up the rod straightened the gut trace  there is a big trout rising in the slack he said i think you could cast from the bank  ida took the rod from him and a little thrill of satisfaction ran through her as she poised herself upon a jutting stone at the waters edge he had spoken vaguely and she would have resented any undue explicitness but she had watched his face and it had set her doubts at rest if any english girl had ever looked upon this man with favor which seemed probable it was evident that he had long ago forgotten her and she fancied that if he had once been stirred to passion he was not a man who would lightly forget then she set about casting for the trout which rose again for in view of her encounters with mrs kinnaird it seemed advisable to take a few fish back with her if only to show how she had spent the time  at the third cast there was a splash and a sudden silvery gleam and a tightening of the line then the reel clinked furiously a bright shape flashed through the froth of the eddy and went down after which the line ripped athwart the surface of the pool weston who whipped up the net waded in kneedeep  keep the butt down he called reel in take up every inch of slack  the fish broke the surface and went down again and a flush of crimson crept into idas face as she stood quivering while the line went round the pool then the strain eased a little and she spun the reel until the fish showing a gleaming side in the swing of the eddy made a rush again  hold on this time said weston its making for the driftlog there are branches under it  the rod bent but the moving line led straight toward the driftlog until in a moment it stopped suddenly ida turned to the man with a gasp  its in under those branches she said  weston glancing at the line threw down the net for though he scarcely had expected this the fish evidently had not snapped the gut trace which was now entangled among the broken branches  give me some slack when i call he said  it was rather a long jump but he managed to reach the butt of the log and he scrambled along it toward its thinner top which stretched out along the side of the rock there was deep water under it and the eddy swung fiercely toward the rapid which swept on to the fall but the trunk provided a tolerably safe pathway to one accustomed to the bush and he reached a spot where a snappedoff branch projected into the river then stripping off his jacket he lay down and crawled along the branch as he lowered one arm and shoulder into the water it seemed to ida that the log rolled a little and when he raised himself again with the water dripping from him she called out to warn him  the logs not safe she said  it was not evident that weston heard her through the roar of the short rapid above the fall for he lowered himself once more ida was quite sure that the trunk tilted a little now but when he turned a wet face toward her in her eagerness she forgot that the thing might be perilous weston did not notice that he was disturbing the equilibrium of the tree  let your reel run he cried  he groped around among the branches with a good deal of the upper part of his body under water and when at length he emerged there was a big gleaming fish in one hand ida saw him jerk its head back with his fingers in its gills and then standing upright he hurled it toward her  it beats the majors largest one he announced  ida laid down her rod and scrambled toward the fish but there was a splashing sound as she bent over it and when she looked around sharply she saw the big pine slide out into the stream weston stood with his back toward her apparently gazing at the rock until he suddenly leaped forward and clutched at it she could not see what he clung to but the surface was uneven and he evidently had found a foothold then while a thrill of horror ran through her she glanced at the pine and saw it whirl out into the rapid twice the top of it which swung clear came down with a splash and then it plunged wildly into spray about the fall she did not care to watch what became of it and she clenched her hands hard as she looked around again  weston was clinging to the rock and his face which was turned partly toward her was set and grim in a moment he moved forward a little feeling with outstretched hand for a fresh hold while one foot splashed in the swirling water ida held her breath as she watched him he swung suddenly forward a yard or so and then with a wild scramble found a foothold ida who was conscious that her heart was beating painfully fast wondered what kept him from falling there was not a crevice or a cranny that she could see but she could not see anything very well except the tense figure stretched against the stone and the set white face dark pines and foaming water had faded into insignificance  he moved again and crept forward with agonizing slowness until at length he stopped and gazed at the wall of rock still in front of him that part of it was very smooth and overhung a little between where he was and the steeply sloping strip of shingle on which the girl stood the stream swirled past furiously and it was evident to ida that if he lost his hold it must sweep him down the rapid and over the fall  she was never sure how long he clung there but his white face and the poise of his strungup figure impressed themselves indelibly on her memory strain was expressed in every line of his body and in his clutching hands then the strength and decision that was in her asserted itself and she overcame the numbing horror that had held her powerless snatching up her rod she turned to him resolutely  you must jump she called  weston looked at the slender point of the rod she held out and somewhat naturally hesitated it was some distance from him but in another moment the girl was wading out from the shingle her skirt trailed in the water which swirled by her but though the shingle dropped steeply it afforded her a foothold and she stretched out the rod a little farther  jump she cried commandingly jump right now  the man flung up his hands as a matter of fact there was not room for him to jump at all ida braced herself for an effort as he lurched down from the rock there was a great splash and a wrench that almost dragged her off her feet then he was close beside her waistdeep in the stream he did not stop but clutched her by the shoulder and drove her before him up the shingle then he sat down gasping while the water ran from him and she moved back a pace or two and leaned on a boulder with her face almost as white as his  you must be very wet i thought the river had us both he said  ida laughed a rather harsh and foolish laugh for now that the tension had slackened she felt curiously shaken the man turned and looked back at the pool  no he said i dont think i ever could have got out of there alone  then he scrambled in a halfdazed fashion to his feet and raised a hand to where his hat should have been the hat was however a long way down the river by this time and when ida noticed his astonishment at not finding it on his head she once more broke into strained laughter after that she pulled herself together with an effort  you wont mind i cant help it she said didnt you know your hat was gone  weston looked at her more steadily than perhaps he should have done there was something in her face that suggested that the last few moments had almost unnerved her this as he could realize was not altogether unnatural and then a sudden thrill that set his nerves tingling ran through him as their eyes met the events of the past minute had shown them in part at least how they stood toward each other and for the moment they could not hide it then weston recovered the selfcommand that was rapidly deserting him  i dont think that matters he said apparently referring to the hat i want to thank you miss stirling its quite clear that i owe a good deal to your quickness and nerve  there were signs that his formal tone had cost him an effort but the fact that slightly dazed as he was he had forced himself to make it and had called her miss stirling was significant and ida fell in with the course he had adopted it was difficult for both of them but she recognized that the matter must be passed over as lightly and as speedily as possible  you shouldnt have gone out on that log at all she said you must have seen it wasnt safe  weston laughed though the signs of struggle were still on his face  did you notice that he asked  i didnt said ida and then a curious little thrill of anger ran through her the mans attitude was only what should be expected of him in view of the difference between their stations but after all it seemed to her that he had almost too much selfcontrol  that is not at first she added afterward i did notice it and i called to you you didnt hear  no said weston i didnt hear you  he looked at her steadily and the girl who felt the impulsive desire to wound him too strong for her made a little gesture  i am rather ashamed of it but the next moment i quite forgot that there was any danger she said you see i was so intent upon the fish  then said weston very quietly i dont think you could blame me  he stooped and picking up the rod set about taking it to pieces with a curious deliberation then he glanced at the girl  i can only offer you my thanks miss stirling but theyre very sincere he said dont you think it would be better if we went back to camp  ida rose and returned with him through the scented bush but neither said anything further for the same restraint was upon both of them     chapter xvi  on the lake   it was rather late that night when weston and grenfell sat smoking beside the dying fire the breeze that came off the lake was colder than usual and the rest of the party had retired indoors but one window of the little wooden house stood open and miss kinnairds voice drifted softly out of it she was evidently singing a selection from an opera grenfell who lay with his back against one of the hearthlogs appeared to be listening critically  its pretty and nothing more he said that girls too diffuseshe spreads herself she might have painted if shed been poor though thats not a sure thing either  why isnt it asked weston who had however no great interest in the matter  she has too level a head grenfell said its as fatal in art as it is in some professions you have to concentrate hang on to the one thing and give yourself to it miss kinnaird couldnt do that she must stop and count the cost to make anything of this life one now and then must shut ones eyes to that there generally has to be a sacrifice  he broke off and looked at his companion rather curiously  the other girl could make it she wouldnt ask whether it were worth while  weston was a trifle startled he had that very day seen something in ida stirlings eyes that seemed to bear out what his comrade suggested it had been there for only a moment which he felt might have been fateful to both of them and he knew that it was beyond his power to analyze all the qualities that the look had suggested it had however hinted at a courage sufficient to set at defiance conventions and the opinions of her friends and at the capacity to make a costly sacrifice  you seem sure of that  well said grenfell reflectively i think i am you see in one or two respects im like miss stirling  you like miss stirling  there was an indignant protest in westons voice which brought a twinkle into grenfells watery eyes  just so he said when i know what i want the most i set about getting it i guess thats sensesense thats way beyond prudence what one wants is in a general way what one likes which is a very different thing from whats good for one its very seldom that one finds the latter nice get these distinctions  i cant see the drift of them said weston impatiently  it may strike you as we proceed if you stop to consider whether its judicious to reach out for the thing you want you generally end by not getting it or anything else isnt it better to clutch with courage even if you have to face the cost  im not sure said weston dryly is it quite impossible to like a thing it is desirable that you should have  one doesnt often like it explained grenfell with a grin even when one does the same principle applies as a rule one cant get it without a sacrifice  thats the principle you acted on  grenfell spread out his hands  i guess it is he said in my case the thing i wanted wasnt good for me i had to choose between my profession and whisky and i did anyway ive had the whisky  weston sat thoughtfully silent a minute or two it seemed to him that while the result of the course his comrade advocated might well prove to be disastrous as it had certainly done in his particular case there was a warranty for it if it were true that practically nothing could be obtained without cost it was clear that the excess of prudence which shrank from incurring the latter could lead only to aridity of life the thoughtless courage which snatched at what was offered seemed a much more fruitful thing though one might afterward bear the smart as well as enjoy the sweet to accomplish or obtain anything one must at least face a risk he remembered how when he clung hesitating to the slippery rock ida stirling had bidden him jump he was however not a moralist but a man with a simple code which a few hours ago had proved singularly difficult to adhere to he had then seen something in ida stirlings eyes that set his nerves tingling but he could not take advantage of the momentary reaction of relief at his escape he wondered though why grenfell had spoken as he had until the latter turned to him again  you mentioned that you nearly pulled miss stirling in when she held out that rod he said you didnt notice that she showed any signs of letting it go  i dont think she did  you dont think so laughed grenfell that girl would have gone right down the fall before she let you go shes the kind that sees things through i wonder whether she said anything in particular afterward  westons face hardened as he looked at him out of halfclosed eyes  she did not what makes you suggest it  well said grenfell reflectively shes flesh and blood like the rest of us shes also a girl with courage enough not to hesitate im not sureand he spread out his handsthat i couldnt have made better use of your opportunities  weston said nothing though he was hot with anger and just then kinnaird who appeared in the lighted doorway of the house moved in their direction he stopped close beside them  i think i would better tell you now that we have decided to leave this place early next week he said you can see about getting the surplus stores and some of the baggage down the lake tomorrow  weston fancied that he looked at him rather hard but though the unexpected news had filled him with dismay he sat very still until kinnaird who said nothing further turned away then grenfell looked up with a smile  the major he said has perhaps had sufficient fishing or his precipitation may be due to the fact that mrs kinnaird is not in some respects a friend of yours im rather surprised that miss stirling who must have known it mentioned the other little matter anyway as you may feel inclined to point out thats not my business the question is what were going to do now  look again for that mine of yours said weston quietly  grenfell made a little sign of comprehension  well he said well go whats more i know that one of us is going to locate that quartz some day  he spoke as with conviction and then lighting his pipe slowly strolled away but weston sat beside the sinking fire for another hour or so it was clear to him that he must find grenfells lost mine  it was two days later when he next had any speech with ida stirling and then though he did not know that mrs kinnaird had done her utmost to prevent it they were crossing the lake alone in the sailboat the boat was running smoothly before a little favoring breeze and ida sat at the tiller looking out upon the shining water they had not spoken since they left the beach but by and by she turned toward weston  i am glad it is so fine an evening since its scarcely likely that i shall have another sail she said we have decided to leave early on monday  weston nodded it was the first time she had mentioned their departure to him and he recognized that unless he were cautious it might prove a dangerous subject  you are going to montreal he inquired  in the first place however we are going to england in a week or two  though he was on his guard she saw him start but he stooped and coiled up one of the halyards before he answered her  you will of course be there some time  six months at least perhaps longer  she watched him quietly but he sat very still with the rope in his hand  well he said i think you will like it you will be in london i suppose  ida felt vaguely sorry for him though he had said it was scarcely probable that he would go back to it she knew that he had not forgotten the land from which he was exiled indeed a certain wistfulness in his eyes suggested that he still thought of it with the exiles usual tenderness she was going to take her place in the world to which she felt reasonably certain he had once belonged while he swung the ax or plied the shovel beside some western railroad track though she did not mean for him to do the latter if she could help it of which however she was far from sure  yes she said still we shall spend some time at the house in the north of england you once heard major kinnaird mention  there was no doubt that this shot had reached its mark for she saw his little abrupt movement then he turned toward her fully which he had not done for the last minute or two  miss stirling he said with a faint flush in his face i am going to ask you a rather curious thing if you meet any of the people about there i should rather you did not mention my name though of course it is scarcely likely that you would find any reason to do so  he broke off and hesitated a moment  you see i know the place  ah said ida with no sign of surprise what were you doing there  the man smiled rather bitterly  i was something similar to head gamekeeper it wasnt an occupation i cared much about  you got tired of it  anyway that wasnt why i gave it up i was turned out fired they call it in this country  ida for a moment was almost angry with him she felt simply because he had said it that this must be correct as far as it went but she was equally sure that he could have gone a good deal further she was of course aware that there were a good many men in canada whose absence from the old country was not regretted by their friends and she was a little hurt that he did not seem to shrink from the possibility of her setting him down as one of them she could not know that he was in a very bitter mood just then  well she said as you say it is not likely that i shall have any occasion to mention you and i certainly wont do it casually you must however be content with that  yes said weston after all it really doesnt matter very much anyway  ida let the matter drop for she had something else to say and it had been in her mind rather often lately  when we leave here you will be without an occupation wont you she asked and then proceeded somewhat hastily without waiting for him to answer now you have done a good deal to make the time pass pleasantly both here and in british columbia  it did pass pleasantly  the question was suggestively abrupt and ida saw that as happened now and then the man was for the moment off his guard this however did not displease her  of course she said for that matter it couldnt have been very burdensome to you  weston laughed in a rather curious fashion and she saw the blood creep into his face  im glad you have enjoyed it he said it seems unfortunately certain that i shall not have another time like this  ida was aware of course that the real man had spoken then but in another moment he once more as she sometimes described it to herself drew back into his shell  i interrupted what you were going to say he observed with a deprecatory gesture  its very simple said the girl if my father or any one else makes you an offer i should like you to take it in one sense chopping trees and shoveling gravel on the track leads to nothing  the flush ida had already noticed grew a little plainer in the mans face but he smiled  im afraid i cant promise to do that he said you see and he seemed to search for words there is a good deal of the vagabond in me i never could stand the cities and that ought to be comprehensible to you when you have seen the wilderness  in summer said the girl dryly isnt it very different during the rest of the year  oh declared weston its always good in the bush even when the pines are gleaming spires of white and you haul the great logs out with the plodding oxen over the downtrodden snow there is nothing the cities can give one to compare with the warmth of the log shack at night when you lie aching a little about the stove telling stories with the boys while the shingles snap and crackle under the frost perhaps its finer still to stand by with the peevie while the great trunks go crashing down the rapids with the freshets of the spring and then theres the still hot summer when the morning airs like wine and you can hear the clinkclink of the drills through the sound of running water in the honeyscented shade and watch the new wagon road wind on into the pines you have seen the big white peaks gleam against the creeping night  it was evident that he was endeavoring to find cause for contentment with the life before him but ida fancied that he wished to avoid the question she had raised  you forget to mention the raw hands and the galled shoulders as well as the snowslush and the rain however thats not quite the point as i said all that leads to nothing are you too proud to take a trifling favor because it comes through me  weston met her gaze and there was a grave forcefulness in his manner which almost astonished her he evidently for once had suffered his usual selfrestraint to relax and she felt it was almost a pity that he had not done so more frequently  miss stirling he said you are as it happens one of the few people from whom i could not take a favor of that kind  she understood him and for a moment a flicker of color crept into her cheek it was she felt a clean pride that had impelled him to the speech there were she admitted no benefits within her command that she would not gladly have thrust upon him but for all that she would not have had him quietly acquiesce in them perhaps she was singular in this but her forebears had laid the foundations of a new lands future with ax and drill clearing forest and breaking prairie with stubborn valor and toil incredible they had flung their wagon roads over thundering rivers and grappled with stubborn rock and among them the softhanded man who sought advancement through a womans favor was as a rule regarded with quiet scorn she said nothing however and it was a few moments before weston looked at her again  anyway he said i couldnt do what you suggest i am going back into the ranges with grenfell to look for the mine  ah said ida you havent given up that notion yet  the man smiled grimly  i am keener about it than ever perhaps its somewhat curious but i seem certain that we shall strike that quartz lead one of these days  ida was glad to let the conversation take this new turn for she understood his eagerness now and she had felt that they were skirting a crisis each time she had talked with him of late she had the courage to make a sacrifice and indeed had the occasion arisen would probably have considered none too costly but it seemed due to him as well as to her that he should at least make some strenuous effort to pull down the barriers between them  well she said quietly it is very curious that you discovered no trace of it you said you found grenfells partner lying dead upon the range and as their provisions were running out when he left the lake he could not have gone very far was it a big lake  it couldnt have been grenfell said he walked round it in a couple of hours  ida looked thoughtful  still when you had the spot where you came upon verneille to work from you should have seen it from one of the spurs of the range  yes admitted weston that seems reasonably evident though we certainly saw no sign of it he broke off and laughed the whole thing sounds crazy doesnt it still as i said i believe we are going to be successful  he turned away and busied himself with some of the gear and neither of them said anything further until they ran into the bay before the house three or four days later weston conveyed the party down the lake to the carriage that was waiting to take them to the station and ida laid her hand in his for only a moment before she drove away     chapter xvii  scarthwaiteintheforest   ida stirling had spent some time in england when one autumn evening she descended the wide oak staircase of scarthwaite hall at scarthwaiteintheforest there was no forest in the vicinity though long ago a certain militant bishop had held by kingly favor the right of venery over the surrounding moors and now odd wisps of straggling firs wound up the hollows that seamed them here and there nobody seemed to know who first built scarthwaite hall though many a dalesman had patched it afterward and pulled portions of it down it was one of the ancient houses half farm and half stronghold which may still be found in the north country they were until a few decades ago usually in possession of the statesmen who worked their own land the statesmen have goneeconomic changes vanquished thembut the houses they inherited from the men who bore pike and bow at bannockburn and flodden are for the most part standing yet they have made no great mark in history but their stout walls have time and again been engirdled by scottish spears and after such occasions there was not infrequently lamentation by esk and liddell  it was clear that scarthwaite hall had been built in those days of foray for one little ruined halfround tower rose from the brink of a ravine whose sides the hardiest of mosstroopers could scarcely have climbed a partly filledin moat led past the other and in between stretched the curtain wall which now formed the facade of the house itself its arrow slits had been enlarged subsequently into narrow stoneribbed windows and a new entrance made while the ancient courtyard was girt with decrepit stables and barns most of the deep winding dale still belonged to it but the last weston had signally failed to make a living out of it or to meet his debts he lived in a little town not far away and let scarthwaite for the shooting when he could which explains how major kinnaird had taken it  ida looked about her as she came down the stairway it led into a darkpaneled stonearched hall which since habitable space was rather scarce at scarthwaite served as general livingroom a fire was burning in the big ancient hearth and a handful of people were scattered here and there waiting for dinner which should have been ready a few minutes earlier kinnaird who appeared a trifle impatient was standing near his wife and a couple of shooting men and his daughter was talking to one or two of his neighbors ida smiled as one of the latter glanced up at her and she moved toward him when she reached the foot of the stairway ainslie the owner of some quarries in the vicinity was a middleaged man whom she had met once or twice before  when she had greeted him she stood still a moment or two listening to the murmurs of general conversation then she saw kinnaird who was standing not far from her take out his watch  its a little too bad of weston i shouldnt have waited for anybody else he said as it is i suppose well have to give him a minute or two longer  the remark was evidently overheard as perhaps kinnaird intended one of the others laughed  ralph weston was never punctual in his life he said  considering everything observed one of the women standing near ida it is rather curious that weston should have promised to come at all it must be a trifle embarrassing to dine at ones own place as another mans guest  oh said the man beside her weston would go anywhere for a good dinner and a good glass of wine  ida as it happened had not heard what guests mrs kinnaird had expected and she started at the name it was a moment or two later when she turned to her companion  this house belongs to the man they seem to be waiting for she asked  ainslie nodded  yes he said i suppose it does  then why doesnt he live in it  it takes a good deal to keep up a place of this kind and until major kinnaird came its some time since anybody seriously attempted it  ah said ida mr westons means are insufficient  its a tolerably open secret there are a good many people similarly situated a small and badlykept estate is not a lucrative possession  then why dont they keep it up efficiently  now said ainslie youre getting at the root of the matter in my opinion its largely a question of character in fact after the glimpses ive had of the wheatgrowers in dakota minnesota and western canada it seems to me that if our people were content to live and work at home as they do out yonder they would acquire at least a moderate prosperity still im rather afraid that wouldnt appeal to some of them as it is their wants are increasing and the means of gratifying them steadily going down  all this applies to mr weston in particular  i dont think it would be a breach of confidence if i admitted that it does perhaps however im a little prejudiced weston doesnt like me he blames me for encouraging his son in what he calls his iconoclastic notions  ida who was becoming interested smiled  after all she said the comparison isnt very unfavorable to the son i believe the original iconoclasts were the imagebreakers in byzantium  were they i didnt know it said ainslie its a moral certainty that weston didnt either in fact ive no doubt he fancies that darwin and bradlaugh and hed certainly include cobden invented them anyway the lad wasnt very much of an iconoclast he believed in his images which were not the same as those his father worshiped and all he wanted was to see them work i think it hurt him when they didnt or at least when they didnt appear to  ah said ida thats rather too involved for me  well returned her companion well leave weston out im not sure about what he believes in and its probable that he doesnt know himself except that its everything as it used to be his wife was high church with altruistic notions and its no secret that she made things rather uncomfortable for her husband but when she took the lad in hand she succeeded perhaps too well you see he wanted to apply her principles and altruism leads to trouble when its possessor comes across formulas that dont stand for anything  just then there was a rattle of wheels outside and a minute or two later a little fullfleshed man with a heavy face in conventional dress entered the hall he greeted those who stood about when he had shaken hands with kinnaird  sorry im a little behind he apologized had to post over i told walters at the george to keep me the black mare instead he let that waterworks chief navvy fellow have her the horse he gave me would hardly face scarside rise  one or two of the guests smiled for the navvy in question was a rather famous engineer who had had a difference of opinion with weston over certain gravel he desired to quarry on the scarthwaite estate then mrs kinnaird stepped forward and they went in to dinner  it was not yet dark outside but the table was lighted and ida who sat not far from weston watched him closely she had at first been startled by the likeness between him and the man she had met in canada but she was now conscious of an increasing dissimilarity there was a suggestion of grossness in the face of major kinnairds guest which had certainly not been a characteristic of weston the packer the older mans expression was petulant and arrogant that of the one who had served her as camp attendant had been as a rule goodhumoredly whimsical nor did she like the halfcontemptuous inattention that weston displayed when one or two of the others addressed him in several cases he merely looked up and went on with his dinner as though it were too much trouble to answer ida felt reasonably sure that his manners would not have been tolerated in most of the primitive logging camps of western canada it became evident however that there were topics in which he took some interest when a man who sat near turned to him  we were in the meadows by ghyllfoot this afternoon and they were looking very sour and rushy he said they were drained once werent they  they were replied weston sharply its stiff land in my fathers time little used to grow good wheat there still even tile drains wont last forever the soil gets in  youre correct about the wheat said another man littles nephew still talks about it they used to grind it at the ramside mills wouldnt it be worth while to have the meadows redrained if only for the grass  ida who was watching him fancied that this was a sore point with weston for he momentarily forgot his dinner  no he answered curtly i took some trouble to make young little understand it when he came to me with a nonsensical proposition not long ago like the rest of them hes always wanting something i asked him where he thought the money was coming from  ida was not surprised at this though she knew that in western canada the smaller settlers as a rule stripped themselves of every comfort and lived in the most grim simplicity that they might have more to give the land  then as the man did not answer weston solemnly laid down his fork with the manner of one making a painful sacrifice  there is a good deal of nonsense talked about farming in these days he observed authoritatively you can put a fortune into drains and fences and buildings but its quite another matter to get two or three per cent upon it back in the old days i hadnt a horse in the stables worth less than sixty guineas and my father thought nothing of giving twice as much the other things were to match he looked down the table with a flush of indignation in his heavy face now walters at the george gives a navvy the horse i hired still what can you expect when they pile up the taxes on us and open new doors continually to the foreigners we grew wheat at scarthwaite and it was ground at ramside mill the last time i looked in harvey had his stores full of flour from minneapolis and winnipeg i asked him whether he didnt feel ashamed of having any hand in that kind of thing  ida could not check a smile in westons case at least the reason why western wheat had displaced the local product was tolerably plain this fullfleshed man differed she fancied in most essentials from the lean farmers who drove the halfmile furrows or ripped up their patches of virgin sod with plodding oxen on the vast expanses of the prairie while he indulged his senses and bought sixtyguinea horses they rose at four or earlier and living on pork and flour and green tea worked in grim earnest until it was dark blizzard and hail and harvest frost brought them to the verge of ruin now and then but could not drive them over it they set their lips cut down the grocery bill and working still harder went on again a good many of them had as she knew come from england  then weston appeared to remember his dinner and made a little vague gesture which seemed to indicate that there was no more to be said  i dont want to hear about drains and deeper tillage while we let every foreigner pour his wheat and chilled beef into our market its nonsense he asserted  some one started another topic and an hour or so later most of the little party strolled out on the terrace in front of the house it was almost dark now but the evening was no more than pleasantly cool and ida sat down on an old stone seat  scarthwaite faced toward the west and she looked out across a deep green valley toward the sweep of upland and heather moor that cut black and solemn against a paling saffron glow it was very still though now and then a bleating of sheep rang sharply out of the wisps of mist that streaked the lower meadows perhaps it was the stillness or the scent of the firs that climbed the hollow of the ghyll behind the house that reminded ida of the man who had strolled with her through the shadow of the giant redwoods of the pacific slope in any case she was thinking of him when arabella kinnaird stopped for a moment at her side and glanced toward weston who stood not far away  you heard that mans name did you notice a resemblance to anybody we have met she inquired  yes said ida of course it may be accidental  her companion laughed  i dont think it is in view of what i once told you on the subject its a matter i mean to investigate  she moved away but it was ida who first was afforded an opportunity of deciding the question for a few minutes later ainslie strolled toward her when he sat down beside her she indicated the waste of climbing pasture which ran up interspersed with gorse bushes and clumps of heather to the dusky moor  not a sign of cultivation she said i suppose that grass is never broken up how much foundation is there for mr westons views  ainslie laughed  im afraid im hardly competent to decide but there are people who agree with him still i think its reasonably certain that a good deal of the higher land that now carries a few head of sheep would grow oats and other things its largely a question of economics somebody would have to spend a good deal of money and labor on it first and the result which wouldnt be very apparent for two or three years would be a little uncertain then it depends on how much the man who undertook it wanted back to make the thing worth while  they are content with food and sometimes very indifferent shelter in western canada  there said ainslie you have the thing in a nutshell you have no doubt formed some idea of westons wants which are rather numerous in fact some of us seem to consider it the correct thing to cultivate them the more wants you have the greater man you are  ida smiled a little as she remembered a man of considerable importance in the wheatlands of assiniboia whom she had last seen sitting clad in blue shirt and very old trousers on a huge machine which a double span of reeking horses hauled through the splendid grain he had driven it since sunrise and it was dusk of evening then and his wants were as she knew remarkably simple he bore his share of the burden under a burning sun but it seemed to her that had weston been in his place he would have ridden around that farm with a gloved hand on his hip and would have raised it only now and then imperiously to direct the toilers then she thought of another man who was like him in some respects and was then in all probability plodding through the lonely bush  you mentioned a son she said what became of him  he went out to canada quarreled with his father as i believe i suggested the lad was at heart a rebel ainslie smiled rather dryly a good many of us are he wouldnt see that his mothers ideas were apt to get him into trouble when he tried to apply them  ida sat silent for a few moments there was no longer any doubt in her mind that weston who had turned his back on scarthwaite was identical with weston the camppacker  do you remember what they quarreled over she asked at length  yes said ainslie who was inclined to wonder at her interest in the subject it was waterfinding its a thing of which you probably have never heard  i have said ida wont you go on  well continued ainslie there was a tenant on this estate who was rather more badly off than the rest of them he had a piece of upland with rock under it and in a dry seasonthough we dont often get oneit was with the greatest trouble he got water enough for his stock he asked young weston to find him a likely spot to drive a well the lad was walking over one parched meadow with the hazel twig in his hand when his father came upon the processioneverybody belonging to the farm was out with him weston i heard went purple when he saw what was going on and from his point of view his indignation was perhaps comprehensible his son was openly before one of the tenants and a parcel of farmhands making use of a superstitious device in which no sane person could believe weston as i remember it compared him to a gipsy fortuneteller and went on through the gamut of impostor mountebank and charlatan before he commanded him to desist on the moment i dont quite know what came next though something was said about a lifted ridingcrop but within the week clarence started for canada  he abandoned the attempt to find water  ainslie smiled  the farmer dug a well in that meadow and i believe he uses it still he held a lease and weston couldnt get rid of him  he looked rather hard at ida and was slightly astonished at the sparkle in her eyes  im afraid ive been somewhat talkative he said  no ida assured him and he saw that she was stirred thank you for telling me  he moved away and by and by arabella kinnaird and one of the other women approached the seat arabella left her companion a moment and made a little whimsical gesture as she met idas gaze  ive been throwing away a good many blandishments on weston she observed he appears prudently reticent on the subject of his relations and if he has any in canada its evident that he isnt proud of them still i havent abandoned the amiable intention of extorting a little more information from him     chapter xviii  westons advocate   a week had passed when weston who apparently had some business with kinnaird drove over to scarthwaite again this time he brought a daughter who it appeared lived for the most part with some more prosperous members of the family arriving a little before lunch they remained until the evening as it happened miss weston displayed what she evidently considered a kindly interest in ida and graciously patronized her as a stranger and a colonial who was necessarily ignorant of a good many of the little amenities of life in the old country  her intentions were no doubt laudable but the methods she adopted to set the stranger at her ease were not those most likely to endear the insular english to their cousins across the atlantic ida to begin with had not only a spice of temper but also no great reverence for forms and formulas and the people that she was accustomed to meeting were those who had set their mark upon wide belts of forest and long leagues of prairie at first she was quietly amused by the patronage of a woman whose right to bestow it consisted apparently in an acquaintance with english people of station and some proficiency at bridge but by and by her condescension grew wearisome and finally exasperating miss weston however could not have been expected to recognize this she was a tall pale woman with a coldly formal manner and some taste in dress  there were several other guests in the house and the party spent most of the hot afternoon about the tennis net and lounging under the shadow of a big copper beech on the lawn once when miss weston left her to play in a set at tennis arabella kinnaird leaned over the back of idas chair  you seem to have made rather a favorable impression upon julia weston and as a rule shes unapproachable she said with a mischievous smile  idas eyebrows straightened which to those acquainted with her was a rather ominous sign  wont you keep that woman away from me she begged i dont want to be rude but if i see very much more of her i may not be able to help it in one way im sorry i met her youre not all like that  well said arabella perhaps it is a pity there really are some of us to whom you could talk without having your pet illusions about the old country shattered in fact i can think of one or two women about here who would strengthen them cant you mr ainslie  ainslie who was standing near them smiled  oh yes he said unfortunately however they are as a rule retiring its the other kind that is usually in evidence do you feel very badly disappointed with us miss stirling  no replied ida with a thoughtfulness which brought the smile more plainly into his eyes in fact i want to think well of you its a thing we wouldnt quite admit but at bottom i believe we all do  then she turned to arabella  by the way what has become of mr weston  he is shut up with my father in the library and there are reasons for supposing that his business requires the consumption of a considerable quantity of soda and whisky the major i am afraid will be a trifle difficult to get on with this evening as a matter of fact he isnt used to it though he was one understands rather popular at the mess table thats a trifle significant considering what is said about us isnt it mr ainslie  ah said ainslie were a maligned people and the pity of it is that its our own people who give us away you dont believe in doing that in the colonies  no laughed ida we are rather fond of making it clear that we are quite above the average as a people however its excusable perhaps for after all theres a germ of truth in it i think miss kinnaird will agree with that  arabella leaned a little farther over her chair  ill leave you to talk it out with mr ainslie but theres another matter does miss weston recall to you anybody we have met  no said ida with a somewhat incautious decisiveness if you mean our camppacker she certainly does not  arabella understood this to mean that any comparison of the kind suggested would be derogatory to the packer which was somewhat significant  well she said there is at least a physical resemblance and though i havent probed the matter very deeply yet ive not abandoned it  then she laughed and turned to ainslie  you and miss stirling can thrash out the question  she strolled away and ainslie watched ida whose eyes were following miss weston at the tennis net  yes he remarked we play these games rather well and after all is there any reason why we shouldnt there are a good many people in this country who dont consider them as of the first importance  oh said ida im really not looking for faults why should you suspect me of such an unpleasant attitude  well observed her companion reflectively i cant help thinking that we now and then give our visitors wrong impressions by showing them the wrong things personally i should recommend an inspection of our mines and mills and factories besides one has rather a fancy that some of our young men who were brought up well say to play tennis well have shown that they can do rather more than that in western canada  idas eyes softened a little as she recalled a weary grayfaced man limping back up the hillside one eventful morning but the turn that the conversation had taken had its effect on her and that effect was to have its result like others born in the newer lands she believed first of all in practical efficiency and she had learned during journeys made with her father that the man with few wants and many abilities or indeed the man with only one of the latter strenuously applied to a useful purpose is the type in most favor in western canada graces do not count for much in the west nor does the assumption of ability carry a man as far as it sometimes does in older communities as stirling had once said when they want a chopper in that country they make him chop and facility in posing is of very little service when one is called on to grapple with virgin forest or stubborn rock  young as ida was she had a grip of essential things and a dislike of shams it generally happened too that when she felt strongly on any subject she sooner or later expressed her thoughts in forcible words and before that afternoon was over she and arabella kinnaird between them disturbed the composure of more than one of mrs kinnairds guests  tea was being laid out on a little table beneath the beech when weston strolled across the lawn he was redder in face than when ida had last seen him and a trifle heavier of expression pushing unceremoniously past two of the women he dropped into a basketchair which bent under him and glanced around at the others with coldly assertive eyes ida watching him became conscious of a sense of repulsion and indignation this arrogant indulgent useless man had it seemed not the manners of a western ranchhand he accepted a cup of tea from mrs kinnaird with an ungraciousness which aroused ida to downright anger and shortly afterward he contrived to spill a quantity of the liquid upon arabellas dress for which he offered no excuses though he blamed the narrowbottomed cup then some one who of course could not foresee the result asked arabella if she would show them some of her canadian sketches  miss kinnaird made no objection and when soon after the tea was cleared away the easel she sent for had been set up in the shadow of the beech she displayed on it several small canvases and watercolor drawings there were vistas of snow mountains stretches of frothing rivers and colonnades of towering firs until at last she laid a canvas on the easel  this she said is i think the best figure drawing i ever did  ida leaning forward in her chair felt the blood creep into her face there was no doubt that the sketch was striking it showed a man standing tensely poised with a big glinting ax in his hand he was lean and lithely muscular and his face was brown and very grim but the artist had succeeded in fixing in its expression the elusive but recognizable something which is born of restraint clean living and arduous physical toil it is to be seen in the eyes of those who living in spartan simplicity make long marches with the dogsledges in the arctic frost drive the logs down roaring rivers or toil sixteen hours daily under a blazing sun in the western harvest field in all probability it was as plainly stamped on the honest countenance of many an unconsidered english tommy who plodded doggedly forward with the relief columns across the dusty veldt drivers of great expresses miners quarrymen now and then wear that look springing as it does not from strength of body but from the subjugation of the latter and all fleshy shrinking and weariness it links man with the greatness of the unseen  there was only the one figure silhouetted against long rows of dusky pines but the meaning of the way in which the hard scarred hands were clenched on the big ax was very plain and ida could fill in from memory the form of the big chopper and the clusters of expectant men  excellent said one of the guests that fellow means to fight hes in hard training too and that has now and then a much bigger effect than the toughening of his muscles upon the man who submits himself to it is it a portrait or a type  the speaker was from the metropolis and while arabella hesitated ida answered him with a suggestive ring in her voice  its both one should like to think she said the man came from england and if you can send us out more of that type we shall be satisfied  then she and the questioner became conscious of the awkward silence that had fallen upon the rest they belonged to the dales and they glanced covertly at weston who was gazing at the picture purple in face and with a very hard look in his eyes ida guessed that it was the scarred workmans hands and the trackgraders old blue shirt and tattered duck that had hurt his very curious pride still it was evident that he could face the situation  yes he said a trifle hoarsely its a portraitan excellent one in fact as some of you are quite aware its my son  he rose and crossing a strip of lawn sat down heavily near ida the latter looking around saw arabellas satisfied smile suddenly subside but the next moment weston leaning forward laid his hand roughly on her arm  why clarence permitted that portrait to be painted i dont quite understand though he was fond of flying in the face of all ideas of decency he said you must have met him out yonder what was he doing  shoveling gravel on a railroad that my father was grading said ida with rather grim amusement for she was determined that the man should face the plain reality even if it hurt him  shoveling gravel said weston but he is my son  im afraid that doesnt count out yonder in any case hes in one sense in reasonably good company did you send your son to sandhurst or an english university  i didnt said the man gazing at her with hot confused anger in his eyes for one thing he hadnt brains enough and for another there were too many charges on the property what do you mean by good company  just a moment before i answer why did you turn him out  that does not describe it he went we had a difference of opinion he would hear no reason  exactly said miss weston who now appeared close by since you seem to have heard a little about the matter i feel i must say that my brother deliberately left us at a time when his father had expected him to be of service to him  ida did not know whether the others could hear what was being said as there was a strip of lawn between them and where she sat but she felt that it did not greatly matter she had no pity for this man or his daughter who preferred to malign the absent rather than to admit an unpleasant fact she would strip them of any solace they might find in shams after which there was a little more to be said  the difference of opinion was i believe decided with a ridingcrop she said still that is a side issue and i will tell you what i meant by good company we have quite a few of your graduates out yonder laying railroad ties as well as lawyers who have got into trouble over trust money and army men who couldnt meet their turf debts or were a little too smart at cards some of them are of unexceptionable familyat least from your point of view as a rule they sleep packed like cattle in reeking redwood shacks and either dress in rags or mend their own clothes among their companions are ranchers who cant live all the year on the produce of their halfcleared land absconders from half the pacific slope cities and runaway sailormen the task set before them every morning would kill most of you  weston who had winced once or twice glanced apprehensively toward the rest they were sitting very still and their appearance suggested that whether warrantable or not they were listening  his insane folly has brought him down to that he asked  ida straightened herself a little with a sparkle in her eyes  i dont think there has been any very great descent she went on you must try to realize that those men are not wastrels now however they may have lived in england montreal or the cities down puget sound theyre rending new roads through the mountains to let in progress and civilization and making fast the foundations of the future greatness of a wide and prosperous land already because of what they and their kind have done you can travel through it without seeing a ragged slatternly woman or a brokendown desperate man besides many of them and certainly most of the small bush ranchers lead lives characterized by the old heroic virtues that seem to have gone out of fashion in the cities though youll find some of them held up for emulation in the pauline epistles  weston gazed at her in blank astonishment she made a little halfcontemptuous gesture  you cant understand that well one really couldnt expect you to you have never starved your body or forced it day after day to a task that was crushing you those men work in icy water keep the trail with bleeding feet and sleep in melting snow they bear these things cheerfully and i think there are no men on this earth who can match their wide charity the free companions never turn away the ragged stranger what is theirs is his from the choicest of their provisions to the softest sprucetwig bed  she laughed and then continued  thats in a general way to be particular ill try to tell you what clarence weston has done its worth hearing  she had spoken more clearly the last few moments and it became evident at length that she had secured the attention of everybody with an impulsive gesture she invited them all to listen  ill tell you what that picture leaves out she said there was an old man in the railroad camp playedout and useless the boys were handling him roughly because hed spoiled their supper rather often when clarence weston stepped in the old man you must understand hadnt a shadow of a claim on him now those are not nice men to make trouble with when they have a genuine grievance and there were three or four of them quite ready to lay hands on weston while there was nobody who sympathized with him he stood facing them one man against an angry crowd and held them off from the stranger who had no claim on him have you heard of anything finer  again when arabella lamed herself up on a great snow rangehed carried our food and blankets since sunrisehe went down to bring help in the darkness through the timber and along the edge of horrible crags the man had badly cut his foot and the wound opened on the march but when he made the camp almost too weary to crawl he went back right away so that the indians he took up might get there a little quicker  she broke off for a moment with a flush in her face and a curious little laugh  now she said i think ive made the thing quite plain and im glad i did  there was an expressive silence for a moment or two and then major kinnaird looked at the others  i know nothing about the first incident but i think that miss stirling could have gone a little further when she described the last one he said my daughter who was badly injured would probably have been left another day on the range without food or any attention if it had not been for the courage and endurance the man displayed i wish to say however that i had no idea he was any connection of mr westons until this moment  idas heart warmed toward kinnaird reserved and formal as he was the man could be honest and it was evident that his few quiet words had made almost as deep an impression as the outbreak to which she had been impelled there was another rather awkward silence and then weston who seemed to have forgotten the others made a little abrupt movement  what had my son to do with you he asked  the question was flung at kinnaird but ida saw that it was a relief to him when she answered it  my father hired him he was our camppacker the man who set up the tents made the fires and poled the canoes she said  weston stood up and looking hard at kinnaird straightened himself his face was an unpleasant red and there was badlysuppressed anger in his eyes  time is getting on and we have rather a long drive he said i may ask miss stirlings leave to call on her later in the meanwhile if mrs kinnaird will excuse us  his hostess made no attempt to keep him and as he moved away his daughter stopped for a moment beside idas chair  i dont know whether what you have done was excusable or not but you have at least succeeded in making the breach between clarence and his father wider than ever she said that was probably what you intended  ida was momentarily puzzled  intended she said if either of you had done your brother justice i dont think i should have mentioned him at all  miss weston smiled scornfully and moved away but the blood crept into the face of the girl she left that she had outraged these peoples sense of their importance she felt reasonably sure and their resentment which she admitted was perhaps more or less warranted did not trouble her but the drift of miss westons last observation filled her with anger they evidently regarded her as a raw colonial endued with no sense of what was fitting who could not expect to be countenanced by an insolvent landowning family this was amusing but the suggestion that she recognized the fact and because of it had endeavored to alienate clarence weston from his relatives who had apparently been very glad to get rid of him was a very different matter however she recovered her composure with an effort and succeeded in taking a part in the general conversation which broke out when weston drove away     chapter xix  illumination   it was three or four months later when ida was carried swiftly westward through the london streets toward twelve oclock one night the motor purred and clicked smoothly slinging bright beams of light in front of it as it twisted eellike through the traffic the glass that would have sheltered ida from the cool night breeze was down but she scarcely noticed the roar of the city or the presence of arabella and mrs kinnaird  she was thinking of that afternoon at scarthwaite and wondering as she had done somewhat frequently since then what had impelled her to speak in that impulsive fashion it had not been as she now recognized merely a desire to justify clarence weston in the eyes of his english relatives for she had felt reasonably sure that this was a thing beyond accomplishment while he remained a railroadhand or a bush chopper the other explanation was that she had spoken to reassure herself but that as she would have admitted seemed scarcely necessary for in this respect he did not need an advocate there was the third alternative that the attitude of weston and his daughter toward the absent man had fanned her dislike of shams into a blaze of downright rage and that she had merely ridden a somewhat reckless tilt against her pet aversions  one thing at least was certain weston had not called on her to ask for any further information about his son and for that matter she would have been astonished had he done so she realized now that there was truth in what clarence weston said when he told her that the failures were soon forgotten that however was a matter that depended largely on ones point of view and she could not regard him as a failure  there was in ida stirling a vein of wholesome simplicity which made for clearness of vision and she seldom shrank from looking even an unwelcome truth squarely in the face that clarence weston was probably shoveling railroad gravel did not count with her but she was reasonably sure that the fact that she was a young woman with extensive possessions would have a deterrent effect on him she once or twice had felt a curious compelling tenderness for him when in his presence but reflection had come later and she could not be sure that she loved him well enough to marry him should he offer her the opportunity during the last few months she had become more uncertain on this point for her english visit was having an effect on her that she had not expected  in the meanwhile the insistent clamor of the city was forcing itself on her attention until at length she became engrossed by it the theaters had just been closed and the streets resounded with the humming of motors the drumming of hoofs and the rattle of wheels they also were flooded with what seemed to her garish light for she had swept through many a wooden town lying wrapped in darkness beside its railroad track the hansoms and motors came up in battalions and in most of them she could see men of leisure in conventional white and black and lavishly dressed women while the sidewalks streamed with a further host of pleasureseekers she wondered when these people slept or when they worked if indeed in one sense some of them worked at all even in the winter they had nothing like this in montreal and the contrast between it and the strenuous grimly practical activity of the canadian railroad camp or the lonely western ranch was more striking still there men rose to toil with the dawn and slept when the soft dusk crept up across solemn pines or silent prairie these men however saw and handled the results of their toil great freighttrains speeding over the trestles they had built vast bands of cattle and leagues of splendid wheat after all the genius of london is administrative and not constructive and it is the latter that appeals most directly to the colonial one can see the forests go down or the great rocks rent but the results that merely figure in the balancesheet are less apparent  there was another matter that claimed idas attention she would meet gregory kinnaird at the dance and she had seen a good deal of him during the last few months he was not formal like his father and in most respects she liked the man and there was no doubt whatever that he neglected no opportunity for enjoying her company indeed he had of late drawn rather close to her and she wondered a little uneasily how far this approachment was to go london she was conscious was getting hold of her and there was after all a good deal it had to offer that strongly appealed to her  by and by the motor stopped before a house with balconies and ponderous pillars and she and her companions went up the ample stairway and into several uncomfortably crowded flowerbedecked rooms ida however was getting used to the lights and the music the gleam of gems the confused hum of voices and the rustle of costly draperies and though she admitted that she liked it all they no longer had the same exhilarating effect on her she danced with one or two men and then as she sat alone for a moment gregory kinnaird crossed the room toward her his face was a little more serious than usual as a rule he took things lightly  i think this is mine he said as the orchestra recommenced still perhaps you have had enough i can find you a nice cool place where we can talk  she went with him because it certainly was uncomfortably warm where she was and besides she was impelled by a certain curiosity to ascertain just how they stood he passed through one supperroom into another and then drew back a heavy curtain from an open window  its quiet anyway he said and they passed out on to a little balcony where late in the year as it was a row of potted shrubs cut them off from view  below there were dusky leafless trees among which a few big lights gleamed and the roar of the city came up across them brokenly ida sat down and a ray of light fell upon her companion who leaned against the rails gregory kinnaird was wellfavored physically and bore the stamp of a military training he was she understood captain of a rather famous regiment and she liked his direct gaze which did not detract from his easy suavity of manner however he appeared somewhat unusually diffident that evening  you like all this he asked with a little wave of his hand which she fancied was intended to indicate the distant roar of the city as well as the music and dancing in the rooms behind her  yes she said with a smile for he appeared to take it for granted as others had done that they had no brilliant social functions in montreal i think i do but when you have so much of it the thing seems a little aimless doesnt it  aimless inquired kinnaird who appeared to ponder over this until a light broke in on him well he admitted i suppose it is still what else could half of them do  ida laughed goodhumoredly and the man made a little expostulatory gesture  i generally avoid any discussions of that kind they never lead to anything he said i was wondering whether you could learn to like london as well as montreal  i dont know replied ida in her most matteroffact manner  oh said her companion it seems a senseless question but i want to explain i have been offered an opportunity to go awayto do somethingvery soon i should be away two years at least and as the notice is a short one i have practically to make up my mind tonight  it almost appeared that he had expected ida to show some sign of interest or perhaps concern but none was perceptible  where are you going she asked  to a colony in tropical africa they want somebody to hammer a native levy into shape and keep the niggers in some kind of order  dont they have fever there  i believe it isnt a particularly salubrious place said kinnaird smiling but that kind of thing affects only some constitutions and it makes promotion quicker  ida who had perused a good many works of travel knew a little about the fevers that afflict the country in question in fact she fancied that she knew more than the man did but his careless indifference to the personal hazard pleased her she noticed that he had spoken naturally as he felt without any idea of producing an effect on her  what is the result of that kind of work she asked  the result queried kinnaird with a puzzled air a battalion of thickheaded niggers with some slight knowledge of civilized drill and perhaps a few stockades blown up in the bush  then as he saw the halfveiled amusement in her eyes a light seemed to break in on him  if one managed the thing efficiently it would perhaps lead to the offer of a secondrate semiadministrative post somewhere else in the tropics though i believe the emoluments are not what one could call liberal  that is all  yes said kinnaird im afraid one couldnt expect anything further  ida smiled rather curiously she liked the man but it was clear that his mental capacity had its limits though she would not have had him expatiate on the fact she had expected him to realize that his mission was to uphold the white mans supremacy and establish tranquillity commerce and civilization in a barbarous land it was however evident that he did not understand this he was going out as he said to drill thickheaded niggers and would in all probability content himself with doing that  then he turned toward her again  what it leads to doesnt matter very much ive been getting away from the point he said you see i dont know whether im going at all at the moment it depends a good deal on what you have to say to me  ida started a little though she had expected something of this kind still she recovered her serenity quickly and in a moment she looked at him inquiringly with calm eyes  i didnt mean to say anything for some while yet but this thing has forced my hand he said you see i must let them know during the next day or two whether im going  he broke off for a moment and his manner became diffident  miss stirling he added i think i fell in love with you the second or third time i saw you if not the first and as i have seen you rather often since then you can perhaps imagine what i feel now im afraid there is no very strong reason why you should look kindly on such a man as i am but i came here tonight to ask if you would marry me  ida quietly met his gaze the man was wellfavored physically honest courteous and considerate and in many ways she liked him indeed she wondered with a certain uneasiness how far she had allowed the latter fact to become apparent for it was quite another matter to marry him as she now realized  is this offer quite spontaneous she asked  kinnaird flushed a little but she thought the more of him for the candor with which he answered her  in the first place i believe my mother put the thing into my head he admitted after that it got hold of meand i was rather glad that my people were apparently satisfied that it did it promised to save trouble for i should naturally have gone on with it if they had done their utmost to thwart me  he broke off abruptly and ida met his gaze  thank you she said the honesty of that admission would have counted a good deal in your favor had the thing been possible  the man straightened himself and clenched one hand  ah he said then its quite out of the question  ida saw the blood rise into his face and noticed the sudden hardness in his eyes her answer evidently had hurt him more than she expected and she felt sorry for him the mans quietness and control and the absence of any dramatic protestation had a favorable effect on her and she was almost certain that she could have married him had she met him a year earlier in the meanwhile however she had met another man dressed in old blue duck with hands hard and scarred and the wellgroomed soldier became of less account as she recalled the man she had left in the mountains then kinnaird turned to her again  cant you give me a chance he said if its necessary ill wait and in the meanwhile i may do something worth while out yonder if thats any inducement  im very sorry replied ida im afraid it wouldnt be  she looked him steadily in the eyes and he had sense enough to recognize that no words of his would move her though it was not an easy matter he retained his selfcontrol  well he admitted it hurts but i must bear it and i want to say that im glad in several ways that i met you then the blood crept into his face again i should at least like you to think kindly of me and im rather afraid appearances are against me because that is so theres a thing that i should like you to understand id have been proud to marry you had you been a beggar  thank you said ida who saw that he meant it im more sorry than ever but the thing isout of the question  kinnaird gravely held out his arm but she intimated by a little sign that she did not wish to go back with him and in a moment the curtains swung to behind him and he had gone  ida became conscious that she was growing cold but she sat quite still for at least five minutes thinking hard and wondering why she felt so sorry to give up gregory kinnaird it was a somewhat perplexing thing that one could be really fond of an eligible man and yet shrink from marrying him and there was no doubt whatever that the one she had just sent away had in several respects a good deal to offer her  she admitted that london was as she expressed it getting hold of her she supposed that its influence was insidious for she no longer looked on its frivolities with halfamused contempt as she had at first she realized the vast control that that city had over so much of the rest of the world and that when some of the men with whom she had lightly laughed and chatted pulled the strings new industries sprang up far away in the scorching tropics or on the desolate prairie and new laws were made for hosts of dusky people it was certainly a legitimate bargain kinnaird had suggested she had wealth sufficient for them both and he could offer her the entry into a world where wealth well directed meant power and this she undoubtedly desired to possess there was a vein of ambition in this girl whose father had risen to affluence from a very humble origin and while she listened to gregory kinnaird she had felt that she could rise further still  she knew that she had will and charm enough to secure with the aid of her fathers money almost what place she would and for a few moments she saw before her dazzling possibilities and then with the resolution that was part of her nature she turned her eyes away after all though a high position with the power and pride of leading was a thing to be desired life she felt had as much to offer in different ways and she recalled a very weary man limping gray in face up the steep range the picture was very plainly before her as she sat there shivering a little and her heart grew soft toward the wanderer she knew at last why nothing that kinnaird could have said or offered would have moved her and she looked down at the lamps that blinked among the leafless boughs with a great tenderness shining in her eyes the stir of the city fell faintly on unheeding ears and she was conscious only of a longing for the stillness of the vast pine forest through which she had wandered with weston at her side  then she rose abruptly and went back into the lighted room though she danced once or twice and talked to a number of people who perhaps fortunately did not seem to expect her to say anything very intelligent she was glad when mrs kinnaird sent for her and they and arabella drove away together the elder lady troubled her with no questions but soon after they reached home she came into the room where ida sat and as she left the door open the girl saw gregory go down the stairway with a letter in his hand he met his sister near the foot of it and his voice which seemed a trifle strained came up to ida clearly  ill just run out and post this ive told those people that ill go as soon as they like he said  then mrs kinnaird quietly closed the door before she crossed the room and sat down near the girl  its rather hard to bear she said perhaps i feel it the more because arabella will leave me soon  the womans quietness troubled ida and her eyes grew hazy  oh she said though it isnt quite my fault how you must blame me its most inadequate but i can only say that im very sorry  i suppose what you told gregory is quite irrevocable inquired her companion  ida saw the tense anxiety in the womans eyes and her answer cost her an effort  yes quite she said i wish i could say anything else  i cant blame you my dear i blame only myself said mrs kinnaird im afraid i brought this trouble on gregory and it makes my share of it harder to bear still there is something to be said i wanted gregory to marry you because i wanted him near me but i cant have you think that i would have tried to bring about a match between him and any girl with money my dear and she leaned forward toward her companion i am fond of you  ida made a gesture of comprehension and sympathy and the little quiet lady went on again  there is just another thing she said gregory will have very littlea few hundred a yearbut it would not have been a dreadfully onesided bargain he had after all a good deal to offer  ida raised a hand in protest  oh she said i know  still continued mrs kinnaird i want you to feel quite sure that he loved you without that nothing else would have counted you will believe it wont you it is due to my son  she rose with a little sigh  things never go as one would wish them to  ida was very sorry for her but there was so little that could be said  i shall always think well of gregory she answered you will try to forgive me  then an impulsive restless longing came over her with the knowledge that she had brought this woman bitter sorrow  i will go home she broke out it will hurt you to see me near you when gregory has gone away there are friends of oursmrs claridge and her daughter you met themleaving for paris on wednesday and they sail for new york in a week or two  it was a relief to both of them to discuss a matter of this kind and before mrs kinnaird left her all had been arranged still it was not montreal and its winter amusements that ida thought of then but the shadowy bush and the green river that stole out from among the somber pines     chapter xx  ida claims an acquaintance   it was early on a fine spring evening when clarence weston lay somewhat moodily on the wooded slope of the mountain that rises behind montreal it is not very much of a mountain though it forms a remarkably fine natural park and from where weston lay he could look down upon a vast sweep of country and the city clustering round the towers of notre dame it is from almost any point of view a beautiful city for its merchants and financiers of english and scottish extraction have emulated the love of artistic symmetry displayed by the old french canadian religious orders as well as their lavish expenditure in the buildings they have raised churches hospitals banks and offices delight the eye and no pall of coalsmoke floats over montreal it lies clean and sightly between its mountain and the river under the clear canadian sky  on the evening in question the faintest trace of thin blue vapor etherealized its clustering roofs and stately towers and the great river spanned by its famous bridge gleamed athwart the flat champaign a wide silver highway to the distant sea beyond it stretches of rolling country ran back league after league into the vast blue distance where vermont lay still weston who was jaded and cast down frowned at the city and felt that he had a grievance against it during the last week or two he had for the most part vainly endeavored to interview men of importance connected with finance and company promoting very few of them would see him at all and those with whom he gained audience listened to what he had to say with open impatience or with a halfamused toleration that was almost as difficult to bear perhaps this was not astonishing as most of them already had had somewhat costly experiences with what they called wildcat mining schemes  there was however a certain vein of dogged persistency in clarence weston and almost intolerably galling as hefound it he would still have continued to obtrude his presence on gentlemen who had no desire whatever to be favored with it and to waylay them in the hotels but for the fact that the little money he had brought with him was rapidly running out one can in case of stern necessity put ones pride in ones pocket though the operation is occasionally painful but one cannot dispense with food and shelter and the latter are not as a rule to be obtained in a canadian city except in exchange for money weston who had had no lunch that day took out the little roll of bills still left in his wallet and when he had flicked them over it became unpleasantly clear that he could not prosecute the campaign more than a very few days longer then he took out his pipe and filling it carefully broke off a sulphur match from the block in his pocket he felt that this was an extravagance but he was in need just then of consolation he had wandered up on the mountain past the reservoir and the mgill university after a singularly discouraging afternoon to wait until supper should be ready at his boardinghouse  one or two groups of loungers young men and daintily dressed women strolled by and then he started suddenly at the sound of a voice that sent a thrill through him he would have recognized it and the laugh that followed it anywhere he sprang to his feet as a group of three people came out from a winding path among the trees for a moment or two a wholly absurd and illogical impulse almost impelled him to bolt he knew it was quite unreasonable especially as he had thought of the girl every day since he had last seen her but he remembered that she was a rich mans daughter and he a wandering packer of no account with an apparently unrealizable project in his mind and in his pocket no more money than would last a week while he hesitated she saw him he stood perfectly still perhaps a little straighter than was absolutely necessary and not looking directly toward her if she preferred to go by without noticing him he meant to afford her the opportunity  she turned toward her father and said something that weston could not hear but he felt his heart beat almost unpleasantly fast when a moment later she moved on quietly straight toward him she looked what she was a lady of station and her companions attire suggested the same thing while though weston now wore city clothes he was morbidly afraid that the stamp of defeat and failure was upon him much as he had longed for her it would almost have been a relief to him if she had passed ida however did nothing of the kind she stopped and held out her hand while she looked at him with gracious composure it was impossible for him to know that this had cost her a certain effort  where have you come from we certainly didnt expect to see you here she said  from winnipeg that is immediately said weston and added i hired out to bring a draft of cattle  ida who was quite aware that the tending of cattle on trains was not a wellpaid occupation and was usually adopted only by those who desired to save the cost of a ticket fancied that she understood why he mentioned this and was not sure that she was pleased it was as she recognized the mans unreasonable pride which impelled him to thrust facts of that kind into the foreground just then however her father who had waited a moment or two stepped forward and shook hands with him  where are you staying in the city he asked  at lemoines boardinghouse answered weston mentioning a street in the french canadian quarter from which any one acquainted with the locality could deduce that he found it desirable to study economy  doing anything here asked stirling  weston said that he had some mining business in hand and he looked down at his clothes when stirling suggested that he should come home with them to supper though from his previous acquaintance with the man he was not astonished at the invitation stirling laughed  thats quite right he said we call it supper and thats how i dress i dont worry about the little men when i bring them along and the big ones dont mind  weston glanced at ida and when he saw that she seconded the invitation he said that he would run around to his boardinghouse first to see whether there were any letters or messages for him stirling made a sign of comprehension for this was a thing he could understand there had been a time when he had watched and waited for the commissions which very seldom came  then you can come straight across as soon as you have called there said ida  she presented him to her companion who it appeared came from toronto and then she explained that they had climbed the mountain so that her friend might see the surroundings of the city they walked back together until they reached a spot where two roads led downhill and weston left them  it was some little time later when he reached stirlings house and was left to wait a few minutes in a very artisticallyfurnished room its floor was of polished parquetry with a few fine skins from british columbia spread upon it here and there and the dainty spindlelegged chairs the little tables the cabinets and the watteau figures were he fancied either of old french manufacture or excellent copies the big basement heater had apparently been extinguished but a snapping woodfire blazed upon the english pattern hearth and for the light was fading outside it flung an uncertain flickering radiance about the room weston sitting down contrasted its luxury with the grim bareness of his matchboarded cubicle in the boardinghouse and with the log shanties of the railroad and logging camps he frowned as he did so for all that his eyes rested on made unpleasantly plain the distinction between himself and the girl whose room it evidently was  then he rose as she came in attired in a long trailing dress that rustled as she moved it seemed to become her wonderfully and he became conscious of a faint embarrassment he had not seen her dressed in that fashion before and after the years that he had spent in lonely bush and noisy railroad camp her beauty and daintiness had an almost disconcerting effect on him she drew a low chair a little nearer the hearth and sinking into it motioned to him to be seated  my father is busy and nellie farquhar will not be down for a little while she said we shall probably have half an hour to ourselves and i want you to tell me all that you have been doing since we left you  weston understood that she meant to resume their acquaintancethough he was not sure that was quite the correct word for itat the point at which it had been broken off and he was rather glad that she asked him what he had been doing it was a safe topic and naturally one on which he could converse and he felt that any silence or sign of constraint would have been inadmissible  oh he said we went up to look for the mine again  you were not successful  no said weston it was winter and we had rather a rough time in the ranges in fact i got one foot frostbitten and was lame for some while afterward it was the one i cut which probably made it more susceptible  his face hardened a trifle as he recalled the agony of the march back through the snowy wilderness and the weeks he had afterward spent unable to set his foot to the ground in the comfortless log hotel of a little desolate settlement  wasnt it rather foolish to go up into the ranges in winter ida asked  it was admitted weston with a faint dry smile still you see i couldnt stay away the thing has become an obsession  ida fancied that she understood he had on several occasions revealed to her his stubborn pride and she knew that whatever he thought of her he would keep it to himself unless he found that mine she also had some idea of what one would have to face floundering over the snowbarred passes into the great desolation in winter time  well she asked quietly what did you do then  we worked in a logging camp until spring and then i went down to vancouver to raise money for the next campaign nobody seemed inclined to let me have any for which one couldnt very well blame them after all and weston laughed softly the thing looks uncommonly crazy later on we got a pass to do some trackgrading back east on one of the prairie lines and when wed saved a few dollars i started to try my luck in montreal  ida said nothing for a few moments she could fill in most of what he left untold and it seemed to her that one who knew how men lived in the lonely logging camps through the iron winter or drove the new track across the prairie through the thaw slush in spring could make an epic of such a theme it was toil that taxed mans utmost strength of body and mind under the arctic frost and what was even worse to bear in halfthawed mire she had once seen the trackgraders trooping back wet to the skin worn out and clogged with soil to the knees to the reeking shanty which was filled with the foul steam of drying clothes as the result of it all weston had perhaps saved less money than she often spent on one gown she felt very compassionate toward him and he was troubled by the softness in her eyes he felt that if he watched her too closely he might lose his head  i tried to study a few works on trigonometry and surveying during the winter but it was a little difficult he said for one thing if you sat near the stove in the logging shack the light was dim and you couldnt very well read anywhere else in the frost we had besides that the boys generally insisted on everybodys playing cards and if any one refused they had a playful trick of throwing things at him  the girl who had imagination could picture the dimlylighted shanty and the bronzed and ragged men flinging their long boots as well as very pointed badinage at the comrade who tried to read it would she admitted certainly be a little difficult to study trigonometry in such surroundings  you see i wanted to go into the thing systematically continued weston who felt that he was safest when he kept on talking we have decided that verneille couldnt have made more than forty miles from the lake and as he was heading south that gives us at most a sweep of about a hundred and twenty miles to search though the whole of it is practically a nest of mountains as i wasnt able to read up the subject quite as much as i should have liked we have thought of hiring a professional surveyor and raising money enough to spend the whole summer over the thing even if we have to let the men who help us take a share in the mine  i wonder whether you would be very much offended if some of your friends were to offer to bear part of the expense ida asked quietly  im afraid i couldnt permit it the mans face flushed they probably would never get their money back after all its only a wildcat scheme  that doesnt sound very convincing said ida havent you another reason  she had expected to find the suggestion useless when she made it for she understood his attitude he would not take her money and that of course was in one respect just as she would have had it but on the other hand there were so many difficulties and probably hazards that she could save him  well he said quietly its the only reason i can offer  there was silence for almost half a minute and ida felt that it was becoming singularly uncomfortable so much could have been said by both of them that their conversation up to this point had suggested to her the crossing of a river on very thin ice on the surface it was smooth but the stream ran strong below and there was the possibility that at any moment one of them might plunge through pride forbade her making any deliberate attempt to break the ice but she would not have been very sorry had it suddenly given way the man evidently was holding himself in hand and she felt that she must emulate his reticence she clung to the safe topic in which she really was interested as he had done  wont you go on she asked you were not successful in vancouver and you tried to raise the money in montreal its a little difficult isnt it  oh yes said weston laughing as im situated it certainly is of course a good deal depends on how you set about this kind of thing and the correct way would have been to come in on a pullman instead of a cattlecar and then engage a suite of rooms at the biggest hotel financiers and company jobbers seem rather shy of a man who gives lemoines boardinghouse as his address and some of them are not quite civil when they hear what he has to say to them in fact im afraid that i shall have to give them up in a day or two  it was evident that he took his defeat quietly but ida thought that she knew what that quietness cost  how are you going to get back she asked  she felt that it was rather a cruel question for this was not the man to give up while he had a dollar in hand and she was sure that he was going back to search for the mine again still in one respect she was a little vexed with him his selfcontrol was excellent but there was rather too much of it  that he said with a whimsical twinkle in his eyes is a point that will require rather careful consideration  ida liked his smile but the desire to startle him out of his reticence in one way or another became suddenly irresistible and she changed the subject abruptly  i told you i was going to england she said i wonder whether you would be surprised to hear that i spent a month or two at scarthwaite hall  weston did not seem exactly astonished but he was clearly disconcerted and off his guard  i heard that you did he said  then you know that i met your father and sister and didnt keep my promise or at least that i didnt do what you wanted me to  yes said weston simply  his quietness was too obvious and she felt that it covered a good deal  one of them wrote you she asked  yes admitted weston my father indulged in a few reproaches he didnt seem to like the notion of my having served as your camppacker after that you were in london  he was at fault on two points for though compelled to answer her he should not have volunteered any information as to what was in the letter nor should he have attempted to change the subject for this made it clear to ida that things had been said which he did not wish her to suspect there would of course be reproaches but it seemed probable that there would be a word or two of halfcontemptuous advice as well and she felt reasonably sure what this would be weston of scarthwaite had no doubt suggested that the man of whom she had spoken so favorably would be a fool if he did not marry her a trace of color crept into her face and seeing that there was a certain diffidence in her companions manner she felt that she hated weston of scarthwaite it was however evident that silence would be too suggestive just then  i didnt make a promise after all she said are you afraid that i gave your people a wrong impression about you  no replied weston quietly looking her in the eyes i know you would say nothing that was not kind of me still the only thing that would affect my people would be the fact that i havent succeeded at anything yet he smiled rather grimly im not sure it wouldnt please them in a way you see they probably expected it  on the whole both of them were glad that miss farquhar came in just then and in a few more minutes stirling appeared and they went in to dinner it was not a very elaborate meal for the contractor who had once toiled much as weston had done was like a good many others of his kind in some respects a simple and frugal man still when ida and miss farquhar left them he laid a cigarbox on the table and filled westons glass with wine  now he said if you have no objections you can tell me what youre doing in montreal  weston supplied him with a brief account of his business and stirling who asked one or two very shrewd questions sat apparently reflecting for a minute or two  you struck nobody in vancouver who seemed inclined to take a hand in it  only one concern and they seemed very doubtful anyway their terms were practically prohibitive  grafton  no norris  lander  well said stirling before you could expect to do anything here youd want to locate the reef and get some big mining man to visit it and give you a certificate that it was a promising property if you had that and a bag of specimens of highgrade milling ore people would listen to you  the trouble is that i cant get them  then observed stirling i guess youll have to fall back on your friends  im afraid that none of my friends have any money to invest and in any case id rather deal with strangers said weston  his host glanced at him very keenly  seems to me you have got to let the thing go he said  no declared weston in some respects its a crazy project but im going on  stirling quietly turned the conversation into another channel but when western took his departure he called up his secretary on the telephone  i want you to write norris  lander vancouver the first thing in the morning and get it off by the pacific express he said tell them they can let a young man named weston with whom theyve been in communication have the money he asks for to count as stock when he starts his company at the biggest discount they can get they can charge me usual brokerage but theyre to keep my name out of it  the secretary said it should be done and stirling sat down to his cigar with a smile he was inclined to fancy that weston would find norris  lander much more amenable after that it was an hour later when ida came into the room and he looked at her thoughtfully  theres some grit in that young man and i guess its just as well he observed hes up against quite a big proposition  he saw the faint gleam in idas eyes  if he has taken hold i think he will put it through she said  she turned away the next moment and moved a glass on the table but when she looked around again she saw stirlings smile  well he said considering everything its quite likely  after this he carefully picked out another cigar and ida left him wondering what he could have meant     chapter xxi  the brÛlÉe   stirling who hitherto like a wise man had carefully avoided wildcat mining schemes and indeed ventures of any kind outside his own profession had for once thrust his prudence into the background and done what he could to further westons project for a reason which he would not have admitted to anybody else he was not famous as a charitable person but he had for all that unobtrusively held out a helping hand to a good many struggling men in need of it during his career and there were now certain conjectures and suspicions lying halfformulated at the back of his mind he had acted on them with the impulsive promptness which usually characterized him and it was not his fault that his efforts proved fruitless for weston as it happened neither revisited vancouver nor communicated with norris  lander  a week after he left montreal weston met grenfell in a little british columbian settlement shut in by towering ranges and leagues of shadowy bush where they were fortunate enough to find a storekeeper who seemed inclined to place more credence in their story than any of the company promoters had done what was more to the purpose he offered to provide them with a horse campgear and provisions in exchange for a certain share in the mine should their search prove successful the share was rather a large one but as the man pointed out it was very probable that they might not strike the lode at all they also made the acquaintance of a young surveyor who had set up in the wooden settlement several months earlier and had done very little business since he was quite willing to give them the benefit of his professional services on somewhat similar terms to those the storekeeper had made  the result of this was that early one morning they set out once more on the gold trail when they made their first camp at sunset in a grove of towering pines they held a council it was almost dark amidst the serried rows of tremendous trunks but the light of the snapping fire fell upon their faces which were all a trifle grave in the case of two of the party at least their faces were stamped with a certain quiet resolution and a hint of the forcefulness which comes of rigid and continuous selfdenial men discover in the bush that abstention from most of the little comforts and amenities of life not infrequently tends to vigor of body and clarity of mind this however is a fact that has been accepted long ago for it is not as a rule the fullfleshed selfindulgent man who does anything worth while their skin was clear and bronzed their nerves steady and though grenfell differed from them in these respects their eyes were very keen with a snap in the depths of them they were eyes that could look peril and defeat squarely in the face without flinching  devine the young surveyor laughed as he flung his empty enameled plate aside  its quite a long time since i had a meal of that kind he said after all there is a certain satisfaction in the feeling that you couldnt eat very much more even if you had it though thats an opportunity to which ive not been accustomed lately ive made my supper rather frequently on half of a stale flapjack and had the other half for breakfast the next day having admitted that suppose we turn our attention to the proposition in front of us you were heading south when you separated from verneille grenfell  about south i cant be sure  that observed the surveyor may mean anything between southeast and southwest and if we take the spot where you found your partner afterward and make a sweep with a fortymile radius which is what weve concluded was the distance he probably covered it gives us quite a big tract of country to search still we ought to find a lake thats a mile or two across  weston laughed softly  its my third attempt and i dont know how often grenfell has tried one could almost fancy that the lake has vanished that sounds a little absurd doesnt it  well said devine with an air of reflection we wont admit that its an impossibility if you can take that for granted it simplifies the thing  grenfell who lay with his back against a fir trunk roused himself suddenly  i never thought of it in that way he said still lakes as big as that one dont vanish  anyway mines seem to do so the woods are full of them if all one hears is true  it isnt said weston dryly though ive no doubt there are a few lost mines are you sure you havent done a crazy thing in joining us in the hunt for this one of course ive tried to put that aspect of the matter squarely before you already  devine who was a young man flushed slightly  the cold fact is that i was only afraid you wouldnt take me its a big inducement to know that one has a reasonable supply of provisions in hand  youve evidently been up against it like the rest of us grenfell suggested  ive lived for three months on the proceeds of the only job i got and its quite likely i shouldnt have held out if i hadnt been broken into the thing while i got through with my studies in toronto i dont quite know now how i did that but i had to hire out between whiles teaming and dredging up building stone from the lake to make my fees and now and then i lived on one meal a day to spin out the money it would have been easier at the settlement but i had a lesson soon after i put up my sign two city men sent up by a syndicate to look for a pulpmill site and timber rights came along one hot day and found me splitting cedar shingles with mighty few clothes on the result was that while i might have made a small pile of money out of them they sent back to vancouver for another man and paid him twice as much though they didnt locate the mill i felt i had to tell you this  it was not at all an uncommon story in that country and when weston looked at grenfell with a smile the latter waved his hand  oh he said were a most worshipful company of broken deadbeats fed on credit and out on a forlorn hope but it seems to me that the storekeeper who supplied us with provisions is the craziest of all the crowd  it was the broken men who made this country said devine  there was a certain truth in this observation as the rest of them knew for after all it was the outcast and the desperate who first pushed grimly on into the wilderness up tremendous defiles and over passes choked with snow and afterward played a leading part in the titanic struggle with nature in the strongholds where she had ruled supreme the wilderness is merciless the beaten men died but the rest held on indomitable and now those who from the security of a railroad observationcar gaze upon orchard and oatfield awful gorge and roaring torrent can dimly realize what the making of that province cost the pioneers who marched into it with famineworn faces and bleeding feet that the valor of that army has not yet abated all are sure who know what the vanguard of the last host had to face on the trail to klondyke a few years ago  it is unpleasant to sleep in halfthawed slush around a sulky fire or to grip canoe pole or paddle until ones swollen fingers will not straighten and the palms are raw there is an exhilaration in plunging down a roaring rapid through a haze of spray but it loses something of its charm when each movement required to keep the canoe straight causes the man who holds the paddle agony from the wounds the floor of the craft has rubbed on his knees and a portage through tangled brushwood and over slippery rock around a fall forms a tolerably arduous task when he is stiff from constant immersion in very cold water and has had little to eat for a week or so it is a little difficult to convey a clear impression of the sensation experienced during the execution of these and similar tasks though they are undertaken somewhat frequently in that country and as it happens the men most qualified to speak are not as a rule gifted with descriptive powers  in any case nobody answered devine and instead of moralizing they presently went to sleep they were up at sunrise the next day and started soon afterward on a march that led them through tangled pine bush the tall grass of natural swamp prairies rotting muskegs and over stony hillslopes it was repeated with no great variation for several weeks except that now and then they swam or ferried themselves on logs over very cold and rapid rivers still thanks to the surveyors professional skill they were quartering the country systematically and though now and then they had to leave the horse at a base camp under grenfells charge they had to grapple with no insuperable difficulty  a good many leagues of range and forest had been traversed when they reached a tract where they had trouble in finding water there was snow above them but it either soaked down through the strata or the drainage from it descended on the other side of the divide it was also though not quite summer yet unusually hot weather and the season had been exceptionally dry and they had contented themselves for a week with the little muddy fluid they scraped up here and there from oozy pools that were lined with pine needles and rotting leaves when they came to a big brûlée  it filled a deep valley that was hemmed in by almost precipitous crags and though charred logs and branches lay here and there most of the burned forest was still standing as a matter of fact a fire in this region very seldom brings the trees down it merely strips them as the men pushed wearily on endless ranks of blackened trunks moved steadily back before them there was not a branch left the trees were tremendous halfcalcined columns and for it was evident that any wild wind seldom entered the deep hollow they might have stood in that condition a year or more the trouble in traversing a brûlée is that one cannot tell when from some cause or other one of them may come down  it was about noon and they had with some difficulty dined on grindstone bread and canned stuff without a drink of any kind when weston who was leading the horse pulled it up suddenly he was thirsty and short of temper and in a mood that would have made it easier for him to smash through an obstacle instead of stopping but he fancied that he saw a great blackened trunk close in front of him lean over a trifle he was sure of it in another moment and he urged the horse aside for the towering column swayed and oscillated as though it strove to recover its equipoise and then suddenly rushed earthward he felt the wind it made strike cold upon his cheek and then there was a deafening crash and a cloud of fine black dust rose up it whirled and eddied about him like the smoke of a great gun and the powder that settled thick upon him clogged his eyelashes and filled his nostrils the horse plunged viciously and came near dragging him off his feet  after that there was for a few seconds a silence that seemed oppressive by contrast until it was suddenly broken by another startling crash it was repeated here and there as though when each tree fell the concussion brought down another and the brûlée was filled with shocks of sound that rang in tremendous reverberations along the steep rocks in the meanwhile the men stood fast with tense blackened faces peering at the eddying dust out of halfblinded eyes until the crashes grew less frequent and there was deep silence again  then weston who patted the trembling horse sat down and pointed to the great shapeless pile of halfburned wood and charcoal close in front of him  a near thing i think ill have a smoke he said  a smoke gasped grenfell with your mouth and tongue like an ashpit id much sooner have a sherry cobbler as they used to make it with a big lump of ice swimming in it at theits the club i mean that is he added with a sigh if i could get it  you cant observed devine dryly id be content with water but didnt you break off rather suddenly in one place  youre young said grenfell looking at him solemnly if you werent i should regard that observation as an impertinence i said the club which is sufficient they used to make you really excellent sherry cobblers there  well said devine with his eyes twinkling i guess it is and the name was half out when you stopped i was naturally never inside the place in question but ive been in montreal its kind of curious isnt it to find a man who talks about such things leading a forlorn hope as you call it  no said grenfell it isnt curious at all there are cases in which a fondness for sherry cobblers provides a sufficient explanation for greater incongruities  it was apparently a relief to talk of something for there was no doubt that all of them had felt the tension of the last few minutes but weston cut short the discussion  we must get water tomorrow anyway he said had you any trouble about it grenfell the time you struck the lake  grenfell sat down on a fragment of the charred log and seemed to consider  no he said slowly that is we didnt quite run out of it though once or twice for several days we came across only a small creek or two there were signs that in some seasons it would be a dry country  he broke off and looked up at the range while the faces of the others grew intent as they watched him  in a way all thats familiar he said but ive felt the same thing in other places and i cant be sure  anyway remarked weston if there was a lake up yonder the creek would naturally flow through the valley it must have an outlet and were going upgrade  the creek said grenfell sharply went down the other side the lake lies just over a low divide  weston started a little and put away his pipe  boys he said well get on again  they went on and the memory of that afternoon long remained with them they were grimed with black dust and ashes and the ranks of charred trunks cast only thin strips of shade while a scorching sun poured down an almost intolerable heat into the deep valley the ground was ankledeep in dust and charcoal and as they floundered through it feathery ash rose in clouds their clothing grew crusted with it and it worked through and irritated their heated skin while every now and then one of them was compelled to stop and splutter their throats as grenfell remarked certainly felt very much like ashheaps none of them had drunk anything since supper the night before and then only a very little water that tasted alkaline  still except for the loose deposit that made walking difficult the ground was comparatively clear and they pushed on making a detour only now and then around a fallen tree or waiting for grenfell who lagged behind and limped until the slanting rays beat pitilessly into their faces and their aching eyes were dazzled by the burning glow then grenfell sat down rather frequently  were going northwest said weston once while they waited for him you said that was how you headed the day before you struck the lake  yes said grenfell with an air of trying to recall something it was summer and at sunset the light was in our eyes there was a very rugged strip on the rangenot unlike that one yonder still i cant be sure  nothing more was said it was quite clear that grenfells memory was not to be trusted and they were in no mood for talking they went on a little more slowly but grenfell lagged again and it was a vast relief to all of them when the glare that hurt their eyes died out suddenly as the red sun dipped behind a wall of rock half an hour later the heat of the brûlée seemed to dissipate and a wondrous invigorating coolness crept in with the dusk when they made their camp and picketed the jaded horse it did not seem worth while to light a fire as they had no water to use for tea and after eating a little grindstone bread and salt pork cooked the previous day they lay down rolled in their blankets     chapter xxii  grenfell goes on   weston tired as he was did not sleep well that night although they had a packhorse he had carried two blankets and a bag of flour and when a man has marched from sunrise until dusk under a heavy burden his shoulders as a rule ache distressfully in addition to this discomfort grenfells manner throughout that days march had roused an unsettling sense of expectation in his comrades the man had limped wearily and continually lagged behind but he had in spite of it resolutely insisted on their pushing on as fast as possible he had also looked about him with a certain suggestive curiosity every now and then and though he had once or twice admitted that he could not positively identify anything he saw his air of restrained eagerness had made its impression on weston  a halfmoon had sailed up into the eastern sky when the latter wakened and raised himself drowsily on one elbow all round him the great burned pines towered in black and shadowy columns against the silvery light and a stillness that was almost oppressive brooded over the valley no sound of running water came out of it and there was not a breath of wind it was cool however and weston drew his dusty blanket higher about his shoulders as he glanced round the camp devine lay close by sleeping like a log but grenfell was huddled at the foot of a tree and it became evident to his comrade that he at least was wide awake  havent you done enough to make you sleep weston asked  grenfell laughed softly  i havent closed my eyes i cant keep them off the range in front of us  weston looked up and saw a huge black rampart cutting sharp and clear against the blueness of the night  dont tell me that you recognize it he said  three nicks replied grenfell after the third one a rounded peak i cant tell whether i remember it from another time but that description came to me as if id used it and i think i must have done so anyway you can see them yonder  he broke off for a moment and when he went on again his manner was deprecatory  since sunrise ive been troubled with a haunting sense of the familiar though when i found the lake with verneille we marched through no brûlée  thats years ago and this brûlée is probably not more than twelve months oldi mean as a brûlée said weston impatiently for the strain of the long march was telling on him anyway youve been halfrecognizing places ever since we started on this search and id rather you didnt make half sure of anything else in fact i cant stand much more of it  grenfell who showed no sign of resentment laughed again  as i think i told you ive been troubled with memories that seem half dreams im not sure thats quite unusual in the case of a man who has consumed as much whisky as i have besides its a little difficult to distinguish between dreams and what we look upon as realities since the latter exist only in the perception of our senses which may be deceptive they agree on that point dont they in places as dissimilar as india and germany  are you sure you didnt dream about the lead weston asked bluntly its a point that has been troubling me for a considerable time  then why did you come up with me to search for the lake  i was once or twice told at home that i was a persistent imbecile that may account for it  well said grenfell reflectively your action on one or two occasions seems to warrant the observationi mean when you stood the boys off me after id spoiled their supper and the other time when you decided on my account not to stay on at the coppermine still i want to say that while i seem to know i will not make another journey on the gold trail ive had a subconscious feeling of certainty since sunrise yesterday that the lake lies just ahead of us i know nothing definite that justifies it but well probably find out tomorrow theres just another thing if i leave my bones up here my share falls to you  he seemed disinclined for any further conversation and weston went to sleep again when he awakened the moon had sunk behind the range and a faint gray light was filtering down beneath the blackened pines it showed the packhorse standing close by and devine stretched out beneath his blanket a shadowy shapeless figure but there was as far as weston could see no sign of grenfell anywhere he called out sharply as soon as he was sure of this and his voice rang hollowly up the valley but there was no answer until devine slowly shook clear of his blankets  whats the matter he asked  grenfells gone  gone devine was on his feet in a moment  it looks like it said weston sharply can you see him  devine gazed into the shadows but he saw nothing beyond the rows of dusky trunks  wheres he gone  that said weston is naturally just what i dont know its up to us to find out  then he briefly related his conversation with grenfell and the two looked at each other there was just light enough to show the anxiety in their faces  well said devine its quite clear to me that hes on the trail and its fortunate in one way that hes left a plain trail behind him whether the whole things a delusion on his part or whether he did strike that lode i dont know but i didnt like the mans looks yesterday he seemed badly played out and it kind of struck me he was just holding on he turned toward the packhorse and pulled up the picket anyway well get upon his trail  they both were men of action and inside of five minutes they had lashed their packs together and started without breakfast weston led the horse while devine picked up grenfells trail weston was a little astonished at the ease with which his companion did this  its quite simple said the surveyor when the other stopped a moment where the footprints seemed to break off and questioned his decision hes heading straight on and not walking like a man with much strength in him i wish i knew just how far he is ahead of us then he added in explanation i went east for a while but i was raised in this country and this is way easier than trailing a deer  they went on a little faster after that for devine had promptly picked up the trail again and by the time the red sun had cleared the range it led them out of the brûlée and into a waste of rock and gravel where there were smaller firs and strips of tangled undergrowth here and there devine stopped for a few minutes but he found the trail again though it led them through thickets and now and then they floundered among halfrotten fallen trunks and branches fortunately the horse was a cayuse and used to that kind of work  it rapidly grew hotter until the perspiration streamed from them and weston who had eaten very little the previous evening became conscious of an unpleasant stitch in his side but they pushed on without flagging urged by a growing anxiety at length the ground which was a little clearer rose sharply in front of them weston pulled up the packhorse and looked significantly at devine who nodded  yes he assented he said a low divide the lake lay just beyond it  then he cast about with his eyes fixed on the loose gravel over which they had scrambled until he came to a spot where a wide patch of halfrotted needles lay beneath another belt of pines  he stopped here and sat down he commented seemed to have had some trouble in pulling out again i dont like those footsteps you and i dont walk like that  get on said weston sharply and turning struck the horse  the sun was overhead when they scrambled gasping over the crest of the divide and looked down into another long winding hollow then they stopped again and looked hard at each other for the hollow seemed filled with forest and there was nowhere any shimmer of shining water  he cant be far ahead went through those vines in front of you said devine  then ensued an hours wild scramble through undergrowth in shade until they broke out dripping with perspiration from the gloom among the pines into a comparatively open space on the edge of a wide belt of willows they left the horse tethered on the outskirts of the latter and twenty minutes afterward devine who had scrambled up and down among the undergrowth stopped suddenly  come here he cried with a suggestive hoarseness were through with this trail  he was standing waistdeep among the tangled brushwood and it was a minute before weston smashed through it to his side then he too stopped and started for he saw a huddled object in tattered duck lying face downward at his comrades feet the latter made a little gesture when he met westons eyes  well make sure he said quietly still you see how hes lying  weston dropped on his knees and with some difficulty turned the prostrate figure over then he took off his battered hat and looked up at devine with it in his hand the latter nodded  yes he said he has pulled out once for all started two or three hours ago on a trail we cant pick up yet  they drew back a little and sat down heavily on a ledge of stone for the sight of the huddled figure in the tattered duck troubled them it was a minute or two before either of them spoke  heart trouble of some kind said the surveyor if not it isnt going to matter  he looked around at his companion with a little wave of his hand which seemed to deprecate the mention of the subject  he cant tell us now where that lode is  weston said nothing for a minute after all there was so little that could be said then he stretched himself wearily  there is something to be done but i dont feel quite equal to it yet and im parched with thirst willows grow only where theres water  these said devine look kind of sickly you can see quite a few of them have dried up but its a sure thing they had water to start them wish i knew how to strike it its most three days since i had what one could call a drink  did you ever hear of waterfinding  yes answered devine ive read a little about the old country kind of old english charlatanry isnt it  well said weston simply i could find water once upon a time i know that because ive done it  dont you need a hazel fork you cant get one here  i dont think the hazel matters the power is in the man i can cut a fork out of something  devine made a little gesture which seemed expressive of resignation  well he said whether we go on or go back we have to have a drink thats a sure thing and i feel like you that i want it before we set about the work thats awaiting us  after that they both sat still again they had to decide whether they would go back or go on and both of them realized what the decision would be their guide had left them and the last expectation of finding the lead had melted away at first the sight of his dead comrade had driven all other thoughts from westons mind but now he was compelled to admit that he had wasted time and money on a delusion that perhaps was no great matter in itself but it made it clear that all he could look for was to earn food and shelter as a packer logginghand or wandering laborer impassable barriers divided ida stirling from a man of that kind and he dare no longer dream of the possibility of tearing them down at last and the knowledge was very bitter he was face to face with defeat he forgot for the moment that grenfell lay just beyond the tangled undergrowth he gazed straight in front of him with a hard hand clenched and a look in his wavering eyes that puzzled his companion at length he raised himself wearily to his feet after all the needs of the body would not be denied and as devine had said before they set about the task that awaited them they must drink  well he said hoarsely im going to cut a fork  he smashed back through the undergrowth toward the pines unlashed the ax from the horses back and though he was never afterward sure whether he cut it from a young fir or a bush of juniper devine came upon him some time later trimming a forked twig with a short stem where the two slender branches united the surveyor glanced at it and smiled  any water that ran into this hollow must have come from the range he said well try close beneath it and give the thing a show  they did as he suggested and his expression was sardonically incredulous when weston proceeded along the foot of the hillside where the ground was a little clearer with a branch of the fork clutched in each hand the pointed stem was directed almost horizontally in front of him and it remained in that position for about twenty minutes when he lowered it with a gesture of discouragement  felt nothing yet devine inquired eagerly theres a kind of hollow yonder running into the thicket  weston made no answer but he turned in among the willows and for half an hour or so they stumbled and floundered among the clinging branches still there was no deflection of the fork and when at length they stopped again gasping and dripping with perspiration devine laughed rather grimly  oh give it a rest i guess thats what it wants he said ill hang on for another halfhour and then im going prospecting on my own account weve got to strike water  that at least was evident they were parched with thirst and it was very hot no breath of air seemed to enter that dense thicket and a cloud of tormenting flies hung about them westons head was throbbing with the heat and his sight seemed dazed both of them were dusty ragged grim of face and worn with travel and the longing for even a few drops of muddy liquid was becoming almost insupportable  it was only by a strenuous effort that weston went on again he felt scarcely capable of further exertion but he could not overcome the horrible bodily craving that seemed to grow stronger with every pulsation of his fevered blood and he plodded on into the thicket very wearily at length devine saw the twig bend downward for a moment in his hands  you did that he asked sharply  no said weston in a strained voice i certainly did not  let me take hold said devine and when weston handed the fork to him he walked back a few paces and crossed the same spot again the fork however pointed straight in front of him he threw it down and said nothing but weston looked at him with a little grim smile  ive heard it said that anybody could do it but thats not my experience he observed  devines gesture might have expressed anything  oh we were both crazy when we started with grenfell he said  weston moved forward with the fork and while devine looked on the stem once more inclined it wavered tilted downward a little farther and then slowly swung back to rest again still weston held on and when there was a further inclination it became clear that his companion was convinced  the things picking up the trail he exclaimed  for a time they wandered up and down the thicket weston apparently directing his course by the spasmodic movements of the fork which now and then would lie still altogether at length it commenced to jerk sharply and devine looked at his companion in a curious manner  its heading right back for grenfell he said in a hoarse whisper  they went on until they almost reached the spot which they had left more than an hour ago then the fork suddenly pointed straight downward and weston stopped his face was flushed and his voice was sharp and strained  go and bring the shovel he said  devine strode into the bush and weston struggled through the undergrowth to where grenfell lay scarcely a stones throw away stripping off his jacket he laid it over the dead man to keep off the flies then he went back and sat down with a dazed look in his eyes until the surveyor broke out from among the trees with the shovel  sit still said devine ill go down the first foot or two anyway  weary as he was he plied the shovel savagely flinging out the mould in showers but he was kneedeep in the hole before there was a clink as the blade struck stones  gravel the water would work right through that he said  he toiled on until the hole was a yard in depth but the gravel he flung out was dry and at length he stopped and sat on the side of the excavation gasping  nothing yet he said youre sure you struck it  yes replied weston quietly im sure  once more devine seized the shovel but in a moment he flung it down suddenly with a sharp glad cry  its sluicing out  weston rose and strode to the edge of the hole there was a little water in the bottom of it and this spread rapidly until it crept up about his comrades boots in one place he could see a frothing bubbling patch with an edge that was crystal clear then devine stooped and filling his wide hat held it up to him dripping  were through with one trouble anyway he announced exultantly     chapter xxiii  the lode   weston sitting down on the pile of gravel took the hat from his comrade and the trickle from the brim of it splashed refreshingly upon his hot and grimy face when he tilted it to drink it was shapeless greasy and thick with dust and few men who fare daintily in the cities would have considered it a tempting cup that however did not occur to weston but another thought flashed into his mind as he glanced toward the undergrowth behind which the man who had led them there lay he lowered the hat a moment and rose wearily  a few drops of this might have saved our partner he said now he has gone on may the trail he has taken be a smooth and easy one  then he drank standing a deep invigorating draught which seemed to cool his fevered blood and put new life in him he gasped for a moment or so and drank again and then flinging wide the splashes upon hot earth and leaves sat down heavily as he fumbled for his pipe devine who had drunk in the meanwhile turned to him  no he said reflectively i dont quite think youre right it wasnt thirst that brought grenfell to his end he had more water than either of usyou saw to thatand though it wouldnt have been pleasant you and i could have held out another day  what was it then asked weston  the strain of the journey on a playedout constitution and as i think i suggested the effect of excitement on a diseased heart the man was under a high tension the last day or two its a sure thing he had something on his mind after all i guess it was a delusion  weston said nothing but lay still with his pipe in his hand there was before him a task from which he shrank but he was wornout and could not nerve himself to undertake it yet and in the meanwhile he thought of his dead comrade with a certain regretful tenderness the man had had no claim on him and there had been much that was dissimilar in their natures but they had after all borne many hardships together and that counted for a good deal still in one way he could not be sorry that grenfell had gone on for life as he had said had very little to offer this outcast it was clear that the same thing held true in his own case and he remembered with a little wry smile that grenfell had said his share was to go to him if they found the mine they had not found it and there was no prospect of their doing so for his faith in the project had vanished now that grenfell was dead it remained for them only to go back to the settlements defeated  at length devine broke in upon his reflections  i dont know whether you remember that weve had nothing since supper last night he said anyway i dont feel equal to undertaking whats before us as i am seems to me the packhorse would like a drink too  weston felt a little guilty for the events of the past hour had driven all thought of the beast out of his mind going back for it he led it to the water after which they made a simple meal when it was over devine stood up resolutely  now he said theres a thing that must be done  they set about it and in another hour had laid to rest the man who had brought them there then devine put down his shovel and turned to weston  this thing has had its effect on me and i guess you feel it too he was your partner quite a while he said we want to get a move on and work this depression out of us well you can make campa little farther backwhile i crawl along between the willows and the range i want to see whats back of them theres an idea in my mind  weston who did not ask him what it was fell in with the suggestion and when his comrade floundered away through the willows proceeded to pitch the camp and build a fire ready for lighting among a few straggling firs a little back from the water then he went to sleep and when the horse awakened him as it strove to pull out its picket to get another drink he was a little astonished to see that the sun now hung low down above one range and that devine had not come back he lay still however in the blissful content that only the wornout know when for a few hours they can cease from toil presently he heard the willows rustle and though it cost him an effort he stood up when devine strode into camp the latter glanced toward the hole they had dug to reach the water  youve let the horse break the sides down and stand in it he said well clean it down to the gravel and pitch the soil out  is it worth while weston asked  yes said devine dryly as well probably be here a day or two i guess it is ill tell you about it when we get supper  weston might have noticed that there was something curious in his manner but he was very weary and his mind was a little hazy then he took the shovel and toiled for some few minutes before a strip of stone he was endeavoring to wrench out broke beneath the blade he flung the fragments out of the hole and one of them caught devines eye  pitch me up that big round stone he said sharply  weston did as he was bidden and his comrade falling upon his knee smashed the fragments into little lumps and then clutching some of them tight in one hand stood up with a hoarse exultant laugh  weve struck the lode he exclaimed  weston was beside him in a moment and devine poured the crushed fragments into his hand  look he said  weston did so and while his heart thumped painfully the blood crept to his face the little lumps he gazed at were milky white and through them ran what seemed to be very fine yellow threads  that is wire gold  it is said devine a sure thing  then the surveyor swept off his battered hat and swung round toward the willows a grotesque ragged figure with his hands spread out  you werent crazy partner you brought us up out of the swamps and sloos of poverty and planked us down right on to the lode he said  weston said nothing after all he was english and to some extent reticent but he felt that his comrades dramatic utterance was more or less warranted for the irony and pathos of the situation was clear to him grenfell had found the mine at last but the gold he had sought so persistently was not for him men great in the mining world had smiled compassionately at his story others with money to invest had coldly turned their backs on him and it had been given to a railroad hand and a surveyor who had longed for an opportunity for splitting roofing shingles in return for enough to eat to prove that after all the skill he had once been proud of had not deserted him he had patiently borne defeat and now the thrill of the longdeferred triumph had crushed him out of existence  in a moment or two devine spoke again in a different tone  well well get supper you want to cool off and quiet down  weston felt that this was true and it was a relief to start the fire and prepare the meal for he had found the rush of emotion which had swept over him almost overwhelming it was however not until the meal was ready that he was quite master of himself and they ate it before they said anything further about the matter then devine took out his pipe and lying with his back against a fir turned to his comrade as the soft dusk settled  whether grenfell knew where he was going when he started out last night or was led by some blind impulse or subconscious memory is more than i can tell and anyway its not a point that greatly matters now he said the cold fact is that you struck the water on the creek where as he told you he once got a drink  but things dont fit in objected weston  oh said his companion you let me talk youve been in this country a few years i was raised in it he said that a creek ran from the range and though theres mighty little water in it i guess it does that now theres rock milling rock shot with gold under it and a small flow of water will filter a long way through gravel  but he described it as an ordinary open creek persisted weston  thats easy said devine it was quite a while ago and nature handles these mountains mighty roughly as you ought to know she sweeps them with cloudbursts that wash half a hillside into the valleys and now and then with snowslides and tremendous falls of rock one of them filled up that creek and as far as i can figure it did rather more it filled up the gully through which the creek flowed high up on the range and while a little water still creeps through most of the melted snow goes down another creek as i took the trouble to ascertain it splits right through the lower slopes and comes out most a league away  this seemed reasonable most of the streams among those ranges originate as weston knew in the melting snow but there was still a point his comrade had left unexplained  then wheres the lake he asked  devine laughed  youre sitting right beside it now  weston gazed at him in blank astonishment and then a light broke in on him  the willows he said the water in that creek would no doubt spread underground and this is evidently an unusually dry season still grenfell spoke of a mile or two of water where has it gone  that explained devine seems the simplest thing of all anyway ill give you my theory when i crawled along the edge of the willows this afternoon i found the outlet of an old creek and a beaverdam now were assuming that the creek ive mentioned once ran into the lake just here that is before a snowslide filled up the ravine with debris and diverted the creek into the other gully the mouth of which isbelowthe beaverdam  you have explained how the water got here not how it got away said weston impatiently  no replied devine i havent explained either of them yet but well get on a little once and i dont think it was very long ago there was a little water with a creek flowing out of it in this hollow a colony of beavers came along and put up their dam across that creek and that backed the water up a foot or two if youd skirted this hollow youd have seen that its tolerably level and a foot rise would spread the water quite a way i want to say that it was probably a swamp with only grass on it when the creek ran through it well the beavers liked the place and piled up their dam while the water went farther and farther back across the swamp finally the beavers either died off or something drove them out it was probably after that that the dam broke down and the water ran off then the snowslide cut off the creek and as the hollow dried out the willows spread across it  weston could find no fault with this train of reasoning which made comparatively plain grenfells long and unsuccessful search  yes he admitted its logical and i think its correct i believe from what grenfell once said that he crossed the range to the east of us not far away some years ago with another man and he must have noticed this valley further i now feel reasonably sure that he and i once stood on the shoulder of the big peak in the southwest and looked right up the hollow he smiled rather grimly we naturally saw nothing we were looking for a lake that had dried out  he lay still for a minute or two and then broached the subject that both had held in abeyance  well he said whats to be done  stay here two days advised devine gather up a load of specimens and try to trace the vein then well put in our stakes and start right off for the settlement to record as many feet of frontage as the law will allow us after that you as holding the larger share will see what can be done about handing it over to a company while i come back with provisions and get the assessment work put in youre going to have mighty little trouble about raising the money when people see those specimens  he broke off for a moment and glanced back toward the willows  in a way he added its rough on grenfell  ah said weston quietly neither you nor i can be sure of that  after that there was silence and it seemed to both of them that the shadows crept in closer about their flickering fire and that the little wind which sighed among the pinetops had grown colder the camp seemed strangely empty and glancing around from force of habit once or twice they realized with a little start that there was now no third figure sitting beside the blaze the man who had made that weary march with them had taken the unmarked trail  it was two days later when they started south reaching a little desolate settlement in due time without misadventure they limped into it ragged and dusty leading the packhorse which was very lame they stopped outside a little wooden store which had a kind of rude veranda in front of it where the loungers sat on hot afternoons and a man in a white shirt and store trousers came out and leaned on the railing he had a hard face and it grew a trifle more grim as he looked at them for the light had not quite gone although it was late in the evening  wheres grenfell he asked  dead said weston  the man made a gesture of resignation he had acquired his money with some difficulty and there was no great trade in that neighborhood while it not infrequently happened that his customers failed to pay him when the government became economical and voted no money for the making of roads which is the small bush ranchers chief source of support  well he said im sorry youre broke  they certainly looked it and for a moment weston said nothing he was aware that there was a spice of cruelty in this but he was curious to see what the man would do it became evident that he could at least face an unpleasant situation with equanimity  anyway he said you can come right in and ill get you some supper you can put the horse in musgraves stable yonder  then while devine laughed softly weston strode up to the veranda and thrust a heavy bag into the storekeepers hand  get a light he said and look at them  it was ten minutes later when they sat around a little table in the back store which smelt unpleasantly of salt pork and coffee a big kerosene lamp hung above their heads and the storekeeper gazed with almost incredulous eyes at the litter of broken stones in front of him  oh yes he said its highgrade milling ore youll say nothing to the boys and get your record in tomorrow then whats your program  ill go on to vancouver and see about getting a wellknown mining man to go up and certify my statements said weston then ill try to raise sufficient money to make a start with i ought to get it there or in victoria  no said the storekeeper you go on to montreal theyve more money yonder and its good policy to strike for the place youre likely to get the most  one understands that its difficult for the little man who has a claim to sell to get much for it anywhere said weston with a smile  the storekeeper straightened himself resolutely in his chair  thats a cold fact but in this case it has to be done i got my money hard in proof of it he held up one hand from which three fingers were missing that was the result of working sixteen hours right off in a onehorse sawmill we had one light above the bench and when i was too played out to see quite what i was doing i got my hand drawn in i made the rest of my pileits a mighty little onemuch the same way and now im holding tight to what is mine i provided your outfit for crazy as it seemed i believed grenfells tale and i figured that you were straight men but i know what generally happens when the little man goes around the city with a mine to sell  he brought his hand down upon the table with a bang  youre going right into montrealill find the moneyand youll stand off just as long as it seems advisable for the biggest figure when this things floated were going to get our share  weston who sat on a packingcase because there was only one chair glanced around the store its walls were of undressed pine logs and it was roofed with cedar shingles handsplit there were a few dozen bags of somebodys early riser flour standing upon what appeared to be kegs of nails and across the room odd cases of canned goods lumps of salt pork and a few bags of sugar apparently had been flung together any way building and stock were of the crudest description and there was certainly nothing about either that suggested any degree of prosperity then he glanced at his companions the storekeeper dressed in shirt and trousers of a kind that no fastidious man would think of wearing and devine who had wornout boots and was suggestively ragged and lean they did not look the kind of men who were likely to pit themselves successfully against opulent financiers and stockjobbers in montreal but something in their grim faces suggested that at least they meant to fight  well he said ill start tomorrow and do what i can its quite likely that before we put the thing through well have trouble     chapter xxiv  a qualified success   ida stirling was sitting by an open window of a very artisticallyfurnished room with an english newspaper lying on the little table beside her and the colonist which is published in british columbia on her knee she fancied from the writing on the wrapper that arabella kinnaird had sent her the former and there was a paragraph in it which had interested her more than a little  trouble it seemed had broken out up a muddy african river and a white officer lying sick of fever at the time had forthwith set off for the scene of it with a handful of halfdrilled black soldiery they had vanished into the steamy bush and for several weeks nothing had been heard of them then when those acquainted with the country had decided that the little detachment had probably been cut off to a man half of them had unexpectedly appeared again they now carried their leader in a hammock as he had been wounded by several pieces of castiron fired out of a gaspipe gun but they also brought back the dusky gentlemen who had been responsible for the abortive rising gregory kinnaird had it transpired blundered into a couple of ambushes but that and the fact that he had marched straight through them did not astonish ida who was more or less acquainted with his character he was the paper stated recovering from his injuries though it judiciously refrained from mentioning whether the authorities applauded or censured him  it was not an uncommon story in connection with the country in question but it sent a little thrill through the girl as she read it the rising from the sickbed and the blundering into the ambuscades were so characteristic of the man he had recognized what was expected of him and had immediately set about doing it without any consideration for his safety or indeed for that of his men gregory kinnaird was not a man of marked ability but he was at least one who could be relied on to attempt the carrying out of a duty he had undertaken at any cost to himself and this is after all a good deal to say in the favor of any man  ida had thought of him with a certain tenderness during the last halfhour she liked these simple downright men and fancied that the absence of ostentation which usually characterized them was essentially english though she had certainly met a few in that country who came under quite a different category they were continually posing men who could not afford to be natural lest they should give themselves away though she liked him gregory kinnaird had however passed out of her life there was a good deal he could have offered her but after all she had almost as much already in canada and it had become suddenly clear to her outside of a london ballroom one evening that to like the man one would have to live with was by no means going far enough she also admitted that she could have gone considerably further in the case of the man on whose account she had been somewhat anxiously turning over the colonist which she had done regularly during the last few weeks without she fancied her father who purchased a good many provincial papers becoming aware of it  there was however once more nothing whatever in it about the adventures of any prospectors though the paper in question now and then detailed such things at length and she laid it down with a little sigh of weariness for two men in one of whom she was interested had gone up into the wilderness some time earlier and nothing apparently had been heard of them since gregory kinnaird had it seemed won credit as well as blame serving the empire under arms in steamy africa but it was she felt a sterner and longer fight the men who were up against itand she liked the expressive phrasemade with savage nature in the west  after all the rush on a rebel stockade was soon over while it seemed to her that the march through the black pine forest halffed with provisions running out the sleeping in dripping fern or slushy snow and the staggering along the rangeside under a crushing load for days together with galled feet and shoulders that bled beneath the packstraps was a much more difficult matter weston her camp attendant had done all these things and as very frequently happened had so far gained nothing by them she was glad that he had done them for the pride of a colonizing people was strong in her but after all that was not why she loved him indeed it was rather hard to find a reason for the latter fact the only thing that mattered was that she admitted it and now she was wondering with an almost torturing anxiety whether there would be any news of him in the next issue of the colonist  laying aside the paper she looked out on the city which stretched away before her with its roofs and spires and towers clear in the evening light toward the great gleaming river but fair as the prospect was her thoughts sped back to the shadowy forests and towering ranges of the pacific slope as they did so her eyes grew curiously soft for when she had last looked upon those snowbarred heights the camppacker had been at her side then she turned with a sudden start and a swift rush of blood to her face as a maid announced mr weston  it was however a moment or two before the man came in and she was then mistress of herself and it was reassuring to know that if there was anything dramatic in his appearance at that particular time he was evidently unaware of it in fact he entered the room as though he had left it just on the previous day and taking her hand merely held it for perhaps a second longer than was absolutely necessary then he sat down and inquired after her health and stirlings at which ida who could not help it laughed she did not like effusiveness but this conventional formality seemed to her singularly out of place until she remembered that she had once or twice already found the matteroffact quietness with which the man made his appearance and went away again almost disconcerting if this had been the result of affectation it would have been provocative but as ida was aware it seldom occurred to the man that anybody else was greatly interested in his doings she felt however that he might have made an exception of her  where have you come from now she asked  weston named a hotel of repute in that city and though this was not the information ida had desired she favored him unobserved with a glance of careful scrutiny he was attired for once like a prosperous man in garments that became him and as she had noticed already he possessed the knack of wearing anything just as it should be worn which as far as her observation went was the particular characteristic of some englishmen  then you are not at lemoines this time  no said weston with a whimsical twinkle in his eyes you see we have at last succeeded in finding the mine  ida started she regretted this but she was human and she knew that the man loved her it seemed only reasonable to expect that he would proceed to make that fact clear to her now that he had found the mine but she was a little puzzled about his smile it indicated rather too much selfpossession for a man on the verge of a proposal and she did not know that since he entered the house he had been endeavoring to impose a due restraint upon himself  oh she said hastily im very glad you found the mine  no replied weston gravely grenfell found it  where is he have you brought him with you  i havent said weston and she noticed the sudden dropping of his voice grenfells dead hewent onthe night before we struck the lode up there in the bush  before you struck the lode but you said he found it  yes admitted weston quietly i think he did  he told her the story in a few forceful words and when he had finished her eyes grew a trifle hazy she had sympathy and intuition and the thought of the wornout man lying still forever beside the gold he so long had sought affected her curiously weston who felt his heart throb painfully fast as he watched her nodded  yes he said it was rather pitiful and there was a certain ghastly irony in the situation but after all as he once admitted there was very little that gold could have given him  ida sat silent a moment or two she was sorry for grenfell but he had as his comrade said gone on and she was more concerned about the results of his discovery to those who were left behind  the lode weston added is all that he described it  it cost ida an effort to sit perfectly calm while she waited for his next observation it was as she recognized only his stubborn british pride which had prevented him from declaring what he felt for her earlier and now the obstacle that had counted for most with him had suddenly been removed as it happened however he said absolutely nothing  then you and devine and that storekeeper are prosperous men she asked  weston laughed in a rather curious fashion and when he spoke it was as if he felt that an explanation of his attitude were due from him  no he said not yet in fact so far were nothing more than three remarkably rash adventurerslittle men of no accountwho have set ourselves up against the big professional company jobbers we have won the first round but that was fought with nature its comparatively easy to face weariness and wet and frost when one is used to it but to fence with the money handler is quite a different matter to cry our wares in the market is a thing to which were wholly new  he had said all that was required to make the situation reasonably clear to a girl of her understanding the battle was less than half won and it seemed that he would not claim her unless he came out victor which was in some respects as she would have it though she now and then chafed at it she loved the mans pride and what he could win by force she would not have him purchase with the money that she could give him she fancied however that if she chose to exert her strength she could sweep away all the resolutions he had formed and she made a little of her power felt as she turned and looked at him  you feel that you must fight this thing out with such weapons as you have she asked i suppose you wouldnt allow your friends to provide you with more efficient ones i know i have suggested as much already and you would not listen but it would make success so much easier  it was not remarkably explicit but weston to some extent at least understood what she had implied and he gazed at her with a curious kindling in his eyes she leaned forward in her chair wonderfully alluring with a suggestive softness in her face and he felt his resolution deserting him it was clear to the girl who watched every change of his expression that the issue of the moment was in her hands and had he told her that the rest of the struggle he was engaged in would be fought out in the snowbound ranges where men not infrequently died she would have exerted all her strength as it was however and because of her pride in him she suddenly determined that she would let him win his spurs though it was beyond defining there was a subtle change in her manner when she leaned back in her chair  i think said weston the first course you mentioned is the only one open to me  the words did not cost him as great an effort as they would have a moment or two earlier he felt that in the meanwhile something had snapped and the tension had suddenly slackened this was a vast relief to him and he had recovered a good deal of his composure when the girl spoke again  still she said you evidently have no great liking for the marketplace  im afraid i havent admitted weston with a little laugh after all when one has seen how some of these mining syndicates and mortgage companies get in their work a certain prejudice against such things isnt quite unnatural  ah said ida who had now decided that the conversation must be kept within safe limits you dont however mind using the shovel  weston was quite ready to follow the lead she had given him  what are we to do when we come out here he asked with an air of whimsical reflection half of us have no professions and we havent a trade they bring us up to take life easily and then when some accident pitches us out into the colonies its rather a shock to discover that nobody seems to have any use for us as a matter of fact i dont blame your sawmill bosses your railroad men and your ranchers considering that it takes several years to learn how to chop a tree and that to keep pace with an average construction gang is a liberal education  ida laughed the further they got away from the crisis now the better she would be pleased  i fancy theres still a notion in the old country that the wellbroughtup young englishman excels at anything he cares to undertake even if its only manual labor she said  oh yes laughed weston ive heard it let them keep such notions over yonder if it pleases them one naturally likes to think were as good as the rest and perhaps were warranted but it seems to me that the man of equal muscle raised to swing the ax and shovel is going to beat the one whos new to it every time  but the pride of caste said ida doesnt that count doesnt success even at such things as tracklaying or chopping trees depend on moral as well as physical strength  i think with most of us courage is largely a matter of experience said weston we learn to know what cant hurt us and to avoid the things that can as to the other kind the man who hazards his life and limbs in halfpropped wildcat adits or running logs down the rapids is hardly likely to be less cool in a tight place than the one who has never been accustomed to anything of the kind  he was evidently expatiating on this subject merely because he felt that it was safe ground but ida who partly agreed with what he said felt that after all there was probably something in the insular english notion that he was too proud to uphold this man at least possessed a courage that made him willing to carry the fight into the marketplace with wholly unaccustomed weapons and a pride that impelled him to lay a stern restraint upon his passion she fancied that there were men in canada who would not have been deterred by her money had they wished to marry her and for that matter one or two in england had delicately permitted the fact to become apparent in the meanwhile she had decided that he should have his wish it would perhaps be possible to offer support in some shape later on if it became apparent that he was badly beaten  i suppose it is not a very easy matter to dispose of an undeveloped mine she inquired  weston smiled rather dryly  it can be done without much trouble if youre content to give the thing away but its rather different if you wish to sell it in fact until the last week id no idea how hard the latter was  then you have been here a week  there was a hint of reproach in her tone and weston who understood her to mean that she was a little astonished that he had not presented himself earlier realized that here was an opportunity that he might have profited by had he only succeeded in selling the mine as it was he let it pass for he felt that if once he let himself go he would probably say a good deal more than was advisable  yes he said with a laugh still at the rate im progressing several months will hardly see me through  ida had formed a reasonably accurate notion of what was in his mind and she was half vexed with him and half pleased he was at least consistent and meant to persist in the attitude he had adopted but it was significant that he evidently was afraid to venture an inch outside his defenses after all she decided that it was probably advisable that he should remain behind them in the meanwhile it was however more or less of a relief to her when her father came in he did not appear in the least astonished to see weston and shook hands with him as though it were the most natural thing to find him sitting there  business in this city he asked  yes said weston ive been endeavoring to sell a mine  then you struck the lode  ive been abusing miss stirlings goodnature with an account of how we did it  stirling made a little gesture that might have meant anything but ida was pleased with the fact that he expressed no astonishment it seemed to her that he had expected weston to succeed and she knew that he was very seldom wrong in his estimate of any mans character she made some excuse and left them together and when the door closed behind her stirling turned to weston  if youll come along to my room ill give you a cigar he said then if you feel like it you can tell me about the thing     chapter xxv  stirling gives advice   the contractor lay back in an easychair when he had lighted a cigar and watched weston who glanced with evident interest around the room its furniture consisted of very little besides a rolltop desk and a couple of chairs but the walls were hung with drawings of machines and largescale maps which had projected railroad routes traced across them an englishman as a rule endeavors with a success which varies in accordance with his temperament to leave his business behind him when he goes home but across the atlantic the man of affairs usually thinks and talks of nothing else as one result of this he has very little time to discuss the concerns of other people which is apt to become a habit of those who have very few of their own stirling was however for private reasons willing to make an exception of weston in this respect and when he noticed how the latters eyes rested on two or three models of machines which stood on a shelf near him he took down one of them  i bought up the patent rights of that thing he said as you see its a power excavator and while it works all right in loose stuff and gravel the two i have on the mule deer road have been giving me trouble  weston who was deeply interested laid the machine on his knee and spun it round once or twice  the elevator buckets are the weak point he said they wont deliver stiff wet spoil freely  stirlings nod was very expressive in that it suggested that he had expected his companion to locate the cause of trouble  youve hit it he said and opening the desk took out a little model of an excavator bucket beautifully made in burnished copper and another one more rudely fashioned out of bent card he handed weston the former  thats a rather famous mans idea he added with a little dry smile i had to leave the thing to my secretary when i was west ive tried it on the mule deer road and im not quite satisfied the others one that ive been thinking over  weston looked at both the models and then taking up the card one unfolded it and after paring part of it away with his knife bent it into a slightly different shape  i think that should meet the purpose i once worked under the engineer of a very similar machine for a month or two he said  stirling picked up the model and examined it carefully before he replaced it in the rolltop desk which he shut with a snap  do you feel like taking a hundred dollars for the notion he asked  id rather make you a present of it said weston quietly  well laughed stirling ill take it my secretary paid the other man a good deal more than that for the copper one and it wont do quite what is wanted if that man had run an excavator in the mud and rain i guess hed have made it different he sits tight in a smart office and tries to remember what they taught him twenty years ago in the erecting shop  it seemed to weston that there was a good deal to be said for this point of view though it was a matter which did not concern him his companions manner was friendly and to some extent familiar but weston had already had an uneasy feeling in his presence that he was being carefully weighed or measured by an astonishingly accurate standard his only defense he decided was to be perfectly natural and in this he was judicious as the assumption of any knowledge or qualities he did not possess would in all probability have been promptly detected he said nothing which is a very excellent rule when one does not know what to say and stirling changed the subject when he spoke again  so you have found the mine and come here to sell it he observed i guess you have had the usual experience  i dont quite know what is usual said weston with a smile still ive been round this city with a bag of what people admit are rather promising specimens of milling ore and i certainly havent succeeded in selling the mine yet  the trouble is that the specimens might have been obtained from anywhere said stirling dryly  theres one concern anyway in whose case the objection does not apply i got a telegram from my partner the storekeeper to the effect that the hogarth combine had sent up van staten from vancouver to inspect the lode i gather that one of the boys spotted him though he meant to do it quietly the fact that he didnt announce his name is rather suggestive you can read the message  he took it from his pocket and handed it to stirling who wrinkled his brows  well he observed what van staten says goes very few of the big concerns would hesitate to purchase when he was satisfied with the thing that storekeeper seems quite a smart man the hogarth people have no doubt made you an offer since then  four thousand dollars all rights and theyll meet expenses while i put in the assessment work and do all thats necessary to get title from the crown they were kind enough to say that it was rather a hazardous venture but they wanted another workable reef to round up their mineral properties the reason seemed a little vague  stirling smiled rather grimly they want everything they can get their hands on in the shape of a mineral property as long as it costs them most nothing what did you tell them  that theyd have to go up six times anyway before i considered the thing and then id want half payment in ordinary stock they asked if i meant to stick to that and i said i did  then asserted stirling youre going to have some trouble in keeping that mine the hogarth people have frozen out more than one little man who didnt want to part with his property theyre said to be quite smart at it and there are various ways of getting hold of you  he studied westons face and saw it harden which as a matter of fact rather pleased him the stubbornness which had sent this young man back up the range aching in every limb with one boot full of bloodand stirling had heard that storywas now it seemed impelling him into a struggle with a group of remarkably clever and powerful mining financiers the successful contractor appreciated ability especially when it was of the practical order but perhaps he was right in rating character higher  yes said weston quietly i quite expect that will be the case  have you had any other offer  wannop made me a conditional one pending investigation he talks of floating a company here or in london after the success of the hazleton and long divide concern he says theyre disposed to regard british columbian ventures favorably yonder if it goes through id have to take most of the vendors payment in shares which im quite ready to do thats a rough sketch of the scheme sir but in the meanwhile its only tentative  stirling perused the paper handed him with close attention and before he answered he lighted another cigar  wannops straight but he and his friends are little men he said at length youd have the hogarth combine right on to you in london one or two of their subsidiary concerns are registered there now i dont know whether they really want your mine but supposing they do and you wont sell out to them i guess you have some idea of what their game would be  im afraid i havent sir  well said stirling youll be fortunate if you get half your authorized capital applied for and it would be quite an easy thing for the hogarth people to send somebody on to the market to sell your stock down that would freeze off any other investors from coming in and scare those who had applied for stock into selling you cant put up a crushing and reducing plant without a pile of money and dams and flumes for waterpower would cost most as much but youd have to have them for you could never pack your ore out to a smelter through the kind of country you have described to me now unless you could get money enough to start clear with the concern is bound to cave in then somebody acting for the combine would quietly buy it up  he broke off for a moment and looked hard at weston  suppose those people let you feel their hand and then make you a rather higher offer what are you going to do  disregard it said weston quietly  stirling nodded in a manner which suggested that this was what he had expected  well he said i guess thats the course most likely to appeal to a man constituted as you seem to be but the question is are you tough enough to see it through its one that may cost you a good deal  i dont know said weston i can only find out by trying  it appeared from his companions manner that the answer pleased him  now he said are you open to take advice or help from me  weston met his gaze which was now unpleasantly steady  advice sir he answered im afraid i couldnt take help  from me said stirling dryly with an emphasis on the last word which brought the blood to westons cheek well you can come for the advice on any matter of detail when you feel like it in a general way i can only throw out one suggestion now and its at variance with the views you seem to hold go over to the hogarth people and make the most reasonable terms you can with them  thats what you would do in my place weston asked with a twinkle in his eyes  ive been a blame fool once or twice in my time stirling admitted its curious that it didnt cost me quite as much as most people expected still what ive given you is excellent advice  he waved his hand as though to indicate that he had closed the subject but when weston took his departure half an hour later the contractor looked remarkably thoughtful  if he werent up against the hogarth combine he and wannop might put that scheme through he mused as it is i guess one way or another ive got to help him out  then he rose and descended to the room where his daughter was  ive had an interesting talk with mr weston he said indifferently thats quite a smart young man but i guess one could call him a little obstinate  ida smiled at this though she suspected her fathers observation was not quite as casual as it seemed  yes she said in some respects i think he is but how has he made that clear to you  stirling sitting down opposite her laughed  hes had an offer for his mine that most of the bush prospectors would have jumped at and if hed played his cards judiciously the people who made it would no doubt have doubled it i suggested that course to him but it wasnt any use mr weston is one of the men who cant make a compromise  isnt that a reasonable attitude he presumably wants his rights  the little man observed stirling has no rights that he isnt prepared to hold on to in a rather uneven fight with weston its all or nothing and just now i dont quite know which hell get he and his partners will have to stake everything they own on a very uncertain game  hasnt everybody who goes into business speculations to do that now and then  no said stirling reflectively i dont think they have quite often the people who deal with them have to face part of the hazard in a general way theyve something to fall back on if theyre men of position the money theyve settled on their wives a name that would get them credit on the market or friends whod give them a lift if they came down with a bang now that young man has nothing if he fails he wont have a dollar to get out of this city with for the mine wont count he cant even hold it unless he puts in his assessment work on it and he couldnt do that without something to live on in the meanwhile he hasnt a friend in canada from whom he could borrow a dollar  ida said nothing and stirling added as if in explanation  i might be willing to give him a lift if it were absolutely necessary but it seems that hes quite determined not to take a favor from me he didnt offer me any reason for adopting that attitude  he looked at the girl rather curiously and she noticed the significance of his last sentence stirling had not said that he was unacquainted with westons reason but he seemed to be waiting for her to make a suggestion and she found the situation embarrassing  well she said he probably has one that seems sufficient to him  stirling said nothing further on the subject and presently went out and left her but her expression changed when he had done so and she sat very still with one hand tightly closed for she now realized what the cost of her lovers defeat might be in his case it would not mean a grapple with temporary difficulties or a curtailing of unnecessary luxuries but disaster complete and irretrievable perhaps for years if he failed he would vanish out of her life and it was becoming rapidly clear that however hard pressed he might be there was after all no way in which she could help him the unyielding pride or stubbornness which animated him at length appeared an almost hateful thing  ida did not sleep particularly well that night and when she went down to breakfast rather late the next morning there was a letter beside her plate she looked up at her father when she had opened it  susan frisingham is coming here from toronto for a day or two before she goes back to new york she said she suggests taking me back with her  ah said stirling with a barely perceptible trace of dryness you dont want to go just now  ida flashed another glance at him and noticed the faint twinkle in his eyes she felt almost disconcerted for it suggested comprehension and she certainly did not want to go she could it seemed do nothing to help the man she loved and for that matter she could scarcely encourage or sympathize with him openly but she would not seek pleasure elsewhere while he fought out the unequal struggle alone  no she said i should much rather stay here  as you like said stirling who shortly afterward departed for the city  mrs frisingham was a rich widow and a distant connection of stirlings she arrived that day and on the following day contrived to spend a few minutes alone with stirling when he came home from business  i wanted to take ida back with me and im a little astonished that she wont hear of it she said  in that case im afraid the notion cant be carried out said stirling  isnt it rather a pity suggested the lady  stirling seemed to consider this the two were old friends in spite of the fact that mrs frisingham who now and then spent a few weeks in montreal had made several determined attempts to regulate the contractors domestic affairs she described him to her friends as pigheaded and added that if it had not been for his daughter she would have given up all idea of making him listen to reason stirling on his part said that she no doubt had excellent intentions but so had a good many people who contrived to make a considerable amount of unnecessary trouble  i wonder why you want her at new york he asked  he had as his companion was aware a somewhat unpleasant habit of going straight to the point but on this occasion she was disposed to meet him  do you mind telling me what you mean to do with the girl  no said stirling i want to keep her with me just as long as shes willing to stay but i suppose i can stand it if she marries somebody by and by  that said the lady is just the point you would naturally prefer him to be an eligible person now if you let me have her for a while i could promise that she would meet nobody who didnt answer that description  stirling laughed he had suspected her intention all along and surmised that her offer was prompted partly by goodnature and partly by a recognition of the fact that the presence of a young woman of considerable wealth who was beautiful as well as otherwise gifted would increase the popularity of the receptions over which she was fond of presiding  im not quite sure her views and yours would coincide he said anyway she has been in new york beforeand in england for that matter  mrs frisingham adroitly shifted her point of attack and it almost appeared though stirling could not tell how that she had heard of the camppacker  dont you think theres a certain danger of her going through the wood and choosing the crooked stick after all she asked  stirling smiled i dont know that you could call new york or london a wood a hothouse would be nearer it he said with an air of reflection still to fall in with the simile there are no doubt plenty of sticks in both places just as there are right here in this city in fact and his eyes twinkled suspiciously im not quite sure that isnt an excellent name for them quite a few are nicely varnished and in a general way theyve hallmarked gold or silver tops the hallmark however guarantees only the trimmings and from one or two specimens that ive come across ive a suspicion that in some cases the timbers rotten when you choose a stick you want a sound oneone that you can lean on when you face a hill and i guess thats a thing my girl will have to do now and then  his tone had grown a trifle graver as he went on but his companion waited feeling that he had a little more to say and that he might offer her a hint of some kind as in fact he presently did  the sound sticks dont grow in stovewarmed houses but out in the wind and sun he said  that was sufficient for mrs frisingham who had rather more than a suspicion that stirling already had in his mind somebody who had not been bred in the city an unknown man who built new railroad bridges in the wilderness or a bush rancher it seemed most probable  well she said i might perhaps warn you that the right choice is a rather serious matter and that after all its wiser to consider the opinionscall them prejudices if you likeof your own order  when my daughter chooses said the contractor smiling shell choose wisely and im going to be satisfied ive had the pleasure of reassuring another lady on that point already as to the other matter the opinions of people of the station to which i now belong dont count for much with me for quite a long while they were dead against my getting here at all but i did work that this country wanted done and im where i am you dont expect me to alter my views out of deference to them  he broke off for a moment and nodded to her pleasantly as he went on again  were old friends susan and i guess you mean to be kind but ive been warned before and it didnt affect me much he said if ida wants to go back with you she may but well leave it at that  he turned away and strolling into his own room he took out the card model of the excavator bucket which weston had altered and examined it critically  yes he said it will do its work i guess thats characteristic of the man     chapter xxvi  the jumpers   saunders the storekeeper lay outside the little tent with the pungent pinewood smoke drifting past him and his feet toward the fire while dusk crept up the range and a wonderful stillness settled down upon the lonely valley his hands were badly blistered and he was aching in every limb while some of his knuckles had the flesh torn off them for devine had brought a heavy hammer down on them several times that day instead of on the drill for all that he lay beside the fire in the drowsy state of physical content which is not infrequently experienced by those who have just enjoyed an ample meal after a long day of strenuous labor in the open air however as saunders had reasons for believing that the result of the latter would in due time prove to be eminently satisfactory the sensation was in his case perhaps a little more pronounced than usual  he was not more than healthfully weary and there was an exhilarating quality in the sweet cool air which was heavy with the smell of the firs while the wonderful green transparency generally to be seen after sunset among the mountains of that land still glimmered behind the peaks on one side of the valley the rest of the hollow was wrapped in creeping shadow against which the nearest pines stood out in dusky ranks saunders raised himself on one elbow and gazed at them reflectively before he turned to devine who was sitting near him they had been hard at work on the mineral claims of the grenfell consolidated for the last few days  this camping in the woods would be quite nice if one could prowl round with the rifle instead of pounding the drill he said and then paused to glance ruefully at one of his battered hands anyway i dont know that i shouldnt just as soon do that as to hold it  sorry said devine still youve done some shooting we brought up a box of cartridges and now we havent one what you want is a singleshot rifle or a deer that will stand still  saunders turned and pointed to the dismembered carcass that hung from a fir branch close at hand  i got that one on the run and there was a time when id have had one for every catridge instead of plugging marlin bullets into trees it was a sport i was meant for he paused and sighed ive had to be a sawmill hand and a storekeeper  devine grinned at this  well he said youve raked more money out of pork and sugar than i have out of surveying for that matter youve got most of mine and youre better off than i am because the stores still running  oh yes said his companion with a sardonic smile its being run by jim from okanagan and hell have the boys round in the back store evenings sampling cheese and eating crackers while they help him theyre kind of curious insects and its a blame pity i never remembered to put those vancouver invoices where they wouldnt lay hands on them for therell sure be trouble when i get back again you have got to strike people for full prices when they dont always meet their bills anyway the man who spreads himself out on jobs that dont strictly belong to him is bound to find it cost him something  it was significant that he spoke of going back but both he and devine admitted that possibility the mine was theirs and they certainly meant to keep it if they could though they recognized that this might be difficult as a matter of fact a reef or lode mine is of almost as much immediate use to a poor man as a sewingmachine would be to a naked savage he cannot get out the ore without sinking a shaft or driving an adit which in the general way means the hiring of labor and the purchase of costly machines then when that is done he must put up a stampmill and reducing plant or arrange for transport by packhorse to somebody who has one which is a very expensive matter in a mountainous land where roads have still to be cut as the result of this he must in the first place go round and beg the assistance of men with money to spare and the latter as a rule insist on his handing over the mine before parting with any of their money there are also means of putting pressure on the reluctant seller and the usual code of morals does not seem to be considered as strictly applicable to a mining deal  well said devine at length we have still a good deal of drilling to do and unless youre smarter with the hammer than i am well want new hands before were through  we hold three claims and that means quite a lot of assessment work for you and me to put in saunders said besides youll have to go down and straighten up things with the gold commissioner  devine made a sign of concurrence when he had staked off the claims with weston he had been more concerned about tracing the lode than anything else and it had not occurred to him that they might be contested as it certainly should have done as the result of this he had neglected one or two usual precautions and when he filed his record he had not been as exact as was advisable in supplying bearings that would fix the precise limits of the holdings  yes he said now that ive made a second survey ill take the back trail in a day or two the stakes are planted just where they should be but the description i gave the commissioner wasnt quite as precise as i should have made it and as the thing stands im not sure wed have much to go upon if anybody pulled up our stakes and swung our claim a little off the lode anyway i dont quite see why the commissioner shouldnt pass my survey to count for assessment work  the firelight fell on saunders face and he looked thoughtful though the thing is by no means common claims have been jumped in that countrythat is occupied by men who surreptitiously or forcibly oust the rightful owner on the ground that he has not done the work required by law or has been inaccurate in his record  i guess youd better go down tomorrow when the boys come up he said its a fact that van staten went over to cedar to see the gold commissioner and from what one of the boys told me he had quite a long talk with him van statens straight but it would be part of his duty to examine our record and mention it to the people who sent him up to investigate he paused and spread out his hands i wouldnt stake my last dollar on the honesty of any of them  the boys would start when they got the news you sent them said devine  saunders smiled ruefully he felt reasonably certain that every man in the settlement would abandon his occupation when he heard the message they had sent by an indian they met on the trail soon after they started saunders it must be admitted had not sent it until devine insisted on his doing so for as he shrewdly said there was not a great deal of the lode that could be economically worked available and he wanted to make quite sure that the grenfell properties were on the richest of it while the boys would be better employed working on their ranches and buying things from him than worrying over profitless claims he added that if the latter broke them he would in all probability never recover what they owed him  theyll be here sure bringing as much of my pork and flour as they can pack along he said its quite likely jim wont have raised thirty dollars among the crowd of them  well said devine if im to take the trail tomorrow im going right under my blanket now  he rolled it round him and lay down on a pile of spruce twigs outside the tent the dew was rather heavy but he was young and strong and it is a luxury to sleep in the open in that elixirlike mountain air he went to sleep at once and it was evidently early morning when saunders awakened him for the moon which had not cleared the eastern peaks when he lay down was now high in the heavens he sprang to his feet and stood a moment or two shivering a little as he looked about him it was very cold and the little open space where the tent stood was flooded with silvery light though here and there the shadows of the firs fell athwart it black as ink and sharp as a fretwork cut in ebony then he saw saunders close beside him fumbling with the magazine of his repeatingrifle  not a blame catridge left youd better take the ax along he said  the ax queried devine who was a little startled as well as puzzled  saunders pointed to the shadowy bush  sure he said its jumpers  that was enough for devine he flashed a glance at his companion saunders possessed the hucksters heart and took pleasure in selling indifferent pork and thirdgrade flour at the highest prices he could possibly extort the clink of the dollar was music to him but it was perfectly clear that he could hold his own on occasion with a very tenacious hand the man was resolutely quiet and evidently quite ready to meet the jumpers with an empty rifle  for the next few moments devine stood listening with strained attention at first he could hear nothing except a little breeze that sighed among the tops of the firs but by and by he became sensible of a stealthy rustling somewhere in the shadows then a branch snapped with a sharp distinctness that set his heart beating a good deal faster than was comfortable making a sign to saunders he strode back to the tent and picked up the ax  after that they set out together down the little trail that led past the willows to the lode slipping as silently as possible through the shadows though now and then a stone clinked beneath their feet or a stick or twig snapped as they passed with a sound that seemed startlingly loud nobody however seemed to hear them and at last they sank down amidst a brake of tall fern near a little neatlysquared stake which had been driven into the soil the brake was in black shadow but a broad patch of moonlight fell on the green carpet of wineberries a yard or two away the rustling had ceased and they could hear nothing for several anxious minutes then it commenced again a man floundering through that kind of bush makes considerable noise even when it is daylight and he can see where he is going then one of the jumpers who apparently had fallen into a clump of thorns broke out into halfsmothered expletives and there was a soft laugh evidently from a comrade  looking for the stake said saunders with a rather grim chuckle they mean to put the work through before they come round to call on us as far as i can figure there cant be more than four of them  that appeared to devine quite enough but he recognized the necessity for a determined opposition he knew that he had framed his record before the gold commissioner and that it would not be difficult for the men who pulled up that stake to swing his claim a little off the richest of the lead this would give them an opportunity for staking off a good deal of the strip he meant to hold and once they took possession it would be a case of proving them wrong and when it came to testimony they were two to one he felt sincerely sorry that saunders had not sent the boys word of his discovery a little earlier  in the meanwhile the rustling had ceased once more and devine felt the silence react upon his nerves what the strangers were doing he could not tell but he fancied that they must be consulting together somewhere among the trees he felt that it would be a vast relief if he could only see them and he glanced around at saunders the latter crouched among the dewy fern impassively still a blurred shadowy object with the rifle across his knees  then the crackling of undergrowth commenced again and devine fancied that he could distinguish the movements of four men he heard the fern rustle close behind him and saw that his companion had raised himself a trifle the latter appeared to be gazing into the bush and looking around sharply the surveyor started as a figure materialized out of the gloom where the moonlight streamed down between the trees not far away the man stood amidst the silvery radiance and devine was relieved to notice that he had nothing in his hand then he turned partly around and his voice reached the pair who watched him  have you struck it yet he asked  an invisible man replied that he had not yet found whatever he was searching for and in another moment a sharp snapping suggested that a third stranger was floundering through the bush he came into sight close by the first and stopped  i cant strike that post he said the bush down that way is black as pitch guess ill have to look for a pineknot and get a light  theyd hear you chopping said the man who had appeared first the tents just back there among the firs we have got to have that post shifted before they know we are about  there was no doubt as to who it was that he referred to and devine saw saunders hitch himself forward a little  if id only three or four catridges he said half aloud  devine sympathized with him his comrade was a very indifferent shot but it would have been a relief to feel that they had something besides the ax to fall back on as a last resort firearms as he was aware are seldom made use of in a dispute in british columbia but for all that men have now and then been rather badly injured during an altercation over a mineral claim at close quarters a shovel or a big hammer is apt to prove an effective weapon  then and neither was afterward quite sure how it happened saunders lost his balance and fell forward amidst the fern he did not do it noiselessly and one of the two jumpers sprang backward a pace  somebody in that clump of fern he said and then apparently recovered a little from his alarm its that blame fool charley  there was no longer any possibility of concealment and saunders suddenly stood up in the moonlight which had crept close up to the brake a tall gaunt figure with the rifle glinting at his hip  its not he said laconically its going to be a funeral unless you light out of this  the men did not stop to consider but vanished on the instant and devine breaking into a little laugh from sheer relief fancied that they had jumped behind adjacent trees saunders who stood gazing into the shadows waved his hand  youll stop right where you are boys if youre wise he said therell sure be trouble if you come out again  the men did not come out but there was a smashing of undergrowth as two more came running up they were visible for a moment as they sprang out into the open space between the willows and the first of the firs and then apparently they saw saunders for they plunged back among the trees the storekeeper sank down behind the fern  its quite a good light and one of them might have a pistol he explained half aloud  devine considered this very probable and when there was no sign of their opponents during the next few minutes he once more became conscious that his heart was beating unpleasantly fast the jumpers apparently had vanished altogether but he fancied that they were considering some plan of attack by and by a voice came out of the shadows  theres the post close up against the fern it said  that remarked saunders dryly is going to put a hustle on to some of them  he was right for a moment later a man stepped out into the moonlight  put down your gun we want to talk he said  then replied saunders who did not stand up go ahead but youll stop in the light and if you feel like sending any of your partners to work a traverse round this bunch of fern you can remember that ive got the forehead plumb onyou  the mans gesture indicated that he understood the situation and though he had jumped for cover a little earlier as most men in his place would have done it was evident that he was a courageous rogue  i want to tell you that there are four of us and weve come up quite a way to shift that post for you he said theres no use making trouble for it has to be done  saunders touched his companions shoulder  chip in he said softly talk like a land agent trying to sell a ranch weve got to keep this crowd quiet the boys cant be far off  devine agreed with his last statement the moonlight was bright enough for one to travel by at least in the brûlée and he was sufficiently acquainted with western human nature to feel certain that every man in the settlement would have started when he heard of their discovery and what was more to the purpose would not waste a moment on the journey men going up to a new gold strike do not as a rule trouble themselves about want of sleep or weariness on the other hand he did not think they could possibly arrive before morning which meant that he must keep the jumpers talking for several hours it appeared very doubtful whether their patience or his conversational powers would hold out but he meant to do what he could  im not quite as sure that youre going to move that post as you seem to be and anyway i dont quite see why you want to do it he said you cant take possession of a duly recorded claim  the jumper laughed  your record wont hold you should have made it clearer given twopoint bearings or blazed your line on trees  why asked devine this post fixes the key boundary  trouble is that were going to move that post said the other man  he did not appear impatient and devine deduced two things from the fact that he was willing to discuss the matter one was that the jumper who evidently had not met the indian was unaware that the men from the settlement were then in all probability pushing on as fast as possible through the brûlée and the other that the man had no desire to proceed to extremities this was reassuring as far as it went but it must be admitted that the surveyor was afterward a little astonished at his collectedness and perspicacity  why dont you want to move all the posts he asked  we couldnt square that with your record was the candid answer moving one will swing you across instead of along the lead and will let in our new location im telling you this because youll probably be reasonable now that you understand the thing light out and dont make trouble and youll still hold quite a strip on the lead  give us a minute or two to think it over said devine  in the meanwhile youll stop just where you are saunders broke in  the man waved his hand as though he conceded that point and devine turned to his companion  ive only one excuse to make when i staked off the claims i was in a feverish hurry to prove the lead and get down and record he said now thats not an educated man but hes got the hang of this thing as clearly as a surveyor could have done its evident that the man who hired him has drilled it into him and what is more has warned him that hes to make no unnecessary trouble were to be bounced out of rather more than half our claim but its to be done as quietly as possible he explained the matter in the expectation that wed pull out and leave the field to them  youve hit it said saunders dont answer let him speak again weve got to gain time  they waited several minutes in tense anxiety for after all it was conceivable that diplomacy failing the jumper would adopt more forcible means then the man waved his hand  youve got to decide what youre going to do he said  devine proceeded to urge every reason he could think of and held him in play a little longer until finally the jumper lost his patience  oh he said you make me tired light out and be done with it were going to pull up that post  saunders thrust forward the rifle barrel so that the moonlight sparkled on it  then he said grimly come right along and shift it  instead of doing so the man jumped back into the shadow which was perhaps a very natural proceeding then there was oppressive silence for a few minutes devine who could not hear anything felt horribly anxious as to what their opponents might be doing suddenly there was a fresh rustling among the undergrowth and saunders thrust the rifle into his companions hands  crawling in at the back of us let them see you on the opposite side he said  devine wriggled through the fern and though he knew that this was rash stood up where the moonlight fell upon him with the long barrel glinting in front of him he fancied though he could not be certain that he saw a shadowy figure flit back among the trees and in any case the rustling died away again after that he crawled back to saunders for as he admitted afterward he did not like standing on the other side of that thicket alone  he subsequently repeated the maneuver several times and saunders once or twice answered the jumpers warnings with a sardonic invitation to remove the post neither of them afterward was sure how long the horrible tension lasted though they agreed that a very little more of it would probably have broken down their nerve but at length a faint sound came out of the shadows down the valley it rapidly grew louder and when it resolved itself into such a smashing of undergrowth as might have been made by a body of men saunders sprang up and waved his rifle toward where he supposed the jumpers to be  youd better git he said the boys from the settlement will head you off inside five minutes  there was no answer and it appeared that the jumpers had already departed as silently as possible a little later the men from the settlement came limping in and the foremost of them clustered round devine who sat just outside the fern while saunders whose face showed a trifle drawn in the moonlight stood still clutching the rifle  whats the matter youre not looking pert the pair of you said one of them  give me a cigar if youve got one said devine saunders will tell you about the thing ive done quite enough talking for one night  saunders told the story tersely and afterward snapped the magazine of his rifle up and down with a dramatic gesture  held them off with that and not a blame catridge in the thing he said     chapter xxvii  saunders takes precautions   the men from the settlement had been three weeks in camp saunders sat with his back to a big fir and a little hammer in his hand there was a pile of shattered quartz at one side of him and another smaller heap of fragments of the same material lying on an empty flourbag at his feet devine who had just announced that dinner was almost ready leaned against a neighboring fir looking on with a suggestive grin and a big gaunt oldtime prospector with a grim bronzed face was carefully poising one of the quartz lumps in a horny hand saunders who had been at work since daylight that morning had paid the latter six dollars for his services and admitted that he was highly satisfied with the result he was then engaged in manufacturing specimens  there was already a change in the forest surrounding the lonely camp the willows had been hewn down great firs lay in swaths with some of their mighty branches burnt and a track of ruin stretched back from saunders tent to the side of the range the grenfell consolidated mine three separate claims occupied what was supposed to be the richest of the land it was certainly the most accessible portion for payable milling ore was already being extracted from an open cut it was not the fault of saunders that the consolidated did not occupy the whole of it but the law allows each free miner only so many feet of frontage and the gold commissioner had shown himself proof against the surveyors reasoning that as grenfell had found the mine a fourth location should be recorded in the name of his executors a dead man as the commissioner pointed out could not record a mineral claim  the men from the settlement had however promptly staked off every remaining rod of ground along the lead and though the spot was remote from anywhere another band was busily engaged in an attempt to trace it back across the driedup lake how they had heard of it at all was not very evident but as the eagles gather round the carcass and the flies about the fallen deer so men with shovels and axes appear as by enchantment when gold is struck distance counts as nothing and neither thundering rivers nor waterless deserts can deter them  saunders listened with great contentment to the ringing of the axes and the sharp clink of the drills men who labor strenuously from dawn to dark in the invigorating mountain air consume provisions freely and as the storekeeper was quite aware those engaged on that lode would be compelled to purchase their pork and tea and flour from him  it was quite a smart idea to give jim a commission on the sales though i was kind of wondering if hed have the sense to stay where he is and run the store he said if he hasnt been fool enough to outfit the boys on credit he must have been raking in money  then he took up the lump of stone the prospector handed him and knocked most of it to pieces with the hammer after which he handed one or two of the fragments to devine who grinned more broadly  since weston wants more specimens i guess hes got to have them he explained i dont know any reason why we shouldnt send him the best we can this lot should assay out anyway several ounces to the ton  the prospector made a little grave sign of agreement for this was a game to which he was more or less accustomed lode ore now and then is of somewhat uniform quality but at times it varies in richness in a rather striking manner and the storekeeper had spent six or seven hours picking out the most promising specimens from these he had trimmed off every fragment in which as far as he could discern the precious metal was not present with the result that any mineralogist to whom they might be handed could certify to the richness of the grenfell consolidated saunders was a business man and quite aware that the vendor of any kind of goods when asked for samples does not as a rule submit indifferent ones  i guess he added probably referring to prospective investors this lot ought to fetch them you asked the boys to come along devine  devine said he had done so and in a few more minutes several little groups of men in dilapidated long boots and somewhat ragged duck who had ceased work for their midday meal gathered round the fir they waited mildly curious when saunders rose and made a sign that he required their attention which they were perhaps the more willing to give because they were all his customers and bills are apt to run up in a bush ranching community  boys said saunders i want to point out that instead of owning goldmines most of you would now be shoveling on the railroads or humping fir trees at the sawmills if it hadnt been for me  some of them laughed and some of them admitted that there was a certain truth in this for the bush rancher who buys uncleared land usually spends several years in very strenuous labor before it produces enough for him to live on and in the meanwhile he must either go away and endeavor to earn a few dollars every now and then or else fall into the hands of the nearest storekeeper  our friend is a philanthropist said one of them who spoke clean colloquial english we all admit his favors but he doesnt mention that he puts them in the bill  and he doesnt charge anything extra for insects in his flour said another man  there was a little laughter but saunders gazed at them reproachfully  if you think its easy making money out of the kind of crowd you are all you have to do is to start a store and see but that wasnt quite what i meant to say he explained anyway i put the whole of you right on to this lead  you were quite a long while doing it interjected one of the audience  saunders waved his hand  am i a blame fool he asked ive no use for an inquisitive grasping crowd worrying round my goldmine until ive got things securely fixed still you drove off those jumpers for which you have my thanks and i want in due time to get back the money most of you owe me  you can count on that boys said another of them its a dead sure thing  the storekeeper disregarded this  well he continued well get to the point of it its kind of easy finding a goldmine when youve a friend of my kind to put you on to it but its quite often a blame hard thing to keep it now youll have men from the cities wanting to buy you up offering you a few hundred dollars for the claims youve struck and if youre fools youll take it if not youll hold off until the grenfell consols go up on the market and then give us first call on buying the lot if we cant take the deal youll get six or eight times as much in vancouver as you would if you let go now  one of the men who had spoken broke in again  boys he said when saunders makes a proposition of that kind its because he sees how hes going to get something out of it but for all that i guess its sound advice hes giving you  there was a little consultation among the men and then one of them asked a question that evidently met with the favor of his companions  how are we going to live in the meanwhile  thats quite easy said the storekeeper with a smile ill supply you with pork and flour drills and giantpowder at bedrock figure while you get in your assessment work and while you live on your ranches afterward until you make a deal all i ask is that you wont sell until the grenfells floated and that youll give us first call then its a cold fact that if i had the money id buy you all up now  there was truth in his last assurance which was at the same time a highly diplomatic one for it occurred to most of the audience that if there was anything to be made by waiting they might as well have it as anybody else and after a further consultation they gave him their promise then they trooped away to prepare their dinner and saunders turned to devine with a contented smile  i guess he said weve headed those company men right off this lode and whats most as much to the purpose the boys will have to trade with me if anybody comes up and starts another store just now id feel quite happy if i knew how jim was running things  he was soon to learn for he had scarcely risen from a meal of salt pork somewhat blackened in the fryingpan and grindstone bread indifferently baked by devine when jim and several strangers plodded into camp he was very ragged and apparently very weary but he displayed no diffidence in accounting for his presence  it was kind of lonesome down there and i figured id come along he said  saunders gazed at him for a moment in mute indignation before his feelings found relief in words  and you raking in money by the shovelful he gasped  no said jim decisively i wasnt quite doing that anyway it was your money i got only a share of it and you didnt figure id stay back there weighing out flour and sugar when there was a gold strike on  saunders contrived to master his anger and merely made a little gesture of resignation he was acquainted with the restlessness which usually impels the average westerner to throw up ranch or business and strike into the bush when word of a new mineral find comes down though much is demanded of those who take the gold trail and as a rule their gains are remarkably small  whom did you leave to run the store asked saunders  nobody said jim except two siwash there was nobody in the settlement and anyway the store was most empty when the boys came along he indicated the strangers with a wave of his hand as they hadnt a dollar between them i told them id give them credit and they could pack up with them anything they could find in the place  saunders appeared to find some difficulty in preserving a befitting selfrestraint but he accomplished it  what did you do with the money youd taken already was his next question  wrapped it up in a flourbag said the man from okanagan cheerfully then i pitched the thing into an empty sugarkeg wrote up what the boys owed you and put the book into the keg too anyway i wrote up as much as i could remember  saunders looked at devine who stood by and there was contempt beyond expression in his eyes  that he said is just the kind of blamed fool he is  then he turned to jim  if i were to talk until tomorrow i couldnt quite tell you what i think of you  jim only grinned and sitting down by the fire set about preparing a meal while saunders who appeared lost in reflection presently turned again to devine  i guess ill go down this afternoon he said well have a fresh crowd pouring in and theyll want provisions anyway ive headed off those company men and if its necessary i can go through to the railroad and get hold of weston by the wires  devine admitted that this might be advisable and saunders who was a man of action took the back trail in the next halfhour he had held his own in one phase of the conflict which it was evident must be fought before the grenfell consolidated could be floated and it was necessary that somebody should go down to despatch the specimens to weston  they were duly delivered to the latter and the day after he got them it happened that he sat with ida on a balcony outside a room on the lower floor at the rear of stirlings house it was about four oclock in the afternoon and very hot but a striped awning was stretched above their heads and a broadleafed maple growing close below flung its cool shadow across them looking out beneath the roof of greenery they could see the wooded slope of the mountain cutting against a sky of cloudless blue while the stir of the city came up to them faintly weston had already at one time or another spent several pleasant hours on that balcony they had been speaking of nothing in particular when at length ida turned to him  have you ever heard anything further from scarthwaite she asked  weston fumbled in his pocket  i had a letter only a few days ago  he took it out and handed it to her with a little smile which he could not help though he rather blamed himself for indulging in it  as you know the place and met my sister you may enjoy reading it julias unusually communicative it almost seems as if i were a person of some consequence to them now  ida took the letter and her face hardened as she read then she looked at him with a suggestive straightening of her brows  isnt that only natural you have found a mine she said  the same idea occurred to me laughed weston but after all perhaps i shouldnt have shown you the letter it wasnt quite the thing  still you felt just a little hurt and that i could respect a confidence  ida looked at him as if she expected an answer and it occurred to weston that she was very alluring in her long white dress though the same thought had been uppermost in his mind for the last halfhour  yes he admitted i suppose that was it  he could have answered more explicitly but he felt that it would not be safe for it seemed very probable that if he once gave his feelings rein they would run away with him and this attitude as the girl naturally had noticed on other occasions tended to make their conversation somewhat difficult  what are you going to do about one very tactfullyworded suggestion she asked  you mean the hint that i should make a few shares in the grenfell consolidated over to my english relatives after all considering everything its not an unnatural request i shall endeavor to fall in with it  idas face did not soften the man was her lover for though he had not declared himself she was quite aware of that and she was his partisan and very jealous of his credit it was difficult to forgive those who had injured him and these people in england had shown him scant consideration and had spoken of him slightingly to her a stranger he noticed her expression and changed the subject  i have fancied now and then that you must have said something remarkably in my favor that day at scarthwaite he said i never quite understood what brought up the subject but julia once referred to a picture  ida laughed softly  im afraid i wasnt very tactful and i shouldnt be astonished if your people still regard me as a partlycivilized colonial anyway there was a picturea rather striking one do you remember arabellas making a sketch of you with the ax  i certainly do she wasnt complimentary in some of her remarks she called me wooden but the picture  would you like to see it before you go  weston glanced at her sharply and she nodded while a faint trace of color crept into her face  yes she said i have it here i made arabella give it to me  she saw the man set his lips for it seemed scarcely probable to him that a young woman who begged for the picture of a man would do so merely because she desired to possess it as a work of art besides he felt and in this he was to some extent correct that she had intended the admission to be provocative he was however a man with a simple code which forbade his making any attempt to claim this womans love while it was possible that in a few months he might once more become a wandering outcast he sat still for a moment or two and it seemed to ida who watched him quietly that he had worn much the same look when he stood beside the helpless grenfell gripping the big ax this was really the fact though he now entered upon a sterner struggle than he had been ready to engage in then once more he was endeavoring to do what it seemed to him right  miss kinnaird would have been better employed if she had painted the big snow peak with the lake at its feet he said at length  ida abandoned the attempt to move him she had yielded to a momentary impulse but she was too proud to persist  well she said that peak certainly was rather wonderful you remember it  yes said weston with injudicious emphasis i remember everything about that camp i can see the big black firs towering above the still waterand you were sitting where the light came slanting in between them you wore that gray fishing suit with the belt round it and you had your hat off the light made little gold gleams in your hair that matched the warm red glow on the redwood behind youand you had burst the strap of one little shoe  havent you overlooked arabella suggested ida who realized that his memory was significantly clear  miss kinnaird said weston of course she was with youbut its rather curious that shes quite shadowy i dont quite seem to fix her though i have a notion that she didnt fit in she was out of key  that laughed ida was probably the result of wearing a smart english skirt do you remember the day you fell down and broke her parasol and what you said immediately afterward about womens fripperies  i didnt know that i had an audience explained weston with his eyes twinkling i certainly remember that when you fancied that i had hurt myself you would have carried half the things over the portage if i had let you we went fishing that evening there was one big trout that broke you in the pool beneath the rapid the scent of the firs was wonderful  she led him on with a few judicious questions and suggestions and for half an hour they talked of thundering rivers still lakes and shadowy bush he remembered everything and without intending to do so he made it clear that in every vivid memory she was the prominent figure it was here she had hooked a big trout and there she had under his directions run a canoe down an easy rapid she had enjoyed all that the great cities had to offer but as she listened to him she sighed for the silence of the pinescented bush  at last he rose with a deprecatory smile  im afraid ive rather abused your patience he said and i have to call on wannop about the mine  you have told me nothing about it said ida how is it getting on  a shadow crept into westons face  there isnt very much to tell and it was a relief to get it out of my mind for an hour or so as a matter of fact its by no means getting on as we should like it  then after another word or two he took up his hat and left her     chapter xxviii  weston stands fast   business called weston to winnipeg a few days after his interview with ida and as it happened he met stirling at the head of the companionway when the big lake steamer steamed out into georgian bay neither of them had any other acquaintance on board and they sat together in the shade of a deckhouse as the steamer ploughed her way smoothly across lake huron a few hours later weston had arranged to meet a chicago stockjobber who had displayed some interest in the mine and he had chosen to travel up the lakes because it was more comfortable than in the cars in the hot weather besides being somewhat cheaper which was a consideration with him stirling it seemed was going to inspect the route for a railroad which an ironmining company contemplated building he lay in a deckchair with a cigar in his hand apparently looking out at the shining water which stretched away before them a vast sheet of turquoise to the far horizon  well he asked at length hows the grenfell consolidated progressing  it seems to be making most progress backward said weston still i suppose the fact that somebody evidently considered it worth while to send up men to jump our claim might be considered encouraging  he briefly related what had taken place at the mine as far as saunders letter had acquainted him with the facts and stirling listened thoughtfully  its a crude maneuver so crude that as youve nothing but suspicions to go upon it would be wiser not to mention them to anybody else he said after all the jumpers may have been acting on their own account  you believe they were  stirling smiled i naturally dont know enough about the matter to decide but in a general way when i come across anything that seems to the discredit of any gentleman of importance or big combine with which i may happen to be at variance i keep it judiciously quiet until i have the proofs in hand i find it an excellent rule then he added in a suggestive manner you probably have had another rather more favorable offer since those jumpers failed  weston admitted that this was the case and said that he had ignored the offer he further stated that as he had found the mine he meant to keep it until he could dispose of it on satisfactory terms  that said stirling dryly is a very natural wish but one now and then has some trouble in carrying out views of that kind ive seen your prospectus any applications for your shares  theyre by no means numerous and a flush of anger crept into westons face if that were the result of a depressed market or of investors indifference i shouldnt mind so much but we are evidently being subjected to almost every kind of unwarranted attack  any mode of attacks legitimate in this kind of deal and theres a rather effective one your friends dont seem to have tried yet quite sure it wouldnt be wiser to make what terms you can and let them have the mine  im afraid i havent considered the wisdom of the course i mean to adopt anyway its a simple one if those people want that mine they must break us first  well stirling said i guess if i were you id allot very few of those shares to what one might call general applicants locate them among your friends and wannops clerks  there are uncommonly few general applicants and my friends are not the kind of men who have money to invest the same thing probably applies to wannops clerks its quite certain that nobody connected with the grenfell consolidated could make them a present of the shares  considering everything thats unfortunate for as i once pointed out the next move will probably be to sell your stock down its a game that contains a certain hazard in the case of a small concern because the stock is generally in few hands but ive no doubt your friends will try it  then were helpless said weston we must raise sufficient money among the general investors or give up the mine  the situation said stirling dryly seems unpleasant but its the kind of one in which a little man who will neither make terms with a big concern nor let his friends help him might expect to find himself  weston sat silent awhile gazing at the steamers smoke trail which stretched far back a dingy smear on the blueness across the shining lake and the contractor watched him with a certain sympathy which however he carefully refrained from expressing there had been a time in his career when it had seemed that every man of influence in his profession and all the powers of capital had been arrayed against him he had been tricked into taking contracts the bigger men would not touch his accounts had been held over until long after the convenanted settling day and he had been compelled to submit to every deduction that perverted ingenuity could suggest he had however hardened his heart and toiled the more assiduously planning half the night and driving machine or plying shovel himself by day whenever a few dollars could be saved by doing so he had lived on the plainest fare but he had without borrowing or soliciting favors from any man borne the shrewd blows dealt him and struggled on inch by inch uphill in spite of them now it seemed to him that this young englishman was bent on doing much the same at length weston turned to him with a wry smile  its quite possible that youre right and the thing is too big for me but i have got to see it out he said  stirling made a little sign of comprehension his companions quietness pleased him and he felt that though the man must fight with indifferent weapons and with formidable powers against him he would not easily be beaten what was more to the purpose the contractor did not mean him to be beaten at all if he could prevent it though this was a point that he did not consider it advisable to mention  well he said reassuringly no one can tell exactly how a game of this kind will go all you can do is to hold tight and keep your eyes open  they changed the subject and nothing more was said about the mine during the rest of the journey  in due time stirling went ashore at a way port and weston met the man from chicago in winnipeg a day or two later the latter asked a good many questions about the mine but he contented himself with stating that the matter would require investigation and weston who gave him a small bag of specimens spent another day in winnipeg in a very dejected mood he felt the hideous cruelty of the system which within certain rather ample limits made it a legitimate thing to crush the little man and rob him of his few possessions by any means available there was it seemed no mercy shown to weaklings in the arena he had rashly entered with none of the weapons that the command of money supplied to those pitted against him but in place of shrinking from the conflict a slow smoldering rage crept into his heart  he remembered the weary marches made in scorching heat and stinging frost how his shoulders had been rubbed raw by the packstraps and how his burst boots had galled his bleeding feet there had been long nights of misery when he had lain halffed and too cold to sleep wrapped in dripping blankets beside a feeble sputtering fire while the deluge thrashed the roaring pines the bustle of the city jarred on him that afternoon and he wandered out of it but the march parched with thirst through the feathery ashes of the brûlée rose up in his memory as he walked aimlessly toward the prairie and he recalled grenfell lying beside the lode he had died to find it became a grim duty to hold his own and once more he determined that his enemies should crush him before they laid their grasping hands on the mine he shrank however from going back to montreal and waiting there in suspense and by the time he retraced his steps to his hotel he had decided that this was out of the question he wrote a few lines to wannop and started for the bush with the next days train  it was dark when he reached the camp after an arduous journey and found devine and saunders sitting beside the fire the latter it transpired had engaged a clerk in vancouver to take charge of his store and he smiled when weston inquired whether he expected the man to remain at the settlement any longer than his predecessor had done when he heard that there was a new gold find in reach of him  i guess ive fixed that he said i took some trouble to get one who was very lame  neither of the pair however appeared cheerful and westons face grew hard when he heard what they had to say about the mine  as youd see by the specimens we were turning out highgrade milling ore a little while ago devine observed  well  the surveyors gesture was expressive were not in it now ores turned spotty and its running deeper i think i remember your telling me that grenfell figured that the lode takes an inclination  he certainly did  its another proof that you could count on what he said theres no doubt about that inclination we cant get out ore that will pay for crushing with an open cut much longer  then said weston we can follow it with an adit  he looked at saunders who smiled in a rather grim fashion  adits cost money to drive observed the latter you have brought some along  weston said that this was not the case and saunders spread out his hands  well he said im broke half the men on this location are owing me quite a pile and its clear that ill never get a dollar out of them unless they strike it rich or the grenfell consols go up with a bang thats how jim from okanagan fixed the thing now ive got credit from a vancouver wholesaler who takes a share in the store and that will keep us in pork and flour but the giantpowder and detonators in the shack yonder represent this syndicates available capital i bought a big supply when i was in vancouver but therell be no more to be had when they run out  well go on until they do said weston doggedly  the next morning he laid his city clothes carefully aside and borrowed from his comrades garments more adapted to the bush they certainly did not fit him but that was a matter of no account and when he had put them on he commenced work in very grim earnest he was hard pressedup against it as they say in that countryand every crashing blow he struck upon the drill was a relief to him indeed he worked with curious coldblooded fury that wore out his comrades long before night came saunders had invested the proceeds of several years of spartan selfdenial in the precarious venture but that was as nothing compared with westons stake he must succeed or relinquish all idea of winning the woman who he ventured to think might listen to him when he had accomplished his task and when he desisted at sunset his hands were bleeding and he had partly lamed devine by an incautious stroke of the pick that however was a matter about which the surveyor protested less than the hazards his comrade quietly took he rammed the giantpowder into the holes with reckless haste and though the cheapest fuses are seldom to be relied on he allowed his companions scanty time to get out of the mine when he lighted them  it was the same the next day and for most of the next three weeks indeed saunders and devine were never sure how they contrived to keep pace with him but they did it for the credit of their manhood which would not allow them to be beaten by a britisher at nights their hands and backs were distressfully sore but the adit they drove crept on steadily along the dip of the lode though they had worked reasonably hard already their faces grew gaunter and harder under the strain and as yet they had come upon little sign of any richer ore in the meanwhile it was very hot and all day the withering sprays of the fallen firs emitted heavy honeylike odors under the scorching sun  then it occurred to some of the others that as there had been several weeks of fierce dry weather it would be a favorable opportunity to burn off the slashing or clear away the branches of the felled trees which is usually done before the great logs which do not readily burn are attacked with the saw and one day when the wind promised to drive the conflagration away from the camp fires were kindled here and there among the tindery undergrowth the attempt proved successful and in a few hours the fire had spread into the surrounding forest it crept on through the latter steadily springing up the towering trunks from spray to spray until the dark firs were garlanded with climbing flame beneath them the brushwood crackled furiously and every now and then a mighty limb fell amidst a shower of sparks while halfcharred logs and rows of blackened stumps marked out the lode the smoke obscured the sun until the workings were wrapped in a haze and it crept into the adit where weston and his comrades toiled but they held on with their fishoil lamps burning until the light outside grew dim and then crawling back sore all over to the wooden shack which had now replaced the tent they lay down outside it when supper was over  it was an impressive spectacle that they gazed upon the conflagration was still not far from them for as a rule a forest fire does not move very rapidly across the valley hung a dusky pall of smoke and beneath it all trunks stripped to bare spires stood out black against a sea of flame the latter however was of no very great extent from wing to wing and now that the wind had almost dropped it made very little progress though it crept on down the valley in a confined belt rising and falling in pulsations with the sharp crackle of lickedup undergrowth breaking through the deeptoned roar saunders lying propped up on one elbow watched it meditatively  its a highclass burn he said going to save somebody quite a lot of chopping but if that breeze whipped round thered sure be trouble  as the men at work on the lode lived either in tents or rude shelters of bark and logs this seemed very probable but weston was not in the mood to concern himself about the matter then  how much giantpowder have we got in hand he asked  almost enough to last another three weeks with fuse and detonators to match youll have to find the next lot when that runs out  weston laughed  ive just sufficient money to take me back to montreal traveling colonist and i must go back to see how wannops getting on before very long what are you going to do then  devine looked at saunders who smiled at him  push the adit right on if we have to cut every foot of it with the drill he said before we let up well rip the rock out with our naked hands  it was a characteristic answer but weston was satisfied with it he had discovered that if the men of the pacific slope were occasionally a trifle assertive and what he called flamboyant in their conversation they nevertheless as a rule meant just what they said it is of course not unusual for an imaginative person to describe what he intends to do in dramatic periods but while some people are wisely content with that the western bushman generally can be depended on to carry out the purpose  they said nothing further and presently went to sleep with the crackle of the undergrowth through which the fire crawled ringing in their ears     chapter xxix  the fire   the shack was full of smoke when weston awakened coughing and drowsily looked about him somebody else was spluttering close by and in a moment or two he heard devine relieve himself with a few expletives then weston got up from his lair of spruce twigs fully dressed for the night was chilly and the shack had only three sides to it while the men who live in such places not infrequently take off their clothes to work and put them on when they go to bed  the wind has evidently dropped and the smokes drifting back i cant stand much more of this said weston  devine it seemed had lost his temper  then why dont you get out instead of worrying people he asked anyway its only one of the little luxuries that saunders and i are quite accustomed to ive been eaten by mosquitoes sandflies and other insects of various kinds youve most smashed my ankle besides sticking a grubhoe into me and saunders must work out a big stone just when i was under it weve been living most of two months on his rancid pork and grindstone bread and now you make a circus about a little smoke  he broke off in another fit of spluttering and the storekeepers voice rose out of the vapor which seemed to be rapidly thickening  the winds not dropped its shifted and the fires working back he said  in another moment weston stood gasping in the doorway a little chilly breeze such as often draws down from the ranges in early morning met him in the face and the air was thick with drifting smoke hoarse shouts rose out of it and a patter of running feet and it became evident that most of the men were departing hastily for the range or the remoter forest weston however could not see them and it was indeed a few seconds before he saw anything except a confused glimmering behind a dusky pall of vapor then as the smoke thinned a bewildering glare shot up and ranks of trees were silhouetted against a sea of fire that flung itself upon the rearmost of them and ran aloft from spray to spray while the snapping of the smaller branches resembled volleys of riflery after that the smoke drove down again and blotted out everything  weston however was not unduly alarmed he concerned himself most about the possibility of their work being delayed during the next day or two as a rule an active man has little difficulty in avoiding a forest fire unless it is of unusual extent or is driven by a strong wind and there was a wide space already burned clear to which they could remove their possessions it appeared advisable to set about the latter task at once for the conflagration was by this time uncomfortably close to them  hand me the big flourbag he said  saunders hoisted it on his shoulders and he stumbled away with it coughing in the smoke until he could deposit it in the cleared track where the fire had passed the previous afternoon then he went back for another load and had some difficulty in reaching the shack for the vapor filled his eyes and almost suffocated him he fell down once or twice among the halfburned branches as he retraced his steps with his burden but pork and flour and picks and drills were precious commodities in the bush and he made a third journey upsetting saunders as he plunged into the shack in the meanwhile the other also had been busy and at length they sat down gasping beside the pile of blankets clothing tools and provisions with several other men who had hastily removed their possessions from adjacent claims  where are the rest of the boys saunders asked one of them  some of them are in the workings some of them on the range but i guess it was for vancouver the fraser crowd started out seemed to me they meant to get there before they stopped  just then a shower of sparks fell about them and charred a hole or two in devines clothes while they had a momentary vision of the front of the conflagration it was not a reassuring spectacle for the rolling sea of fire flung itself aloft in glittering spray to the tops of the highest firs and the valley rang with the roar it made  well said saunders reflectively i dont know that i blame the fraser crowd and one of the boys was telling me not long ago that the settlement he came from was burned out a thing of that kind makes a man cautious anyway its quite hot enough here and well hump this truck along to the adit  the others agreed that it would be advisable but most of the things were heavy and it was some little time later when weston lighted a fishoil lamp in the heading and held it up the narrow tunnel seemed halffull of rolledup blankets flourbags and slabs of pork and a group of men some of whose faces were blackened sat among them  our lot came in first have you got it all weston asked  they found the flour and pork the tea and saunders rifle as well as a couple of hammers and several drills but weston did not seem satisfied  where are my clothes he asked  none of them seemed to know though it became evident that his city garments were at least not in the adit  guess theyll be frizzled quite out of fashion if you left them in the shack said one of the men a miner has no use for getting himself up like a bank clerk anyway  weston held up the lamp so the rest could see him his face was black and the sleeve of his duck jacket had several big holes in it his trousers were rent in places and one of his long boots was burst while devines hat which was too big for him hung shapeless and dotted with charred holes on his head  im going back to montreal in a day or two can i call on big stockjobbers and company floaters like this  guess you can buy new ones in montreal said the miner  you can agreed weston when you have the money the trouble is i havent saunders im going back for those clothes  they went with him to the mouth of the adit and saw the shack outlined against a dazzling blaze it did not seem to be burning yet but none of westons companions believed that it would be possible for him to reach it the smoke had risen and now rolled among the tops of the firs but though they stood at some distance from the fire the air scorched their faces westons showed up in the lurid radiance worn and very grim and it was evident to devine that the curious moodiness which had troubled him since he came back from the city was at least as strong as it had been  you cant get them now he expostulated  give me your jacket said weston sharply its thicker than the thing i have on  the surveyor hesitated he could see the sparks and blazing fragments stream past the shack and he had no wish to encourage his comrade in the rashness he contemplated  well said weston ill go as i am  then saunders remembered something and seized him by the shoulder  hold on he cried did either of you bring the giantpowder and detonators along  weston glanced at devine who shook his head  i didnt anyway he said  for a moment or two there was a silence that was expressive of dismay as they realized that in the haste and confusion they had saved only the things that could be replaced the result of this might prove disastrous for giantpowder and detonators are comparatively dear in that country and in any case are not obtainable in the bush to hire labor was in the meanwhile out of the question and the progress two men could make cutting through hard rock with only the pick and drill was as they were quite aware likely to be remarkably small saunders made a little dejected gesture  then he said theyre still in the leanto behind the shack and it would be kind of wiser to crawl back into the adit the case of detonators was lying bang up against the giantpowder  this was a significant statement for it must be explained that although giantpowder as dynamite is generally called in the west as a rule merely burns more or less violently when ignited by a flame it is still a somewhat unstable product and now and then explodes with appalling results on apparently quite insufficient provocation in use it is fired with a detonator a big copper cap charged with a fulminate of the highest power and when lighted in this fashion the energies unloosed by the explosion though limited in their area are stupendous the detonator is almost as dangerous for a few grains of the fulminate contained in it are sufficient to reduce a man to his component gases at least this was the case a few years ago  several men besides its owners had sought shelter from the heat and sparks in the adit and they evidently agreed with saunders that it was advisable to crawl back into shelter as soon as possible but weston stood still he had for the past few weeks been looking disaster in the face and this had produced in him a certain savage desperation which is not altogether unusual in the case of hardpressed men who feel that they have everything against them in his mood which was not a pleasant one each fresh blow stirred him to a grimmer effort made with a curious quiet fury from which his comrades now and then almost shrank turning abruptly he shook himself free from saunders grip  well he said im going to bring out that powder  in a moment he had scrambled up the pile of shattered rock and was running across the open space like a deer it was strewn with halfburned branches and here and there with little piles of glowing fragments but he went straight through them without a stumble and it must be admitted that his comrades stood still and watched him with consternation before it dawned on them that it was scarcely fitting to let him go alone then saunders climbed up to the level ground somewhat deliberately  i guess he said weve got to go after the blame fool  they set out but saunders who had been keeping store for some years was not remarkably agile and one could hardly blame devine for proceeding with a certain caution however they reached the outside of the shack soon after weston had disappeared in it and they stopped gasping the air which scorched their faces seemed to frizzle their hair and the smoke which once more had descended whirled about them they could hear nothing but the roar of the fire  then a halfseen figure reeled out of the shack and devine who was nearest it laughed discordantly when his comrade thrust upon him a bundle of clothes the thing seemed altogether incongruous but he turned and set off toward the adit with his arms full of the garments which got loose and flopped about him until he flung them to another man who had ventured part of the distance  general jackson exclaimed the miner he went back for his clothes  devine did not stop to sympathize with his astonishment but ran back to the shack and weston flung him a partlyfilled flourbag as he approached it it fell close beside a glowing fragment and the surveyor felt a little shiver run through him as he whipped it up for he had some knowledge of the vagaries of giantpowder he flung the bag over his shoulder as gently as possible and once more started for the adit though he proceeded with caution he was desperately anxious to get rid of his burden but he had no desire to shake it up unduly giantpowder will now and then go off without any very apparent cause  in the meanwhile saunders clutched at weston as he turned back toward the hut one had to enter it before gaining admission to the smaller shed in which they kept the giantpowder  youre not going in again weve got one bag he said  the other one is still inside was the hoarse reply  saunders did not waste his breath in expostulation but grappled with him and he had rent part of westons jacket off his back in the effort to detain him when devine came running up then weston wriggling around struck the storekeeper in the face and plunged back into the smoke as the latter dropped his hand  they lost sight of him for almost a minute and then he reeled out of the shack as the smoke drove away a stream of sparks whirled past it and close above him the roof was blazing but he held another flourbag in his hands and his comrades who had reasonably steady nerves were almost appalled when he poised himself to throw it there was only a thin strip of cotton fabric between the flying sparks and the plastic yellow rolls of powder still the bag was thrown and saunders set off with it while weston stood gasping a moment and looked at devine  theres the bag of detonators yet he said and swinging around disappeared again  devine remembered that there was no lid to the iron box in which they kept the detonators and that they were intended to be ignited by the sparking of a fuse he stood some little distance from the shack and it did not occur to him that as one person could carry the box readily he was serving no purpose in waiting indeed he was only conscious of a suspense that made it impossible for him to go away he did not know how long he waited but in the meanwhile the smoke whirled lower and he could see nothing for a moment or two then it lifted and the shack stood out in the midst of a lurid blaze there was a horrible crackling and weston suddenly sprang into sight black against the brightness with the iron box which had deerhide straps attached to it slung upon his back the sparks rained about him but he plunged through the midst of them while the box banged against him then devine turned and ran  they reached the mouth of the adit safely and when they crawled into it weston sat down and gasped heavily for a while before he turned to the others and pointed to the two bags of giantpowder lying on the floor his duck jacket was burned in patches and there were several red spots apparently where sparks had fallen on his blackened face and hands  havent you sense enough to take that open lamp farther away from those bags he asked  there was a roar of hoarse laughter as his companions recognized the incongruity of the question and weston blinked at them as though puzzled by it until a light broke in on him  perhaps it wasnt quite in keeping with the other thing boys he admitted give me some tobacco one of you mine seems to have gone and i feel id like to sit quiet a minute or two  the hand he thrust into his pocket came out through the bottom of it for the lower part of the jacket was torn and burned but one of the others produced a plug of tobacco and when he had lighted his pipe weston leaned back somewhat limply against the side of the adit  well he said i suppose it was rather a crazy trick but if wed been sensible wed certainly have let the grenfell consolidated fall into the hands of those city men  then he turned to the storekeeper with a deprecatory gesture  im sorry saunders but you would try to hold me you ought to have known that you cant reason with a man in the mood that i was in then  saunders grinned i wouldnt worry about the thing if there isnt a club handy the next time you feel like doing anything of that kind im going to leave you severely alone  then through the roar and crackle of the fire they heard a heavy crash and one of the men nearest the mouth of the adit glanced at weston significantly  its kind of fortunate you got through when you did he said a big branch has fallen right across your shack and broken it up     chapter xxx  defeat   there had been trouble at the board meeting and now that it was almost over the directors of the grenfell consolidated sat in dejected silence listening to the animadversions of one of their comrades they did not agree with everything he said but it scarcely seemed worth while to raise minor objections for they were willing to admit that the situation was desperate  we should never have proceeded to allotment he said i warned you that the applications for our stock were quite insufficient to warrant the flotation of the concern at the time but you apparently lost your heads over those specimens and you overruled me now its unpleasantly evident that we cannot expect to go on much longer and i venture to predict a voluntary liquidation during the next few months  it certainly looks like that said one of the others gloomily still you might give us your reasons for counting on the thing if you have any  the man laugheda little harsh laugh that had in it a hint of contempt for the intelligence of his colleagues  will you let me have those estimates again mr weston he asked  weston who sat with a set face gazing at the papers in front of him handed several of them across the table it was now some time since he had left the mine and in the meanwhile trouble after trouble had crowded thick upon him he realized also that he was rapidly losing the confidence of his companions they were not men of any great account in that city and it was significant that the board meeting was held in wannops little back office where there was scarcely room for all of them  you have discussed those estimates at length already he said i should however like to point out that i consider them absurdly high in fact id undertake to do the work at not more than twothirds of the cost  this company said the first speaker severely has no intention of taking up roadmaking and the building of flumes and dams it has as i think you will admit gentlemen quite enough already on its hands  there was some show of agreement from all but wannop and weston set his lips there had been a time when they had listened to his suggestions but now it was becoming evident that they regarded him with suspicion  this said his colleague is a little list of our requirements and expenditures before we can expect to get to work tools drillingmachines and labor on the heading he read out the cost of each item then we have to provide a stampmill turbines flumes and dam and though mr weston suggests a woodburning engine to supply the crushing power the saving effected would be no great matter the point is that we now discover that the cost of these things will in one way or another be nearly double what we stated in our prospectus  that said wannop dryly isnt altogether unusual  what is more to the purpose is that it will approximately absorb our whole available capital said the first speaker who took up another paper then we have as an alternative scheme several leagues of road and trail cutting including wooden bridges and a strip that must be dug out of an impassable mountainside you have to add to it the cost and maintenance of packhorses and the rates youd have to pay the owners of the nearest crushingplant to do your reducing gentlemen i can only move that these estimates stand over and that in the meanwhile we merely proceed with the heading  they agreed to this then another of them spoke  it seems to me that theres a way in which we could save something as well as our credit he said ive had a hint that another big concern might be willing to take us over  they looked at one another in a manner which suggested that this was not altogether a new idea weston straightened himself suddenly  it will never be done with my consent he said  then remarked the first speaker it is quite likely that you will find yourself in a minority of one  mr weston can count on at least one supporter said wannop shortly  then there was an awkward silence until one of the others thrust back his chair  its becoming quite clear that we cant go on he said this concern was started wrong we should have spent more money taken firstclass offices and turned out floods of illustrated pamphlets  i just want to ask how youre going to spend money that you havent got said wannop i was quite willing to take the money you wouldnt put it up  there was a little laughter and the meeting broke up but weston stayed behind with wannop when the others went down the stairway the broker who sat down again made a little dejected gesture  i guess the game is up theyre going back on us he said in a way i dont blame them the hogarth people have scared them off theyre not big enough  have you any idea as to what theyll do weston asked  wannop nodded oh yes he said theyll hold out a month or two and piffle away at the adit to save appearances then theyll call the stockholders together and suggest turning the mine over to the hogarth people on such terms as they can get there are just two things that could save usa strike of extra highgrade ore or a sudden whim of investors to purchase western mining stock he smiled in a wry fashion i dont expect either of them  weston sat still a moment and then rose with an air of weariness  well he said im going back to the mine tomorrow well hold on as long as possible  he left and a few minutes later stirling came in he sat down and handed wannop a cigar  now he said we have got to talk  if youd come a little earlier youd have met weston  yes said stirling thats just why i didnt now wheres the trouble  ill tell youthough to some extent its a breach of confidence its the shortage of money and the fact that our stock is tumbling down  tumbling down  wannop smiled i might have said being clubbed down  i want to get the thing quite straight said stirling what made you take up this mine  mr westons representations i think i attached as much weight to them as i did to the specimens i felt that was a man that i could put my money on  you feel that now  i do wannop admitted in fact its hard to believe he will be beaten though the rest of us are going back on him  stirling nodded in a manner which might have meant anything  so your stock is being sold down he said as i pointed out to mr weston considering that you havent a great deal of it thats rather a dangerous game are any actual holders parting  they had spoken without reticence in terse sharp sentences as men who recognized the advisability of coming straight to the point which is after all a custom that usually saves trouble for everybody concerned the men who shrink from candor lest they should give themselves away not infrequently waste a good deal of time wondering what the other person means and then decide incorrectly  they are said wannop besides several small lots one parcel of six hundred shares held in england changed hands though that was when we stood near par and the stock was only beginning to break away what we want is such a strike of ore as will startle mining investors  anything else stirling asked suggestively  well said wannop were not likely to get it if a good strong buyer who could wait were to take hold it would help us as much as anything  quite sure asked stirling very dryly  isnt it evident it would stiffen prices and scare off the hogarth brokers whats more it would steady my colleagues nerves  yes admitted stirling it would do all that however i want to suggest that that isnt quite enough anyway thats my view of it  they looked at each other steadily for a moment or two and then stirling made a little forceful gesture  now he said im going to take hold of this thing and in the first place ill give you an order on my bank for all the money that seems necessary you will take up some of that stock for me and as the hogarth men will offer more freely as soon as they strike an actual buyer in case prices stiffen youll follow their lead and pitch the stock you bought on to the market  some men would consider that was playing the other peoples game commented wannop with a chuckle  it would be in the meanwhile said stirling well you wont let your salesif you make anyget out of hand youll have to put on one or two smart men and cover or sell at a lower price through different ones when it appears advisable i shall naturally lose a little on every deal of that kind but the only real trouble will be when you quietly gather in as much as possible of the stock the other people are offering it will have to be done without raising suspicions and before their broker can report and ask for instructions  wannop struck the table theres some hazard in itbut its a great idea he said theyll club the grenfell consols down quite flat  until settling day then when the other people have to deliver they cant get the stock well shove the prices up on them to anything we like  wannop gazed at him in exultation but presently he asked a disconnected question  why are you doing all this  for money for one thing said stirling with a little flush in his face for another because ive been sweated and bluffed and bullied by people of the kind youre up against and now i feel its most a duty to strike back he clenched a big hard hand ive watched my wife scrubbing and baking and patching my clothes in the old black days when i lived in a threeroomed shack because i was bluffed out of half my earnings by people who sent their daughters to europe every year ive nothing to say against legitimate dealing but its another thing when these softhanded overfedmen suck the blood out of every minor industry and make their pile by the grinding down of a host of struggling toilers by next settling day one or two of them are going to feel my hand  he reached out for his hat rather red in face  if ive any other reasons they dont concern you he added in a different tone all i expect from you is to do your part judiciously and as a matter of fact it will have to be done that way  he went out and left wannop sitting with the light of a somewhat grim satisfaction in his eyes  in the meanwhile weston went moodily back to his hotel and spent an unpleasant hour or two before he proceeded irresolutely toward stirlings house he realized that this was in some respects most unwise of him but he was going away on the morrow and he felt that he could not go without a word with ida  she was sitting near the fire which burned upon the open hearth when he was shown into a daintilyfurnished room after a swift glance at him she rose and followed the maid to the door  i cannot receive anybody else just now she said  then she came back and sat down not far from him feeling that there was a crisis on hand for though the mans manner was quiet there was trouble in his face  you have something to tell me about your meeting perhaps  yes said weston i dont however wish to trouble you much about the meeting i merely want to thank you for your sympathy before i go away you see im going west tomorrow  will you be long away  yes said weston with a strained quietness that jarred on her in fact its scarcely probable that i shall come back here at all the games up my directors have lost their nerve the grenfell consolidated must go down in the next few months  it was evident to ida that whatever could be done must be done by her or the man would go away again without a word and this time he would as he had said not come back at all for a moment or two she sat very still  ah she murmured i neednt tell you that im sorry  no said weston simply i know you are  then there was for a minute or two a silence that both found almost intolerable and that seemed emphasized by the snapping of the fire there was before the girl a task from which she shrank but it was clear to her that since she could not let him go one of them must speak  what are you going to do in the west she asked  push on the heading until we have to let the mine go  and then  weston spread out his hands  i dont know act as somebodys camppacker shovel on the railroads work on the ranches  it was very evident to ida that his quietness was the result of a strenuous effort the barrier of reticence between them was very frail just then and she meant to break it down she leaned forward in her chair with her eyes fixed on him and now the signs of tension in his face grew plainer  you speak as if that would be easy for you she said  weston shut his eyes to one aspect of the question he had not the courage to face it and he confined himself to the more prosaic one  as a matter of fact im afraid it wont be he admitted the life ive led here and the few weeks i spent at kinnairds camp have rather spoiled me for the bush some of the customs prevalent in the trailchoppers shanties and the loggingcamps are a little primitive and one cant quite overcome a certain distaste for them  that was not quite what i meant said ida  weston was startled but she saw that he would not allow himself to wonder what she really did mean  anyway he answered doggedly i suppose i can bear any unpleasantness of that kind which is fortunate because theres apparently no way out of it after all its one consolation to feel that im only going back to what i was accustomed to before i found the mine  ah said ida you are very wrong in one respect you speak as if you could bear the trouble alone dont you think it would hurt anybody else as much to let you go then while the blood crept into her face she fixed her eyes on him yes she added simply i mean myself  weston rose and stood leaning on the back of his chair with one hand tightly closed he had struggled stubbornly but it was evident that his strength had suddenly deserted him and that he was beaten now  it would hurt you as much he said with a curious harshness thats quite impossible the hardest bitterest thing i could ever have to face would be to go away from you  he flung out the closed hand  now he said you know ive thrown away common sense and prudence all sense of what is fitting and all that is due to you none of those things seem to count just now  he drew a little nearer  i fell in love with you at kinnairds camp and tried hard to crush that folly then i found the mine and for a few mad weeks i almost ventured to believe that i might win you after that the fight to drive your memory out of my heart had to be made again  it was hard asked ida very softly  it was relentlessly cruel westons voice grew sharper still i tried to make it i gave way in only one pointi came to see you now and then now its so hard that im beaten ive failed in this thing as ive failed in the other  he straightened himself suddenly with a little forceful gesture  im beaten all round beaten to my knees but i dont seem ashamed even if you cant forgive me im glad ive told you  i think said ida i could forgive you for one offensethe one you seem to think most importantrather easily it would have been ever so much harder to do that had you gone away without telling me  you mean that cried weston and stooping over her he caught one hand and gripped it almost cruelly  cant you take anything for granted ida asked demurely must one always explain in full to you  she felt the mans arms close about her and his lips hot on her cheek but in another moment he drew away from her  but this is madness he said i have nothing in a few more weeks i shall be an outcast  ah said ida you have given me all that counts for anything andshe looked up at him with shining eyes and burning cheeksyou belong to me  he stood silent for several moments with trouble in his face apparently struggling with himself  what are you thinking of she asked  weston raised his head  i dare not think he said ive won you by unfair meansand yet knowing that im only filled with the exultation of it still this thing has to be faced and decided now you know i love youbut is it right that you should be bound to a man who may never be able to marry you  is that any great obstacle asked ida if i dont object  it is said weston hoarsely i want you now  the girl was almost startled by the change in him his restraint had broken down once for all at last and she saw by the tension in his face and the glow in his eyes that his nature was stirred to its depths in a moment or two however he seemed to succeed in imposing a partial control upon himself  i had meant to come to you only when we had made the mine a success he said  to save your prideyou could think of that  weston laughed harshly  my pridethere isnt a shred of it left but now at least the situation has to be faced  is it so very dreadful asked ida with a smile you have told me that you love me is that a thing to be ashamed of must i tell you that i am glad you came to me when you were beaten and not when you had won is there anything that i should trouble myself about  your friends opinion your fathers opposition  he broke off and ida who turned in her chair looked around suddenly with her cheeks flushed  my father she said is able to speak for himself  weston started for he saw stirling standing just inside the doorway looking at them gravely their attitude and the girls expression would he realized be significant to a man of the contractors intelligence then ida rose and faced the elder man  i think i would better tell you that i have promised to marry mr weston when things are propitious she said she looked around at weston with a smile at least i suppose i have  ah said stirling dryly the situation rather suggested it mr weston has no doubt something to say to me  ida glanced at weston and slipped out of the room     chapter xxxi  highgrade ore   stirling waited until the door closed before he turned to weston  sit down weve got to have a straight talk he said  weston complied feeling that he had to face the most unpleasant few minutes he had ever spent in his life he had given way to his passion in a moment of desperation and he fancied that he could make no defense which would appear reasonable to such a man as his companion in spite of this he was filled with a certain reckless exultation ida stirling loved him  what miss stirling told you was correct he said at least i intend to marry her if everthings are propitious but as far as i can remember she did not bind herself  there are occasions when ones memory gets a little confused said stirling dryly you have made the situation quite clear but there are one or two points to consider and so far you havent troubled to ascertain my views on the matter  that remark said weston is quite warranted i have only this to say when i entered your house half an hour ago i hadnt the faintest notion that i should permit my feelings to run away with me  then this thing has been going on for quite a time  stirlings tone was coldly even but weston did not like the question the form of it rather jarred on him he realized however that he was on his defense and would probably have to put up with a good deal more than that  i have had a strong regard for miss stirling since i first met her in british columbia he said that however is all i can admit i do not know how she thought of me and i have at least never knowingly until this evening spoken a word which could show her what my feelings were  oh said stirling youve lived in the woods if you hadnt youd have found out by now that young women possess a certain faculty of putting things together anyway he added enigmatically i dont know that the bush isnt as good a place to raise a man in as the hothouse susan frisingham talked about  weston gazed at him in some astonishment but the contractor made a little gesture with his hand  well he said you meant to keep the thing to yourself  until i had made the grenfell consolidated a success when i should have come to you  quite the proper course commented stirling its kind of a pity you didnt stick to it when you had arrived at that wise decision why did you come here to talk to my daughter  it was a shrewd question and perfectly warranted but weston answered it candidly  i think i came because i could not stay away he said  then it never occurred to you that my daughter might fall in love with you  a flush crept into westons face  at least he said i never came here with the intention of profiting by that possibility  stirling laughed in a rather dry fashion  then she was to do it all at once when you intimated that she had permission to  it almost looks like that weston admitted with an embarrassment that surpassed anything he had expected im afraid and he made a deprecatory gesture that ive made a deplorable mess of the whole affair  you have said stirling as it happens however thats in your favor if youd shown yourself a cleverer man in this matter it might have occurred to me that it was miss stirlings money that you had your eyes on  weston turned and gazed at him with the blood in his forehead  i wish with all my heart that miss stirlings money were at the bottom of the sea he said passionately theres just another thing i have to say i came to your house in a fit of desperation a little while ago so shaken by what i had just had to face that i was off my guard when i told miss stirling what i felt for her it was a follybut i did itand i have no excuse to make  then to westons astonishment the contractors manner changed suddenly and he leaned forward with a smile  well he said its possible that she could find one or two for you but we have to face the situation it seems that you love my daughter and there is reason for believing that she is fond of you now ida has been accustomed to every luxury and the only thing you count on is a share in the grenfell mine which i guess you will admit may go under at any time what do you propose to do  i dont know replied weston simply its a question that has been driving me to desperation lately  well said stirling i could find a way out of the difficulty are you open to place yourself in my hands do what i tell you and take what i may think fit to offer you  no answered weston im sorrybut i cant do that  then if the grenfell goes under youd rather go back to the bush and chop trees for the ranchers or shovel on the railroads  weston sat very still a moment with his face awry then he looked up resolutely  yes he said i think that by and by miss stirling would be glad i did it she would not have her husband her fathers pensioner after all he added one meets with sudden changes of fortune in the west  then stirling suddenly stretched out his hand and laid it on his companions shoulder  ive been twice warned by shortsighted women that my daughter might make an injudicious marriage and on each occasion i pointed out that when she chose her husband she would choose just right he said now it seems that she has done it and im satisfied  he let his hand fall and while weston gazed at him in bewilderment smiled reassuringly  go back to the mine when you like he added you admitted that you would take advice from me and all i suggest now is that you hold fast to every share you hold and make no arrangements of any kind until after next settling day in the meanwhile if youll go along to the first room in the corridor its quite likely that youll find ida there ive no doubt that shell be anxious to hear what ive said to you  weston could never remember what answer he made but he went out with his heart beating furiously and a light in his eyes and when he entered the other room ida stretched out her hands to him when she saw his face  then it isnt disaster she said you will stay with me  weston drew her toward him  dear i must still go away tomorrow but we have at least this evening  it was all too short for them but weston left in a state of exultation with fresh courage in his heart and it was in an optimistic frame of mind that he started west the next day for several weeks he toiled strenuously under the blinking fishoil lamps in the shadowy adit but there was now as his companions noticed a change in his mood the grimness which had characterized him had vanished in place of toiling in savage silence he laughed cheerfully when there was any cause for it and showed some consideration for his personal safety he handled the sticks of giantpowder with due circumspection and no longer exposed himself to any unnecessary hazard from falling stones the man was softer more human and on occasion whimsical  for all that the work was pushed on as determinedly as before and both saunders and devine experienced the same difficulty in keeping pace with their comrades efforts though they had grown hard and lean and their hands were deeply scarred yard by yard the adit crept on along the dipping lode and one evening they stood watching weston who was carefully tamping a stick of giantpowder in a hole drilled in the stone the ore had shown signs of getting richer the last few days but their powder was rapidly running out and they had not decided yet where they were to obtain a fresh supply his directors had sent him neither the promised machines nor the money with which to hire labor and he chafed at the fact that as it was a long and arduous journey to the nearest station where he could reach the wires he could not ascertain the cause of the delay  the storekeeper nodded when at length weston carefully clamped down a big copper cap on a length of snaky fuse and inserted it in another hole  well he said i guess this shot will settle whether theres highgrade ore in front of us  he struck a sputtering sulphur match and touched the fuses  now he said well get out just as quickly as possible  they ran down the adit with devine in front swinging a blinking lamp and crawled out gasping into the cold evening air as dusk was closing down then they sat around and waited until there was a crash and a muffled rumbling weston stood up but saunders made a sign of expostulation  you just sit down again and take a smoke he said weve got to give her quite a while yet  there was a reason for this the fumes of giantpowder are apt to prove overpowering in a confined space and in case of some men the distressful effects they produce last for several hours but when weston filled his pipe he scattered a good deal of the tobacco he had shredded upon the ground a strike of really rich ore would he knew send the grenfell consolidated up and he had worked since morning in a state of tense anticipation for the signs had been propitious he contrived to sit still for some minutes and then stood up resolutely  you may wait as long as you like he said im going back to the adit now  they went with him saunders expostulating and devine carrying the lamp thin vapor that turned them dizzy met them as they floundered into the dark tunnel the lamp burned uncertainly but they crept on by the feeble ray of light over masses of fallen rock until they reached a spot where the adit was blocked with the debris weston dropping on hands and knees tore out several smaller fragments and held up one of them but as he did it there was a faint hoarse cry and sudden darkness as devine fell forward upon the lamp  get me out quick he gasped  weston felt for the lamp and contrived to light it though he wasted several matches in the attempt but he felt greatly tempted to disregard the dictates of humanity when he hooked it in his hat  well he said reluctantly i suppose well have to take him out  they did it with some difficulty and left him unceremoniously when they had deposited him limp and almost helpless in the open air for miners who meet with unpleasantness of that kind recover and one does not make a discovery that promises to put thousands of dollars into ones pockets very frequently they went back and though weston felt faint and dizzy he flung himself down among the smaller stones and thrust one or two of them into saunders hands  feel themand look at the break he exclaimed  saunders poised one of the stones carefully and then glanced at the rent where it had been torn from the rock  yes he said weve struck it this time sure guess well get out of this and make supper  make supper weston gazed at him incredulously i dont stir out of here until sunup  then he tore off his tattered shirt and stood up stripped to the waist  get hold of the drill he said hoarsely youve got to work tonight  saunders remembered that night long afterward for the first halfhour he was troubled by a distressful faintness and when that passed off as the air grew clearer his back and arms commenced to ache unpleasantly he already had toiled since soon after sunrise but weston too had done so and he at least seemed impervious to fatigue so intent was he that every now and then he swung the heavy hammer long after his turn had run out without asking for relief and saunders judiciously permitted him to undertake the more arduous task by and by however devine crept back to join them and when at length morning broke and the mouth of the adit glimmered faintly weston glanced at his bleeding hands as he flung down the hammer  i suppose well have to let up for an hour or two he said reluctantly  saunders staggered when they reached the open air and weston seemed to have some difficulty in straightening himself but they got breakfast and afterward lay smoking beside the fire almost too stiff to move it was getting cold among the ranges now and they were glad of the warmth from the blaze  well go on for two or three days said weston then well pack every load of ore out to the new passage smelter and get them to reduce it devine and i will take it down to the railroad over the dead pine trail the freighter from the settlement should be in with his packtrain by the time were ready  nobody ever brought a packbeast in or out by dead pine and therell be deep snow in the pass saunders expostulated  then said weston curtly im going to do it now if we cant raise a stamp and reducing plant we have got to prove that we can make a trail to the railroad by which we can get our ore out without spending a small fortune on packing if we can get over dead pine divide it should shorten the present trail by half and im under the impression that if we spend a few thousand dollars on making a road up the big gully it could be done  saunders looked at devine who made a little sign  oh he said he means to try it i guess weve got to let him  they went back to work by and by and a few days later weston and devine and a grizzled freighter breakfasted in haste beside a sputtering fire a row of loaded packhorses stood close by in the rain and a cluster of dripping men gathered round when at length weston rose to his feet the freighter waved his hand to them with a little dry smile  were going to blaze you out a new road boys and it will save me some in horses if it can be done he said guess youll be sorry when you see what the next man strikes you for if we dont come back again  there was some laughter and rude good wishes followed the three wet men as they plodded away beside the loaded beasts into the rain     chapter xxxii  grenfells gift   it was snowing hard and though it was still two hours before sunset the light was growing dim when weston pulled the foremost packhorse up on the edge of the gully he and devine had each a beast in his charge and the freighter had started with two but one of these had been left behind with a broken leg and a merciful bullet in its brain that country is a difficult one even to the cayuse horses which are used to its forestchoked valleys and perilous defiles  in front of them a rugged peak rose above the high white ridge of dead pine they could see the latter cutting against a lowering sky some twelve hundred feet above though the peak showed only a ghostly shape through its wrappings of drifting mist in altitude alone the ridge was difficult to reach but while that would not have troubled any of the men greatly the ascent was made more arduous by the fact that the unmarked trail followed the slope of an awful gully the latter fell almost sheer from close beside their feet running down into the creeping obscurity out of which the hoarse thunder of a torrent rose here and there they could catch a glimpse of a ragged pine clinging far down among the stones and that seemed only to emphasize the depth of the gloomy pit on the other hand the hillside rose like a slightly slanted wall and the sharp stones of the talus lay thinly covered with snow between it and the gully  the freighter glanced dubiously up the hollow  ive struck places that looked nicer but we cant stop here and freeze he said well either have to take the back trail and camp among that last clump of pines or get on a hustle and get up  im certainly not going back said weston we have come out to see in just what time we can make the journey to the railroad over the new trail when we have done it well try to spread the information to everybody likely to find it interesting  youre not going to worry about how many horses you leave behind i suppose  that said devine with a little laugh is one of the facts they never do mention in a report of the kind weve lost only one so far and two bags of rather highgrade ore  if youve one altogether when you fetch the head of this gully youll be blame lucky said the freighter give that beast a whack to start him get up there  they went on with the snow in their faces and the stones they could not see slipping beneath their feet and the light grew dimmer as they proceeded a bitter wind swept down the gully and drove their wet clothing against their chilled bodies while the hillside growing steeper pushed them nearer the brink of the awful hollow the slope of the latter as far down as they could see was apparently too steep to afford a foothold and every now and then there was a roar and a rattle as the stones they dislodged plunged into the depths of it weston plodding along behind the freighter however kept his eyes fixed for the most part on the face of the hill for it seemed to him that the cost of changing that perilous passage into a reasonably safe trail would not be excessive  when they had climbed for an hour the snow grew thicker and it became evident that the light was dying out rapidly the freighter announced that he could scarcely see a dozen yards ahead and weston could discern no more than the blurred shape of the horse that floundered over the slippery stones a few paces in front of him he could however hear devine encouraging the one he led and occasionally breaking out into hoarse expletives  its gluey feet they want said the latter when they stopped for a minute or two you cant expect horses to crawl up a wall  theyve managed about half of it weston declared we could make this quite an easy trail with a little grading its the only really difficult spot  well said devine dryly i guess you could in this country they call any trail easy that you can crawl up on your hands and knees still that little gradings going to cost you about two thousand dollars a mile  they could scarcely see one another when they went on again and the sound of their footsteps was muffled by the sliding snow weston could dimly make out something that moved on in front of him but it had no certain shape and he stumbled heavily every now and then as the stones rolled round beneath him he gripped the packhorses bridle in a halfnumbed hand but as he admitted afterward he made no attempt to lead the beast he said he rather clung to it for company for the others vanished now and then for minutes amidst the whirling snow  suddenly there was a crash and a cry behind him for a moment he stood halfdazed with his hand on the bridle while the jaded horse plunged then he let it go as the freighter appeared and together they stumbled back to where devine was clinging to the bridle of another horse which lay close at his feet amidst a wreath of snow he staggered back just as they reached him there was a frantic scrambling in the snow and then the halfseen horse rolled over and slid away down the white slope of the gully  they watched it horrified for a moment or two and said nothing for a brief space when it vanished altogether into the obscurity the sight was more unpleasant because they knew that they had seen only the commencement of that awful journey then devine who was white and gasping made a deprecatory gesture  i dont know whether it was my fault he said the beast stumbled and almost jerked me over then i guess the bridle either broke or pulled out  two horses and four bags of ore and were not through yet commented the freighter guess its going to cost you something if you pack much paydirt out over dead pine trail anyway youll have to get that grading done before i come back here again  get on said weston quietly  they struggled on and in another halfhour the gully died out and lost itself in the hillside after which they made a rather faster pace over the thinning talus still it was snowing hard and none of them was capable of much further exertion when soaked through and white all over they limped into the lee of a ridge of rock on the crest of the divide a bitter wind wailed above them but there was a little shelter beneath the wall of ragged stone and picketing the jaded horses they lay down in their wet blankets packed close together in a hollow when their frugal meal was over there was nothing they might make a fire with on that empty windswept plateau  any one unused to the gold trail would have lain awake shivering that night and in all probability would have found it very difficult to set out again the next morning for a horrible ache in the hip is as a rule not the least unpleasant result of such experiences but these men slept and took up the trail almost fresh with the first of the daylight it was by no means the first time they had slept out in the open in the frost or rain and fed on wet unwarmed food  in due time they reached the settlement on the railroad and after delivering the remaining bags of ore to the stationagent and leaving the freighter with his horses weston went back along the trail with devine descending the gully in clear daylight they reached the grenfell camp without misadventure  it was some time later when the freighter coming up by the other route with provisions brought them a letter it was from the manager of the reducing plant who stated that the yield of the ore sent him for treatment was eminently satisfactory and he enclosed a certificate with particulars as they had requested probably with a view to further business he also offered to purchase any of the grenfell shares they might have to dispose of  saunders eyes gleamed as he handed the certificate around  i guess thats going to send our stock up with a bang he said well put it right into wannops hands so he can get a notice of the new mineral field into the papers the smelter man doesnt seem to know that the last news we had was that the grenfell stock was tumbling down but when hes open to buy its a sure thing that he figures it will soon stand at a big premium  then he waved his hand impressively  after what weston has told us boys you want to get hold of the significance of that people have been selling our stock way down on the notion that before they had to deliver they could cover at a still lower figure now they cant buy it were going to smash them flat  they celebrated the occasion that night with the most elaborate meal devine could prepare and invited as many as possible of their neighbors who also had struck what promised to be payable milling ore as it happened their satisfaction was fully warranted for a few days after westons letter arrived in montreal two gentlemen connected with western mines called on wannop stirling was sitting in the latters office at the time and he made no sign of retiring when they entered  we should like a few minutes conversation with you about the grenfell stock said one of the strangers naturally wed prefer to have it alone  wannop looked at stirling who smiled and answered the man  im afraid youll have to put up with my presence he said in fact this is a pleasure that ive been expecting for the last few days  what standing has mr stirling in this matter the stranger asked  i hold most of the grenfell stock thats likely to be salable said stirling dryly you cant pick up much on the market which is presumably why you have come to wannop seems to me you have been selling rather heavily  if wed known you were in it we might have let the thing alone one of the men admitted  youre going to realize that its quite a pity you didnt  the men looked at each other and one of them turned to stirling  ill get to the point he said we have certainly been selling and now that settling day is almost on us we find that we cant buy in now of course if you hold most of the available stock you have the whip hand of us well admit that right away and were quite prepared to face any reasonable tax you and wannop may think fit to exact still it might be wiser to be reasonable  how much do you want stirling asked  they told him how many shares and stirling appeared to consider  well he said what are you going to offer  one wrote something on a strip of paper and handed it to the other who nodded and made an offer  thats our idea he said i dont mind admitting that it will cost us twenty cents on the dollar  no said stirling its going to cost you just whatever i like to call it i can swing every dollar that stock stands for up to two or three will you do me the favor to glance at that certificate  wannop handed it to the nearest man and the latters face fell  now said stirling at the moment youre the only people anxious to buy but ive only to send that certificate and a nicely workedup account of the rich new find around to the press and everybody with a dollar to spare will be wanting grenfell stock still therell be no shares availableive made sure of that ill ask you as men with some knowledge of these matters wheres the price going to  one of the men sat down limply  whatll you take to hold the thing over until after settling day he asked  in money inquired stirling whose face grew hard if you put it that way well call it half your personal estate  the second man who saw that his companion had been injudicious hastily broke in  no he said in the shape of mutual accommodation perhaps theres some little arrangement you might like us to make  stirling laughed anyway why should you want to make an offer of that kind suppose i held the certificate over it wouldnt straighten things out for you you have to deliver to the people who acted on my behalf so much grenfell stock and you cant get itnow  thats true was the dejected answer what are you going to do  that said stirling grimly is a matter that must stand over until i can send for the man who found the grenfell mine i cant tell you what course hes likely to adopt but in the meantime id like to point out just how you stand you set in motion the laws of supply and demand to break a struggling man theyre the only ones you recognize but as it happens theyre immutable laws that work both ways and youre hard up against them now its not a pleasant situation but i cant say how far we may be disposed to let you off it until ive had a talk with mr weston after that ill send for you  there was nothing more to be said and when the two men went out stirling turned to wannop  if you can get a wire through to mr weston tell him to come back at once  ill have it done said wannop he said he had sent an indian to wait for letters or messages at the nearest railroad settlement you have those men in your clutches you could break them if you wanted to  well laughed stirling on the whole im more disposed to make them hand over a moderate sum and to let them off after that on condition that in the future they keep their hands off the grenfell consolidated  youd take their word wannop asked  yes said stirling with an air of whimsical reflection in this case anyway i most think i could theyve had about enough of the grenfell consols i guess they found them prickly  then he went out and wannop despatched a telegram to weston who left the mine immediately after it reached him somewhat to his astonishment he found stirling awaiting him when he sprang down from the car platform in the station at montreal and the latter smiled benevolently as he grasped his hand  ida would have come along if id let her he explained i felt however id better make things clear to you before you saw her well go straight to wannops office and have a little talk  it did not take wannop long to explain the situation and when he judiciously left weston and stirling alone together the latter smiled at his companion  well he said as the specimens we have just been handling seem quite as rich as the last lot its evident that your share in the grenfell will keep you comfortable and as far as im concerned theres no reason why you and ida should not set up housekeeping as soon as you like now its my intention to hand her a block of the grenfell stock as part of her wedding present on condition that she takes your advice as to what she does with it id just like to suggest that you make the people who want that stock subscribe quite smartly and then let them off its not wise to push a beaten enemy too far  weston who agreed with this expressed his thanks and then asked a question  wannop mentioned one lot of six hundred shares where did you get those  they were thrown on the market by an english holder i believe you gave some stock to friends over there  i did on condition that they didnt sell without consulting me  then it seems that somebody must have gone back on you  westons face grew a trifle flushed  i think he said well let that subject drop altogether its a rather painful one  stirling made a sign of comprehension  well he said ive other business on hand and i guess ida is expecting you  weston took the hint and not long afterward ida was smiling up at him with shining eyes they had a good deal to tell each other and some time had passed when ida said  well go back to the bush again as soon as the snow melts if only for a week or two then she flashed a quick glance at him that is unless you are longing for a trip to england  a shadow crept into westons face as he remembered the six hundred shares but he smiled a moment later  no he said well go over there together by and bybut not just now well camp beside the lake where i met you first instead  after a while ida lifted his right hand gently and glanced down at the battered knuckles and broken nails  im glad its hard and strongstrong enough to keep me safe and those scars will wear off dear she said there are scars of another kind that dontbut with those you and i have nothing to do  then she looked up at him  do you know what first made me think of you  i dont replied weston smiling in fact i have often wondered  then said ida ill show you i mentioned the picture once before but you didnt think it worth while to look at it that was left to me i looked at it very often while you were away  she led him across the room and weston started and flushed when she took out the picture arabella kinnaird had made  no said ida i really dont think you have any reason to regret your conduct that eventful evening  i never fancied that you or miss kinnaird saw me laughed weston im afraid it was a remarkably foolish action  it was one of the little actions that have big results said ida and in this she was correct for one must reap as one has sown then she looked up at him  if you hadnt taken grenfells part that night you would not have found the mine  weston smiled and gripped the hand he held in a tightening clasp  the mine he said grenfell gave me you     the end     a few of grosset
