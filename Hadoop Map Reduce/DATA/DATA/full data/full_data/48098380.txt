48098380	the novels tales and sketches of j m barrie  auld licht idylls        frontispiece photograph of j m barrie    published in new york by charles scribners sons 1896  authors edition copyright 1896 by charles scribners sons     to  frederick greenwood     introduction  this is the only american edition of my books produced with my sanction and i have special reasons for thanking messrs scribner for its publication they let it be seen by this edition what are my books for i know not how many volumes purporting to be by me are in circulation in america which are no books of mine  i have seen several of these bearing such titles as two of them an auld licht manse a tillyloss scandal and some of them announce themselves as authors editions or published by arrangement with the author  they consist of scraps collected and published without my knowledge and i entirely disown them  i have written no books save those that appear in this edition  i am asked to write a few lines on the front page of each of these volumes to say something as i take it about how they came into being  well they were written mainly to please one woman who is now dead but as i am writing a little book about my mother i shall say no more of her here  many of the chapters in auld licht idylls first appeared in a different form in the st jamess gazette and there is little doubt that they would never have appeared anywhere but for the encouragement given to me by the editor of that paper  it was pressure from him that induced me to write a second idyll and a third after i thought the first completed the picture he set me thinking seriously of these people and though he knew nothing of them himself may be said to have led me back to them  it seems odd and yet i am not the first nor the fiftieth who has left thrums at sunrise to seek the lifework that was all the time awaiting him at home  and we seldom sally forth a second time  i had always meant to be a novelist but london i thought was the quarry  for long i had an uneasy feeling that no one save the editor read my contributions for i was leading a lonely life in london and not another editor could i find in the land willing to print the scotch dialect  the magazines scotch and english would have nothing to say to mei think i tried them all with the courting of tnowheads bell but it never found shelter until it got within bookcovers  in time however i found another paper the british weekly with an editor as bold as my first or shall we say he suffered from the same infirmity  he revived my drooping hopes and i was again able to turn to the only kind of literary work i now seemed to have much interest in  he let me sign my articles which was a big step for me and led to my having requests for work from elsewhere but always the invitations said not scotchthe public will not read dialect  by this time i had put together from these two sources and from my drawerful of rejected stories this book of auld licht idylls and in its collected form it again went the rounds  i offered it to certain firms as a gift but they would not have it even at that  and then on a day came actually an offer for it from messrs hodder and stoughton for this and for many another kindness i had the editor of the british weekly to thank  thus the book was published at last and as for messrs hodder and stoughton i simply dare not say what a generous firm i found them lest it send too many aspirants to their doors but indeed i have had the pleasantest relations with all my publishers  better dead is by my wish no longer on sale in great britain and i should have preferred not to see it here for it is in no way worthy of the beautiful clothes messrs scribner have given it  weighted with an edinburgh eleven it would rest very comfortably in the mill dam but the publishers have reasons for its inclusion among them i suspect is a wellgrounded fear that if i once began to hack and hew i should not stop until i had reduced the edition to two volumes  this juvenile effort is a field of prickles into which none may be advised to penetratei made the attempt lately in cold blood and came back shuddering but i had read enough to have the profoundest reason for declining to tell what the book is about  and yet i have a sentimental interest in better dead for it was my firstpublished when i had small hope of getting any one to accept the scotchand there was a week when i loved to carry it in my pocket and did not think it dead weight  once i almost saw it find a purchaser  she was a pretty girl and it lay on a bookstall and she read some pages and smiled and then retired and came back and began another chapter  several times she did this and i stood in the background trembling with hope and fear at last she went away without the book but i am still of opinion that had it been just a little bit better she would have bought it     contents      i the schoolhouse    ii thrums   iii the auld licht

early this morning i opened a window in my schoolhouse in the glen of quharity awakened by the shivering of a starving sparrow against the frosted glass  as the snowy sash creaked in my hand he made off to the waterspout that suspends its tangles of ice over a gaping tank and rebounding from that with a quiver of his little black breast bobbed through the network of wire and joined a few of his fellows in a forlorn hop round the henhouse in search of food  two days ago my hilarious bantamcock saucy to the last my cheeriest companion was found frozen in his own watertrough the cornsaucer in three pieces by his side  since then i have taken the hens into the house  at mealtimes they litter the hearth with each others feathers but for the most part they give little trouble roosting on the rafters of the lowroofed kitchen among staves and fishingrods  another white blanket has been spread upon the glen since i looked out last night for over the same wilderness of snow that has met my gaze for a week i see the steading of waster lunny sunk deeper into the waste  the schoolhouse i suppose serves similarly as a snowmark for the people at the farm  unless that is waster lunnys grieve foddering the cattle in the snow not a living thing is visible  the ghostlike hills that pen in the glen have ceased to echo to the sharp crack of the sportsmans gun so clear in the frosty air as to be a warning to every rabbit and partridge in the valley and only giant catlaw shows here and there a black ridge rearing its head at the entrance to the glen and struggling ineffectually to cast off his shroud  most wintry sign of all i think as i close the window hastily is the open farmstile its poles lying embedded in the snow where they were last flung by waster lunnys herd  through the still air comes from a distance a vibration as of a tuningfork a robin perhaps alighting on the wire of a broken fence  in the warm kitchen where i dawdle over my breakfast the widowed bantamhen has perched on the back of my drowsy cat  it is needless to go through the form of opening the school today for with the exception of waster lunnys girl i have had no scholars for nine days yesterday she announced that there would be no more schooling till it was fresh as she wasna comin and indeed though the smoke from the farm chimneys is a pretty prospect for a snowedup schoolmaster the trudge between the two houses must be weary work for a bairn  as for the other children who have to come from all parts of the hills and glen i may not see them for weeks  last year the school was practically deserted for a month  a pleasant outlook with the march examinations staring me in the face and an inspector fresh from oxford  i wonder what he would say if he saw me today digging myself out of the schoolhouse with the spade i now keep for the purpose in my bedroom  the kail grows brittle from the snow in my dank and cheerless garden a crust of bread gathers timid pheasants round me  the robins i see have made the coalhouse their home  waster lunnys dog never barks without rousing my sluggish cat to a joyful response  it is dutch courage with the birds and beasts of the glen hard driven for food but i look attentively for them in these long forenoons and they have begun to regard me as one of themselves  my breath freezes despite my pipe as i peer from the door and with a fortnightold newspaper i retire to the inglenook  the friendliest thing i have seen today is the wellsmoked ham suspended from my kitchen rafters  it was a gift from the farm of tullin with a load of peats the day before the snow began to fall  i doubt if i have seen a cart since  this afternoon i was the not altogether passive spectator of a curious scene in natural history  my feet encased in stout tackety boots i had waded down two of waster lunnys fields to the glen burn in summer the neverfailing larder from which with wriggling worm or garish fly i can any morning whip a savoury breakfast in the wintertime the only thing in the valley that defies the icekings chloroform  i watched the water twisting black and solemn through the snow the ragged ice on its edge proof of the toughness of the struggle with the frost from which it has after all crept only half victorious  a bare wild rosebush on the further bank was violently agitated and then there ran from its root a blackheaded rat with wings  such was the general effect  i was not less interested when my startled eyes divided this phenomenon into its component parts and recognized in the disturbance on the opposite bank only another fierce struggle among the hungry animals for existence they need no professor to teach them the doctrine of the survival of the fittest  a weasel had gripped a waterhen whitrit and beltie they are called in these parts cowering at the root of the rosebush and was being dragged down the bank by the terrified bird which made for the water as its only chance of escape  in less disadvantageous circumstances the weasel would have made short work of his victim but as he only had the bird by the tail the prospects of the combatants were equalized  it was the tugofwar being played with a life as the stakes  if i do not reach the water was the argument that went on in the heaving little breast of the one i am a dead bird  if this waterhen reasoned the other reaches the burn my supper vanishes with her  down the sloping bank the hen had distinctly the best of it but after that came a yard of level snow and here she tugged and screamed in vain  i had so far been an unobserved spectator but my sympathies were with the beltie and thinking it high time to interfere i jumped into the water  the waterhen gave one mighty final tug and toppled into the burn while the weasel viciously showed me his teeth and then stole slowly up the bank to the rosebush whence girning he watched me lift his exhausted victim from the water and set off with her for the schoolhouse  except for her draggled tail she already looks wonderfully composed and so long as the frost holds i shall have little difficulty in keeping her with me  on sunday i found a frozen sparrow whose heart had almost ceased to beat in the disused pigsty and put him for warmth into my breastpocket  the ungrateful little scrub bolted without a word of thanks about ten minutes afterwards to the alarm of my cat which had not known his whereabouts  i am alone in the schoolhouse  on just such an evening as this last year my desolation drove me to waster lunny where i was stormstayed for the night  the recollection decides me to court my own warm hearth to challenge my right hand again to a game at the dambrod against my left  i do not lock the schoolhouse door at nights for even a highwayman there is no such luck would be received with open arms and i doubt if there be a barred door in all the glen  but it is cosier to put on the shutters  the road to thrums has lost itself miles down the valley  i wonder what they are doing out in the world though i am the free church precentor in thrums ten pounds a year and the little town is five miles away they have not seen me for three weeks  a packman whom i thawed yesterday at my kitchen fire tells me that last sabbath only the auld lichts held service  other people realized that they were snowed up  far up the glen after it twists out of view a manse and half a dozen thatched cottages that are there may still show a candle light and the crumbling gravestones keep cold vigil round the grey old kirk  heavy shadows fade into the sky to the north  a flake trembles against the window but it is too cold for much snow tonight  the shutter bars the outer world from the schoolhouse     chapter ii  thrums  thrums is the name i give here to the handful of houses jumbled together in a cup which is the town nearest the schoolhouse  until twenty years ago its every other room earthenfloored and showing the rafters overhead had a handloom and hundreds of weavers lived and died thoreaus ben the hoose without knowing it  in those days the cup overflowed and left several houses on the top of the hill where their cold skeletons still stand  the road that climbs from the square which is thrumss heart to the north is so steep and straight that in a sharp frost children hunker at the top and are blown down with a roar and a rush on rails of ice  at such times when viewed from the cemetery where the traveller from the schoolhouse gets his first glimpse of the little town thrums is but two church steeples and a dozen red stone patches standing out of a snowheap  one of the steeples belongs to the new free kirk and the other to the parish church both of which the first auld licht minister i knew ran past when he had not time to avoid them by taking a back wynd  he was but a pocket edition of a man who grew two inches after he was called but he was so full of the cure of souls that he usually scudded to it with his coattails quarrelling behind him  his successor whom i knew better was a greater scholar and said let us see what this is in the original greek as an ordinary man might invite a friend to dinner but he never wrestled as mr dishart his successor did with the pulpit cushions nor flung himself at the pulpit door  nor was he so hard on the book as lang tammas the precentor expressed it meaning that he did not bang the bible with his fist as much as might have been wished  thrums had been known to me for years before i succeeded the captious dominie at the schoolhouse in the glen  the dear old soul who originally induced me to enter the auld licht kirk by lamenting the want of christ in the ministers discourses was my first landlady for the last ten years of her life she was bedridden and only her interest in the kirk kept her alive  her case against the minister was that he did not call to denounce her sufficiently often for her sins her pleasure being to hear him bewailing her on his knees as one who was probably past praying for  she was as sweet and pure a woman as i ever knew and had her wishes been horses she would have sold them and kept and looked after a minister herself  there are few auld licht communities in scotland nowadaysperhaps because people are now so well off for the most devout auld lichts were always poor and their last years were generally a grim struggle with the workhouse  many a heavyeyed backbent weaver has won his waterloo in thrums fighting on his stumps  there are a score or two of them left still for though there are now two factories in the town the clatter of the handloom can yet be heard and they have been starving themselves of late until they have saved up enough money to get another minister  the square is packed away in the centre of thrums and irregularly built little houses squeeze close to it like chickens clustering round a hen  once the auld lichts held property in the square but other denominations have bought them out of it and now few of them are even to be found in the main streets that make for the rim of the cup  they live in the kirkwynd or in retiring little houses the builder of which does not seem to have remembered that it is a good plan to have a road leading to houses until after they were finished  narrow paths straggling round gardens some of them with stunted gates which it is commoner to step over than to open have been formed to reach these dwellings but in winter they are running streams and then the best way to reach a house such as that of tammy mealmaker the wright pronounced wiricht is over a broken dyke and a pigsty  tammy who died a bachelor had been soured in his youth by a disappointment in love of which he spoke but seldom  she lived far away in a town to which he had wandered in the days when his blood ran hot and they became engaged  unfortunately however tammy forgot her name and he never knew the address so there the affair ended to his silent grief he admitted himself over his snuffmull of an evening that he was a very ordinary character but a certain halo of horror was cast over the whole family by their connection with little joey sutie who was pointed at in thrums as the laddie that whistled when he went past the minister  joey became a pedlar and was found dead one raw morning dangling over a high wall within a few miles of thrums  when climbing the dyke his pack had slipped back the strap round his neck and choked him  you could generally tell an auld licht in thrums when you passed him his dull vacant face wrinkled over a heavy wob  he wore tags of yarn round his trousers beneath the knee that looked like ostentatious garters and frequently his jacket of corduroy was put on beneath his waistcoat  if he was too old to carry his load on his back he wheeled it on a creaking barrow and when he met a friend they said ay jeames and ay davit and then could think of nothing else  at long intervals they passed through the square disappearing or coming into sight round the townhouse which stands on the south side of it and guards the entrance to a steep brae that leads down and then twists up on its lonely way to the county town  i like to linger over the square for it was from an upper window in it that i got to know thrums  on saturday nights when the auld licht young men came into the square dressed and washed to look at the young women errandgoing and to laugh sometime afterwards to each other it presented a glare of light and here even came the cheap jacks and the fair circassian and the showman who besides playing the mountain maid and the shepherds bride exhibited part of the tail of balaams ass the helm of noahs ark and the tartan plaid in which flora mcdonald wrapped prince charlie  more select entertainment such as shuffle kittys waxwork whose motto was a rag to pay and in you go were given in a hall whose approach was by an outside stair  on the muckle friday the fair for which children storing their pocket money would accumulate sevenpencehalfpenny in less than six months the square was crammed with gingerbread stalls bagpipers fiddlers and monstrosities who were gifted with second sight  there was a bearded man who had neither legs nor arms and was drawn through the streets in a small cart by four dogs  by looking at you he could see all the clockwork inside as could a boy who was led about by his mother at the end of a string  every friday there was the market when a dozen ramshackle carts containing vegetables and cheap crockery filled the centre of the square resting in line on their shafts  a score of farmers wives or daughters in oldworld garments squatted against the townhouse within walls of butter on cabbageleaves eggs and chickens  towards evening the voice of the buckieman shook the square and rival fishcadgers terrible characters who ran races on horseback screamed libels at each other over a fruiterers barrow  then it was time for douce auld lichts to go home draw their stools near the fire spread their red handkerchiefs over their legs to prevent their trousers getting singed and read their pilgrims progress  in my schoolhouse however i seem to see the square most readily in the scotch mist which so often filled it loosening the stones and choking the drains  there was then no rattle of rain against my windowsill nor dancing of diamond drops on the roofs but blobs of water grew on the panes of glass to reel heavily down them  then the sodden square would have shed abundant tears if you could have taken it in your hands and wrung it like a dripping cloth  at such a time the square would be empty but for one vegetable cart left in the care of a lean collie which tied to the wheel whined and shivered underneath pools of water gather in the coarse sacks that have been spread over the potatoes and bundles of greens which turn to manure in their lidless barrels  the eyes of the whimpering dog never leave a black close over which hangs the sign of the bull probably the refuge of the hawker  at long intervals a farmers gig rumbles over the bumpy illpaved square or a native with his head buried in his coat peeps out of doors skurries across the way and vanishes  most of the leading shops are here and the decorous draper ventures a few yards from the pavement to scan the sky or note the effect of his new arrangement in scarves  planted against his door is the butcher henders todd whiteaproned and with a knife in his hand gazing interestedly at the draper for a mere man may look at an elder  the tinsmith brings out his steps and mounting them stealthily removes the saucepans and pepperpots that dangle on a wire above his signboard  pulling to his door he shuts out the foggy light that showed in his solderstrewn workshop  the square is deserted again  a bundle of sloppy parsley slips from the hawkers cart and topples over the wheel in driblets  the puddles in the sacks overflow and run together  the dog has twisted his chain round a barrel and yelps sharply  as if in response comes a rush of other dogs  a terrified foxterrier tears across the square with half a score of mongrels the butchers mastiff and some collies at his heels he is doubtless a stranger who has insulted them by his glossy coat  for two seconds the square shakes to an invasion of dogs and then again there is only one dog in sight  no one will admit the scotch mist  it looks saft  the tinsmith wudna wonder but what it was makkin for rain  tammas haggart and pete lunan dander into sight bareheaded and have to stretch out their hands to discover what the weather is like  by and by they come to a standstill to discuss the immortality of the soul and then they are looking silently at the bull  neither speaks but they begin to move toward the inn at the same time and its door closes on them before they know what they are doing  a few minutes afterwards jinny dundas who is petes wife runs straight for the bull in her short gown which is tucked up very high and emerges with her husband soon afterwards jinny is voluble but pete says nothing  tammas follows later putting his head out at the door first and looking cautiously about him to see if any one is in sight  pete is a u p and may be left to his fate but the auld licht minister thinks that though it be hard work tammas is worth saving  to the auld licht of the past there were three degrees of damnationauld kirk playacting chapel  chapel was the name always given to the english church of which i am too much an auld licht myself to care to write even now  to belong to the chapel was in thrums to be a roman catholic and the boy who flung a clod of earth at the english ministerwho called the sabbath sundayor dropped a divet down his chimney was held to be in the right way  the only pleasant story thrums could tell of the chapel was that its steeple once fell  it is surprising that an english church was ever suffered to be built in such a place though probably the county gentry had something to do with it  they travelled about too much to be good men small though thrums used to be it had four kirks in all before the disruption and then another which split into two immediately afterwards  the spire of the parish church known as the auld kirk commands a view of the square from which the entrance to the kirkyard would be visible if it were not hidden by the townhouse  the kirkyard has long been crammed and is not now in use but the church is sufficiently large to hold nearly all the congregations in thrums just at the gate lived pete todd the father of saml a man of whom the auld lichts had reason to be proud  pete was an everyday man at ordinary times and was even said when his wife who had been long ill died to have clapped his hands and exclaimed hip hip hurrah adding only as an afterthought the lords will be done  but midsummer was his great opportunity  then took place the rouping of the seats in the parish church  the scene was the kirk itself and the seats being put up to auction were knocked down to the highest bidder this sometimes led to the breaking of the peace  every person was present who was at all particular as to where he sat and an auctioneer was engaged for the day  he rouped the kirkseats like potatodrills beginning by asking for a bid  every seat was put up to auction separately for some were much more run after than others and the men were instructed by their wives what to bid for  often the women joined in and as they bid excitedly against each other the church rang with opprobrious epithets  a man would come to the roup late and learn that the seat he wanted had been knocked down  he maintained that he had been unfairly treated or denounced the local laird to whom the seatrents went  if he did not get the seat he would leave the kirk then the woman who had forestalled him wanted to know what he meant by glaring at her so and the auction was interrupted  another member would thrip down the throat of the auctioneer that he had a right to his former seat if he continued to pay the same price for it  the auctioneer was screamed at for favouring his friends and at times the roup became so noisy that men and women had to be forcibly ejected then was petes chance  hovering at the gate he caught the angry people on their way home and took them into his workshop by an outside stair  there he assisted them in denouncing the parish kirk with the view of getting them to forswear it  pete made a good many auld lichts in his time out of unpromising material  sights were to be witnessed in the parish church at times that could not have been made more impressive by the auld lichts themselves  here sinful women were grimly taken to task by the minister who having thundered for a time against adultery in general called upon one sinner in particular to stand forth  she had to step forward into a pew near the pulpit where alone and friendless and stared at by the congregation she cowered in tears beneath his denunciations  in that seat she had to remain during the forenoon service  she returned home alone and had to come back alone to her solitary seat in the afternoon  all day no one dared speak to her  she was as much an object of contumely as the thieves and smugglers whom in the end of last century it was the privilege of feudal bailie wood as he was called to whip round the square  it is nearly twenty years since the gardeners had their last walk in thrums and they survived all the other benefit societies that walked once every summer  there was a weavers walk and five or six others the womens walk being the most picturesque  these were processions of the members of benefit societies through the square and wynds and all the women walked in white to the number of a hundred or more behind the tilliedrum band thrums having in those days no band of its own  from the northwest corner of the square a narrow street sets off jerking this way and that as if uncertain what point to make for  here lurks the postoffice which had once the reputation of being as crooked in its ways as the street itself  a railway line runs into thrums now  the sensational days of the postoffice were when the letters were conveyed officially in a creaking old cart from tilliedrum  the pony had seen better days than the cart and always looked as if he were just on the point of succeeding in running away from it  hooky crewe was driver socalled because an iron hook was his substitute for a right arm robbie proctor the blacksmith made the hook and fixed it in  crewe suffered from rheumatism and when he felt it coming on he stayed at home sometimes his cart came undone in a snowdrift when hooky extricated from the fragments by some chance wayfarer was deposited with his mailbag of which he always kept a grip by the hook in a farmhouse it was his boast that his letters always reached their destination eventually  they might be a long time about it but slow and sure was his motto  hooky emphasized his slow and sure by taking a snuff he was a godsend to the postmistress for to his failings or the infirmities of his gig were charged all delays  at the time i write of the posting of the letter took as long and was as serious an undertaking as the writing  that means a good deal for many of the letters were written to dictation by the thrums schoolmaster mr fleemister who belonged to the auld kirk  he was one of the few persons in the community who looked upon the despatch of his letters by the postmistress as his right and not a favour on her part there was a longstanding feud between them accordingly  after a few tumblers of widow stabless treaclebeerin the concoction of which she was the acknowledged mistress for miles aroundthe schoolmaster would sometimes go the length of hinting that he could get the postmistress dismissed any day  this mighty power seemed to rest on a knowledge of steamed letters  thrums had a high respect for the schoolmaster but among themselves the weavers agreed that even if he did write to the government lizzie harrison the postmistress would refuse to transmit the letter  the more shrewd ones among us kept friends with both parties for unless you could write writhand you could not compose a letter without the schoolmasters assistance and unless lizzie was so courteous as to send it to its destination it might lieor so it was thoughtmuch too long in the box  a letter addressed by the schoolmaster found great disfavour in lizzies eyes you might explain to her that you had merely called in his assistance because you were a poor hand at writing yourself but that was held no excuse  some addressed their own envelopes with much labour and sought to palm off the whole as their handiwork  it reflects on the postmistress somewhat that she had generally found them out by next day when if in a specially vixenish mood she did not hesitate to upbraid them for their perfidy  to post a letter you did not merely saunter to the postoffice and drop it into the box  the cautious correspondent first went into the shop and explained to lizzie how matters stood  she kept what she called a booksellers shop as well as the postoffice but the supply of books corresponded exactly to the lack of demand for them and her chief trade was in nicknacks from marbles and moneyboxes up to concertinas if he found the postmistress in an amiable mood which was only now and then the caller led up craftily to the object of his visit  having discussed the weather and the potatodisease he explained that his sister mary whom lizzie would remember had married a fishmonger in dundee  the fishmonger had lately started on himself and was doing well  they had four children  the youngest had had a severe attack of measles  no news had been got of mary for twelve months and annie his other sister who lived in thrums had been at him of late for not writing  so he had written a few lines and in fact he had the letter with him  the letter was then produced and examined by the postmistress  if the address was in the schoolmasters handwriting she professed her inability to read it  was this a t or an l or an i was that a b or a d  this was a cruel revenge on lizzies part for the sender of the letter was completely at her mercy  the schoolmasters name being tabooed in her presence he was unable to explain that the writing was not his own and as for deciding between the ts and ls he could not do it  eventually he would be directed to put the letter into the box  they would do their best with it lizzie said but in a voice that suggested how little hope she had of her efforts to decipher it proving successful  there was an opinion among some of the people that the letter should not be stamped by the sender  the proper thing to do was to drop a penny for the stamp into the box along with the letter and then lizzie would see that it was all right  lizzies acquaintance with the handwriting of every person in the place who could write gave her a great advantage  you would perhaps drop into her shop some day to make a purchase when she would calmly produce a letter you had posted several days before  in explanation she would tell you that you had not put a stamp on it or that she suspected there was money in it or that you had addressed it to the wrong place  i remember an old man a relative of my own who happened for once in his life to have several letters to post at one time  the circumstance was so out of the common that he considered it only reasonable to make lizzie a small present  perhaps the postmistress was belled but if she did not steam the letters and confide their titbits to favoured friends of her own sex it is difficult to see how all the gossip got out  the schoolmaster once played an unmanly trick on her with the view of catching her in the act  he was a bachelor who had long been given up by all the maids in the town  one day however he wrote a letter to an imaginary lady in the countytown asking her to be his and going into full particulars about his income his age and his prospects  a male friend in the secret at the other end was to reply in a ladys handwriting accepting him and also giving personal particulars  the first letter was written and an answer arrived in due coursetwo days the schoolmaster said after date  no other person knew of this scheme for the undoing of the postmistress yet in a very short time the schoolmasters coming marriage was the talk of thrums  everybody became suddenly aware of the ladys name of her abode and of the sum of money she was to bring her husband  it was even noised abroad that the schoolmaster had represented his age as a good ten years less than it was  then the schoolmaster divulged everything  to his mortification he was not quite believed  all the proof he could bring forward to support his story was this that time would show whether he got married or not  foolish man this argument was met by another which was accepted at once  the lady had jilted the schoolmaster whether this explanation came from the postoffice who shall say  but so long as he lived the schoolmaster was twitted about the lady who threw him over  he took his revenge in two ways  he wrote and posted letters exceedingly abusive of the postmistress  the matter might be libellous but then as he pointed out she would incriminate herself if she brought him up about it  probably lizzie felt his other insult more  by publishing his suspicions of her on every possible occasion he got a few people to seal their letters  so bitter was his feeling against her that he was even willing to supply the wax  they know all about postoffices in thrums now and even jeer at the telegraphboys uniform  in the old days they gathered round him when he was seen in the street and escorted him to his destination in triumph  that too was after lizzie had gone the way of all the earth  but perhaps they are not even yet as knowing as they think themselves  i was told the other day that one of them took out a postal order meaning to send the money to a relative and kept the order as a receipt  i have said that the town is sometimes full of snow  one frosty saturday seven years ago i trudged into it from the schoolhouse and on the monday morning we could not see thrums anywhere  i was in one of the proud twostoried houses in the place and could have shaken hands with my friends without from the upper windows  to get out of doors you had to walk upstairs  the outlook was a sea of snow fading into white hills and sky with the quarry standing out red and ragged to the right like a rock in the ocean  the auld licht manse was gone but had left its gardentrees behind their lean branches soft with snow  roofs were humps in the white blanket  the spire of the established kirk stood up cold and stiff like a monument to the buried inhabitants  those of the natives who had taken the precaution of conveying spades into their houses the night before which is my plan at the schoolhouse dug themselves out  they hobbled cautiously over the snow sometimes sinking into it to their knees when they stood still and slowly took in the situation  it had been snowing more or less for a week but in a commonplace kind of way and they had gone to bed thinking all was well  this night the snow must have fallen as if the heavens had opened up determined to shake themselves free of it for ever  the man who first came to himself and saw what was to be done was young henders ramsay  henders had no fixed occupation being but an orra man about the place and the best thing known of him is that his mothers sister was a baptist  he feared god man nor the minister and all the learning he had was obtained from assiduous study of a grocers window  but for one brief day he had things his own way in the town or speaking strictly on the top of it  with a spade a broom and a pickaxe which sat lightly on his broad shoulders he was not even backbent and that showed him no respectable weaver henders delved his way to the nearest house which formed one of a row and addressed the inmates down the chimney  they had already been clearing it at the other end or his words would have been choked  youre snawed up davit cried henders in a voice that was entirely businesslike hae ye a spade  a conversation ensued up and down this unusual channel of communication  the unlucky householder taking no thought of the morrow was without a spade  but if henders would clear away the snow from his door he would be varra obleeged  henders however had to come to terms first  the chairge is saxpence davit he shouted  then a haggling ensued  henders must be neighbourly  a plate of broth nowor say twopence  but henders was obdurate ise nae time to argybargy wi ye davit  gin yere no willin to say saxpence im aff to willum pyatts  hes buried too  so the victim had to make up his mind to one of two things he must either say saxpence or remain where he was  if henders was promised he took good care that no snowedup inhabitant should perjure himself  he made his way to a window first and clearing the snow from the top of it pointed out that he could not conscientiously proceed further until the debt had been paid money doon he cried as soon as he reached a pane of glass or come awa wi my saxpence noo  the belief that this day had not come to henders unexpectedly was borne out by the method of the crafty callant  his charges varied from sixpence to halfacrown according to the wealth and status of his victims and when later on there were rivals in the snow he had the discrimination to reduce his minimum fee to threepence  he had the honour of digging out three ministers at one shilling one and threepence and two shillings respectively  half a dozen times within the next fortnight the town was reburied in snow  this generally happened in the nighttime but the inhabitants were not to be caught unprepared again  spades stood ready to their hands in the morning and they fought their way above ground without henders ramsays assistance  to clear the snow from the narrow wynds and pends however was a task not to be attempted and the auld lichts at least rested content when enough light got into their workshops to let them see where their looms stood  wading through beds of snow they did not much mind but they wondered what would happen to their houses when the thaw came  the thaw was slow in coming  snow during the night and several degrees of frost by day were what thrums began to accept as a revised order of nature  vainly the thrums doctor whose practice extends into the glens made repeated attempts to reach his distant patients twice driving so far into the dreary waste that he could neither go on nor turn back  a ploughman who contrived to gallop ten miles for him did not get home for a week  between the town which is nowadays an agricultural centre of some importance and the outlying farms communication was cut off for a month and i heard subsequently of one farmer who did not see a human being unconnected with his own farm for seven weeks  the schoolhouse which i managed to reach only two days behind time was closed for a fortnight and even in thrums there was only a sprinkling of scholars  on sundays the feeling between the different denominations ran high and the middling good folk who did not go to church counted those who did  in the established church there was a sparse gathering who waited in vain for the minister  after a time it got abroad that a flag of distress was flying from the manse and then they saw that the minister was stormstayed  an officebearer offered to conduct service but the others present thought they had done their duty and went home  the u p bell did not ring at all and the kirk gates were not opened  the free kirk did bravely however  the attendance in the forenoon amounted to seven including the minister but in the afternoon there was a turnout of upwards of fifty  how much denominational competition had to do with this none can say but the general opinion was that this muster to afternoon service was a piece of vainglory  next sunday all the kirks were on their mettle and though the snow was drifting the whole day services were general  it was felt that after the action of the free kirk the establisheds and the u ps must show what they too were capable of  so when the bells rang at eleven oclock and two churchgoers began to pour out of every close  if i remember aright the victory lay with the u ps by two women and a boy  of course the auld lichts mustered in as great force as ever  the other kirks never dreamt of competing with them what was regarded as a judgment on the free kirk for its boastfulness of spirit on the preceding sunday happened during the forenoon  while the service was taking place a huge clod of snow slipped from the roof and fell right against the church door  it was some time before the prisoners could make up their minds to leave by the windows  what the auld lichts would have done in a similar predicament i cannot even conjecture  that was the first warning of the thaw  it froze again there was more snow the thaw began in earnest and then the streets were a sight to see  there was no traffic to turn the snow to slush and where it had not been piled up in walls a few feet from the houses it remained in the narrow ways till it became a lake  it tried to escape through doorways when it sank slowly into the floors  gentle breezes created a ripple on its surface and strong winds lifted it into the air and flung it against the houses  it undermined the heaps of clotted snow till they tottered like icebergs and fell to pieces  men made their way through it on stilts  had a frost followed the result would have been appalling but there was no more frost that winter  a fortnight passed before the place looked itself again and even then congealed snow stood doggedly in the streets while the country roads were like newly ploughed fields after rain  the heat from large fires soon penetrated through roofs of slate and thatch and it was quite a common thing for a man to be flattened to the ground by a slithering of snow from above just as he opened his door  but it had seldom more than ten feet to fall  most interesting of all was the novel sensation experienced as thrums began to assume its familiar aspect and objects so long buried that they had been half forgotten came back to view and use  stormstayed shows used to emphasize the severity of a thrums winter as the name indicates these were gatherings of travelling booths in the wintertime  half a century ago the country was overrun by itinerant showmen who went their different ways in summer but formed little colonies in the cold weather when they pitched their tents in any empty field or disused quarry and huddled together for the sake of warmth not that they got much of it  not more than five winters ago we had a stormstayed show on a small scale but nowadays the farmers are less willing to give these wanderers a campingplace and the people are less easily drawn to the entertainments provided by fife and drum  the colony hung together until it was starved out when it trailed itself elsewhere  i have often seen it forming  the first arrival would be what was popularly known as saml manns tumblingbooth with its tumblers jugglers swordswallowers and balancers  this travelling show visited us regularly twice a year once in summer for the muckle friday when the performers were gay and stout and even the horses had flesh on their bones and again in the backend of the year when cold and hunger had taken the blood from their faces and the scraggy dogs that whined at their side were lashed for licking the paint off the caravans  while the stormstayed show was in the vicinity the villages suffered from an invasion of these dogs  nothing told more truly the dreadful tale of the showmans life in winter  saml manns was a big show and half a dozen smaller ones most of which were familiar to us crawled in its wake  others heard of its whereabouts and came in from distant parts  there was the wellknown gubbins with his a the world in a box a halfpenny peepshow in which all the world was represented by joseph and his brethren with pit and coat the bombardment of copenhagen the battle of the nile daniel in the den of lions and mount etna in eruption aunt maggys whirligig could be enjoyed on payment of an old pair of boots a collection of rags or the like  besides these and other shows there were the wandering minstrels most of whom were waterloo veterans wanting arms or a leg  i remember one whose arms had been smashed by a thunderbolt at jamaica  queer bent old dames who superintended lucky bags or told fortunes supplied the uncanny element but hesitated to call themselves witches for there can still be seen near thrums the pool where these unfortunates used to be drowned and in the session book of the glen quharity kirk can be read an old minute announcing that on a certain sabbath there was no preaching because the minister was away at the burning of a witch to the stormstayed shows came the gypsies in great numbers  claypots which is a corruption of claypits was their headquarters near thrums and it is still sacred to their memory  it was a clachan of miserable little huts built entirely of clay from the dreary and sticky pit in which they had been flung together  a shapeless hole on one side was the doorway and a little hole stuffed with straw in winter the window  some of the remnants of these hovels still stand  their occupants though they went by the name of gypsies among themselves were known to the weavers as the claypots beggars and their king was jimmy pawse  his regal dignity gave jimmy the right to seek alms first when he chose to do so thus he got the cream of a place before his subjects set to work  he was rather foppish in his dress generally affecting a suit of grey cloth with showy metal buttons on it and a broad blue bonnet  his wife was a little body like himself and when they went abegging jimmy with a mealbag for alms on his back she always took her husbands arm  jimmy was the legal adviser of his subjects his decision was considered final on all questions and he guided them in their courtships as well as on their deathbeds  he christened their children and officiated at their weddings marrying them over the tongs  the stormstayed show attracted old and youngto looking on from the outside  in the daytime the wagons and tents presented a dreary appearance sunk in snow the dogs shivering between the wheels and but little other sign of life visible  when dusk came the lights were lit and the drummer and fifer from the booth of tumblers were sent into the town to entice an audience  they marched quickly through the nipping windy streets and then returned with two or three score of men women and children plunging through the snow or mud at their heavy heels  it was orpheus fallen from his high estate  what a mockery the glare of the lamps and the capers of the mountebanks were and how satisfied were we to enjoy it all without going inside  i hear the waterloo veterans still and remember their patriotic outbursts    on the sixteenth day of june brave boys       while cannon loud did roar   we being short of cavalry they pressed on us full sore   but british steel soon made them yield       though our numbers was but few   and death or victory was the word on the plains of waterloo   the stormstayed shows often found it easier to sink to rest in a field than to leave it  for weeks at a time they were snowed up sufficiently to prevent any one from thrums going near them though not sufficiently to keep the pallid mummers indoors  that would in many cases have meant starvation  they managed to fight their way through storm and snowdrift to the high road and thence to the town where they got meal and sometimes broth  the tumblers and jugglers used occasionally to hire an outhouse in the town at these timesyou may be sure they did not pay for it in advanceand give performances there  it is a curious thing but true that our herdboys and others were sometimes struck with the stagefever  thrums lost boys to the showmen even in winter  on the whole the farmers and the people generally were wonderfully longsuffering with these wanderers who i believe were more honest than was to be expected  they stole certainly but seldom did they steal anything more valuable than turnips  saml mann himself flushed proudly over the effect his show once had on an irate farmer  the farmer appeared in the encampment whip in hand and furious  they must get off his land before nightfall  the crafty showman however prevailed upon him to take a look at the acrobats and he enjoyed the performance so much that he offered to let them stay until the end of the week  before that time came there was such a fall of snow that departure was out of the question and it is to the farmers credit that he sent saml a bag of meal to tide him and his actors over the storm  there were times when the showmen made a tour of the bothies where they slung their poles and ropes and gave their poor performances to audiences that were not critical  the bothy being strictly the mans castle the farmer never interfered indeed he was sometimes glad to see the show  every other weaver in thrums used to have a son a ploughman and it was the men from the bothies who filled the square on the muckly  hands are not huddled together nowadays in squalid barns more like cattle than men and women but bothies in the neighbourhood of thrums are not yet things of the past  many a ploughman delves his way to and from them still in all weathers when the snow is on the ground at the time of hairst and when the turnip shaws have just forced themselves through the earth looking like straight rows of green needles  here is a picture of a bothy of today that i visited recently  over the door there is a waterspout that has given way and as i entered i got a rush of rain down my neck  the passage was so small that one could easily have stepped from the doorway on to the ladder standing against the wall which was there in lieu of a staircase  upstairs was a mere garret where a man could not stand erect even in the centre  it was entered by a square hole in the ceiling at present closed by a clapdoor in no way dissimilar to the trapdoors on a theatre stage  i climbed into this garret which is at present used as a storeroom for agricultural odds and ends  at harvesttime however it is inhabitedfull to overflowing  a few decades ago as many as fifty labourers engaged for the harvest had to be housed in the farm outhouses on beds of straw  there was no help for it and men and women had to congregate in these barns together up as early as five in the morning they were generally dead tired by night and miserable though this system of herding them together was they took it like stoics and their very number served as a moral safeguard  nowadays the harvest is gathered in so quickly and machinery does so much that used to be done by hand that this crowding of labourers together which was the bothy system at its worst is nothing like what it was  as many as six or eight men however are put up in the garret referred to during hairsttime and the female labourers have to make the best of it in the barn  there is no doubt that on many farms the two sexes have still at this busy time to herd together even at night  the bothy was but scantily furnished though it consisted of two rooms in the one which was used almost solely as a sleeping apartment there was no furniture to speak of beyond two closet beds and its bumpy earthen floor gave it a cheerless look  the other which had a single bed was floored with wood  it was not badly lit by two very small windows that faced each other and besides several stools there was a long form against one of the walls  a bright fire of peat and coalnothing in the world makes such a cheerful red fire as this combinationburned beneath a big kettle boiler they called it and there was a press or cupboard containing a fair assortment of cooking utensils  of these some belonged to the bothy while others were the private property of the tenants  a tin pan and pitcher of water stood near the door and the table in the middle of the room was covered with oilcloth  four men and a boy inhabited this bothy and the rain had driven them all indoors  in better weather they spend the leisure of the evening at the game of quoits which is the standard pastime among scottish ploughmen  they fish the neighbouring streams too and have burntrout for supper several times a week  when i entered two of them were sitting by the fire playing draughts or as they called it the dambrod  the dambrod is the scottish labourers billiards and he often attains to a remarkable proficiency at the game  wylie the champion draughtplayer was once a herdboy and wonderful stories are current in all bothies of the times when his master called him into the farmparlour to show his skill  a third man who seemed the elder by quite twenty years was at the window reading a newspaper and i got no shock when i saw that it was the saturday review which he and a labourer on an adjoining farm took in weekly between them  there was a copy of a local newspaperthe peoples journalalso lying about and some books including one of darwins  these were all the property of this man however who did the reading for the bothy  they did all the cooking for themselves living largely on milk  in the old days which the senior could remember porridge was so universally the morning meal that they called it by that name instead of breakfast  they still breakfast on porridge but often take tea above it  generally milk is taken with the porridge but porter or stout in a bowl is no uncommon substitute  potatoes at twelve oclockseldom brose nowadaysare the staple dinner dish and the tinned meats have become very popular  there are bothies where each man makes his own food but of course the more satisfactory plan is for them to club together  sometimes they get their food in the farmkitchen but this is only when there are few of them and the farmer and his family do not think it beneath them to dine with the men  broth too may be made in the kitchen and sent down to the bothy  at harvesttime the workers take their food in the fields when great quantities of milk are provided  there is very little beer drunk and whisky is only consumed in privacy  life in the bothies is not i should say so lonely as life at the schoolhouse for the hands have at least each others company  the hawker visits them frequently still though the itinerant tailor once a familiar figure has almost vanished  their great place of congregating is still some country smiddy which is also their frequent meetingplace when bent on blackfishing  the flare of the blackfishers torch still attracts salmon to their death in the rivers near thrums and you may hear in the glens on a dark night the rattle of the spears on the wet stones  twenty or thirty years ago however the sport was much more common  after the farmer had gone to bed some halfdozen ploughmen and a few other poachers from thrums would set out for the meetingplace  the smithy on these occasions must have been a weird sight though one did not mark that at the time  the poacher crept from the darkness into the glaring smithy light for in country parts the anvil might sometimes be heard clanging at all hours of the night  as a rule every face was blackened and it was this i suppose rather than the fact that dark nights were chosen that gave the gangs the name of blackfishers  other disguises were resorted to one of the commonest being to change clothes or to turn your corduroys outside in  the countryfolk of those days were more superstitious than they are now and it did not take much to turn the blackfishers back  there was not a barn or byre in the district that had not its horseshoe over the door  another popular device for frightening away witches and fairies was to hang bunches of garlic about the farms  i have known a blackfishing expedition stopped because a yellow yite or yellowhammer hovered round the gang when they were setting out  still more ominous was the peat when it appeared with one or three companions  an old rhyme about this bird runsone is joy two is grief threes a bridal four is death  such snatches of superstition are still to be heard amidst the gossip of a northcountry smithy  each blackfisher brought his own spear and torch both more or less homemade  the spears were in many cases gullyknives fastened to staves with twine and resin called rozet  the torches were very roughandready thingsrope and tar or even rotten roots dug from broken treesin fact anything that would flare  the blackfishers seldom journeyed far from home confining themselves to the rivers within a radius of three or four miles  there were many reasons for this one of them being that the hands had to be at their work on the farm by five oclock in the morning another that so they poached and let poach  except when in spate the river i specially refer to offered no attractions to the blackfishers  heavy rains however swell it much more quickly than most rivers into a turbulent rush of water the part of it affected by the blackfishers being banked in with rocks that prevent the waters spreading  above these rocks again are heavy green banks from which stunted trees grow aslant across the river  the effect is fearsome at some points where the trees run into each other as it were from opposite banks  however the blackfishers thought nothing of these things  they took a turnip lantern with themthat is a lantern hollowed out of a turnip with a piece of candle insidebut no lights were shown on the road  every one knew his way to the river blindfold so that the darker the night the better  on reaching the water there was a pause  one or two of the gang climbed the banks to discover if any bailiffs were on the watch while the others sat down and with the help of the turnip lantern busked their spears in other words fastened on the steelor it might be merely pieces of rusty iron sharpened into a point at hometo the staves  some had them busked before they set out but that was not considered prudent for of course there was always a risk of meeting spoilsports on the way to whom the spears would tell a tale that could not be learned from ordinary staves nevertheless little time was lost  five or six of the gang waded into the water torch in one hand and spear in the other and the object now was to catch some salmon with the least possible delay and hurry away windy nights were good for the sport and i can still see the river lit up with the lumps of light that a torch makes in a high wind  the torches of course were used to attract the fish which came swimming to the sheen and were then speared  as little noise as possible was made but though the men bit their lips instead of crying out when they missed their fish there was a continuous ring of their weapons on the stones and every irrepressible imprecation was echoed up and down the black glen  two or three of the gang were told off to land the salmon and they had to work smartly and deftly  they kept by the side of the spearsman and the moment he struck a fish they grabbed at it with their hands  when the spear had a barb there was less chance of the fishs being lost but often this was not the case and probably not more than twothirds of the salmon speared were got safely to the bank the takes of course varied sometimes indeed the blackfishers returned home emptyhanded  encounters with the bailiffs were not infrequent though they seldom took place at the waters edge  when the poachers were caught in the act and had their blood up with the excitement of the sport they were ugly customers  spears were used and heads were broken  struggles even took place in the water when there was always a chance of somebodys being drowned  where the bailiffs gave the blackfishers an opportunity of escaping without a fight it was nearly always taken the booty being left behind  as a rule when the waterwatchers as the bailiffs were sometimes called had an inkling of what was to take place they reinforced themselves with a constable or two and waited on the road to catch the poachers on their way home  one blackfisher a noted character was nicknamed the deil o glen quharity  he was said to have gone to the houses of the bailiffs and offered to sell them the fish stolen from the streams over which they kept guard  the deil was never imprisonedpartly perhaps because he was too eccentric to be taken seriously     chapter iii  the auld licht kirk  one sabbath day in the beginning of the century the auld licht minister at thrums walked out of his battered ramshackle earthenfloored kirk with a following and never returned  the last words he uttered in it were follow me to the commonty all you persons who want to hear the word of god properly preached and james duphie and his two sons will answer for this on the day of judgment  the congregation which belonged to the body who seceded from the established church a hundred and fifty years ago had split and as the new lights now the u ps were in the majority the old lights with the minister at their head had to retire to the commonty or common and hold service in the open air until they had saved up money for a church  they kept possession however of the white manse among the trees  their kirk has but a cluster of members now most of them old and done but each is equal to a dozen ordinary churchgoers and there have been men and women among them on whom the memory loves to linger  for forty years they have been dying out but their cold stiff pews still echo the psalms of david and the auld licht kirk will remain open so long as it has one member and a minister  the church stands round the corner from the square with only a large door to distinguish it from the other building in the short street children who want to do a brave thing hit this door with their fists when there is no one near and then run away scared  the door however is sacred to the memory of a whitehaired old lady who not so long ago used to march out of the kirk and remain on the pavement until the psalm which had just been given out was sung  of thrumss pavement it may here be said that when you come even to this day to a level slab you feel reluctant to leave it  the old lady was mistress which is miss tibbie mcquhatty and she nearly split the auld licht kirk over run line  this conspicuous innovation was introduced by mr dishart the minister when he was young and audacious  the old reverent custom in the kirk was for the precentor to read out the psalm a line at a time  having then sung that line he read out the next one led the singing of it and so worked his way on to line three  where run line holds however the psalm is read out first and forthwith sung  this is not only a flighty way of doing things which may lead to greater scandals but has its practical disadvantages for the precentor always starts singing in advance of the congregation auld lichts never being able to begin to do anything all at once and increasing the distance with every line leaves them hopelessly behind at the finish  miss mcquhatty protested against this change as meeting the devil halfway but the minister carried his point and ever after that she rushed ostentatiously from the church the moment a psalm was given out and remained behind the door until the singing was finished when she returned with a rustle to her seat  run line had on her the effect of the reading of the riot act  once some men capable of anything held the door from the outside and the congregation heard tibbie rampaging in the passage  bursting into the kirk she called the officebearers to her assistance whereupon the minister in miniature raised his voice and demanded the why and wherefore of the ungodly disturbance  great was the hubbub but the door was fast and a compromise had to be arrived at  the old lady consented for once to stand in the passage but not without pressing her hands to her ears  you may smile at tibbie but ah i know what she was at a sick bedside  i have seen her when the hard look had gone from her eyes and it would ill become me to smile too  as with all the churches in thrums care had been taken to make the auld licht one much too large  the stair to the laft or gallery which was originally little more than a ladder is ready for you as soon as you enter the doorway but it is best to sit in the body of the kirk  the plate for collections is inside the church so that the whole congregation can give a guess at what you give  if it is something very stingy or very liberal all thrums knows of it within a few hours indeed this holds good of all the churches especially perhaps of the free one which has been called the bawbee kirk because so many halfpennies find their way into the plate  on saturday nights the thrums shops are besieged for coppers by housewives of all denominations who would as soon think of dropping a threepenny bit into the plate as of giving nothing  tammy todd had a curious way of tipping his penny into the auld licht plate while still keeping his hand to his side  he did it much as a boy fires a marble and there was quite a talk in the congregation the first time he missed  a devout plan was to carry your penny in your hand all the way to church but to appear to take it out of your pocket on entering and some plumped it down noisily like men paying their way  i believe old snecky hobart who was a canty stock but obstinate once dropped a penny into the plate and took out a halfpenny as change but the only untoward thing that happened to the plate was once when the lassie from the farm of curly bog capsized it in passing  mr dishart who was always a ready man introduced something into his sermon that day about womens dress which every one hoped chirsty lundy the lassie in question would remember  nevertheless the minister sometimes came to a sudden stop himself when passing from the vestry to the pulpit  the passage being narrow his rigging would catch in a pew as he sailed down the aisle  even then however mr dishart remembered that he was not as other men  white is not a religious colour and the walls of the kirk were of a dull grey  a cushion was allowed to the manse pew but merely as a symbol of office and this was the only pew in the church that had a door  it was and is the pew nearest to the pulpit on the ministers right and one day it contained a bonnet which mr disharts predecessor preached at for one hour and ten minutes  from the pulpit which was swaddled in black the minister had a fine sweep of all the congregation except those in the back pews downstairs who were lost in the shadow of the laft  here sat whinny webster so called because having an inexplicable passion against them he devoted his life to the extermination of whins  whinny for years ate peppermint lozenges with impunity in his back seat safe in the certainty that the minister however much he might try could not possibly see him  but his day came  one afternoon the kirk smelt of peppermints and mr dishart could rebuke no one for the defaulter was not in sight  whinnys cheek was working up and down in quiet enjoyment of its lozenge when he started noticing that the preaching had stopped  then he heard a sepulchral voice say charles webster  whinnys eyes turned to the pulpit only part of which was visible to him and to his horror they encountered the ministers head coming down the stairs  this took place after i had ceased to attend the auld licht kirk regularly but i am told that as whinny gave one wild scream the peppermint dropped from his mouth  the minister had got him by leaning over the pulpit door until had he given himself only another inch his feet would have gone into the air  as for whinny he became a godfearing man  the most uncanny thing about the kirk was the precentors box beneath the pulpit  three auld licht ministers i have known but i can only conceive one precentor  lang tammass box was much too small for him since his disappearance from thrums i believe they have paid him the compliment of enlarging it for a smaller manno doubt with the feeling that tammas alone could look like a christian in it  like the whole congregation of course he had to stand during the prayersthe first of which averaged half an hour in length  if he stood erect his head and shoulders vanished beneath funereal trappings when he seemed decapitated and if he stretched his neck the pulpit tottered  he looked like the pillar on which it rested or he balanced it on his head like a bakers tray  sometimes he leaned forward as reverently as he could and then with his long lean arms dangling over the side of his box he might have been a suit of blacks hung up to dry  once i was talking with cree queery in a sober respectable manner when all at once a light broke out on his face  i asked him what he was laughing at and he said it was at lang tammas  he got grave again when i asked him what there was in lang tammas to smile at and admitted that he could not tell me  however i have always been of opinion that the thought of the precentor in his box gave cree a fleeting sense of humour  tammas and hendry munn were the two paid officials of the church hendry being kirkofficer but poverty was among the few points they had in common  the precentor was a cobbler though he never knew it shoemaker being the name in those parts and his dwellingroom was also his workshop  there he sat in his brot or apron from early morning to far on to midnight and contrived to make his six or eight shillings a week  i have often sat with him in the darkness that his cruizey lamp could not pierce while his mutterings to himself of ay ay yes umpha oh ay ay man came as regularly and monotonously as the tick of his wagatthewa clock  hendry and he were paid no fixed sum for their services in the auld licht kirk but once a year there was a collection for each of them and so they jogged along  though not the only kirkofficer of my time hendry made the most lasting impression he was i think the only man in thrums who did not quake when the minister looked at him  a wild story never authenticated says that hendry once offered mr dishart a snuff from his mull  in the streets lang tammas was more stern and dreaded by evildoers but hendry had first place in the kirk  one of his duties was to precede the minister from the sessionhouse to the pulpit and open the door for him  having shut mr dishart in he strolled away to his seat  when a strange minister preached hendry was if possible still more at his ease this will not be believed but i have seen him give the pulpitdoor on these occasions a flingto with his feet  however ill an ordinary member of the congregation might become in the kirk he sat on till the service ended but hendry would wander to the door and shut it if he noticed that the wind was playing irreverent tricks with the pages of bibles and proof could still be brought forward that he would stop deliberately in the aisle to lift up a piece of paper say that had floated there  after the first psalm had been sung it was hendrys part to lift up the plate and carry its tinkling contents to the sessionhouse  on the greatest occasions he remained so calm so indifferent so expressionless that he might have been present the night before at a rehearsal  when there was preaching at night the church was lit by tallow candles which also gave out all the artificial heat provided  two candles stood on each side of the pulpit and others were scattered over the church some of them fixed into holes on rough brackets and some merely sticking in their own grease on the pews  hendry superintended the lighting of the candles and frequently hobbled through the church to snuff them  mr dishart was a man who could do anything except snuff a candle but when he stopped in his sermon to do that he as often as not knocked the candle over  in vain he sought to refix it in its proper place and then all eyes turned to hendry  as coolly as though he were in a public hall or place of entertainment the kirkofficer arose and mounting the stair took the candle from the ministers reluctant hands and put it right  then he returned to his seat not apparently puffed up yet perhaps satisfied with himself while mr dishart glaring after him to see if he was carrying his head high resumed his wordy way  never was there a man more uncomfortably loved than mr dishart  easie haggart his maidservant reproved him at the breakfasttable  lang tammas and saml mealmaker crouched for five successive sabbath nights on his manse wall to catch him smoking and got him  old wives grumbled by their hearths when he did not look in to despair of their salvation  he told the maidens of his congregation not to make an idol of him  his session saw him from behind a haystack in conversation with a strange woman and asked grimly if he remembered that he had a wife  twenty were his years when he came to thrums and on the very first sabbath he knocked a board out of the pulpit  before beginning his trial sermon he handed down the big bible to the precentor to give his arms freer swing  the congregation trembling with exhilaration probed his meaning  not a square inch of paper they saw could be concealed there  mr dishart had scarcely any hope for the auld lichts he had none for any other denomination  davit lunan got behind his handkerchief to think for a moment and the minister was on him like a tiger  the call was unanimous  davit proposed him  every few years as one might say the auld licht kirk gave way and burled its minister  the congregation turned their empty pockets inside out and the minister departed in a farmers cart  the scene was not an amusing one to those who looked on at it  to the auld lichts was then the humiliation of seeing their pulpit supplied on alternate sabbaths by itinerant probationers or stickit ministers when they were not starving themselves to support a pastor the auld lichts were saving up for a stipend  they retired with compressed lips to their looms and weaved and weaved till they weaved another minister  without the grief of parting with one minister there could not have been the transport of choosing another  to have had a pastor always might have made them vainglorious  they were seldom longer than twelve months in making a selection and in their haste they would have passed over mr dishart and mated with a monster  many years have elapsed since providence flung mr watts out of the auld licht kirk  mr watts was a probationer who was tried before mr dishart and though not so young as might have been wished he found favour in many eyes  sluggard in the laft awake he cried to bell whamond who had forgotten herself and it was felt that there must be good stuff in him  a breeze from heaven exposed him on communion sabbath  on the evening of this solemn day the door of the auld licht kirk was sometimes locked and the congregation repaired bible in hand to the commonty  they had a right to this common on the communion sabbath but only took advantage of it when it was believed that more persons intended witnessing the evening service than the kirk would hold  on this day the attendance was always very great  it was the covenanters come back to life  to the summit of the slope a wooden box was slowly hurled by hendry munn and others and round this the congregation quietly grouped to the tinkle of the cracked auld licht bell  with slow majestic tread the session advanced up the steep common with the little minister in their midst  he had the people in his hands now and the more he squeezed them the better they were pleased  the travelling pulpit consisted of two compartments the one for the minister and the other for lang tammas but no auld licht thought that it looked like a punch and judy puppet show  this service on the common was known as the tent preaching owing to a tents being frequently used instead of the box  mr watts was conducting the service on the commonty  it was a fine still summer evening and loud above the whisper of the burn from which the common climbs and the laboured pechs of the listeners rose the preachers voice  the auld lichts in their rusty blacks they must have been a more artistic sight in the olden days of blue bonnets and kneebreeches nodded their heads in sharp approval for though they could swoop down on a heretic like an eagle on carrion they scented no prey  even lang tammas on whose nose a drop of water gathered when he was in his greatest fettle thought that all was fair and aboveboard suddenly a rush of wind tore up the common and ran straight at the pulpit  it formed in a sieve and passed over the heads of the congregation who felt it as a fan and looked up in awe  lang tammas feeling himself all at once grow clammy distinctly heard the leaves of the pulpit bible shiver  mr wattss hands outstretched to prevent a catastrophe were blown against his side and then some twenty sheets of closelywritten paper floated into the air  there was a horrible dead silence  the burn was roaring now  the minister if such he can be called shrunk back in his box and as if they had seen it printed in letters of fire on the heavens the congregation realized that mr watts whom they had been on the point of calling read his sermon  he wrote it out on pages the exact size of those in the bible and did not scruple to fasten these into the holy book itself  at theatres a sullen thunder of angry voices behind the scene represents a crowd in a rage and such a low longdrawn howl swept the common when mr watts was found out  to follow a pastor who read seemed to the auld lichts like claiming heaven on false pretences  in ten minutes the session alone with lang tammas and hendry were on the common  they were watched by many from afar off and when one comes to think of it now looked a little curious jumping like trout at flies at the damning papers still fluttering in the air  the minister was never seen in our parts again but he is still remembered as paper watts  mr dishart in the pulpit was the reward of his upbringing  at ten he had entered the university  before he was in his teens he was practising the art of gesticulation in his fathers gallery pew  from distant congregations people came to marvel at him  he was never more than comparatively young  so long as the pulpit trappings of the kirk at thrums lasted he could be seen once he was fairly under weigh with his sermon but dimly in a cloud of dust  he introduced headaches  in a grand transport of enthusiasm he once flung his arms over the pulpit and caught lang tammas on the forehead  leaning forward with his chest on the cushions he would pommel the evil one with both hands and then whirling round to the left shake his fist at bell whamonds neckerchief  with a sudden jump he would fix pete todds youngest boy catching flies at the laft window  stiffening unexpectedly he would leap three times in the air and then gather himself in a corner for a fearsome spring  when he wept he seemed to be laughing and he laughed in a paroxysm of tears  he tried to tear the devil out of the pulpit rails  when he was not a teetotum he was a windmill  his pump position was the most appalling  then he glared motionless at his admiring listeners as if he had fallen into a trance with his arm upraised  the hurricane broke next moment  nanny sutie bore up under the shadow of the windmillwhich would have been heavier had auld licht ministers worn gownsbut the pump affected her to tears  she was stonedeaf  for the first year or more of his ministry an auld licht minister was a mouse among cats  both in the pulpit and out of it they watched for unsound doctrine and when he strayed they took him by the neck  mr dishart however had been brought up in the true way and seldom gave his people a chance  in time it may be said they grew despondent and settled in their uncomfortable pews with all suspicion of lurking heresy allayed  it was only on such sabbaths as mr dishart changed pulpits with another minister that they cocked their ears and leant forward eagerly to snap the preacher up  mr dishart had his trials  there was the split in the kirk too that comes once at least to every auld licht minister  he was long in marrying  the congregation were thinking of approaching him through the medium of his servant easie haggart on the subject of matrimony for a bachelor coming on for twentytwo with an income of eighty pounds per annum seemed an anomaly when one day he took the canal for edinburgh and returned with his bride  his people nodded their heads but said nothing to the minister  if he did not choose to take them into his confidence it was no affair of theirs  that there was something queer about the marriage however seemed certain  sandy whamond who was a soured man after losing his eldership said that he believed she had been an englishyin other words had belonged to the english church but it is not probable that mr dishart would have gone the length of that  the secret is buried in his grave  easie haggart jagged the minister sorely  she grew loquacious with years and when he had company would stand at the door joining in the conversation  if the company was another minister she would take a chair and discuss mr disharts infirmities with him  the auld lichts loved their minister but they saw even more clearly than himself the necessity for his humiliation  his wife made all her childrens clothes but sanders gow complained that she looked too like their sister  in one week three of the children died and on the sabbath following it rained  mr dishart preached twice breaking down altogether and gaping strangely round the kirk there was no dust flying that day and spoke of the rain as angels tears for three little girls  the auld lichts let it pass but as lang tammas said in private for of course the thing was much discussed at the looms if you materialize angels in that way where are you going to stop  it was on the fast days that the auld licht kirk showed what it was capable of and so to speak left all the other churches in thrums far behind  the fast came round once every summer beginning on a thursday when all the looms were hushed and two services were held in the kirk of about three hours length each  a minister from another town assisted at these times and when the service ended the members filed in at one door and out at another passing on their way mr dishart and his elders who dispensed tokens at the foot of the pulpit  without a token which was a metal lozenge no one could take the sacrament on the coming sabbath and many a member has mr dishart made miserable by refusing him his token for gathering wild flowers say on a lords day as testified to by another member  women were lost who cooked dinners on the sabbath or took to coloured ribbons or absented themselves from church without sufficient cause  on the fast day fists were shaken at mr dishart as he walked sternly homewards but he was undismayed  next day there were no services in the kirk for auld lichts could not afford many holidays but they weaved solemnly with saturday and the sabbath and monday to think of  on saturday service began at two and lasted until nearly seven  two sermons were preached but there was no interval  the sacrament was dispensed on the sabbath  nowadays the tables in the auld licht kirk are soon served for the attendance has decayed and most of the pews in the body of the church are made use of  in the days of which i speak however the front pews alone were hung with white and it was in them only that the sacrament was administered  as many members as could get into them delivered up their tokens and took the first table then they made room for others who sat in their pews awaiting their turn  what with tables the preaching and unusually long prayers the service lasted from eleven to six  at halfpast six a two hours service began either in the kirk or on the common from which no one who thought much about his immortal soul would have dared or cared to absent himself  a four hours service on the monday which like that of the saturday consisted of two services in one but began at eleven instead of two completed the programme  on those days if you were a poor creature and wanted to acknowledge it you could leave the church for a few minutes and return to it but the creditable thing was to sit on  even among the children there was a keen competition fostered by their parents to sit each other out and be in at the death  the other thrums kirks held the sacrament at the same time but not with the same vehemence  as far north from the schoolhouse as thrums is south of it nestles the little village of quharity and there the fast day was not a day of fasting  in most cases the people had to go many miles to church  they drove or rode two on a horse or walked in from other glens  without the tents therefore the congregation with a long day before them would have been badly off  sometimes one tent sufficed at other times rival publicans were on the ground  the tents were those in use at the feeing and other markets and you could get anything inside them from broth made in a boiler to the fieriest whisky  they were planted just outside the kirkgatelong low tents of dirty white canvasso that when passing into the church or out of it you inhaled their odours  the congregation emerged austerely from the church shaking their heads solemnly over the ministers remarks and their feet carried them into the tent  there was no mirth no unseemly revelry but there was a great deal of hard drinking eventually the tents were done away with but not until the services on the fast days were shortened  the auld licht ministers were the only ones who preached against the tents with any heart and since the old dominie my predecessor at the schoolhouse died there has not been an auld licht permanently resident in the glen of quharity  perhaps nothing took it out of the auld licht males so much as a christening  then alone they showed symptoms of nervousness more especially after the remarkable baptism of eppie whamond  i could tell of several scandals in connection with the kirk  there was for instance the time when easie haggart saved the minister  in a fit of temporary mental derangement the misguided man had one sabbath day despite the entreaties of his affrighted spouse called at the postoffice and was on the point of reading the letter there received when easie who had slipped on her bonnet and followed him snatched the secular thing from his hands  there was the story that ran like fire through thrums and crushed an innocent man to the effect that pete todd had been in an edinburgh theatre countenancing the playactors something could be made too of the retribution that came to chairlie ramsay who woke in his pew to discover that its other occupant his little son jamie was standing on the seat divesting himself of his clothes in presence of a horrified congregation  jamie had begun stealthily and had very little on when chairlie seized him  but having my choice of scandals i prefer the christening onethe unique case of eppie whamond who was born late on saturday night and baptized in the kirk on the following forenoon  to the casual observer the auld licht always looked as if he were returning from burying a near relative  yet when i met him hobbling down the street preternaturally grave and occupied experience taught me that he was preparing for a christening  how the minister would have borne himself in the event of a member of his congregations wanting the baptism to take place at home it is not easy to say but i shudder to think of the public prayers for the parents that would certainly have followed  the child was carried to the kirk through rain or snow or sleet or wind the father took his seat alone in the front pew under the ministers eye and the service was prolonged far on into the afternoon  but though the references in the sermon to that unhappy object of interest in the front pew were many and pointed his time had not really come until the minister signed to him to advance as far as the second step of the pulpit stairs  the nervous father clenched the railing in a daze and cowered before the ministerial heckling  from warning the minister passed to exhortation from exhortation to admonition from admonition to searching questioning from questioning to prayer and wailing  when the father glanced up there was the radiant boy in the pulpit looking as if he would like to jump down his throat  if he hung his head the minister would ask with a groan whether he was unprepared and the whole congregation would sigh out the response that mr dishart had hit it  when he replied audibly to the ministers uncomfortable questions a pained look at his flippancy travelled from the pulpit all round the pews and when he only bowed his head in answer the minister paused sternly and the congregation wondered what the man meant  little wonder that davie haggart took to drinking when his turn came for occupying that front pew  if wee eppie whamonds birth had been deferred until the beginning of the week or humility had shown more prominently among her mothers virtues the kirk would have been saved a painful scandal and sandy whamond might have retained his eldership  yet it was a foolish but wifely pride in her husbands official position that turned bell dundass heada wild ambition to beat all baptismal record  among the wives she was esteemed a poor body whose infant did not see the inside of the kirk within a fortnight of its birth  forty years ago it was an accepted superstition in thrums that the ghosts of children who had died before they were baptized went wailing and wringing their hands round the kirkyard at nights and that they would continue to do this until the crack of doom  when the auld licht children grew up too they crowed over those of their fellows whose christening had been deferred until a comparatively late date and the mothers who had needlessly missed a sabbath for long afterwards hung their heads  that was a good and creditable birth which took place early in the week thus allowing time for suitable christening preparations while to be born on a friday or a saturday was to humiliate your parents besides being an extremely ominous beginning for yourself  without seeking to vindicate bell dundass behaviour i may note as an act of ordinary fairness that being the leading elders wife she was sorely tempted  eppie made her appearance at 945 on a saturday night  in the hurry and scurry that ensued sandy escaped sadly to the square his infant would be baptized eight days old one of the longestdeferred christenings of the year  sandy was shivering under the clock when i met him accidentally and took him home  but by that time the harm had been done  several of the congregation had been roused from their beds to hear his lamentations of whom the men sympathized with him while the wives triumphed austerely over bell dundas  as i wrung poor sandys hand i hardly noticed that a bright light showed distinctly between the shutters of his kitchenwindow but the elder himself turned pale and breathed quickly  it was then fourteen minutes past twelve  my heart sank within me on the following forenoon when sandy whamond walked with a queer twitching face into the front pew under a glare of eyes from the body of the kirk and the laft  an amazed buzz went round the church followed by a pursing up of lips and hurried whisperings  evidently sandy had been driven to it against his own judgment  the scene is still vivid before me the minister suspecting no guile and omitting the admonitory stage out of compliment to the elders standing sandys ghastly face the proud godmother aged twelve with the squalling baby in her arms the horror of the congregation to a man and woman  a slate fell from sandys house even as he held up the babe to the minister to receive a droukin of water and eppie cried so vigorously that her shamed godmother had to rush with her to the vestry  now things are not as they should be when an auld licht infant does not quietly sit out her first service  bell tried for a time to carry her head high but sandy ceased to whistle at his loom and the scandal was a rolling stone that soon passed over him  briefly it amounted to this that a bairn born within two hours of midnight on saturday could not have been ready for christening at the kirk next day without the breaking of the sabbath had the secret of the nocturnal light been mine alone all might have been well but betsy munns evidence was irrefutable  great had been bells cunning but betsy had outwitted her  passing the house on the eventful night betsy had observed marget dundas bells sister open the door and creep cautiously to the window the chinks in the outside shutters of which she cunningly closed up with tow  as in a flash the disgusted betsy saw what bell was up to and removing the tow planted herself behind the dilapidated dyke opposite and awaited events  questioned at a special meeting of the officebearers in the vestry she admitted that the lamp was extinguished soon after twelve oclock though the fire burned brightly all night  there had been unnecessary feasting during the night and six eggs were consumed before breakfasttime  asked how she knew this she admitted having counted the eggshells that marget had thrown out of doors in the morning  this with the testimony of the persons from whom sandy had sought condolence on the saturday night was the case for the prosecution  for the defence bell maintained that all preparations stopped when the clock struck twelve and even hinted that the bairn had been born on saturday afternoon  but sandy knew that he and his had got a fall  in the forenoon of the following sabbath the minister preached from the text be sure your sin will find you out and in the afternoon from pride goeth before a fall  he was grand  in the evening sandy tendered his resignation of office which was at once accepted  wobs were behindhand for a week owing to the length of the prayers offered up for bell and lang tammas ruled in sandys stead     chapter iv  lads and lasses  with the severe auld lichts the sabbath began at six oclock on saturday evening  by that time the gleaming shuttle was at rest davie haggart had strolled into the village from his pile of stones on the whunny road hendry robb the dummy had sold his last barrowful of rozetty resiny roots for firewood and the people having tranquilly supped and soused their faces in their waterpails slowly donned their sunday clothes  this ceremony was common to all but here divergence set in  the grey auld licht to whom love was not even a name sat in his highbacked armchair by the hearth bible or pilgrims progress in hand occasionally lapsing into slumber butthough when they got the chance they went willingly three times to the kirkthere were young men in the community so flighty that instead of dozing at home on saturday night they dandered casually into the square and forming into knots at the corners talked solemnly and mysteriously of women  not even on the night preceding his wedding was an auld licht ever known to stay out after ten oclock  so weekly conclaves at streetcorners came to an end at a comparatively early hour one coelebs after another shuffling silently from the square until it echoed deserted to the townhouse clock  the last of the gallants gradually discovering that he was alone would look around him musingly and taking in the situation slowly wend his way home  on no other night of the week was frivolous talk about the softer sex indulged in the auld lichts being creatures of habit who never thought of smiling on a monday  long before they reached their teens they were earning their keep as herds in the surrounding glens or filling pirns for their parents but they were generally on the brink of twenty before they thought seriously of matrimony  up to that time they only trifled with the other sexs affections at a distancefilling a maids waterpails perhaps when no one was looking or carrying her wob at the recollection of which they would slap their knees almost jovially on saturday night  a wife was expected to assist at the loom as well as to be cunning in the making of marmalade and the firing of bannocks and there was consequently some heartburning among the lads for maids of skill and muscle  the auld licht however who meant marriage seldom loitered in the streets  by and by there came a time when the clock looked down through its cracked glass upon the hemmed in square and saw him not  his companions gazing at each others boots felt that something was going on but made no remark  a month ago passing through the shabby familiar square i brushed against a withered old man tottering down the street under a load of yarn  it was piled on a wheelbarrow which his feeble hands could not have raised but for the rope of yarn that supported it from his shoulders and though auld licht was written on his patient eyes i did not immediately recognize jamie whamond  years ago jamie was a sturdy weaver and fervent lover whom i had the right to call my friend  turn back the century a few decades and we are together on a moonlight night taking a short cut through the fields from the farm of craigiebuckle  buxom were craigiebuckles dochters and jamie was janets accepted suitor  it was a muddy road through damp grass and we picked our way silently over its ruts and pools  im thinkin jamie said at last a little wistfully that i micht hae been as weel wi chirsty  chirsty was janets sister and jamie had first thought of her  craigiebuckle however strongly advised him to take janet instead and he consented  alack heavy wobs have taken all the grace from janets shoulders this many a year though she and jamie go bravely down the hill together  unless they pass the allotted span of life the poorshouse will never know them  as for bonny chirsty she proved a flighty thing and married a deacon in the established church the auld lichts groaned over her fall craigiebuckle hung his head and the minister told her sternly to go her way  but a few weeks afterwards lang tammas the chief elder was observed talking with her for an hour in gowries close and the very next sabbath chirsty pushed her husband in triumph into her fathers pew  the minister though completely taken by surprise at once referred to the stranger in a prayer of great length as a brand that might yet be plucked from the burning  changing his text he preached at him lang tammas the precentor and the whole congregation chirsty included sang at him and before he exactly realized his position he had become an auld licht for life  chirstys triumph was complete when next week in broad daylight too the ministers wife called and in the presence of betsy munn who vouches for the truth of the story graciously asked her to come up to the manse on thursday at 4 p m and drink a dish of tea  chirsty who knew her position of course begged modestly to be excused but a coolness arose over the invitation between her and janetwho felt slightedthat was only made up at the layingout of chirstys fatherinlaw to which janet was pleasantly invited  when they had red up the house the auld licht lassies sat in the gloaming at their doors on threelegged stools patiently knitting stockings  to them came stifflimbed youths who with a blawy nicht jeanie to which the inevitable answer was it is so charles rested their shoulders on the doorpost and silently followed with their eyes the flashing needles  thus the courtship beganoften to ripen promptly into marriage at other times to go no further  the smoothhaired maids neat in their simple wrappers knew they were on their trial and that it behoved them to be wary  they had not compassed twenty winters without knowing that marget todd lost davie haggart because she fittit a black stocking with brown worsted and that finnys grieve turned from bell whamond on account of the frivolous flowers in her bonnet and yet bells prospects as i happen to know at one time looked bright and promising  sitting over her fathers peatfire one night gossiping with him about fishingflies and tackle i noticed the grieve who had dropped in by appointment with some ducks eggs on which bells clockin hen was to sit performing some sleightofhand trick with his coatsleeve  craftily he jerked and twisted it till his own photograph a black smudge on white gradually appeared to view  this he gravely slipped into the hands of the maid of his choice and then took his departure apparently much relieved  had not bells lightheadedness driven him away the grieve would have soon followed up his gift with an offer of his hand  some night bell would have seen him to the door and they would have stared sheepishly at each other before saying goodnight  the parting salutation given the grieve would still have stood his ground and bell would have waited with him  at last will ye haes bell would have dropped from his halfreluctant lips and bell would have mumbled ay with her thumb in her mouth  guid nicht to ye bell would be the next remarkguid nicht to ye jeames the answer the humble door would close softly and bell and her lad would have been engaged but as it was their attachment never got beyond the silhouette stage from which in the ethics of the auld lichts a man can draw back in certain circumstances without loss of honour  the only really tender thing i ever heard an auld licht lover say to his sweetheart was when gowries brother looked softly into easie tamsons eyes and whispered do you swite sweat  even then the effect was produced more by the loving cast in gowries eye than by the tenderness of the words themselves  the courtships were sometimes of long duration but as soon as the young man realized that he was courting he proposed  cases were not wanting in which he realized this for himself but as a rule he had to be told of it  there were a few instances of weddings among the auld lichts that did not take place on friday  betsy munns brother thought to assert his two coalcarts about which he was sinfully puffed up by getting married early in the week but he was a pragmatical feckless body jamie  the foreigner from york that finnys grieve after disappointing bell whamond took sought to sow the seeds of strife by urging that friday was an unlucky day and i remember how the minister who was always great in a crisis nipped the bickering in the bud by adducing the conclusive fact that he had been married on the sixth day of the week himself  it was a judicious policy on mr disharts part to take vigorous action at once and insist on the solemnization of the marriage on a friday or not at all for he best kept superstition out of the congregation by branding it as heresy  perhaps the auld lichts were only ignorant of the grieves lasss theory because they had not thought of it  fridays claims too were incontrovertible for the saturdays being a slack day gave the couple an opportunity to put their but and ben in order and on sabbath they had a gay day of it three times at the kirk  the honeymoon over the racket of the loom began again on the monday  the natural politeness of the allardice family gave me my invitation to tibbies wedding  i was taking tea and cheese early one wintry afternoon with the smith and his wife when little joey todd in his sabbath clothes peered in at the passage and then knocked primly at the door  andra forgot himself and called out to him to come in by but jess frowned him into silence and hastily donning her black mutch received willie on the threshold  both halves of the door were open and the visitor had looked us over carefully before knocking but he had come with the compliments of tibbies mother requesting the pleasure of jess and her man that evening to the lassies marriage with saml todd and the knocking at the door was part of the ceremony five minutes afterwards joey returned to beg a moment of me in the passage when i too got my invitation  the lad had just received with an expression of polite surprise though he knew he could claim it as his right a slice of crumbling shortbread and taken his staid departure when jess cleared the teathings off the table remarking simply that it was a mercy we had not got beyond the first cup  we then retired to dress  about six oclock the time announced for the ceremony i elbowed my way through the expectant throng of men women and children that already besieged the smiths door  shrill demands of toss toss rent the air every time jesss head showed on the windowblind and andra hoped as i pushed open the door that i hadna forgotten my bawbees  weddings were celebrated among the auld lichts by showers of hapence and the guests on their way to the brides house had to scatter to the hungry rabble like housewives feeding poultry  willie todd the best man who had never come out so strong in his life before slipped through the back window while the crowd led on by kitty mcqueen seethed in front and making a bolt for it to the sosh was back in a moment with a handful of small change  dinna toss ower lavishly at first the smith whispered me nervously as we followed jess and willie into the darkening wynd  the guests were packed hot and solemn in johnny allardices room the men anxious to surrender their seats to the ladies who happened to be standing but too bashful to propose it the ham and the fish frizzling noisily side by side but the house and hissing out every now and then to let all whom it might concern know that janet craik was adding more water to the gravy  a better woman never lived but oh the hypocrisy of the face that beamed greeting to the guests as if it had nothing to do but politely show them in and gasped next moment with upraised arms over what was nearly a fall in crockery  when janet sped to the door her spleet new merino dress fell to the pulling of a string over her homemade petticoat like the dropscene in a theatre and rose as promptly when she returned to slice the bacon  the murmur of admiration that filled the room when she entered with the minister was an involuntary tribute to the spotlessness of her wrapper and a great triumph for janet  if there is an impression that the dress of the auld lichts was on all occasions as sombre as their faces let it be known that the bride was but one of several in whites and that mag munn had only at the last moment been dissuaded from wearing flowers the minister the auld lichts congratulated themselves disapproved of all such decking of the person and bowing of the head to idols but on such an occasion he was not expected to observe it  bell whamond however has reason for knowing that marriages or no marriages he drew the line at curls  by and by saml todd looking a little dazed was pushed into the middle of the room to tibbies side and the minister raised his voice in prayer  all eyes closed reverently except perhaps the bridegrooms which seemed glazed and vacant  it was an open question in the community whether mr dishart did not miss his chance at weddings the men shaking their heads over the comparative brevity of the ceremony the women worshipping him though he never hesitated to rebuke them when they showed it too openly for the urbanity of his manners  at that time however only a minister of such experience as mr disharts predecessor could lead up to a marriage in prayer without inadvertently joining the couple and the catechizing was mercifully brief  another prayer followed the union the minister waived his right to kiss the bride every one looked at every other one as if he had for the moment forgotten what he was on the point of saying and found it very annoying and janet signed frantically to willie todd who nodded intelligently in reply but evidently had no idea what she meant  in time johnny allardice our host who became more and more doited as the night proceeded remembered his instructions and led the way to the kitchen where the guests having politely informed their hostess that they were not hungry partook of a hearty tea  mr dishart presided with the bride and bridegroom near him but though he tried to give an agreeable turn to the conversation by describing the extensions at the cemetery his personality oppressed us and we only breathed freely when he rose to go  yet we marvelled at his versatility  in shaking hands with the newlymarried couple the minister reminded them that it was leapyear and wished them three hundred and sixtysix happy and godfearing days  samls station being too high for it tibbie did not have a penny wedding which her thrifty mother bewailed penny weddings starting a couple in life  i can recall nothing more characteristic of the nation from which the auld lichts sprung than the penny wedding where the only revellers that were not out of pocket by it were the couple who gave the entertainment  the more the guests ate and drank the better pecuniarily for their hosts  the charge for admission to the penny wedding practically to the feast that followed it varied in different districts but with us it was generally a shilling  perhaps the penny extra to the fiddler accounts for the name penny wedding  the ceremony having been gone through in the brides house there was an adjournment to a barn or other convenient place of meeting where was held the nuptial feast long white boards from rob anguss sawmill supported on trestles stood in lieu of tables and those of the company who could not find a seat waited patiently against the wall for a vacancy  the shilling gave every guest the free run of the groaning board but though fowls were plentiful and even white bread too little had been spent on them  the farmers of the neighbourhood who looked forward to providing the young people with drills of potatoes for the coming winter made a bid for their custom by sending them a fowl gratis for the marriage supper  it was popularly understood to be the oldest cock of the farmyard but for all that it made a brave appearance in a shallow sea of soup  the fowls were always boiledwithout exception so far as my memory carries me the guidwife never having the heart to roast them and so lose the broth  one round of whiskyandwater was all the drink to which his shilling entitled the guest  if he wanted more he had to pay for it  there was much revelry with song and dance that no stranger could have thought those stifflimbed weavers capable of and the more they shouted and whirled through the barn the more their host smiled and rubbed his hands  he presided at the bar improvised for the occasion and if the thing was conducted with spirit his bride flung an apron over her gown and helped him  i remember one elderly bridegroom who having married a blind woman had to do double work at his penny wedding  it was a sight to see him flitting about the torchlit barn with a kettle of hot water in one hand and a besom to sweep up crumbs in the other  though saml had no penny wedding however we made a night of it at his marriage  wedding chariots were not in those days though i know of auld lichts being conveyed to marriages nowadays by horses with white ears  the tea over we formed in couples andthe best man with the bride the bridegroom with the best maid leading the waymarched in slow procession in the moonlight night to tibbies new home between lines of hoarse and eager onlookers  an attempt was made by an itinerant musician to head the company with his fiddle but instrumental music even in the streets was abhorrent to sound auld lichts and the minister had spoken privately to willie todd on the subject  as a consequence peter was driven from the ranks  the last thing i saw that night as we filed bareheaded and solemn into the newlymarried couples house was kitty mcqueens vigorous arm in a dishevelled sleeve pounding a pair of urchins who had got between her and a muddy hapenny  that night there was revelry and boisterous mirth or what the auld lichts took for such in tibbies kitchen  at eleven oclock davit lunan cracked a joke  davie haggart in reply to bell dundass request gave a song of distinctly secular tendencies  the bride who had carefully taken off her wedding gown on getting home and donned a wrapper coquettishly let the bridegrooms father hold her hand  in auld licht circles when one of the company was offered whisky and refused it the others as if pained even at the offer pushed it from them as a thing abhorred  but davie haggart set another example on this occasion and no one had the courage to refuse to follow it  we sat late round the dying fire and it was only willie todds scandalous assertion he was but a boy about his being able to dance that induced us to think of moving  in the community i understand this marriage is still memorable as the occasion on which bell whamond laughed in the ministers face     chapter v  the auld lichts in arms  arms and men i sing douce jeemsy todd rushing from his loom armed with a bedpost lisbeth whamond an avenging whirlwind neil haggart pausing in his thanksofferings to smite and slay the impious foe scudding up the bleeding braehead with nemesis at their flashing heels the minister holding it a nice question whether the carnage was not justified  then came the two hours sermons of the following sabbath when mr dishart revolving like a teetotum in the pulpit damned every bandaged person present individually and collectively and lang tammas in the precentors box with a plaster on his cheek included any one the minister might have by chance omitted and the congregation with most of their eyes bunged up burst into psalms of praise  twice a year the auld lichts went demented  the occasion was the fast day at tilliedrum when its inhabitants instead of crowding reverently to the kirk swooped profanely down in their scores and tens of scores on our godfearing town intent on making a day of it  then did the weavers rise as one man and go forth to show the ribald crew the errors of their way  all denominations were represented but auld lichts led  an auld licht would have taken no mans blood without the conviction that he would be the better morally for the bleeding and if tammas lunans case gave an impetus to the blows it can only have been because it opened wider auld licht eyes to tilliedrums desperate condition  mr disharts predecessor more than once remarked that at the creation the devil put forward a claim for thrums but said he would take his chance of tilliedrum and the statement was generally understood to be made on the authority of the original hebrew  the mustardseed of a feud between the two parishes shot into a tall tree in a single night when davit lunans father went to a tattie roup at tilliedrum and thoughtlessly died there  twentyfour hours afterwards a small party of staid auld lichts carrying long white poles stepped out of various wynds and closes and picked their solemn way to the house of mourning  nanny low the widow received them dejectedly as one oppressed by the knowledge that her mans death at such an inopportune place did not fulfil the promise of his youth and her guests admitted bluntly that they were disappointed in tammas snecky hobarts fathers unusually long and impressive prayer was an official intimation that the deceased in the opinion of the session sorely needed everything of the kind he could get and then the silent driblet of auld lichts in black stalked off in the direction of tilliedrum  women left their spinningwheels and pirns to follow them with their eyes along the tenements and the minister was known to be holding an extra service at the manse  when the little procession reached the boundaryline between the two parishes they sat down on a dyke and waited  by and by half a dozen men drew near from the opposite direction bearing on poles the remains of tammas lunan in a closed coffin  the coffin was brought to within thirty yards of those who awaited it and then roughly lowered to the ground  its bearers rested morosely on their poles  in conveying lunans remains to the borders of his own parish they were only conforming to custom but thrums and tilliedrum differed as to where the boundaryline was drawn and not a foot would either advance into the others territory  for half a day the coffin lay unclaimed and the two parties sat scowling at each other  neither dared move  gloaming had stolen into the valley when dite deuchars of tilliedrum rose to his feet and deliberately spat upon the coffin  a stone whizzed through the air and then the ugly spectacle was presented in the grey night of a dozen mutes fighting with their poles over a coffin  there was blood on the shoulders that bore tammass remains to thrums  after that meeting tilliedrum lived for the fast day  never perhaps was there a community more given up to sin and thrums felt called to its chastisement  the insult to lunans coffin however dispirited their weavers for a time and not until the suicide of pitlums did they put much fervour into their prayers  it made new men of them tilliedrums sins had found it out  pitlums was a farmer in the parish of thrums but he had been born at tilliedrum and thrums thanked providence for that when it saw him suspended between two hams from his kitchen rafters  the custom was to cart suicides to the quarry at the galla pond and bury them near the cairn that had supported the gallows but on this occasion not a farmer in the parish would lend a cart and for a week the corpse lay on the sanded floor as it had been cut downan object of awestruck interest to boys who knew no better than to peep through the darkened window  tilliedrum bit its lips at home  the auld licht minister it was said had been approached on the subject but after serious consideration did not see his way to offering up a prayer  finally old hobart and two others tied a rope round the body and dragged it from the farm to the cairn a distance of four miles  instead of this incidents humbling tilliedrum into attending church the next fast day saw its streets deserted  as for the thrums auld lichts only heavy wobs prevented their walking erect like men who had done their duty  if no prayer was volunteered for pitlums before his burial there was a great deal of psalmsinging after it  by early morn on their fast day the tilliedrummers were straggling into thrums and the weavers already at their looms read the clattering of feet and carts aright  to convince themselves all they had to do was to raise their eyes but the first triumph would have been to tilliedrum if they had done that  the invadersthe men in aberdeen blue serge coats velvet kneebreeches and broad blue bonnets and the wincey gowns of the women set off with hooded cloaks of red or tartantapped at the windows and shouted insultingly as they passed but with pursed lips thrums bent fiercely over its wobs and not an auld licht showed outside his door  the day wore on to noon and still ribaldry was master of the wynds  but there was a change inside the houses  the minister had pulled down his blinds moody men had left their looms for stools by the fire there were rumours of a conflict in andra gowries close from which kitty mcqueen had emerged with her short gown in rags and lang tammas was going from door to door  the austere precentor admonished fiery youth to beware of giving way to passion and it was a proud day for the auld lichts to find their leading elder so conversant with apt scripture texts  they bowed their heads reverently while he thundered forth that those who lived by the sword would perish by the sword and when he had finished they took him ben to inspect their bludgeons  i have a vivid recollection of going the round of the auld licht and other houses to see the sticks and the wrists in coils of wire  a stranger in the tenements in the afternoon would have noted more than one draggled youth in holiday attire sitting on a doorstep with a wet cloth to his nose and passing down the commonty he would have had to step over prostrate lumps of humanity from which all shape had departed  gavin ogilvy limped heavily after his encounter with thrummy tosha struggle that was looked forward to eagerly as a biyearly event chirsty davies development of muscle had not prevented her going down before the terrible onslaught of joe the miller and lang tammass plasters told a tale  it was in the square that the two parties leading their maimed and blind formed in force tilliedrum thirsting for its opponents blood and thrums humbly accepting the responsibility of punching the fast day breakers into the ways of rectitude  in the small illkept square the invaders to the number of about a hundred were wedged together at its upper end while the thrums people formed in a thick line at the foot  for its inhabitants the way to tilliedrum lay through this threatening mass of armed weavers  no words were bandied between the two forces the centre of the square was left open and nearly every eye was fixed on the townhouse clock  it directed operations and gave the signal to charge  the moment six oclock struck the upper mass broke its bonds and flung itself on the living barricade  there was a clatter of heads and sticks a yelling and a groaning and then the invaders bursting through the opposing ranks fled for tilliedrum  down the tanage brae and up the braehead they skurried half a hundred avenging spirits in pursuit  on the tilliedrum fast day i have tasted blood myself  in the godless place there is no auld licht kirk but there are two auld lichts in it now who walk to thrums to church every sabbath blow or rain as it lists  they are making their influence felt in tilliedrum  the auld lichts also did valorous deeds at the battle of cabbylatch the farm land so named lies a mile or more to the south of thrums  you have to go over the rim of the cup to reach it  it is lowlying and uninteresting to the eye except for some giant stones scattered cold and naked through the fields  no human hands reared these boulders but they might be looked upon as tombstones to the heroes who fell to rise hurriedly on the plain of cabbylatch  the fight of cabbylatch belongs to the days of what are now but dimly remembered as the meal mobs  then there was a wild cry all over the country for bread not the fine loaves that we know but something very much coarser and hungry men and women prematurely shrunken began to forget the taste of meal  potatoes were their chief sustenance and when the crop failed starvation gripped them  at that time the farmers having control of the meal had the small towns at their mercy and they increased its cost  the price of the meal went up and up until the famishing people swarmed up the sides of the carts in which it was conveyed to the towns and tearing open the sacks devoured it in handfuls  in thrums they had a stern sense of justice and for a time after taking possession of the meal they carried it to the square and sold it at what they considered a reasonable price  the money was handed over to the farmers  the honesty of this is worth thinking about but it seems to have only incensed the farmers the more and when they saw that to send their meal to the town was not to get high prices for it they laid their heads together and then gave notice that the people who wanted meal and were able to pay for it must come to the farms  in thrums no one who cared to live on porridge and bannocks had money to satisfy the farmers but on the other hand none of them grudged going for it and go they did  they went in numbers from farm to farm like bands of hungry rats and throttled the opposition they not infrequently encountered  the raging farmers at last met in council and noting that they were lusty men and brave resolved to march in armed force upon the erring people and burn their town  now we come to the battle of cabbylatch  the farmers were not less than eighty strong and chiefly consisted of cavalry  armed with pitchforks and cumbrous scythes where they were not able to lay their hands on the more orthodox weapons of war they presented a determined appearance the few footsoldiers who had no carthorses at their disposal bearing in their arms bundles of firewood  one memorable morning they set out to avenge their losses and by and by a halt was called when each man bowed his head to listen  in thrums pipe and drum were calling the inhabitants to arms scouts rushed in with the news that the farmers were advancing rapidly upon the town and soon the streets were clattering with feet  at that time thrums had its piper and drummer the bellman of a later and more degenerate age and on this occasion they marched together through the narrow wynds firing the blood of haggard men and summoning them to the square  according to my informants father the gathering of these angry and startled weavers when he thrust his blue bonnet on his head and rushed out to join them was an impressive and solemn spectacle that bloodshed was meant there can be no doubt for starving men do not see the ludicrous side of things  the difference between the farmers and the town had resolved itself into an ugly and sullen hate and the wealthier townsmen who would have come between the people and the bread were fiercely pushed aside  there was no nominal leader but every man in the ranks meant to fight for himself and his belongings and they are said to have sallied out to meet the foe in no disorder  the women they would fain have left behind them but these had their own injuries to redress and they followed in their husbands wake carrying bags of stones  the men who were of various denominations were armed with sticks blunderbusses anything they could snatch up at a moments notice and some of them were not unacquainted with fighting  dire silence prevailed among the men but the women shouted as they ran and the curious army moved forward to the drone and squall of drum and pipe  the enemy was sighted on the level land of cabbylatch and here while the intending combatants glared at each other a wellknown local magnate galloped his horse between them and ordered them in the name of the king to return to their homes  but for the farmers that meant further depredation at the peoples hands and the townsmen would not go back to their gloomy homes to sit down and wait for sunshine  soon stones the first it is said cast by a woman darkened the air  the farmers got the word to charge but their horses with the best intentions did not know the way  there was a stampeding in different directions a blind rushing of one frightened steed against another and then the townspeople breaking any ranks they had hitherto managed to keep rushed vindictively forward  the struggle at cabbylatch itself was not of long duration for their own horses proved the farmers worst enemies except in the cases where these sagacious animals took matters into their own ordering and bolted judiciously for their stables  the day was to thrums  individual deeds of prowess were done that day  of these not the least fondly remembered by her descendants were those of the gallant matron who pursued the most obnoxious farmer in the district even to his very porch with heavy stones and opprobrious epithets  once when he thought he had left her far behind did he alight to draw breath and take a pinch of snuff and she was upon him like a flail  with a terrorstricken cry he leapt once more upon his horse and fled but not without leaving his snuffbox in the hands of the derisive enemy meggy has long gone to the kirkyard but the snuffmull is still preserved  some ugly cuts were given and received and heads as well as ribs were broken but the townsmens triumph was shortlived  the ringleaders were whipped through the streets of perth as a warning to persons thinking of taking the law into their own hands and all the lasting consolation they got was that some time afterwards the chief witness against them the parish minister met with a mysterious death  they said it was evidently the hand of god but some people looked suspiciously at them when they said it     chapter vi  the old dominie  from the new cemetery which is the highest point in thrums you just fail to catch sight of the red schoolhouse that nestles between two bare trees some five miles up the glen of quharity  this was proved by davit lunan tinsmith whom i have heard tell the story  it was in the time when the cemetery gates were locked to keep the bodies of suicides out but men who cared to risk the consequences could get the coffin over the high dyke and bury it themselves  peter lundys coffin broke as one might say into the churchyard in this way peter having hanged himself in the whunny wood when he saw that work he must  the general feeling among the intimates of the deceased was expressed by davit when he said  it may do the crittur nae guid i the tail o the day but he paid fors bit o ground an hes ins richt to occupy it  the custom was to push the coffin on to the wall up a plank and then let it drop less carefully into the cemetery  some of the mourners were dragging the plank over the wall with davit lunan on the top directing them when they seem to have let go and sent the tinsmith suddenly into the air  a week afterwards it struck davit when in the act of soldering a hole in leeby wheenss flagon here he branched off to explain that he had made the flagon years before and that leeby was sister to tammas wheens and married one baker robbie who died of chickenpox in his fortyfourth year that when up there he had a view of quharity schoolhouse  davit was as truthful as a man who tells the same story more than once can be expected to be and it is far from a suspicious circumstance that he did not remember seeing the schoolhouse all at once  in thrums things only struck them gradually the new cemetery for instance was only so called because it had been new once  in this red stone school full of the modern improvements that he detested the old dominie whom i succeeded taught and sometimes slept during the last five years of his cantankerous life  it was in a little thatched school consisting of but one room that he did his best work some five hundred yards away from the edifice that was reared in its stead  now dismally fallen into disrepute often indeed a domicile for cattle the ragged academy of glen quharity where he held despotic sway for nearly half a century is falling to pieces slowly in a howe that conceals it from the high road  even in its best scholastic days when it sent barefooted lads to college who helped to hasten the disruption it was but a pile of ungainly stones such as scotts black dwarf flung together in a night with holes in its broken roof of thatch where the rain trickled through and never with less than two of its knotted little windowpanes stopped with brown paper the twelve or twenty pupils of both sexes who constituted the attendance sat at the two loose desks which never fell unless you leaned on them with an eye on the corner of the earthen floor where the worms came out and on cold days they liked the wind to turn the peat smoke into the room  one boy who was supposed to wash it out got his education free for keeping the schoolhouse dirty and the others paid their way with peats which they brought in their hands just as wealthier schoolchildren carry books and with pence which the dominie collected regularly every monday morning  the attendance on monday mornings was often small  once a year the dominie added to his income by holding cockfights in the old school  this was at yule and the same practice held in the parish school of thrums  it must have been a strange sight  every male scholar was expected to bring a cock to the school and to pay a shilling to the dominie for the privilege of seeing it killed there the dominie was the master of the sports assisted by the neighbouring farmers some of whom might be elders of the church  three rounds were fought  by the end of the first round all the cocks had fought and the victors were then pitted against each other  the cocks that survived the second round were eligible for the third and the dominie besides his shilling got every cock killed  sometimes if all stories be true the spectators were fighting with each other before the third round concluded  the glen was but sparsely dotted with houses even in those days a number of them inhabited by farmerweavers who combined two trades and just managed to live  one would have a plough another a horse and so in glen quharity they helped each other  without a loom in addition many of them would have starved and on saturdays the big farmer and his wife driving home in a gig would pass the little farmer carrying or wheeling his wob to thrums  when there was no longer a market for the produce of the handloom these farms had to be given up and thus it is that the old school is not the only house in our weary glen around which gooseberry and currant bushes once tended by careful hands now grow wild  in heavy spates the children were conveyed to the old school as they are still to the new one in carts and between it and the dominies whitewashed dwellinghouse swirled in winter a torrent of water that often carried lumps of the land along with it  this burn he had at times to ford on stilts  before the education act passed the dominie was not much troubled by the school inspector who appeared in great splendour every year at thrums  fifteen years ago however glen quharity resolved itself into a school board and marched down the glen with the minister at its head to condemn the school  when the dominie who had heard of their design saw the board approaching he sent one of his scholars who enjoyed making a mess of himself wading across the burn to bring over the stilts which were lying on the other side  the board were thus unable to send across a spokesman and after they had harangued the dominie who was in the best of tempers from the wrong side of the stream the siege was raised by their returning home this time with the minister in the rear  so far as is known this was the only occasion on which the dominie ever lifted his hat to the minister  he was the established church minister at the top of the glen but the dominie was an auld licht and trudged into thrums to church nearly every sunday with his daughter  the farm of little tilly lay so close to the dominies house that from one window he could see through a telescope whether the farmer was going to church owing to little tillys habit of never shaving except with that intention and of always doing it at a lookingglass which he hung on a nail in his door  the farmer was established church and when the dominie saw him in his shirtsleeves with a razor in his hand he called for his black clothes  if he did not see him it is undeniable that the dominie sent his daughter to thrums but remained at home himself  possibly therefore the dominie sometimes went to church because he did not want to give little tilly and the established minister the satisfaction of knowing that he was not devout today and it is even conceivable that had little tilly had a telescope and an intellect as well as his neighbour he would have spied on the dominie in return  he sent the teacher a load of potatoes every year and the recipient rated him soundly if they did not turn out as well as the ones he had got the autumn before  little tilly was rather in awe of the dominie and had an idea that he was a freethinker because he played the fiddle and wore a black cap  the dominie was a wizenedlooking little man with sharp eyes that pierced you when they thought they were unobserved and if any visitor drew near who might be a member of the board he disappeared into his house much as a startled weasel makes for its hole  the most striking thing about him was his walk which to the casual observer seemed a limp  the glen in our part is marshy and to progress along it you have to jump from one little island of grass or heather to another perhaps it was this that made the dominie take the main road and even the streets of thrums in leaps as if there were boulders or puddles in the way  it is however currently believed among those who knew him best that he jerked himself along in that way when he applied for the vacancy in glen quharity school and that he was therefore chosen from among the candidates by the committee of farmers who saw that he was specially constructed for the district  in the spring the inspector was sent to report on the school and of course he said with a wave of his hand that this would never do  so a new school was built and the ramshackle little academy that had done good service in its day was closed for the last time  for years it had been without a lock ever since a blatter of wind and rain drove the door against the fireplace  after that it was the dominies custom on seeing the room cleared to send in a smart boya dux was always chosenwho wedged a clod of earth or peat between doorpost and door thus the school was locked up for the night  the boy came out by the window where he entered to open the door next morning  in time grass hid the little path from view that led to the old school and a dozen years ago every particle of wood about the building including the door and the framework of the windows had been burned by travelling tinkers  the board would have liked to leave the dominie in his whitewashed dwellinghouse to enjoy his old age comfortably and until he learned that he had intended to retire  then he changed his tactics and removed his beard  instead of railing at the new school he began to approve of it and it soon came to the ears of the horrified established minister who had a man established in his eye for the appointment that the dominie was looking ten years younger  as he spurned a pension he had to get the place and then began a warfare of bickerings between the board and him that lasted until within a few weeks of his death  in his scholastic barn the dominie had thumped the latin grammar into his scholars till they became university bursars to escape him  in the new school with maps which he hid in the henhouse and every other modern appliance for making teaching easy he was the scandal of the glen  he snapped at the clerk of the boards throat and barred his door in the ministers face  it was one of his favourite relaxations to peregrinate the district telling the farmers who were not on the board themselves but were given to gossiping with those who were that though he could slumber pleasantly in the school so long as the hum of the standards was kept up he immediately woke if it ceased  having settled himself in his new quarters the dominie seems to have read over the code and come at once to the conclusion that it would be idle to think of straightforwardly fulfilling its requirements  the inspector he regarded as a natural enemy who was to be circumvented by much guile  one year that admirable oxford don arrived at the school to find that all the children except two girlsone of whom had her face tied up with red flannelwere away for the harvest  on another occasion the dominie met the inspectors trap some distance from the school and explained that he would guide him by a short cut leaving the driver to take the dogcart to a farm where it could be put up the unsuspecting inspector agreed and they set off the obsequious dominie carrying his bag  he led his victim into another glen the hills round which had hidden their heads in mist and then slyly remarked that he was afraid they had lost their way  the minister who liked to attend the examination reproved the dominie for providing no luncheon but turned pale when his enemy suggested that he should examine the boys in latin  for some reason that i could never discover the dominie had all his life refused to teach his scholars geography  the inspector and many others asked him why there was no geography class and his invariable answer was to point to his pupils collectively and reply in an impressive whisper  they winna hae her  this story too seems to reflect against the dominies views on cleanliness  one examination day the minister attended to open the inspection with prayer  just as he was finishing a scholar entered who had a reputation for dirt  michty cried a little pupil as his opening eyes fell on the apparition at the door theres jocky tamson wi his face washed  when the dominie was a younger man he had first clashed with the minister during mr rattrays attempts to do away with some old customs that were already dying by inches  one was the selection of a queen of beauty from among the young women at the annual thrums fair  the judges who were selected from the betterknown farmers as a rule sat at the door of a tent that reeked of whisky and regarded the competitors filing by much as they selected prize sheep with a stolid stare  there was much giggling and blushing on these occasions among the maidens and shouts from their relatives and friends to haud yer head up jean and lat them see yer een jess  the dominie enjoyed this and was one time chosen a judge when he insisted on the prizes being bestowed on his own daughter marget  the other judges demurred but the dominie remained firm and won the day  she wasna the bestfaured amon them he admitted afterwards but a man maun mak the maist o his ain  the dominie too would not shake his head with mr rattray over the apple and loaf bread raffles in the smithy nor even at the daft days the black week of glum debauch that ushered in the year a period when the whole countryside rumbled to the farmers kebecladen cart  for the great part of his career the dominie had not made forty pounds a year but he died worth about three hundred pounds  the moral of his life came in just as he was leaving it for he rose from his deathbed to hide a whisky bottle from his wife     chapter vii  cree queery and mysy drolly  the children used to fling stones at grinder queery because he loved his mother  i never heard the grinders real name  he and his mother were queery and drolly contemptuously so called and they answered to these names  i remember cree best as a battered old weaver who bent forward as he walked with his arms hanging limp as if ready to grasp the shafts of the barrow behind which it was his life to totter uphill and downhill a rope of yarn suspended round his shaking neck and fastened to the shafts assisting him to bear the yoke and slowly strangling him  by and by there came a time when the barrow and the weaver seemed both palsystricken and cree gasping for breath would stop in the middle of a brae unable to push his load over a stone then he laid himself down behind it to prevent the barrows slipping back  on those occasions only the barefooted boys who jeered at the panting weaver could put new strength into his shrivelled arms  they did it by telling him that he and mysy would have to go to the poorshouse after all at which the grey old man would wince as if joukin from a blow and shuddering rise and with a desperate effort gain the top of the incline  small blame perhaps attached to cree if as he neared his grave he grew a little dottle  his loads of yarn frequently took him past the workhouse and his eyelids quivered as he drew near  boys used to gather round the gate in anticipation of his coming and make a feint of driving him inside  cree when he observed them sat down on his barrowshafts terrified to approach and i see them now pointing to the workhouse till he left his barrow on the road and hobbled away his legs cracking as he ran  it is strange to know that there was once a time when cree was young and straight a callant who wore a flower in his buttonhole and tried to be a hero for a maidens sake  before cree settled down as a weaver he was knife and scissorgrinder for three counties and mysy his mother accompanied him wherever he went  mysy trudged alongside him till her eyes grew dim and her limbs failed her and then cree was told that she must be sent to the paupers home  after that a pitiable and beautiful sight was to be seen  grinder queery already a feeble man would wheel his grindstone along the long high road leaving mysy behind  he took the stone on a few hundred yards and then hiding it by the roadside in a ditch or behind a paling returned for his mother  her he ledsometimes he almost carried herto the place where the grindstone lay and thus by double journeys kept her with him  every one said that mysys death would be a merciful releaseevery one but cree  cree had been a grinder from his youth having learned the trade from his father but he gave it up when mysy became almost blind  for a time he had to leave her in thrums with danl wilkies wife and find employment himself in tilliedrum  mysy got me to write several letters for her to cree and she cried while telling me what to say  i never heard either of them use a term of endearment to the other but all mysy could tell me to put in writing wasoh my son cree oh my beloved son oh i have no one but you oh thou god watch over my cree  on one of these occasions mysy put into my hands a paper which she said would perhaps help me to write the letter  it had been drawn up by cree many years before when he and his mother had been compelled to part for a time and i saw from it that he had been trying to teach mysy to write  the paper consisted of phrases such as dear son cree loving mother i am takin my food weel yesterday blankets the peats is near done mr dishart come home cree  the grinder had left this paper with his mother and she had written letters to him from it  when danl wilkie objected to keeping a cranky old body like mysy in his house cree came back to thrums and took a single room with a handloom in it  the flooring was only lumpy earth with sacks spread over it to protect mysys feet  the room contained two dilapidated old coffinbeds a dresser a highbacked armchair several threelegged stools and two tables of which one could be packed away beneath the other  in one corner stood the wheel at which cree had to fill his own pirns  there was a platerack on one wall and near the chimneypiece hung the wagatthewall clock the timepiece that was commonest in thrums at that time and that got this name because its exposed pendulum swung along the wall  the two windows in the room faced each other on opposite walls and were so small that even a child might have stuck in trying to crawl through them  they opened on hinges like a door  in the wall of the dark passage leading from the outer door into the room was a recess where a pan and pitcher of water always stood wedded as it were and a little hole known as the bole in the wall opposite the fireplace contained crees library  it consisted of baxters saints rest harveys meditations the pilgrims progress a work on folklore and several bibles  the sautbacket or saltbucket stood at the end of the fender which was half of an old cartwheel  here cree worked whistling ower the watter for chairlie to make mysy think that he was as gay as a mavis  mysy grew querulous in her old age and up to the end she thought of poor done cree as a handsome gallant  only by weaving far on into the night could cree earn as much as six shillings a week  he began at six oclock in the morning and worked until midnight by the light of his cruizey  the cruizey was all the lamp thrums had in those days though it is only to be seen in use now in a few oldworld houses in the glens  it is an ungainly thing in iron the size of a mans palm and shaped not unlike the palm when contracted and deepened to hold a liquid  whaleoil lying open in the mould was used and the wick was a rash with the green skin peeled off  these rashes were sold by herdboys at a halfpenny the bundle but cree gathered his own wicks the rashes skin readily when you know how to do it  the iron mould was placed inside another of the same shape but slightly larger for in time the oil dripped through the iron and the whole was then hung by a deck or hook close to the person using it  even with three wicks it gave but a stime of light and never allowed the weaver to see more than the half of his loom at a time  sometimes cree used threads for wicks  he was too dull a man to have many visitors but mr dishart called occasionally and reproved him for telling his mother lies  the lies cree told mysy were that he was sharing the meals he won for her and that he wore the overcoat which he had exchanged years before for a blanket to keep her warm  there was a terrible want of spirit about grinder queery  boys used to climb on to his stone roof with clods of damp earth in their hands which they dropped down the chimney  mysy was bedridden by this time and the smoke threatened to choke her so cree instead of chasing his persecutors bargained with them  he gave them flyhooks which he had busked himself and when he had nothing left to give he tried to flatter them into dealing gently with mysy by talking to them as men one night it went through the town that mysy now lay in bed all day listening for her summons to depart  according to her ideas this would come in the form of a tapping at the window and their intention was to forestall the spirit  dite gows boy who is now a grown man was hoisted up to one of the little windows and he has always thought of mysy since as he saw her then for the last time  she lay sleeping so far as he could see and cree sat by the fireside looking at her  every one knew that there was seldom a fire in that house unless mysy was cold  cree seemed to think that the fire was getting low  in the little closet which with the kitchen made up his house was a corner shut off from the rest of the room by a few boards and behind this he kept his peats  there was a similar receptacle for potatoes in the kitchen  cree wanted to get another peat for the fire without disturbing mysy  first he took off his boots and made for the peats on tiptoe  his shadow was cast on the bed however so he next got down on his knees and crawled softly into the closet  with the peat in his hands he returned in the same way glancing every moment at the bed where mysy lay  though tammy gows face was pressed against a broken window he did not hear cree putting that peat on the fire  some say that mysy heard but pretended not to do so for her sons sake that she realized the deception he played on her and had not the heart to undeceive him  but it would be too sad to believe that  the boys left cree alone that night  the old weaver lived on alone in that solitary house after mysy left him and by and by the story went abroad that he was saving money  at first no one believed this except the man who told it but there seemed after all to be something in it  you had only to hit crees trouser pocket to hear the money chinking for he was afraid to let it out of his clutch  those who sat on dykes with him when his days labour was over said that the weaver kept his hand all the time in his pocket and that they saw his lips move as he counted his hoard by letting it slip through his fingers  so there were boys who called miser queery after him instead of grinder and asked him whether he was saving up to keep himself from the workhouse  but we had all done cree wrong  it came out on his deathbed what he had been storing up his money for  grinder according to the doctor died of getting a good meal from a friend of his earlier days after being accustomed to starve on potatoes and a very little oatmeal indeed  the day before he died this friend sent him half a sovereign and when grinder saw it he sat up excitedly in his bed and pulled his corduroys from beneath his pillow  the woman who out of kindness attended him in his last illness looked on curiously while cree added the sixpences and coppers in his pocket to the halfsovereign  after all they only made some two pounds but a look of peace came into crees eyes as he told the woman to take it all to a shop in the town nearly twelve years previously jamie lownie had lent him two pounds and though the money was never asked for it preyed on crees mind that he was in debt  he payed off all he owed and so crees life was not i think a failure     chapter viii  the courting of tnowheads bell  for two years it had been notorious in the square that saml dickie was thinking of courting tnowheads bell and that if little sanders elshioner which is the thrums pronunciation of alexander alexander went in for her he might prove a formidable rival  saml was a weaver in the tenements and sanders a coalcarter whose trade mark was a bell on his horses neck that told when coals were coming  being something of a public man sanders had not perhaps so high a social position as saml but he had succeeded his father on the coalcart while the weaver had already tried several trades  it had always been against saml too that once when the kirk was vacant he had advised the selection of the third minister who preached for it on the ground that it came expensive to pay a large number of candidates  the scandal of the thing was hushed up out of respect for his father who was a godfearing man but saml was known by it in lang tammass circle the coalcarter was called little sanders to distinguish him from his father who was not much more than half his size  he had grown up with the name and its inapplicability now came home to nobody  samls mother had been more farseeing than sanderss  her man had been called sammy all his life because it was the name he got as a boy so when their eldest son was born she spoke of him as saml while still in his cradle  the neighbours imitated her and thus the young man had a better start in life than had been granted to sammy his father  it was saturday eveningthe night in the week when auld licht young men fell in love  saml dickie wearing a blue glengarry bonnet with a red ball on the top came to the door of a onestorey house in the tenements and stood there wriggling for he was in a suit of tweed for the first time that week and did not feel at one with them  when his feeling of being a stranger to himself wore off he looked up and down the road which straggles between houses and gardens and then picking his way over the puddles crossed to his fathers henhouse and sat down on it  he was now on his way to the square  eppie fargus was sitting on an adjoining dyke knitting stockings and saml looked at her for a time  ist yersel eppie he said at last  its a that said eppie  hoos a wi ye asked saml  were juist aff an on replied eppie cautiously  there was not much more to say but as saml sidled off the henhouse he murmured politely ay ay  in another minute he would have been fairly started but eppie resumed the conversation  saml she said with a twinkle in her eye ye can tell lisbeth fargus ill likely be drappin in on her aboot mununday or teisday  lisbeth was sister to eppie and wife of tammas mcquhatty better known as tnowhead which was the name of his farm  she was thus bells mistress  saml leant against the henhouse as if all his desire to depart had gone  hoo dye kin ill be at the tnowhead the nicht he asked grinning in anticipation  ou ise warrant yell be after bell said eppie  am no sae sure o that said saml trying to leer  he was enjoying himself now  am no sure o that he repeated for eppie seemed lost in stitches  saml  ay  yell be speirin her sune noo i dinna doot  this took saml who had only been courting bell for a year or two a little aback  hoo dye mean eppie he asked  maybe yell dot the nicht  na theres nae hurry said saml

ye can tell her gin ye like  i widna think twice o tellin her mysel  the lord forgie ye for leein saml said eppie as he disappeared down tammy toshs close  here he came upon henders webster  yere late saml said henders  what for  ou i was thinkin ye wid be gaen the length o tnowhead the nicht an i saw sanders elshioner makkins wy there an oor syne  did ye cried saml adding craftily but its naething to me  tod lad said henders gin ye dinna buckle to sandersll be carryin her off  saml flung back his head and passed on  saml cried henders after him  ay said saml wheeling round  gie bell a kiss frae me  the full force of this joke struck neither all at once  saml began to smile at it as he turned down the schoolwynd and it came upon henders while he was in his garden feeding his ferret  then he slapped his legs gleefully and explained the conceit to willum byars who went into the house and thought it over  there were twelve or twenty little groups of men in the square which was lit by a flare of oil suspended over a cadgers cart  now and again a staid young woman passed through the square with a basket on her arm and if she had lingered long enough to give them time some of the idlers would have addressed her  as it was they gazed after her and then grinned to each other  ay saml said two or three young men as saml joined them beneath the town clock  ay davit replied saml  this group was composed of some of the sharpest wits in thrums and it was not to be expected that they would let this opportunity pass perhaps when saml joined them he knew what was in store for him  was ye lookin for tnowheads bell saml asked one  or mebbe ye was wantin the minister suggested another the same who had walked out twice with chirsty duff and not married her after all  saml could not think of a good reply at the moment so he laughed goodnaturedly  ondoobtedly shes a snod bit crittur said davit archly  an michty clever wi her fingers added jamie deuchars  man ive thocht o makkin up to bell mysel said pete ogle  wid there be ony chance think ye saml  im thinkin she widna hae ye for her first pete replied saml in one of those happy flashes that come to some men but theres nae sayin but what she micht tak ye to finish up wi  the unexpectedness of this sally startled every one  though saml did not set up for a wit however like davit it was notorious that he could say a cutting thing once in a way  did ye ever see bell reddin up asked pete recovering from his overthrow  he was a man who bore no malice  its a sicht said saml solemnly  hoo will that be asked jamie deuchars  its weel worth yer while said pete to ging atower to the tnowhead an see  yell mind the closedin beds i the kitchen  ay weel theyre a fell spoilt crew tnowheads litlins an no that aisy to manage  th ither lasses lisbeths haen had a michty trouble wi them  when they war i the middle o their reddin up the bairns wid come tumlin about the floor but sal i assure ye bell didna fash lang wi them  did she saml  she did not said saml dropping into a fine mode of speech to add emphasis to his remark  ill tell ye what she did said pete to the others  she juist lifted up the litlins twa at a time an flung them into the coffinbeds  syne she snibbit the doors on them an keepit them there till the floor was dry  ay man did she so said davit admiringly  ive seen her dot mysel said saml  theres no a lassie maks better bannocks this side o fetter lums continued pete  her mither tocht her that said saml she was a gran han at the bakin kitty ogilvy  ive heard say remarked jamie putting it this way so as not to tie himself down to anything at bells scones is equal to mag lunans  so they are said saml almost fiercely  i kin shes a neat han at singein a hen said pete  an wit a said davit shes a snod canty bit stocky in her sabbath claes  if onything thick in the waist suggested jamie  i dinna see that said saml  i dna care for her hair either continued jamie who was very nice in his tastes something mair yallowchy wid be an improvement  abody kins growled saml at black hairs the bonniest  the others chuckled  puir saml pete said  saml not being certain whether this should be received with a smile or a frown opened his mouth wide as a kind of compromise  this was position one with him for thinking things over  few auld lichts as i have said went the length of choosing a helpmate for themselves  one day a young mans friends would see him mending the washing tub of a maidens mother  they kept the joke until saturday night and then he learned from them what he had been after it dazed him for a time but in a year or so he grew accustomed to the idea and they were then married  with a little help he fell in love just like other people  saml was going the way of the others but he found it difficult to come to the point  he only went courting once a week and he could never take up the running at the place where he left off the saturday before  thus he had not so far made great headway  his method of making up to bell had been to drop in at tnowhead on saturday nights and talk with the farmer about the rinderpest  the farm kitchen was bells testimonial  its chairs tables and stools were scoured by her to the whiteness of rob anguss sawmill boards and the muslin blind on the window was starched like a childs pinafore  bell was brave too as well as energetic  once thrums had been overrun with thieves  it is now thought that there may have been only one but he had the wicked cleverness of a gang  such was his repute that there were weavers who spoke of locking their doors when they went from home  he was not very skilful however being generally caught and when they said they knew he was a robber he gave them their things back and went away  if they had given him time there is no doubt that he would have gone off with his plunder  one night he went to tnowhead and bell who slept in the kitchen was wakened by the noise  she knew who it would be so she rose and dressed herself and went to look for him with a candle  the thief had not known what to do when he got in and as it was very lonely he was glad to see bell  she told him he ought to be ashamed of himself and would not let him out by the door until he had taken off his boots so as not to soil the carpet  on this saturday evening saml stood his ground in the square until by and by he found himself alone  there were other groups there still but his circle had melted away  they went separately and no one said goodnight  each took himself off slowly backing out of the group until he was fairly started  saml looked about him and then seeing that the others had gone walked round the townhouse into the darkness of the brae that leads down and then up to the farm of tnowhead  to get into the good graces of lisbeth fargus you had to know her ways and humour them  saml who was a student of women knew this and so instead of pushing the door open and walking in he went through the rather ridiculous ceremony of knocking  sanders elshioner was also aware of this weakness of lisbeths but though he often made up his mind to knock the absurdity of the thing prevented his doing so when he reached the door  tnowhead himself had never got used to his wifes refined notions and when any one knocked he always started to his feet thinking there must be something wrong  lisbeth came to the door her expansive figure blocking the way in  saml she said  lisbeth said saml  he shook hands with the farmers wife knowing that she liked it but only said ay bell to his sweetheart ay tnowhead to mcquhatty and its yersel sanders to his rival  they were all sitting round the fire tnowhead with his feet on the ribs wondering why he felt so warm and bell darned a stocking while lisbeth kept an eye on a goblet full of potatoes  sit into the fire saml said the farmer not however making way for him  na na said saml im to bide nae time  then he sat into the fire  his face was turned away from bell and when she spoke he answered her without looking round  saml felt a little anxious sanders elshioner who had one leg shorter than the other but looked well when sitting seemed suspiciously at home  he asked bell questions out of his own head which was beyond saml and once he said something to her in such a low voice that the others could not catch it  tnowhead asked curiously what it was and sanders explained that he had only said ay bell the morns the sabbath  there was nothing startling in this but saml did not like it  he began to wonder if he was too late and had he seen his opportunity would have told bell of a nasty rumour that sanders intended to go over to the free church if they would make him kirkofficer  illustration sabbath at tnowhead  from a photograph by g w wilson  saml had the goodwill of tnowheads wife who liked a polite man sanders did his best but from want of practice he constantly made mistakes  tonight for instance he wore his hat in the house because he did not like to put up his hand and take it off  tnowhead had not taken his off either but that was because he meant to go out by and by and lock the byre door  it was impossible to say which of her lovers bell preferred  the proper course with an auld licht lassie was to prefer the man who proposed to her  yell bide a wee an hae something to eat lisbeth asked saml with her eyes on the goblet  no i thank ye said saml with true genteelity  yell better  i dinna think it  hoots aye whats to hender ye  weel since yere sae pressin ill bide  no one asked sanders to stay  bell could not for she was but the servant and tnowhead knew that the kick his wife had given him meant that he was not to do so either  sanders whistled to show that he was not uncomfortable  ay then ill be stappin ower the brae he said at last  he did not go however  there was sufficient pride in him to get him off his chair but only slowly for he had to get accustomed to the notion of going  at intervals of two or three minutes he remarked that he must now be going  in the same circumstances saml would have acted similarly  for a thrums man it is one of the hardest things in life to get away from anywhere  at last lisbeth saw that something must be done  the potatoes were burning and tnowhead had an invitation on his tongue  yes ill hae to be movin said sanders hopelessly for the fifth time  guid nicht to ye then sanders said lisbeth  gie the door a flingto ahent ye  sanders with a mighty effort pulled himself together  he looked boldly at bell and then took off his hat carefully  saml saw with misgivings that there was something in it which was not a handkerchief it was a paper bag glittering with gold braid and contained such an assortment of sweets as lads bought for their lasses on the muckle friday  hae bell said sanders handing the bag to bell in an offhand way as if it were but a trifle  nevertheless he was a little excited for he went off without saying goodnight  no one spoke  bells face was crimson  tnowhead fidgetted on his chair and lisbeth looked at saml  the weaver was strangely calm and collected though he would have liked to know whether this was a proposal  sit in by to the table saml said lisbeth trying to look as if things were as they had been before  she put a saucerful of butter salt and pepper near the fire to melt for melted butter is the shoeinghorn that helps over a meal of potatoes  saml however saw what the hour required and jumping up he seized his bonnet  hing the tatties higher up the joist lisbeth he said with dignity ise be back in ten meenits  he hurried out of the house leaving the others looking at each other  what do ye think asked lisbeth  i dna kin faltered bell  thae tatties is lang o comin to the boil said tnowhead  in some circles a lover who behaved like saml would have been suspected of intent upon his rivals life but neither bell nor lisbeth did the weaver that injustice  in a case of this kind it does not much matter what tnowhead thought  the ten minutes had barely passed when saml was back in the farm kitchen  he was too flurried to knock this time and indeed lisbeth did not expect it of him  bell hae he cried handing his sweetheart a tinsel bag twice the size of sanderss gift  losh preserves exclaimed lisbeth ise warrant theres a shillins worth  theres a that lisbethan mair said saml firmly  i thank ye saml said bell feeling an unwonted elation as she gazed at the two paper bags in her lap  yere ower extravegint saml lisbeth said  not at all said saml not at all  but i widna advise ye to eat thae ither anes belltheyre second quality  bell drew back a step from saml  how do ye kin asked the farmer shortly for he liked sanders  i spiered i the shop said saml  the goblet was placed on a broken plate on the table with the saucer beside it and saml like the others helped himself  what he did was to take potatoes from the pot with his fingers peel off their coats and then dip them into the butter  lisbeth would have liked to provide knives and forks but she knew that beyond a certain point tnowhead was master in his own house  as for saml he felt victory in his hands and began to think that he had gone too far  in the meantime sanders little witting that saml had trumped his trick was sauntering along the kirkwynd with his hat on the side of his head  fortunately he did not meet the minister  the courting of tnowheads bell reached its crisis one sabbath about a month after the events above recorded  the minister was in great force that day but it is no part of mine to tell how he bore himself  i was there and am not likely to forget the scene  it was a fateful sabbath for tnowheads bell and her swains and destined to be remembered for the painful scandal which they perpetrated in their passion  bell was not in the kirk  there being an infant of six months in the house it was a question of either lisbeth or the lassies staying at home with him and though lisbeth was unselfish in a general way she could not resist the delight of going to church  she had nine children besides the baby and being but a woman it was the pride of her life to march them into the tnowhead pew so well watched that they dared not misbehave and so tightly packed that they could not fall  the congregation looked at that pew the mothers enviously when they sang the lines    jerusalem like a city is   compactly built together   the first half of the service had been gone through on this particular sunday without anything remarkable happening  it was at the end of the psalm which preceded the sermon that sanders elshioner who sat near the door lowered his head until it was no higher than the pews and in that attitude looking almost like a fourfooted animal slipped out of the church  in their eagerness to be at the sermon many of the congregation did not notice him and those who did put the matter by in their minds for future investigation  saml however could not take it so coolly  from his seat in the gallery he saw sanders disappear and his mind misgave him  with the true lovers instinct he understood it all  sanders had been struck by the fine turnout in the tnowhead pew  bell was alone at the farm  what an opportunity to work ones way up to a proposal  tnowhead was so overrun with children that such a chance seldom occurred except on a sabbath  sanders doubtless was off to propose and he saml was left behind  the suspense was terrible  saml and sanders had both known all along that bell would take the first of the two who asked her  even those who thought her proud admitted that she was modest  bitterly the weaver repented having waited so long  now it was too late  in ten minutes sanders would be at tnowhead in an hour all would be over saml rose to his feet in a daze  his mother pulled him down by the coattail and his father shook him thinking he was walking in his sleep  he tottered past them however hurried up the aisle which was so narrow that danl ross could only reach his seat by walking sideways and was gone before the minister could do more than stop in the middle of a whirl and gape in horror after him  a number of the congregation felt that day the advantage of sitting in the laft  what was a mystery to those downstairs was revealed to them from the gallery windows they had a fine open view to the south and as saml took the common which was a short cut though a steep ascent to tnowhead he was never out of their line of vision  sanders was not to be seen but they guessed rightly the reason why  thinking he had ample time he had gone round by the main road to save his bootsperhaps a little scared by what was coming  samls design was to forestall him by taking the shorter path over the burn and up the commonty  it was a race for a wife and several onlookers in the gallery braved the ministers displeasure to see who won  those who favoured samls suit exultingly saw him leap the stream while the friends of sanders fixed their eyes on the top of the common where it ran into the road sanders must come into sight there and the one who reached this point first would get bell  as auld lichts do not walk abroad on the sabbath sanders would probably not be delayed  the chances were in his favour  had it been any other day in the week saml might have run  so some of the congregation in the gallery were thinking when suddenly they saw him bend low and then take to his heels  he had caught sight of sanderss head bobbing over the hedge that separated the road from the common and feared that sanders might see him  the congregation who could crane their necks sufficiently saw a black object which they guessed to be the carters hat crawling along the hedgetop  for a moment it was motionless and then it shot ahead  the rivals had seen each other  it was now a hot race  saml dissembling no longer clattered up the common becoming smaller and smaller to the onlookers as he neared the top  more than one person in the gallery almost rose to their feet in their excitement  saml had it  no sanders was in front  then the two figures disappeared from view  they seemed to run into each other at the top of the brae and no one could say who was first  the congregation looked at one another  some of them perspired  but the minister held on his course  saml had just been in time to cut sanders out  it was the weavers saving that sanders saw this when his rival turned the corner for saml was sadly blown  sanders took in the situation and gave in at once  the last hundred yards of the distance he covered at his leisure and when he arrived at his destination he did not go in  it was a fine afternoon for the time of year and he went round to have a look at the pig about which tnowhead was a little sinfully puffed up  ay said sanders digging his fingers critically into the grunting animal quite so  grumph said the pig getting reluctantly to his feet  ou ay yes said sanders thoughtfully  then he sat down on the edge of the sty and looked long and silently at an empty bucket  but whether his thoughts were of tnowheads bell whom he had lost for ever or of the food the farmer fed his pig on is not known  lord preserves  are ye no at the kirk cried bell nearly dropping the baby as saml broke into the room  bell cried saml  then tnowheads bell knew that her hour had come  saml she faltered  will ye haes bell demanded saml glaring at her sheepishly  ay answered bell  saml fell into a chair  brings a drink o water bell he said  but bell thought the occasion required milk and there was none in the kitchen  she went out to the byre still with the baby in her arms and saw sanders elshioner sitting gloomily on the pigsty  weel bell said sanders  i thocht yed been at the kirk sanders said bell  then there was a silence between them  has saml spiered ye bell asked sanders stolidly  ay said bell again and this time there was a tear in her eye sanders was little better than an orra man and saml was a weaver and yet  but it was too late now  sanders gave the pig a vicious poke with a stick and when it had ceased to grunt bell was back in the kitchen  she had forgotten about the milk however and saml only got water after all  in after days when the story of bells wooing was told there were some who held that the circumstances would have almost justified the lassie in giving saml the goby  but these perhaps forgot that her other lover was in the same predicament as the accepted onethat of the two indeed he was the more to blame for he set off to tnowhead on the sabbath of his own accord while saml only ran after him  and then there is no one to say for certain whether bell heard of her suitors delinquencies until lisbeths return from the kirk  saml could never remember whether he told her and bell was not sure whether if he did she took it in  sanders was greatly in demand for weeks after to tell what he knew of the affair but though he was twice asked to tea to the manse among the trees and subjected thereafter to ministerial crossexaminations this is all he told  he remained at the pigsty until saml left the farm when he joined him at the top of the brae and they went home together  its yersel sanders said saml  it is so saml said sanders  very cauld said saml  blawy assented sanders  after a pause  saml said sanders  ay  im hearin yer to be mairit  ay  weel saml shes a snod bit lassie  thank ye said saml  i had ance a kin o notion o bell mysel continued sanders  ye had  yes saml but i thocht

and honourable state sanders yeve heard the minister ont  they say continued the relentless sanders at the minister doesna get on sair wi the wife himsel  so they do cried saml with a sinking at the heart  ive been telt sanders went on at gin ye can get the upper han o the wife for a while at first theres the mair chance o a harmonious exeestence  bells no the lassie said saml appealingly to

soul of sanders elshioner was filled with contempt for saml dickie  the scandal blew over  at first it was expected that the minister would interfere to prevent the union but beyond intimating from the pulpit that the souls of sabbathbreakers were beyond praying for and then praying for saml and sanders at great length with a word thrown in for bell he let things take their course  some said it was because he was always frightened lest his young men should intermarry with other denominations but sanders explained it differently to saml  i havna a word to say agin the minister he said theyre gran prayers but saml hes a mairit man himsel  hes a the better for that sanders isna he  do ye no see asked sanders compassionately at hes tryin to mak the best ot  oh sanders man said saml  cheer up saml said sanders itll sune be ower  their having been rival suitors had not interfered with their friendship  on the contrary while they had hitherto been mere acquaintances they became inseparables as the weddingday drew near it was noticed that they had much to say to each other and that when they could not get a room to themselves they wandered about together in the churchyard  when saml had anything to tell bell he sent sanders to tell it and sanders did as he was bid  there was nothing that he would not have done for saml  the more obliging sanders was however the sadder saml grew  he never laughed now on saturdays and sometimes his loom was silent half the day  saml felt that sanderss was the kindness of a friend for a dying man  it was to be a penny wedding and lisbeth fargus said it was delicacy that made saml superintend the fittingup of the barn by deputy  once he came to see it in person but he looked so ill that sanders had to see him home  this was on the thursday afternoon and the wedding was fixed for friday  sanders sanders said saml in a voice strangely unlike his own itll a be ower by this time the morn  it will said sanders  if i had only kent her langer

night before put on his sabbath clothes and strolled up to the manse  butbut where is saml asked the minister i must see himself  its a new arrangement said sanders  what do you mean sanders  bells to

credit sanders said the minister but i hope you do not enter upon the blessed state of matrimony without full consideration of its responsibilities  it is a serious business marriage  its a that said sanders but im willin to stan the risk  so as soon as it could be done sanders elshioner took to wife tnowheads bell and i remember seeing saml dickie trying to dance at the penny wedding  years afterwards it was said in thrums that saml had treated bell badly but he was never sure about it himself  it was a near thinga michty near thing he admitted in the square  they say some other weaver would remark at it was you bell liked best  i dna kin saml would reply but theres nae doot the lassie was fell fond o me  ou a mere passin fancys ye micht say     chapter ix  davit lunans political reminiscences  when an electionday comes round now it takes me back to the time of 1832  i would be eight or ten year old at the time  james strachan was at the door by five oclock in the morning in his sabbath clothes by arrangement  we was to go up to the hill to see them building the bonfire  moreover there was word that mr scrimgour was to be there tossing pennies just like at a marriage  i was wakened before that by my mother at the pans and bowls  i have always associated elections since that time with jellymaking for just as my mother would fill the cups and tankers and bowls with jelly to save cans she was emptying the pots and pans to make way for the ale and porter  james and me was to help to carry it home from the squarehim in the pitcher and me in a flagon because i was silly for my age and not strong in the arms  it was a very blowy morning though the rain kept off and what part of the bonfire had been built already was found scattered to the winds before we rose a great mass of folk was getting the barrels and things together again but some of them was never recovered and suspicion pointed to william geddes it being well known that william would not hesitate to carry off anything if unobserved  more by token chirsty lamby had seen him rolling home a barrowful of firewood early in the morning her having risen to hold cold water in her mouth being down with the toothache  when we got up to the hill everybody was making for the quarry which being more sheltered was now thought to be a better place for the bonfire  the masons had struck work it being a general holiday in the whole countryside  there was a great commotion of people all fine dressed and mostly with glengarry bonnets and me and james was well acquaint with them though mostly weavers and the like and not my fathers equal  mr scrimgour was not there himself but there was a small active body in his room as tossed the money for him fair enough though not so liberally as was expected being mostly hapence where pennies was looked for  such was not my fathers opinion and him and a few others only had a vote  he considered it was a waste of money giving to them that had no vote and so taking out of other folks mouths but the little man said it kept everybody in goodhumour and made mr scrimgour popular  he was an extraordinary affable man and very spirity running about to waste no time in walking and gave me a shilling saying to me to be a truthful boy and tell my father  he did not give james anything him being an orphan but clapped his head and said he was a fine boy  the captain was to vote for the bill if he got in the which he did it was the captain was to give the ale and porter in the square like a true gentleman  my father gave a kind of laugh when i let him see my shilling and said he would keep care of it for me and sorry i was i let him get it me never seeing the face of it again to this day  me and james was much annoyed with the women especially kitty davie always pushing in when there was tossing and tearing the very hapence out of our hands us not caring so much about the money but humiliated to see women mixing up in politics  by the time the topmost barrel was on the bonfire there was a great smell of whisky in the quarry it being a confined place  my father had been against the bonfire being in the quarry arguing that the wind on the hill would have carried off the smell of the whisky but peter tosh said they did not want the smell carried off it would be agreeable to the masons for weeks to come  except among the women there was no fighting nor wrangling at the quarry but all in fine spirits  i misremember now whether it was mr scrimgour or the captain that took the fancy to my fathers pigs but it was this day at any rate that the captain sent him the gamecock  whichever one it was that fancied the litter of pigs nothing would content him but to buy them which he did at thirty shillings each being the best bargain ever my father made  nevertheless im thinking he was windier of the cock  the captain who was a local man when not with his regiment had the grandest collection of fightingcocks in the county and sometimes came into the town to try them against the town cocks  i mind well the large wicker cage in which they were conveyed from place to place and never without the captain near at hand  my father had a cock that beat all the other town cocks at the cock fight at our school which was superintended by the elder of the kirk to see fair play but the which died of its wounds the next day but one  this was a great grief to my father it having been challenged to fight the captains cock therefore it was very considerate of the captain to make my father a present of his bird father in compliment to him changing its name from the deil to the captain  during the forenoon and i think until well on in the day james and me was busy with the pitcher and the flagon  the proceedings in the square however was not so well conducted as in the quarry many of the folk there assembled showing a mean and grasping spirit  the captain had given orders that there was to be no stint of ale and porter and neither there was but much of it lost through hastiness great barrels was hurled into the middle of the square where the country wives sat with their eggs and butter on marketday and was quickly stove in with an axe or pavingstone or whatever came handy sometimes they would break into the barrel at different points and then when they tilted it up to get the ale out at one hole it gushed out at the bottom till the square was flooded  my mother was fair disgusted when told by me and james of the waste of good liquor  it is gospel truth i speak when i say i mind well of seeing singer davie catching the porter in a pan as it ran down the sire and when the pan was full to overflowing putting his mouth to the stream and drinking till he was as full as the pan  most of the men however stuck to the barrels the drink running in the street being ale and porter mixed and left it to the women and the young folk to do the carrying  susy mqueen brought as many pans as she could collect on a barrow and was filling them all with porter rejecting the ale but indignation was aroused against her and as fast as she filled the others emptied  my father scorned to go to the square to drink ale and porter with the crowd having the election on his mind and him to vote  nevertheless he instructed me and james to keep up a brisk trade with the pans and run back across the gardens in case we met dishonest folk in the streets who might drink the ale  also said my father we was to let the excesses of our neighbours be a warning in sobriety to us enough being as good as a feast except when you can store it up for the winter  by and by my mother thought it was not safe me being in the streets with so many wild men about and would have sent james himself him being an orphan and hardier but this i did not like but running out did not come back for long enough  there is no doubt that the music was to blame for firing the mens blood and the result most disgraceful fighting with no object in view  there was three fiddlers and two at the flute most of them blind but not the less dangerous on that account and they kept the town in a ferment even playing the countryfolk home to the farms followed by bands of townsfolk  they were a quarrelsome set the ploughmen and others and it was generally admitted in the town that their overbearing behaviour was responsible for the fights  i mind them being driven out of the square stones flying thick also some standup fights with sticks and others fair enough with fists  the worst fight i did not see  it took place in a field  at first it was only between two who had been miscalling one another but there was many looking on and when the town man was like getting the worst of it the others set to and a most heathenish fray with no sense in it ensued  one man had his arm broken  i mind hobart the bellman going about ringing his bell and telling all persons to get within doors but little attention was paid to him it being notorious that snecky had had a fight earlier in the day himself  when james was fighting in the field according to his own account i had the honour of dining with the electors who voted for the captain him paying all expenses  it was a lucky accident my mother sending me to the townhouse where the dinner came off to try to get my father home at a decent hour me having a remarkable power over him when in liquor but at no other time  they were very jolly however and insisted on my drinking the captains health and eating more than was safe  my father got it next day from my mother for this and so would i myself but it was several days before i left my bed completely knocked up as i was with the excitement and one thing or another  the bonfire which was built to celebrate the election of mr scrimgour was set ablaze though i did not see it in honour of the election of the captain it being thought a pity to lose it as no doubt it would have been  that is about all i remember of the celebrated election of 32 when the reform bill was passed     chapter x  a very old family  they were a very old family with whom snecky hobart the bellman lodged  their favourite dissipation when their looms had come to rest was a dander through the kirkyard  they dressed for it the three young ones in their rusty black the patriarch in his old blue coat velvet kneebreeches and broad blue bonnet and often of an evening i have met them moving from grave to grave  by this time the old man was nearly ninety and the young ones averaged sixty  they read out the inscriptions on the tombstones in a solemn drone and their father added his reminiscences  he never failed them  since the beginning of the century he had not missed a funeral and his children felt that he was a great example  sire and sons returned from the cemetery invigorated for their dally labours  if one of them happened to start a dozen yards behind the others he never thought of making up the distance  if his foot struck against a stone he came to a deadstop when he discovered that he had stopped he set off again  a high wall shut off this old familys house and garden from the clatter of thrums a wall that gave snecky some trouble before he went to live within it  i speak from personal knowledge  one spring morning before the schoolhouse was built i was assisting the patriarch to divest the gaunt garden pump of its winter suit of straw i was taking a drink i remember my palm over the mouth of the wooden spout and my mouth at the gimlet hole above when a leg appeared above the corner of the wall against which the henhouse was built  two hands followed clutching desperately at the uneven stones  then the leg worked as if it were turning a grindstone and next moment snecky was sitting breathlessly on the dyke  from this to the henhouse whose roof was of divets the descent was comparatively easy and a slanting board allowed the daring bellman to slide thence to the ground  he had come on business and having talked it over slowly with the old man he turned to depart  though he was a genteel man i heard him sigh heavily as with the remark ay weel ill be movin again he began to rescale the wall  the patriarch twisted round the pump made no reply so i ventured to suggest to the bellman that he might find the gate easier  is there a gate said snecky in surprise at the resources of civilization  i pointed it out to him and he went his way chuckling  the old man told me that he had sometimes wondered at sneckys mode of approach but it had not struck him to say anything  afterwards when the bellman took up his abode there they discussed the matter heavily  hobart inherited both his bell and his nickname from his father who was not a native of thrums  he came from some distant part where the people speak of snecking the door meaning shut it  in thrums the word used is steek and sneck seemed to the inhabitants so droll and ridiculous that hobart got the name of snecky  his son left thrums at the age of ten for the distant farm of tirl and did not return until the old bellmans death twenty years afterwards but the first remark he overheard on entering the kirkwynd was a conjecture flung across the street by a greyhaired crone that he would be little snecky come to bury auld snecky  the father had a reputation in his day for crying crimes he was suspected of having committed himself but the snecky i knew had too high a sense of his own importance for that  on great occasions such as the loss of little davy dundas or when a tattie roup had to be cried he was even offensively inflated but ordinary announcements such as the approach of a flying stationer the roup of a deceased weavers loom or the arrival in thrums of a cartload of fine kebec cheeses he treated as the merest trifles  i see still the bent legs of the snuffy old man straightening to the tinkle of his bell and the smirk with which he let the curious populace gather round him  in one hand he ostentatiously displayed the paper on which what he had to cry was written but like the minister he scorned to read  with the bell carefully tucked under his oxter he gave forth his news in a rasping voice that broke now and again into a squeal  though scotch in his unofficial conversation he was believed to deliver himself on public occasions in the finest english  when trotting from place to place with his news he carried his bell by the tongue as cautiously as if it were a flagon of milk  snecky never allowed himself to degenerate into a mere machine  his proclamations were provided by those who employed him but his soul was his own  having cried a potato roup he would sometimes add a word of warning such as i wudna advise ye lads to hae onything to do wi thae tatties theyre diseased  once just before the cattle market he was sent round by a local laird to announce that any drover found taking the short cut to the hill through the grounds of muckle plowy would be prosecuted to the utmost limits of the law  the people were aghast  hoots lads snecky said dinna fash yoursels  its juist a haver o the grieves  one of hobarts ways of striking terror into evildoers was to announce when crying a crime that he himself knew perfectly well who the culprit was  i see him brawly he would say standing afore me an if he disna instantly mak retribution i am determined this very day to mak a public example of him  before the time of the burke and hare murders sneckys father was sent round thrums to proclaim the startling news that a grave in the kirkyard had been tampered with  the resurrectionist scare was at its height then and the patriarch who was one of the men in thrums paid to watch new graves in the nighttime has often told the story the town was in a ferment as the news spread and there were fierce suspicious men among hobarts hearers who already had the rifler of graves in their eye  he was a man who worked for the farmers when they required an extra hand and loafed about the square when they could do without him  no one had a good word for him and lately he had been flush of money that was sufficient  there was a rush of angry men through the pend that led to his habitation and he was dragged panting and terrified to the kirkyard before he understood what it all meant  to the grave they hurried him and almost without a word handed him a spade  the whole town gathered round the spota sullen crowd the women only breaking the silence with their sobs and te children clinging to their gowns  the suspected resurrectionist understood what was wanted of him and flinging off his jacket began to reopen the grave presently the spade struck upon wood and by and by part of the coffin came in view  that was nothing for the resurrectionists had a way of breaking the coffin at one end and drawing out the body with tongs the digger knew this  he broke the boards with the spade and revealed an arm  the people convinced he dropped the arm savagely leapt out of the grave and went his way leaving them to shovel back the earth themselves  there was humour in the old family as well as in their lodger  i found this out slowly  they used to gather round their peat fire in the evening after the poultry had gone to sleep on the kitchen rafters and take off their neighbours  none of them ever laughed but their neighbours did afford them subject for gossip and the old man was very sarcastic over other peoples oldfashioned ways  when one of the family wanted to go out he did it gradually  he would be sitting into the fire browning his corduroy trousers and he would get up slowly  then he gazed solemnly before him for a time and after that if you watched him narrowly you would see that he was really moving to the door  another member of the family took the vacant seat with the same precautions  willum the eldest has a gun which customarily stands behind the old eightday clock and he takes it with him to the garden to shoot the blackbirds  long before willum is ready to let fly the blackbirds have gone away and so the gun is never never fired but there is a determined look on willums face when he returns from the garden  in the stormy days of his youth the old man had been a black nib the black nibs were the persons who agitated against the french war and the public feeling against them ran strong and deep  in thrums the local black nibs were burned in effigy and whenever they put their heads out of doors they risked being stoned  even where the authorities were unprejudiced they were helpless to interfere and as a rule they were as bitter against the black nibs as the populace themselves  once the patriarch was running through the street with a score of the enemy at his heels and the bailie opening his window shouted to them stane the black nib oot o the toon  when the patriarch was a young man he was a follower of pleasure  this is the one thing about him that his family have never been able to understand  a solemn stroll through the kirkyard was not sufficient relaxation in those riotous times after a hard day at the loom and he rarely lost a chance of going to see a man hanged  there was a good deal of hanging in those days and yet the authorities had an ugly way of reprieving condemned men on whom the sightseers had been counting an air of gloom would gather on my old friends countenance when he told how he and his contemporaries in thrums trudged every saturday for six weeks to the county town many miles distant to witness the execution of some criminal in whom they had a local interest and who after disappointing them again and again was said to have been bought off by a friend  his crime had been stolen entrance into a house in thrums by the chimney with intent to rob and though this oldfashioned family did not see it not the least noticeable incident in the scrimmage that followed was the prudence of the canny housewife when she saw the legs coming down the lum she rushed to the kailpot which was on the fire and put on the lid  she confessed that this was not done to prevent the visitors scalding himself but to save the broth  the old man was repeated in his three sons  they told his stories precisely as he did himself taking as long in the telling and making the points in exactly the same way  by and by they will come to think that they themselves were of those past times  already the young ones look like contemporaries of their father     chapter xi  little rathies bural  devoutunderdifficulties would have been the name of lang tammas had he been of covenanting times  so i thought one wintry afternoon years before i went to the schoolhouse when he dropped in to ask the pleasure of my company to the farmer of little rathies bural  as a good auld licht tammas reserved his swallowtail coat and lum hat chimney pot for the kirk and funerals but the coat would have flapped villainously to tammass eternal ignominy had he for one rash moment relaxed his hold on the bottom button and it was only by walking sideways as horses sometimes try to do that the hat could be kept at the angle of decorum  let it not be thought that tammas had asked me to little rathies funeral on his own responsibility  burals were among the few events to break the monotony of an auld licht winter and invitations were as much sought after as cards to my ladys dances in the south  this had been a fair average season for tammas though of his four burials one had been a bairnsa mere bagatelle but had it not been for the death of little rathie i would probably not have been out that year at all  the small farm of little rathie lies two miles from thrums and tammas and i trudged manfully through the snow adding to our numbers as we went  the dress of none differed materially from the precentors and the general effect was of septuagenarians in each others best clothes though living in lowroofed houses had bent most of them before their time  by a rearrangement of garments such as making tammas change coat hat and trousers with cragiebuckle silva mcqueen and saml wilkie respectively a dexterous tailor might perhaps have supplied each with a fit  the talk was chiefly of little rathie and sometimes threatened to become animated when another mourner would fall in and restore the more fitting gloom  ay ay the new comer would say by way of responding to the sober salutation ay johnny  then there was silence but for the gluck with which we lifted our feet from the slush  so little rathies been taen awa johnny would venture to say by and by  hes gone johnny ay man he is so  death must come to all some one would waken up to murmur  ay lang tammas would reply putting on the copingstone in the morning we are strong and in the evening we are cut down  we are so tammas ou ay we are so were here the wan day an gone the neist  little rathie wasna a crittur i took till no i canna say he was said bowie haggart so called because his legs described a parabola but he maks a very creeditable corp corpse  i will say that for him  its wonderfu hoo death improves a body  ye cudna hae said as little rathie was a weelfaured man when he was i the flesh  bowie was the wright and attended burials in his official capacity he had the gift of words to an uncommon degree and i do not forget his crushing blow at the reputation of the poet burns as delivered under the auspices of the thrums literary society  i am of opeenion said bowie that the works of burns is of an immoral tendency  i have not read them myself but such is my opeenion  he was a queer stock little rathie michty queer said tammas haggart bowies brother who was a queer stock himself but was not aware of it but ou im thinkin the wife had something to do wit she was ill to manage an little rathie hadna the way o the women he hadna the knack o managin them s ye micht sayno little rathie hadna the knack  theyre kittle cattle the women said the farmer of craigiebuckleson of the craigiebuckle mentioned elsewherea little gloomily  ive often thocht maiterimony is no onlike the lucky bags th auld wines has at the muckly  theres prizes an blanks baith inside but losh yere far frae sure what yell draw oot when ye put in yer han  ou weel said tammas complacently theres truth in what ye say but the women can be managed if we have the knack  some o them said cragiebuckle woefully  ye had yer wark wi the wife yersel tammas so ye had observed lang tammas unbending to suit his company  yere speakin aboot the bit wifes bural said tammas haggart with a chuckle ay ay that brocht her to reason  without much pressure haggart retold a story known to the majority of his hearers  he had not the knack of managing women apparently when he married for he and his gipsy wife agreed ill thegither at first once chirsty left him and took up her abode in a house just across the wynd  instead of routing her out tammas without taking any one into his confidence determined to treat chirsty as dead and celebrate her decease in a lyke wakea last wake  these wakes were very general in thrums in the old days though they had ceased to be common by the date of little rathies death  for three days before the burial the friends and neighbours of the mourners were invited into the house to partake of food and drink by the side of the corpse  the dead lay on chairs covered with a white sheet  dirges were sung and the deceased was extolled but when night came the lights were extinguished and the corpse was left alone  on the morning of the funeral tables were spread with a white cloth outside the house and food and drink were placed upon them  no neighbour could pass the tables without paying his respects to the dead and even when the house was in a busy narrow thoroughfare this part of the ceremony was never omitted  tammas did not give chirsty a wake inside the house but one friday morningit was marketday and the square was consequently fullit went through the town that the tables were spread before his door  young and old collected wandering round the house and tammas stood at the tables in his blacks inviting every one to eat and drink  he was pressed to tell what it meant but nothing could be got from him except that his wife was dead  at times he pressed his hands to his heart and then he would make wry faces trying hard to cry  chirsty watched from a window across the street until she perhaps began to fear that she really was dead  unable to stand it any longer she rushed out into her husbands arms and shortly afterwards she could have been seen dismantling the tables  shes gone this fower year tammas said when he had finished his story but up to the end i had no more trouble wi chirsty  no i had the knack o her  ive heard tell though said the sceptical craigiebuckle as chirsty only cam back to ye because she cudna bear to see the fowk makkin sae free wi the whisky  i mind hoo she bottled it up at ance and drove the laddies awa said bowie an i hae seen her after that tammas giein ye up yer fut an you no sayin a word  ou ay said the wifetamer in the tone of a man who could afford to be generous in trifles women maun talk an a man hasna aye time to conterdick them but frae that day i had the knack o chirsty  donal elshioners was a very seemilar case broke in snecky hobart shrilly  maist o yell mind at donal was michty plaguet wi a drucken wife  ay weel wan day bowies man was carryin a coffin past donals door and donal an the wife was there  says donal put doon yer coffin my man an tells wha its for  the laddie rests the coffin on its end an says he its for davie fairbrothers guidwife  ay then says donal tak it awa tak it awa to davie an tell im as ye kin a man wi a wife at wid be glad to neifer exchange wi him  man that terrified donals wife it did so  as we delved up the twisting road between two fields that leads to the farm of little rathie the talk became less general and another mourner who joined us there was told that the farmer was gone  we must all fade as a leaf said lang tammas  so we maun so we maun admitted the newcomer  they say he added solemnly as little rathie has left a full teapot  the reference was to the safe in which the old people in the district stored their gains  he was thrifty said tammas haggart an shrewd too was little rathie  i mind mr dishart admonishin him for no attendin a special weather service i the kirk when finny an lintool the twa adjoinin farmers baith attendit  ou says little rathie i thocht to mysel thinks i if they get rain for prayin fort on finny an lintool were bound to get the benefit ot on little rathie  tod said snecky theres some sense in that an what says the minister  i dna kin what he said admitted haggart but he took little rathie up to the manse an if ever i saw a man lookin sma it was little rathie when he cam oot  the deceased had left behind him a daughter herself now known as little rathie quite capable of attending to the ramshackle but and ben and i remember how she nipped off tammass consolations to go out and feed the hens  to the number of about twenty we assembled round the end of the house to escape the bitter wind and here i lost the precentor who as an auld licht elder joined the chief mourners inside  the post of distinction at a funeral is near the coffin but it is not given to every one to be a relative of the deceased and there is always much competition and genteelly concealed disappointment over the few open vacancies  the window of the room was decently veiled but the mourners outside knew what was happening within and that it was not all prayer neither mourning  a few of the more reverent uncovered their heads at intervals but it would be idle to deny that there was a feeling that little rathies daughter was favouring tammas and others somewhat invidiously  indeed robbie gibruth did not scruple to remark that she had made an inauspeecious beginning  tammas haggart who was melancholy when not sarcastic though he brightened up wonderfully at funerals reminded robbie that disappointment is the lot of man on his earthly pilgrimage but haggart knew who were to be invited back after the burial to the farm and was inclined to make much of his position  the secret would doubtless have been wormed from him had not public attention been directed into another channel  a prayer was certainly being offered up inside but the voice was not the voice of the minister  lang tammas told me afterwards that it had seemed at one time very questionable whether little rathie would be buried that day at all the incomprehensible absence of mr dishart afterwards satisfactorily explained had raised the unexpected question of the legality of a burial in a case where the minister had not prayed over the corp there had even been an indulgence in hot words and the reverend alexander kewans a stickit minister but not of the auld licht persuasion had withdrawn in dudgeon on hearing tammas asked to conduct the ceremony instead of himself  but great as tammas was on religious questions a pillar of the auld licht kirk the shorter catechism at his fingerends a sad want of words at the very time when he needed them most incapacitated him for prayer in public and it was providential that bowie proved himself a man of parts  but tammas tells me that the wright grossly abused his position by praying at such length that craigiebuckle fell asleep and the mistress had to rise and hang the pot on the fire higher up the joist lest its contents should burn before the return from the funeral  loury grew the sky and more and more anxious the face of little rathies daughter and still bowie prayed on  had it not been for the impatience of the precentor and the grumbling of the mourners outside there is no saying when the remains would have been lifted through the bole or little window  hearses had hardly come in at this time and the coffin was carried by the mourners on long stakes  the straggling procession of pedestrians behind wound its slow way in the waning light to the kirkyard showing startlingly black against the dazzling snow and it was not until the earth rattled on the coffinlid that little rathies nearest male relative seemed to remember his last mournful duty to the dead sidling up to the favoured mourners he remarked casually and in the most emotionless tone he could assume theyre expecin ye to stap doon the length o little rathie noo  aye aye hes gone  na na nae refoosal daavit ye was aye a guid friend till him an its onything a body can do for him noo  though the uninvited slunk away sorrowfully the entertainment provided at auld licht houses of mourning was characteristic of a stern and sober sect  they got to eat and to drink to the extent as a rule of a lippy of shortbread and a brew of toddy but open bibles lay on the table and the eyes of each were on his neighbours to catch them transgressing and offer up a prayer for them on the spot  ay me there is no bowie nowadays to fill an absent ministers shoes     chapter xii  a literary club  the ministers in the town did not hold with literature  when the most notorious of the clubs met in the townhouse under the presidentship of gavin ogilvy who was no better than a poacher and was troubled in his mind because writers called pope a poet there was frequently a wrangle over the question is literature necessarily immoral  it was a fighting club and on friday nights the few respectable godfearing members dandered to the townhouse as if merely curious to have another look at the building  if lang tammas who was dead against letters was in sight they wandered off but when there were no spies abroad they slunk up the stair  the attendance was greatest on dark nights though gavin himself and some other characters would have marched straight to the meeting in broad daylight  tammas haggart who did not think much of miltons devil had married a gypsy woman for an experiment and the coat of many colours did not know where his wife was  as a rule however the members were wild bachelors  when they married they had to settle down  gavins essay on willum pitt the father of the taxes led to the clubs being bundled out of the townhouse where people said it should never have been allowed to meet  there was a terrible town when tammas haggart then disclosed the secret of mr byarss supposed approval of the club  mr byars was the auld licht minister whom mr dishart succeeded and it was well known that he had advised the authorities to grant the use of the little townhouse to the club on friday evenings as he solemnly warned his congregation against attending the meetings the position he had taken up created talk and lang tammas called at the manse with sanders whamond to remonstrate  the minister however harangued them on their sinfulness in daring to question the like of him and they had to retire vanquished though dissatisfied  then came the disclosures of tammas haggart who was never properly secured by the auld lichts until mr dishart took him in hand  it was tammas who wrote anonymous letters to mr byars about the scarlet woman and strange to say this led to the clubs being allowed to meet in the townhouse  the minister after many days discovered who his correspondent was and succeeded in inveigling the stonebreaker to the manse  there with the door snibbed he opened out on tammas who after his usual manner when hard pressed pretended to be deaf  this sudden fit of deafness so exasperated the minister that he flung a book at tammas  the scene that followed was one that few auld licht manses can have witnessed  according to tammas the book had hardly reached the floor when the minister turned white  tammas picked up the missile  it was a bible  the two men looked at each other  beneath the window mr byarss children were prattling  his wife was moving about in the next room little thinking what had happened  the minister held out his hand for the bible but tammas shook his head and then mr byars shrank into a chair  finally it was arranged that if tammas kept the affair to himself the minister would say a good word to the bailie about the literary club  after that the stonebreaker used to go from house to house twisting his mouth to the side and remarking that he could tell such a tale of mr byars as would lead to a split in the kirk  when the townhouse was locked on the club tammas spoke out but though the scandal ran from door to door as i have seen a pig in a fluster do the minister did not lose his place  tammas preserved the bible and showed it complacently to visitors as the present he got from mr byars  the minister knew this and it turned his temper sour  tammass proud moments after that were when he passed the minister  driven from the townhouse literature found a table with forms round it in a tavern hard by where the club lopped of its most respectable members kept the blinds down and talked openly of shakspeare  it was a lowroofed room with pieces of lime hanging from the ceiling and peeling walls  the floor had a slope that tended to fling the debater forward and its boards lying loose on an uneven foundation rose and looked at you as you crossed the room  in winter when the meetings were held regularly every fortnight a fire of peat sod and dross lit up the curious company who sat round the table shaking their heads over shelleys mysticism or requiring to be called to order because they would not wait their turn to deny an essayists assertion that berkeleys style was superior to david humes  davit hume they said and watty scott  burns was simply referred to as rob or robbie  there was little drinking at these meetings for the members knew what they were talking about and your mind had to gallop to keep up with the flow of reasoning  thrums is rather a remarkable town  there are scores and scores of houses in it that have sent their sons to college by what a struggle some to make their way to the front in their professions and others perhaps despite their broadcloth never to be a patch on their parents  in that literary club there were men of a reading so wide and catholic that it might put some graduates of the universities to shame and of an intellect so keen that had it not had a crook in it their fame would have crossed the county  most of them had but a threadbare existence for you weave slowly with a wordsworth open before you and some were strange bohemians which does not do in thrums yet others wandered into the world and compelled it to recognize them  there is a london barrister whose father belonged to the club  not many years ago a man died on the staff of the times who when he was a weaver near thrums was one of the clubs prominent members  he taught himself shorthand by the light of a cruizey and got a post on a perth paper afterwards on the scotsman and the witness and finally on the times  several other men of his type had a history worth reading but it is not for me to write  yet i may say that there is still at least one of the original members of the club left behind in thrums to whom some of the literary dandies might lift their hats  gavin ogilvy i only knew as a weaver and a poacher a lank longarmed man much bent from crouching in ditches whence he watched his snares to the young he was a romantic figure because they saw him frequently in the fields with his callbirds tempting siskins yellow yites and linties to twigs which he had previously smeared with lime  he made the lime from the tough roots of holly sometimes from linseed oil which is boiled until thick when it is taken out of the pot and drawn and stretched with the hands like elastic  gavin was also a famous haresnarer at a time when the ploughman looked upon this form of poaching as his perquisite  the snare was of wire so constructed that the hare entangled itself the more when trying to escape and it was placed across the little roads through the fields to which hares confine themselves with a heavy stone attached to it by a string once gavin caught a toad fox instead of a hare and did not discover his mistake until it had him by the teeth  he was not able to weave for two months  the grousenetting was more lucrative and more exciting and women engaged in it with their husbands  it is told of gavin that he was on one occasion chased by a gamekeeper over moor and hill for twenty miles and that by and by when the one sank down exhausted so did the other  they would sit fifty yards apart glaring at each other  the poacher eventually escaped  this curious as it may seem is the man whose eloquence at the club has not been forgotten in fifty years  thus did he stand i have been told recently exclaiming in language sublime that the soul shall bloom in immortal youth through the ruin and wrack of time  another member read to the club an account of his journey to lochnagar which was afterwards published in chamberss journal  he was celebrated for his descriptions of scenery and was not the only member of the club whose essays got into print  more memorable perhaps was an itinerant matchseller known to thrums and the surrounding towns as the literary spunkseller  he was a wizened shivering old man often barefooted wearing at the best a thin ragged coat that had been black but was greenbrown with age and he made his spunks as well as sold them  he brought bacon and adam smith into thrums and he loved to recite long screeds from spenser with a running commentary on the versification and the luxuriance of the diction  of jamies death i do not care to write  he went without many a dinner in order to buy a book  the coat of many colours and silva robbie were two street preachers who gave the thrums ministers some work  they occasionally appeared at the club  the coat of many colours was so called because he wore a garment consisting of patches of cloth of various colours sewed together  it hung down to his heels  he may have been cracked rather than inspired but he was a power in the square where he preached the women declaring that he was gifted by god  an awe filled even the men when he admonished them for using strong language for at such a time he would remind them of the woe which fell upon tibbie mason  tibbie had been notorious in her day for evilspeaking especially for her free use of the word handless which she flung a hundred times in a week at her man and even at her old mother  her punishment was to have a son born without hands  the coat of many colours also told of the liar who exclaimed if this is not gospel true may i stand here for ever and who is standing on that spot still only nobody knows where it is george wishart was the coats hero and often he has told in the square how wishart saved dundee  it was the time when the plague lay over scotland and in dundee they saw it approaching from the west in the form of a great black cloud  they fell on their knees and prayed crying to the cloud to pass them by and while they prayed it came nearer  then they looked around for the most holy man among them to intervene with god on their behalf  all eyes turned to george wishart and he stood up stretching his arms to the cloud and prayed and it rolled back  thus dundee was saved from the plague but when wishart ended his prayer he was alone for the people had all returned to their homes  less of a genuine man than the coat of many colours was silva robbie who had horrid fits of laughing in the middle of his prayers and even fell in a paroxysm of laughter from the chair on which he stood  in the club he said things not to be borne though logical up to a certain point  tammas haggart was the most sarcastic member of the club being celebrated for his sarcasm far and wide  it was a remarkable thing about him often spoken of that if you went to tammas with a stranger and asked him to say a sarcastic thing that the man might take away as a specimen he could not do it  na na tammas would say after a few trials referring to sarcasm shes no a critter to force  ye maun lat her tak her ain time  sometimes shes dry like the pump an syne again oot she comes in a gush  the most sarcastic thing the stonebreaker ever said was frequently marvelled over in thrums both before and behind his face but unfortunately no one could ever remember what it was  the subject however was cha tamsons potato pit  there is little doubt that it was a fit of sarcasm that induced tammas to marry a gypsy lassie  mr byars would not join them so tammas had himself married by jimmy pawse the gay little gypsy king and after that the minister remarried them  the marriage over the tongs is a thing to scandalise any wellbroughtup person for before he joined the couples hands jimmy jumped about in a startling way uttering wild gibberish and after the ceremony was over there was rough work with incantations and blowing on pipes  tammas always held that this marriage turned out better than he had expected though he had his trials like other married men  among them was chirstys way of climbing on to the dresser to get at the higher part of the platerack one evening i called in to have a smoke with the stonebreaker and while we were talking chirsty climbed the dresser  the next moment she was on the floor on her back wailing but tammas smoked on imperturbably  do you not see what has happened man i cried ou said tammas shes aye fain aff the dresser  of the schoolmasters who were at times members of the club mr dickie was the ripest scholar but my predecessor at the schoolhouse had a way of sneering at him that was as good as sarcasm  when they were on their legs at the same time asking each other passionately to be calm and rolling out lines from homer that made the innkeeper look fearfully to the fastenings of the door their heads very nearly came together although the table was between them  the old dominie had an advantage in being the shorter man for he could hammer on the table as he spoke while gaunt mr dickie had to stoop to it  mr mcritties arguments were a series of nails that he knocked into the table and he did it in a workmanlike manner  mr dickie though he kept firm on his feet swayed his body until by and by his head was rotating in a large circle  the mathematical figure he made was a cone revolving on its apex  gavins reinstalment in the chair year after year was made by the disappointed dominie the subject of some tart verses which he called an epode but gavin crushed him when they were read before the club  satire he said is a legitimate weapon used with michty effect by swift sammy butler and others and i dount object to being made the subject of creeticism  it has often been called a tnife knife but them as is not used to tnives cuts their hands and yell a observe that mr mcritties fingers is bleedin  all eyes were turned upon the dominies hand and though he pocketed it smartly several members had seen the blood  the dominie was a rare visitor at the club after that though he outlived poor mr dickie by many years mr dickie was a teacher in tilliedrum but he was ruined by drink  he wandered from town to town reciting greek and latin poetry to any one who would give him a dram and sometimes he wept and moaned aloud in the street crying poor mr dickie poor mr dickie  the leading poet in a club of poets was dite walls who kept a school when there were scholars and weaved when there were none  he had a song that was published in a halfpenny leaflet about the famous lawsuit instituted by the farmer of teuchbusses against the laird of drumlee  the laird was alleged to have taken from the land of teuchbusses sufficient broom to make a besom thereof and i am not certain that the case is settled to this day  it was dite or another member of the club who wrote the wife o deeside of all the songs of the period the one that had the greatest vogue in the county at a time when lord jeffrey was cursed at every fireside in thrums  the wife of deeside was tried for the murder of her servant who had infatuated the young laird and had it not been that jeffrey defended her she would in the words of the song have hung like a troot  it is not easy now to conceive the rage against jeffrey when the woman was acquitted  the song was sung and recited in the streets at the smiddy in bothies and by firesides to the shaking of fists and the grinding of teeth  it began    yell a hae hear tell o the wife o deeside   yell a hae hear tell o the wife o deeside   she poisoned her maid for to keep up her pride   yell a hae hear tell o the wife o deeside   before the excitement had abated jeffrey was in tilliedrum for electioneering purposes and he was mobbed in the streets  angry crowds pressed close to howl wife o deeside at him  a contingent from thrums was there and it was long afterwards told of saml todd by himself that he hit jeffrey on the back of the head with a clod of earth  johnny mcquhatty a brother of the tnowhead farmer was the one taciturn member of the club and you had only to look at him to know that he had a secret  he was a great genius at the handloom and invented a loom for the weaving of linen such as has not been seen before or since  in the daytime he kept guard over his shop into which no one was allowed to enter and the fame of his loom was so great that he had to watch over it with a gun  at night he weaved and when the result at last pleased him he made the linen into shirts all of which he stitched together with his own hands even to the buttonholes  he sent one shirt to the queen and another to the duchess of athole mentioning a very large price for them which he got  then he destroyed his wonderful loom and how it was made no one will ever know  johnny only took to literature after he had made his name and he seldom spoke at the club except when ghosts and the like were the subject of debate as they tended to be when the farmer of muckle haws could get in a word  muckle haws was fascinated by johnnys sneers at superstition and sometimes on dark nights the inventor had to make his courage good by seeing the farmer past the doulie yates ghost gates which muckle haws had to go perilously near on his way home  johnny was a small man but it was the burly farmer who shook at sight of the gates standing out white in the night  white gates have an evil name still and muckle haws was full of horrors as he drew near them clinging to johnnys arm  it was on such a night he would remember that he saw the white lady go through the gates greeting sorely with a dead bairn in her arms while water kelpies laughed and splashed in the pools and the witches danced in a ring round broken buss  that very night twelve months ago the packman was murdered at broken buss and easie pettie hanged herself on the stump of a tree  last night there were ugly sounds from the quarry of croup where the bairn lies buried and its not mous canny to be out at such a time  the farmer had seen spectre maidens walking round the ruined castle of darg and the castle all lit up with flaring torches and dead knights and ladies sitting in the halls at the winecup and the devil himself flapping his wings on the ramparts  when the debates were political two members with the gift of song fired the blood with their own poems about taxation and the depopulation of the highlands and by selling these songs from door to door they made their livelihood  books and pamphlets were brought into the town by the flying stationers as they were called who visited the square periodically carrying their wares on their backs except at the muckly when they had their stall and even sold books by auction  the flying stationer best known to thrums was sandersy riach who was stricken from head to foot with the palsy and could only speak with a quaver in consequence sandersy brought to the members of the club all the great books he could get second hand but his stockintrade was thrummy cap and akenstaff the fishwives of buckhaven the devil upon two sticks gilderoy sir james the rose the brownie of badenoch the ghaist of firenden and the like  it was from sandersy that tammas haggart bought his copy of shakspeare whom mr dishart could never abide tammas kept what he had done from his wife but chirsty saw a deterioration setting in and told the minister of her suspicions  mr dishart was newly placed at the time and very vigorous and the way he shook the truth out of tammas was grand  the minister pulled tammas the one way and gavin pulled him the other but mr dishart was not the man to be beaten and he landed tammas in the auld licht kirk before the year was out  chirsty buried shakspeare in the yard
