grip a little so that we hoped for spring winter had once more closed down on the broad canadian prairie and the lonely outpost was swept by icy draughts when one bitter night sergeant mackay laying down his pipe thrust fresh billets into the crackling stove it already glowed with a dull redness and the light that beat out through its opened front glinted upon the carbines belts and stirrups hung about the rough log walls  tis for the rebuking of evildoers an the keeping of the peace were sent here to patrol the wilderness an if were frozen stiff in the saddle tis no more than our duty said the sergeant while his eyes twinkled whimsically but a man with lands an cattle shows a distressful want o judgment by sleeping in a snow bank when he might be sitting snug in a club at montreal tis a matter o wonder to me that ye are whiles so deficient in common sense rancher ormesby still im no denying ye showed a little when ye brought that whisky tis allowable to interpret the regulations with discretion in bitter weatheran heres a safe ride to ye  a brighter beam that shot out called up the speakers rugged face and gaunt figure from the shadows although his lean hard fingers closed somewhat affectionately on a flask instead of on the bridle or carbine they were used to his profession was stamped on him for allan mackay was as fine a sample of noncommissioned cavalry officer as ever patrolled the desolate marches of western canadawhich implies a good deal to those who know the northwest troopers he was also as i knew a man acquainted with sorrow who united the shrewdness of solomon with a childish simplicity and hid beneath his grim exterior a vein of eccentric chivalry which on occasion led him into trouble the blaze further touched the face of a young english lad sitting in a corner of the room  some of us were sent here for our sins and some came for our health when the temperature of our birthplaces grew a trifle high he said i dont know that anybody except rancher ormesby ever rode with us for pleasure yet im open to admit the life has its compensations and sergeant mackay has given me many as good a run as i ever had withthat is i mean any man who must earn his bread might well find work he would take less kindly to  the lads momentary embarrassment was not lost on his officer who chuckled somewhat dryly as he glanced at him im asking no questions an ye are not called on to testify against yourself he said maybe ye rode foxhunting on a hundredguinea horse an maybe ye did not but ye showed a bit knowledge o a beast an that was enough for me meantime yere trooper cotton an ill see ye do your duty to some the old countrygod bless heris a hard stepmother an yere no the first she has turned the cold shoulder on and sent out to me  the worthy sergeant was apt to grow tiresome when he launched out into his reminiscences and seeing that trooper cotton did not appreciate the turn the conversation was taking i broke in but youre forgetting the outlaw mackay and im not here for either health or pleasure i want to recover the mare i gave five hundred dollars for and that ought to excuse my company what has the fellow who borrowed her done  fired on a mortgage moneylender down in assiniboia was the answer maybe he was badly treated for yell mind that the man who takes blood money as yon lane has done is first cousin to judas iscariot but thats no my business it is not allowable to shoot ones creditors in the canadian dominion what im wondering is where he is now an that will be either striking north for the barrens or west for british columbia it will be boot and saddle when pete comes in and meantime well consider what routes would best fit him  mackay knew every bluff and ravine seaming a hundred miles of prairie and another silent man rising from his bunk stood beside myself and cotton as the sergeant traced lines across the table each represented an alternative route the fugitive might take and the places where the hard forefinger paused marked a risky ford or lake on which the ice was yielding mackay spent some time over it as much for his own edification as for ours but i was interested for i greatly desired to recover the blood mare stolen from me  i was then fiveandtwenty fairly stalwart and tall of stature and seldom regretted that after a good education in england i had gone out to western canada to assist a relative in raising cattle the old man was slow and cautious but he taught me my business well before he died suddenly and left me his possessions adding my small patrimony i made larger profits by taking heavier risks and for fortune had favored me and youth is no handicap in the colonies my homestead was one of the finest in that section of the country save for occasional risks of frostbite and wild rides through blinding snow the life had been toilsome rather than eventful but the day which while we talked in the outpost was speeding westward across the pines of quebec and the lakes of ontario to gild the rockies peaks was to mark a turningpoint in my history  suddenly a beat of hoofs rose out of the night there was a jingle outside and the cold set me shivering when a man who held a smoking horses bridle stood by the open door your man tried to buy a horse from the reservation crees and when they wouldnt trade doubled on his tracks heading west for the bitter lakes ive nearly killed my beast to bring you word he said  horses stood ready in the sod stable behind the dwelling and in less than three minutes we were in the saddle and flitting in single file across the prairie it was about five oclock in the morning and though winter should have been over it was very bitter the steam from the horses hung about us our breath froze on our furs but a chinook wind had swept the prairie clear of snow and though in the barer places the ground rang like iron beneath us the carpet of matted grasses made moderately fast traveling possible no word was spoken and when the silent figures about me faded as they spread out to left and right and only a faint jingle of steel or dull thud of hoofs betokened their presence i seemed to have ridden out of all touch with warmth and life  the frost bit keen the heavens were black with the presage of coming storm and the utter silence seemed the hush of death beast and bird had long fled south and i started when once the ghostly howl of a coyote rose eerily and faintly from the rim of the prairie  by daylight we had left long leagues behind us and i was the better pleased that the fugitives trail of which we found signs led back towards my own homestead for a brief five minutes the rockies seen very far off across the levels flushed crimson against the sky then the line of spectral peaks faded suddenly and we were left four tiny crawling specks in the center of a limitless gray circle whose circumference receded steadily as the hours went by but the trail grew plainer to the sergeants practiced eyes and when we had crossed the bitter lakes on rotten and but partially refrozen ice he predicted that we should come up with the fugitive by nightfall if our horses held out mine was the best in the party and though not equal to the stolen mare the latter had already traveled fast and far it was a depressing journey no ray of sunlight touched the widespread levels and there was neither smoke trail nor sign of human life in all that great desolation hands and feet lost sense of feeling the cold numbed ones very brain but the wardens of the prairie used alike to sleep in a snow trench or swim an icy ford care little for adverse weather and mackay held on with a slow tenacity that boded ill for the man he was pursuing  the light showed signs of failing when trooper cotton shouted and we caught sight of our quarry a shadowy blur on the crest of a low rise that seamed the prairie ye may save your breath for yell need it said mackay its a league from yon rise to the sweetwater an theres neither icebridge nor safe ford now if hes across before we are well no grip him the night im thinkingand theres ill weather brewing  whip and heel were plied and the wornout beasts responded as best they might the man who had taught me stock and horse breeding knew his business and when my beast raced across the edge of the rise the troopers were at least two hundred yards behind then the exultation of the chase took hold of me and my frozen blood commenced to stir as the staunch beast beneath me swept faster and faster down the long gray incline at every stride i was coming up with the horse thief a dusky ridge of birches loomed ahead shutting off the steep dip to the river beyond this there were thicker trees and the light was failing but while all this promised safety for the pursued i was gaining fast and the troopers were dropping further behind the fugitive had just reached the timber when a light wagon lurched out from it and i yelled to the man who drove it to hold clear of my path there was a hoarse shout away to the left and when no answer came back the crack of a carbine a repeating rifle banged against my back and feeling that its sling lay within easy reach i drove my heels home as i raced past the wagon  there was scarcely time for a side glance but the one i risked set my heart beating two feminine figures wrapped in furs sat within it and one smiled at me as i passed the face that looked out from beneath the fur cap was worth remembering though it was several years since i had last seen it in england haldane had brought his daughters with him when he came out from montreal to visit his western possessions it seemed but my horse was over the brink of the declivity before i could return the greeting and bending low to clear the branches i drove him reeling and blundering down and down through willow undergrowth and scattered birches on the track of the fugitive i was but a plain rancher and it seemed presumptuous folly to neglect my lawful business for a smile from beatrice haldane  it was growing dark among the birches and flakes of feathery snow sliding down between the branches filled my eyes but i could see that the distance between us was shortening more rapidly and that the man in front of me reeled in his saddle when a branch smote him the mare also stumbled and i gained several lengths the drumming of hoofs and the moan of an icy wind which had sprung up seemed to fill all the hollow white mist that slid athwart the birches hung over the sweetwater in the rift beneath andfor the river had lately burst its chains of icei felt sure that the man i followed would never make the crossing yet it appeared certain that he meant to attempt it for he rode straight at the screen of willows that fringed the waters edge vanished among them and i heard a crackling as his weary beast smashed through the shoreward fringe of honeycombed ice then i saw nothing for rattling branches closed about me as the horse feebly launched himself at the leap while a denser whiteness thickened the mist so far fortune had favored me throughout the reckless ride but it is not wise to tempt fate too hardly and the beast pitched forward when his hoofs descended upon bare frozen ground  had i worn boots my neck might have paid the penalty but the soft moccasins slipped free of the stirrups in time and when i came down the horse rolled over several yards clear of me he was up next moment but moved stiffly and stood still trembling when i grasped the bridle the saddle had slipped sideways as though a girth buckle had yielded and i felt faint and dizzy for the fall had shaken me nevertheless i unslung the rifle mechanically when a hail reached me and turning i saw the man we had followed sitting still in his saddle some twoscore yards away with the steam frothing white to his horses knees the daylight had almost gone the snow was commencing in earnest but i could make out that he was bareheaded and his face smeared with crimson perhaps from a wound the branch had made it looked drawn and ghastly as he sat stiffly erect against a background of hurrying water and falling snow with one hand on his hip and the other raised as though to command attention  you are rancher ormesby whose horse i borrowed i presume he said well if you are wise you will give up the chase before worse befalls you i am armed and i give you fair warning that i do not mean to be taken go home to your stove and comforts you have no quarrel with me  the clean english accent surprised me and the rifle lay still in the hollow of my left arm as i answered him do you forget you are sitting on the best mare i possess the loss of several hundred dollars is more than i can put up with and your warning sounds rather empty when i could hardly fail to pick you off with this rifle  i listened for the troopers coming but could hear only the fret of the river and the moaning of the blast for the wind was rising rapidly it was evident that the beast whose bridle i held was in no fit state to attempt the crossing and yet though the strangers cool assurance was exasperating i began to be conscious of a certain admiration and pity for him the man was fearless he had been hunted like a wolf and now left worn out wounded and doubtless faint from want of food to face the wild night in the open he had it seemed risked his last chance of escape to warn me when he might have taken me at a disadvantage  he laughed recklessly still i hardly think you will the mare is done and i pledge my word ill turn her loose as soon as im clear of the troopers i have no grudge against you but if you are wise you will take no further chances with a desperate man go home and be thankful you have a place to shelter you  there would have been no great difficulty in bringing the man down at that range even in a bad light and it is probable that nobody would have blamed me but though i should willingly have ridden him down in fair chase i could not fire on him as he sat there at my mercy for if he was armed it must have been with a pistola very poor weapon against a rifle i might also have shot the horse but one hesitates to sacrifice a costly beast even in the service of the state and strange to say i felt inclined to trust his promise accordingly i did neither and when a great ice cake came driving down and raising his hand again as though in recognition of my forbearance he wheeled the mare and vanished into a thicker rush of snow i stood motionless and let him go then feeling more shaken and dizzy than before i seized the bridle and led the horse into the whirling whiteness that drove down the slope darkness came suddenly i could scarcely see the trees and it was by accident i stumbled upon the troopers dismounted and picking their way  have ye seen him asked an object which looked like a polar bear and proved to be the sergeant  yes i answered shortly deciding that it would not be well to fully explain how i had let our quarry slip through my fingers if he has not drowned himself in the river he has got away i was close upon him when my horse fell and threw me badly are you going to try the crossing too  there are few bolder riders than the northwest troopers but mackay shook his head im thinking it would be a useless waste of government property an maybe of a troopers life he said no man could find him in this snow and if he lives through the night which is doubtful well find his trail plain in the morning well just seek shelter with haldane at bonaventure  i do not know how we managed to find the bonaventure ranch the wind had suddenly freshened almost to a gale and once clear of the river hollow we met the full force of it the snow that whirled across the desolate waste filled our eyes and nostrils rendering breathing difficult and sight almost impossible but it may be that the instinct of the horses helped us for making no effort at guidance i trudged on clinging to the bridle of my limping beast while halfseen spectral objects floundered through the white haze on each side nevertheless the pain which followed the impact of the flakes on one side of my halffrozen face showed that we were at least progressing in a constant direction and at last trooper cotton raised a hoarse halloo as a faint ray of light pierced the obscurity then shadowy buildings loomed ahead and blundering up against a wire fence we staggered whitened all over to the door of bonaventure  it was flung wide open at our knock banged to again and while a trooper went off with the horses to the stable the rest of us partly stupefied by the change of temperature stood in the lamplit hall shaking the white flakes from us a man of middle age attired in a fashion more common in the cities than in the west stretched out his hand to me  i am glad to see you ormesby and of course you and your companions will spend the night here he said cordially my girls told me they had met you and we were partly expecting your company apparently the malefactor got away sergeant mackay  we did not bring him with us but hell not win far this weather was the somewhat rueful answer the master of bonaventure smiled a little  he deserves to escape if he can live through such a night and im inclined to be sorry for the poor devil he said however you have barely time to get into dry things before supper will be ready we expect you all to join us prairie fashion  the welcome was characteristic of carson haldane who could win the goodwill of most men either on the prairie or in the exclusive circles of ottawa and montreal it was also characteristic that he called the evening meal as we did supper though when he was present a state of luxury wholly unusual on the prairie reigned at bonaventure     chapter ii  bonaventure ranch   we are waiting for you said haldane smiling as he stood in the doorway of the room where with some misgivings and by the aid of borrowed sundries we had made the best toilets we could you are not a stranger ormesby and must help to see your comrades made comfortable sergeant my younger daughter is enthusiastic about the prairie and you will have a busy time if you answer all her questions though i fear she will be disappointed to discover that nobody has ever scalped you  mackay drew himself up stiffly as if for his inspection parade and a white streak on his forehead showed the graze a bullet had made young cotton smiled wryly as he glanced at his uniform for it was probably under very different auspices he had last appeared in the society of ladies and i was uneasily conscious of the fact that the black leather tunic which a german teamster had given me was much more comfortable than becoming i might have felt even more dissatisfied had i known that my fall had badly split the tunic up the back that however did not account for the curious mingling of hesitation and expectancy with which i followed our host  during a brief visit to england some years ago i had met miss haldane at the house of a relative and the memory had haunted me during long winter evenings spent in dreamy meditation beside the twinkling stove and in many a lonely camp when the stars shone down on the waste of whitened grass through the blue transparency of the summer night the interval had been a time of strenuous effort with me but through all the stress and struggle in stinging snowdrift and blinding dust of alkali i had never lost the remembrance of the maiden who whiled away the sunny afternoons with me under the english elms indeed the recollection of the serene delicately cut face and the wealth of dusky hair grew sharper as the months went by until it became an abstract type of all that was desirable in womanhood rather than a prosaic reality now i was to meet its owner once more in the concrete flesh it may have been merely a young mans fancy born of a life bare of romance but i think that idealization was good for me  haldane held a door open saying something that i did not catch but young cotton whose bronzed color deepened for a moment made a courtly bow and the big grizzled sergeant smiled at me across the table as he took his place beside a laughing girl while i presently found myself drawing a chair back for beatrice haldane who showed genuine pleasure as she greeted me her beauty had increased during the long interval the clustering dark hair and the dark eyes were those i remembered well and if her face was a trifle colorless and cold i did not notice it she had grown a little more full in outline and more stately in bearing but the quiet graciousness which had so impressed me still remained  it is a long time since we met and you have changed since then she said pleasantly when you raced past our wagon i hardly recognized you that however was perhaps only to be expected but one might wonder whether you have changed otherwise too i recollect you were refreshingly sanguine when i last saw you  this was gratifying that i should have treasured the remembrance of beatrice haldane was only natural but it was very pleasant to hear from her own lips that she had not forgotten me her intention was doubtless kindly and it was inherited courtesy for haldane did most things graciously  the light was dim and this life sets its stamp on most of us i said may one compliment you on your powers of memory needless to say i recognized you the moment i saw you  miss haldane smiled a little a good memory is useful but do you wish me to return the compliment  no and i looked at her steadily but there is a difference in your world men and events follow each other in kaleidoscopic succession and each change of the combinations must dim the memory of the rest with us it is different you will see how we livebut no i hardly think you willfor bonaventure is not a typical homestead and the control of it can be only a pastime with your father  and yet it is said that whatever carson haldane touches yields him dividends but proceed interposed miss haldane  with us each day is spent in hurried labor and it is probably well that it is for otherwise the loneliness and monotony might overpower any man with leisure to brood and think heat frost and fatigue are our lot and an interlude resembling the one in which i met you means as a glimpse of a wholly different life so much to us we dream of it long afterwards and wonder if ever the enchanted gates will open to us again now please dont smile this is really not exaggeration  which gates you are not precise said my companion and laughed pleasantly when smiling too i answered one might almost sayof paradise  it must be the moslems paradise then she said still i hardly fancy a stalwart prairie rancher would pose well as the peri and by way of consolation you can remember that there are disappointments within those gates and those who have acquired knowledge beyond them sometimes envy the illusions of those without no you have not changed much in some respects mr ormesby you must talk to my sister lucilleshe will agree with you  her manner was very gracious in spite of the badinage but there was a faint trace of weariness and sardonic humor in her merriment which chilled me the darkhaired girl i remembered had displayed a power of sympathy and quick enthusiasm which had apparently vanished from my present companion  i am curious to hear if you have verified the optimistic views you once professed she added languidly  i laughed a little dryly being younger then and led on by a very winsome maidens interest i had talked with perhaps a little less than becoming modesty of the possibilities open to a resolute man in the new lands of the west and laid it down as an axiom that determination was a sure password to success  you should be merciful that was in my callow days i said nevertheless with a few more reservations i believe it is possible for those who can hope and hold on to realize their ambition in this country whether it be the evolution of a prosperous homestead from a strip of government land and a sod hovelor more desirable things the belief is excusable because one may see the proof of it almost every day i even fancied when in england that you agreed with me  there was a faint mischievous sparkle in miss haldanes eyes but she answered with becoming gravity wisdom as you seem to intimate comes with age and it is allowable to change ones opinions now it seems to me that all things happen more often against our will than as the result of it when the invisible powers behind us decree for instance who could have anticipated yesterday that we two should meet tonight at table or who could say whether this assembly brought about by a blizzard may not be the first scene of either a tragedy or a comedy  i was more at home when haldane turned the conversation upon practical matters such as wheat and cattle than when discussing abstract possibilities but i afterwards remembered that my fair companions speech was prophetic and as i glanced about it struck me that there were dramatic possibilities in the situation we were a strangely assorted company and to one who had spent eight years in the wilderness the surroundings were striking tall wax candles in silver standards flickering a little when the impact of the snowladen gale shook the lonely dwelling lighted the table the rest of the long room was wrapped in shadow save when the blaze from the great open hearth flung forth its uncertain radiance the light flashed upon cut glass and polished silver and forced up against the dusky background the faces of those who sat together  carson haldane owner of bonaventure which he occasionally visited sat at the head of the table a cleanshaven darkhaired man of little more than middle age whose slightly ascetic appearance concealed a very genial disposition he was a man of mark a daring speculator in mills and lands and mines and supposed to be singularly successful why he bought bonaventure ranch or what he meant to do with it nobody seemed to know but he acted in accordance with the customs of the place in which he found himself and because the distinctions of caste and wealth are not greatly recognized on the prairie there was nothing incongruous in his present company sergeant mackaylean bronzed and saturnine when the humor seized himnow bent his grizzled head with keen gray eyes that twinkled as he chatted to the freshfaced girl in the simple dress beside him i knew this was lucille haldane but had hardly glanced at her cotton had evidently forgotten that he was a police trooper and when he could broke in with some boyish jest or english story told in a different idiom from that which he generally adopted he seemed unconscious that he was recklessly betraying himself  you must not turn my daughters head with your reminiscences sergeant she is inclined to be overromantic already haldane said with a kindly glance at the girl possibly however one may excuse her tonight for you gentlemen live the stories she delights in by the way i do not quite understand how you allowed the evildoer to escape ormesby  being forced to an explanation i described the scene by the river as best i could looking at the sergeant a trifle defiantly until at the conclusion he said i cannot compliment ye rancher ormesby  i was about to retort when a clear young voice with a trace of mischief in its tone asked what would you have done had you been there and why were you so far behind sergeant  we do not ride pedigree horses said mackay a trifle grimly i should have shot his beast an so made sure of him in the first place  then there was a sudden silence when the girl who turned upon him with a gesture of indignation said it would have been cruel and i am glad he got away i saw his face when he passed us and it was so drawn and haggard that i can hardly forget it but it was not that of a bad man what crime had he committed that he should be hunted so pitilessly  young cotton colored almost guiltily under his tan as the girls indignant gaze fell upon him and for the first time i glanced at her with interest she was by no means to be compared with her sister but she had a brave young face slightly flushed with carmine and relieved by bright eyes that now shone with pity in contrast to beatrices dark tresses the light of the candles called up bronzegold gleams in her hair and her eyes were hazel while the voice had a vibration in it that seemed to awaken an answering thrill lucille haldane reminded me of what her sister had been but there was a difference slighter in physique she was characterized by a suggestion of nervous energy instead of beatrices queenly serenity the latter moved her shoulders almost imperceptibly but i fancied the movement expressed subdued impatience and her face a slightly contemptuous apology while her father laughed a little  you must be careful sergeant my younger daughter is mistress of bonaventure and rules us all somewhat autocratically but as far as i can gather your perceptions were tolerably correct in this instance lucille he said the man fell into the grip of the usurer who as usual drained his blood but while what he did may have been ethical justice he broke the laws of this country and perhaps hardly deserves your sympathy  no said lucille haldane and her eyes glistened i wish you had not told us what took place at the river mr ormesby here we sit warm and sheltered while that man who has perhaps suffered so much already wanders hungry faint and bleeding through this awful cold and snow just listen a moment  in the brief silence that followed i could hear the windows rattle under the impact of the driving snow and the eerie scream of the blast i shivered a little having more than once barely escaped with my life when caught far from shelter under such conditions and it was borne in upon me that the outlaw might well be summoned before a higher tribunal than an earthly court by morning  it was beatrice haldane who with i noticed a warning glance at her sister turned the conversation into a more cheerful channel and i was well content when some time later she took her place near me beside the hearth while lucille opened the piano at her fathers request possibly neither her voice nor her execution might have pleased a critic but as a break in our monotonous daily drudgery the music enchanted us and the grizzled sergeant straightened himself very erect while a steely glint came into his eyes as perhaps to atone for her speech at dinner the girl sang with fire and pathos a jacobite ballad of his own country its effect may have been enhanced by the novelty but there was a power in lucille haldane which is held only by the innocent in spirit whose generous enthusiasms are still unblunted and it seemed to me that the words and chords rang alternately with a deathless devotion and the clank of the clansmens steel  i cannot thank ye it was just grand said mackay shaken into unusual eloquence when the girl turned and halfshyly asked if he liked the song though as the soft candle light touched it her face was slightly flushed ye made one see themthe poor lads with the claymores who came out of the mist with a faith that was not bought with silver to die for their king loyal oh ay starving illled unpaid they were loyal to the death theres a pattern for ye trooper cotton who if yell mind what he tells ye will hold her majestys commission some day when sergeant mackays gone yell excuse me miss haldane but the music made me speak  i noticed that trooper cotton seemed to flinch a moment at the mention of a commission as though it recalled unpleasant memories and that the worthy sergeant appeared slightly ashamed of his outbreak while beatrice haldane showed a quiet amusement at his caledonian weakness for improving the occasion lucille however smiled at him again i think that is the prettiest compliment i have ever had paid my poor singing she said naïvely but i have done my duty i wonder if you would sing if we asked you mr cotton  lucille is at an impressionable age beatrice haldane said to me later she may find much that she now delights in obsolete and oldfashioned we have grown very materialistic in these modern days  god forbid i answered and i think the sergeant could tell you true stories of modern loyalty  for instance and i answered doggedly you can find instances for yourself if you try to see beneath the surface there are some very plain men on this prairie who could furnish them i think did you ever hear of rancher dane who stripped himself of all his possessions to advance the career of a now popular singer she married another man when fame came to her and it is said he knew she would never be more than a friend to him from the beginning  i have and the speakers eyes rested on me with a faint and yet kindly twinkle in them he was a very foolish person although it is refreshing to hear of such men even if disappointment follow consummation aspiration is good for one it is more blessed to give than to receive you know  here to the astonishment of his superior officer cotton who played his own accompaniment broke into song and he not only sang passably well but made a special effort to do his best i think while i remember reflecting as i glanced at the lad in uniform and the rich mans daughter who sat close by watching him how strange all this would have seemed to anyone unused to the customs of the prairie ours however is a new land wide enough to take in not only the upright and the strong of hand but the broken in spirit and the outcast whom the older country thrusts outside her gates and much more often than one might expect convert them into sturdy citizens the past history of any man is no concern of ours he begins afresh on his merits and by right of bold enterprise or industry meets as an equal whatever substitute for the older worlds dignitaries may be found among us how it is one cannot tell but the brand of servitude with the coarseness or cringing it engenders fades from sight on the broad prairie  beatrice haldane presently bade me go talk to her sister and though i did so somewhat reluctantly the girl interested me i do not remember all we said and probably it would not justify the effort to recall it but she was pleasantly vivacious of speech and genuinely interested in the answers to her numerous questions at length however she asked with a halfnervous laugh did you ever feel mr ormesby that somebody you could not see was watching you  no i answered lightly in my case it would not be worth while for anybody to do so you see and lucille haldane first blushed prettily and then shivered for no apparent reason  it must be a fancy but ifeltthat somebody was crouching outside there in the snow perhaps it is because the thought of that hunted man troubles me still said she  he would never venture near the house but rather try to find shelter in the depths of the ravinehowever to reassure you i wonder whether it is snowing as hard as ever sergeant i said turning towards mackay as i concluded  the casements were double and sunk in a recess of the thick log walls over which red curtains were not wholly drawn i flung one behind my shoulder and when the heavy folds shut out the light inside i could see for some little distance the ghostly glimmer of the snow then returning to my companion i said quietly there is nobody outside and i should have seen footprints if there had been  presently the two girls withdrew to attend to some household duties and haldane who handed a cigar box around said to me did you do well last season ormesby and what are your ideas concerning the prospects down here  i was partly fortunate and partly the reverse i answered as perhaps you heard i put less into stock and sowed grain largely it is my opinion that as has happened elsewhere the plow furrows will presently displace many of the unfenced cattleruns it is hardly wise to put all ones eggs into the same basket but my plowing was not wholly successful sir  it is a long way to laurentian tidewater and assisted by winnipeg mills the manitoba men would beat you said haldane with a shrewd glance at me  for the east they certainly would sir i answered but i see no reason why if we get the promised railroad we should not have our own mills and we lie near the gates of a good market in british columbia  haldane nodded approval and i was gratified he was not a practical farmer but it was said that he rarely made a mistake concerning the financial aspect of any industrial enterprise  you may be right i wish i had taken in the next ranch when i bought bonaventure but from what i gather you have extended your operations somewhat rapidly is it permissible to ask how you managed in respect to capital  the speakers tone was friendly and i did not resent the question i borrowed on interest sir after three good seasons i paid off one loan and seeing an opportunity borrowed again as it happened i lost a number of my stock but this year should leave me with much more plowland broken and liabilities considerably reduced  you borrowed from a bank asked haldane and looked a little graver when i answered no  it was as transpired later a great pity he spoke again before i told him where i had obtained the money but fate would have it so  i have grown gray at the game you are commencing but unless you have a gift for it it is a dangerous one and the facilities for obtaining credit are the bane of this country he said i dont wish to check any mans enterprise but i knew the man who started you and promised him in his last sickness to keep an eye on you take it as an axiom that if you cant get an honest partner you should deal only with the banks otherwise the mortgage speculator comes uppermost in the end hell carry you over almost against your wishes when times are good but when a few adverse seasons run in succession he will take you by the throat when you least expect it your neighbors are panicstricken nobody with money will look at your property and the bloodsucker seizes his opportunity  but if he sold one up under such circumstances he could not recover his loan much less charges and interest i interposed and haldane laughed  a man of the class im describing would not wish to recover in that way he is not short of money and knows bad seasons dont last forever so he sells off your property for say half its value recovers most of what he lent and stillremember the oppressive interestholds you fast for the balance he also puts up a dummy to buy the placeat depression valuepays a foreman to run it and when times improve sells the property on which you spent the borrowed money for twice as much  haldane nodded to emphasize his remarks as he leaned forward towards me the man you were hunting was handled in a similar fashion and it naturally made him savage we are neighbors ormesby and if ever you dont quite see your way out of a difficulty you might do worse than consult me  he moved towards the others when i thanked him and left me slightly troubled i knew his offer was genuine but being obstinately proud there were reasons why he would be the last man i should care to ask for assistance in a difficulty that i should ever have anything worth offering beatrice haldane appeared at one time a chimerical fancy but though her fathers words left their impression i had made some progress along the road to prosperity ever since the brief days i spent in her company in england a vague purpose had been growing into definite shape but that night i had discovered with a shock that if the difference in wealth between us had been lessened she was far removed by experience as well as culture from a plain stockraiser     chapter iii  a midnight visitor   the snow had thinned a little though it still blew hard when before retiring i borrowed a lantern and made a dash for the stable the horse which had fallen was a valuable one and remembering how stiffly he had moved i was anxious about him winter should have been over and this was its last effort but the cold struck through me and i knew by the depth of the snow that a horse would be a useless incumbrance to the fugitive who could not have made a league in any direction he was probably hiding in the ravine and it appeared certain that he would be captured on the morrow i was therefore the less surprised when the stolen mare shuffled towards me the man had at least kept his promise to release her when useless but i was still slightly puzzled as to how the beast had found her own way to bonaventure this meant work for me and i spent some time in the long sodprotected building which was redolent of peppermint in the prairie hay before returning to the dwelling my moccasins made no sound as i came softly through the hall but it was not my fault that when i halted to turn out and hang up the lantern voices reached me through an open door  you are in charge here and will see that the lamps and stoves are safe lucille one of them said what did you think about our guests  i liked them immensely the sergeant was simply splendid answered another voice the young trooper was very nice too i did not see much of mr ormesby he talked a good deal to you  there was no mistaking beatrice haldanes rippling laugh rancher ormesby is amusing for a change one grows to long for something original after the stereotyped products of the cities contact with primitive men and fashions acts for a time as a tonic although too much of it might serve as say an emetic  it was a pity it had not occurred to me to rattle the lantern earlier for though women do not always mean what they say this last observation was not particularly gratifying neither was it quite what i had expected from beatrice haldane whether the fair speaker guessed that she had been overheard or not i never knew but because a ripple of subdued laughter reached me as a door swung to i surmised that her sister had found cause for merriment tired as i was i did not feel immediately disposed for sleep and as haldane had bidden us do just what best pleased us i looked into the troopers quarters and found mackay and one of his subordinates who had preferred to spend the evening with the hired hands asleep and cotton cleaning his carbine  well be off before daybreak and i had not a chance earlier i would not have missed a minute of this evening for promotion tomorrow of course ill pay for it later but thats the usual rule and partly why im serving the nation as trooper cotton now he said with a mirthless smile  you are getting as bad as the sergeant i answered impatiently come along when you have finished if youre not overtired and well smoke one of our hosts cigars together he left the box for us beside the big hearth in the hall  ill be there in ten minutes mackays so confoundedly particular about the arms said cotton  the fire was burning redly in the hall though the lamps were out when i ensconced myself in a deep chair behind a deerhide screen quaintly embroidered by indian women the cigar was a good one and i had much to think about so it was not until a shaft of light streamed athwart the screen that looking round it i noticed that lucille haldane carrying a candle had entered the long room she set it down on a table and stood still glancing about her while i effaced myself behind the screen the girl had cast her hair loose and it rippled in glossy masses from her shoulders to the delicate inward curve of her waist setting forth the lithe shapeliness of her figure concluding that she would withdraw as soon as she was satisfied that all was safe i decided it would be better if she remained unaware of my presence and hoped that cotton would delay his coming to judge by the soft footsteps she was returning when a sudden coldness chilled the room the light grew uncertain as though the candle flickered in a draught and a door i had not previously noticed opened noiselessly  wondering what this might mean i sat very still and then stared blankly as a snowwhitened object came softly into the room for a few seconds i could almost have fancied it was a supernatural visitant rather than a creature of flesh and blood for the mans face was ghastly and he brought the chill of the grave with him he was bareheaded his cheeks ashy gray and clotted brown patches streaked the rag bound round his forehead while the snow was in his hair but as he moved forward i had no difficulty in recognizing him i heard lucille haldane draw in her breath with a gasp and it was that which roused me to action but the intruder broke the silence first  please dont cry out you are perfectly safeand my life is in your hands he said  not exactly i broke in and flinging the screen sideways stepped between him and the girl the strangers hand dropped instinctively to the holster at his waist then he let it fall to his side  you here rancher ormesby i freed your horse and you have no further cause for hunting me down he said with a composure which astonished me i am sorry to alarm you miss haldane but it was the truth i told you i will not be taken and it rests with you either to call the troopers or to turn me out to freeze in the snow  in spite of his terrifying appearance it was clear that the man was not a ruffian he spoke with deference and his voice betrayed consideration for the girl and again a sense of compassion came upon me still there was my hosts daughter to consider and i turned towards her  will you go away and leave him to me i said  lucille haldane glancing from one of us to the other shook her head and i think we must have formed a striking tableau as we stood where the candlelight flickered athwart one small portion of the long shadowy room the girls face was pale but a sudden wave of color swept across it when with a sinuous movement of her neck she flung back the lustrous masses of her hair she was dressed as i had last seen her except that the lace collar was missing and her full white throat gleamed like ivory yet though her voice trembled a little she showed small sign of fear  will you tell me how you came here she asked and as the question applied to either we both answered it  i have been here some little time and feared to surprise you but am very glad it happened so i said and the stranger followed me  rancher ormesby is unjustified in his inference i came in by the anteroom window earlier in the evening i lay outside in the lee of the building watching you and i felt that i might risk trusting you so i waited for an opportunity i knew the troopers were here but i was freezing in the snow and i wondered whether out of charity you would give me a little food and let me hide in an outbuilding until the blizzard blows over  lucille haldanes fear if it ever lasted more than a moment had vanished and her eyes glistened with womanly pity for the mans strength was clearly spent but she drew herself up a little what have you done to come to this said she  i am afraid i should tire you and somebody might surprise us before i told you half he answered logically you must take my word that all i did was to resist by force the last effort of an extortioner to complete my ruin he lent me money and after i had paid it back nearly twice over he tried to seize the little that remained between me and destitution there was a fracas and he was shotthough the wound was only trifling  i believed the terse story and saw that lucille haldane did also then i grew anxious lest cotton should come in before she had made her decision there is not a minute to lose your father at least should know had you not better tell him while i stay here i said  i dont think so he has told me that i am mistress at bonaventure and i might rouse the troopers in calling him the girl answered steadily turning from me to the intruder i think i can believe you and you will find sleighrobes in the harnessroom at the end of the long stable slip up the ladder and crawl in among the hay the sergeant would never suspect your presence there  and rancher ormesby asked the other with a glance at me  will accept the mistress of bonaventures decision i answered dryly but i am expecting one of the troopers and you are risking your liberty every second you stay  he is starving said lucille haldane there is brandy in that sideboard mr ormesby and i can find cold food in the kitchen ah  i had forgotten while i strained my ears that cottons moccasins would give no warning as he came down the passage and i hurried forward at the girls exclamation a second too late to bolt the door he came in before i reached it and halted at sight of the outlaw gripping the edge of the table as suddenly as though struck by a bullet he was a lad of spirit and i saw there was some special cause for his consternation and that he was also apparently oblivious of the presence of two of the party  good lord is it you boone we have been chasing all day he said  i seized a chairback and measured the distance between myself and the fugitive as i noticed the venomous pistol glint in his hand but he lowered the muzzle when he saw cotton clearly and with a glance in miss haldanes direction let the weapon fall out of sight behind his thigh  it is he answered steadily what in heavens name broughtyouto canada charlie cotton and thrust you in my way it was in a very different character from your present one that i last saw you  both apparently forgot the spectators in their mutual surprise though lucille haldane stared at them wideeyed which was small wonder considering that she was a romantic girl forced for the first time to play a part in what threatened to prove an unpleasantly realistic tragedy it was hardly possible for her not to guess that these two had been friends in very different circumstances  cotton leaned heavily on the table and i fancied groaned then straightened himself and answered in a strained voice that sounded very bitter it would be useless to return the compliment though the contrast is more marked in your case i didnt see your face and the name on our warrant suggested nothing this is her majestys uniform at leastthough i would give ten years pay if it werent cant you see that im trooper cotton and must skulk away a deserter unless i arrest you  there does not seem to be much choice boone said grimly heaven knows how little there is to attract any man in the life i have been leading but there is one good cause why i should not be quixotic enough to give myself up to oblige you no stand back charlie cottoni dont want to hurt you  the pistol barrel glinted as it rose into sight again and though no one had spoken in more than a hoarse whisper before a heavy silence settled upon the room through which i thought i could hear the girl catch at her breath i stood between her and the two men but i was at my wits end as to what should be done by this time my sympathies were enlisted on the side of the unfortunate rancher but the girls presence complicated the affair it seemed imperative that she should be safely out of the way before either an alarm was given or a struggle ensued yet she had refused to vacate the position and i realized that she meant it meantime cottons face was a study of indecision and disgust the lad was brave enough but it seemed as though the mental struggle had partly crippled his physical faculties with a gesture of dismay he turned suddenly to me  its a horrible combination ormesby of course i cant tell anybody all but i knew this man well and was indebted to him in the old country now he has somehow broken the laws of the dominion and im bound by my oath of service to arrest him there is no other course possible boone i cant help it will you surrender quietly  no was the answer my liberty is precious because i have work to do move or call out at your peril charlie  the climax was evidently approaching and still i could do nothing for fear of jeopardizing lucille haldanes safety if i precipitated it the young lad unarmed as he was stiffened himself as for a spring and i wondered whether i could reach his opponents pistol arm with the chairleg in time when the trooper moved or shouted then because feminine wits are often quicker than our own i saw the girls eyes were fixed on me as unnoticed by the others she pointed towards the candle another second passed before i understood her then for the light stood on the corner of the table nearest me i swept one arm out and there was sudden darkness as i hurled it sideways across the room the door into the main passage swung to and cotton fell over something as he groped his way towards it while though strung up in a state of tension i smiled hearingwhat he did notsomebody brush through the other door which it was evident had escaped his notice  next feeling that the girl was mistress of the position i stirred the sinking fire until a faint brightness shone out from the hearth it just sufficed to reveal lucille haldane standing with her back to the door the fugitive had not passed through this quickwitted maneuver sufficed to deceive the bewildered representative of the law you cannot pass trooper cotton she said  the lad positively groaned do you know that you are disgracing me forever miss haldane he said in a hoarse appeal you must let me pass  the girl resolutely shook her head and the dying light showed me her slender fingers tightly clenched on the handle of the door i will see that you do not suffer but i am mistress of this house and i think you are an english gentleman trooper cotton she said  then with an air of desperation the lad turned to me wont you try to persuade her ormesby  no i said dryly i am miss haldanes guest and not a police officer i am sorry for you cotton but you have done your best and even if you forget your own traditions ill certainly see you show her due respect it is not your fault that i have twice your strength but it will be if while miss haldane remains here you summon your comrades by a shout  confound you you never thought he broke out but ceasing abruptly he left the sentence incomplete and feeling that there were two sides to the question i stood aside while he commenced a circuit of the room which he might have done earlier still lucille haldane did not move for each moment gained might be valuable until with an ejaculation he discovered and sprang through the other door then hurrying to her side i laid my hand reassuringly on the girls arm and found she was trembling like a leaf as i drew the door open  you must not lose a moment and i think you should tell your father but you can trust me to manage cotton and keep what has passed a secret i said  there was a faint thank you while hardly had she flitted down the passage than a shout rang out and hurrying as for my life i found cotton pounding on the inner door of the anteroom noticing that the window was shut i seized his shoulder and gripped it hard pull yourself together and remember that whatever tale you tell miss haldane does not figure in it i said a horse would be no use to him but ill make sure by a run to the stable while you acquaint the sergeant  it was still snowing and the drifts were deep but i managed to plunge my feet into the hollows left by somebody who had preceded me and there was a bottle of brandy in my pocket i returned floundering as heavily as possible along my outward tracksfor one learns a good deal when trailing wandering steers or stalking antelopeand met cotton who now carried his carbine it was evident that he was bent on discharging his duty thoroughly for when i announced that no horses were missing he answered shortly thanks but im going myself to see mackay and mr haldane are waiting for you  i smiled to myself trooper cotton had acquired small proficiency in the art of tracking and i knew that my footprints would not only deceive him but that following them he would obliterate evidence that might have been conclusive to the sergeants practiced eyes all the male inmates of bonaventure had gathered halfdressed in the hall and sergeant mackay who was asking questions turned to me ye were here when he came in rancher ormesby  i was i answered i didnt hear him until he was in the room but he seemed starving and presumably ran the risk in the hope of obtaining food  why did ye not seize him or raise the alarm asked the sergeant and i shrugged my shoulders  i was wholly unarmed and he is a desperate man with a pistol you may remember mentioning that his capture was not my business  i mind that i have seen ye take as heavy risks when for a fivedollar wager ye drove a loaded sledge over the rotten ice said the sergeant with a searching glance at me while ye did nothing trooper cotton came in to help ye  just so he had no weapon either but appeared quite willing to face the outlaws pistol when the candle went out and the man must have slipped out by the second door in the dark i made for the stables at once but all the horses were safe my own i discovered earlier had come back by itself  ye showed little sense said mackay while haldane glanced curiously at me what would he do with a horse in two foot of snow there are points im no clear about but therell be time for questions later ah found ye anything trooper cotton  no said the lad nothing but the footprints made by ormesby and i can only presume that there being no lee on that side the wind would fill the horsethiefs track with snow he would never risk trying the outbuildings when he knew that we were here  no was the sergeants answer hell be for the ravine well take our leave mr haldane with thanks for your hospitality leaving the horses in the meantime it is a regret to me we have brought this disturbance upon ye  two minutes later the police had vanished into the snow and in another ten bonaventure was almost silent again i went back to my couch and slept soundly being too wearied to wonder whether i had done well or ill next morning haldane called me into a room of his own  my daughter has told me what took place last night and while in one sense im indebted to you ormesby i really cant decide whether you showed a lamentable lack of judgment in abetting her he said she is a brave little soul but does not always spare time to think frankly i wish this thing had not come about as it did  he spoke seriously but there was a kindliness in his eyes and it was easy to see that carson haldanes younger daughter was his idol which slightly puzzled me there were those who heaped abuse upon his head and it is possible his financial operations did not benefit everybody for when men grow rich by speculation somebody must lose there are however many sides to every nature and i always found him an upright kindly gentleman while only those who knew him best could guess that he was faithful to a memory and that the gracious influence of one he had lost still swayed him  i am sorry if i acted indiscreetly sir but i could think of no other course at the time i said do you know where the man is now  it is sometimes unwise to ask questions and i have not inquired too closely and haldane laid his hand on my shoulder it must be our secret ormesby and i should prefer that miss haldane did not share it thisi suppose one must call it an escapademight trouble her i presume you could rely on that lads discretion he was evidently not brought up for a police trooper  i think you could depend on him sir and as you know a good many others in this country follow vocations they were never intended for  well we will say no more on that subject he answered the doctors tell me i have been working under too great a strain and as they recommend quiet and relaxation i decided to try six months practical ranching my partner will no doubt arrange that other folks pay the bill but this is hardly a peaceful beginning  haldane laughed before he added significantly in one respect im duly grateful ormesby andin confidencehere is a proof of it you are staking high on the future of this region well the railroad will be built which will naturally make a great difference in the value of adjacent land you will however remember that in accordance with medical advice i am now ranching for my health  i remembered it was said that carson haldane could anticipate long before anybody else what the powers at ottawa would sanction or veto and that a hint from him was valuable it is good news and i presume that bonaventure will have extended its boundaries by the time you recover sir i said  that evening sergeant mackay returned to requisition provisions and departed again he was alone and very much disgusted having no news of the fugitive he did not revisit bonaventure during the next day i remained there and presumably the man he sought slipped away when the coast was clear perhaps the fact that the whirling drifts would obliterate his tracks had deceived the sergeant and we supposed the contrabandists who dealt in prohibited liquor had smuggled him across the american frontier the night before i took my leave beatrice haldane looked across at her sister who sat sewing near the stove and then at me  since you recovered your horse i am not altogether sorry the hunted man got away she said there are however two things about the affair which puzzle mehow the candlestick my sister carried when she made the rounds reached the table in the hall where it is never left and why i should find the candle it contained under the sideboard in the room the intruder entered can you suggest any solution mr ormesby  i felt uncomfortable knowing that beatrice haldane was not only clever herself but the daughter of a very shrewd man while her eyes were fixed steadily on me lucilles head bent lower over her sewing and though i would have given much to answer frankly i felt that she trusted me so i said as indifferently as i could there might be several and the correct one very simple somebody must have knocked the candlestick over in his hurry and forgotten about it have you been studying detective literature latterly  beatrice haldane said nothing further but i realized that i had incurred her displeasure and was not greatly comforted by the grateful glance her sister flashed at me     chapter iv  the tightening of the net   it was a hot morning of early summer when i rode up the low rise to my house at gaspards trail a few willows straggled behind one side of it but otherwise it rose unsheltered from the windswept plain which after a transitory flush of greenness had grown dusty white again i had been in the saddle since sunrise when the dewy freshness had infused cheerfulness and vigor into my blood but now it was with a feeling of dejection i reined in my horse and sat still looking about me  the air was as clear as crystal so that the birches far off on the western horizon cut sharply against the blue all around the rest of the circle ran an almost unbroken sweep of white and gray streaked in one place by the dust of alkali rolling up from a strip of bitter water which flashed like polished steel long plowfurrows stretched across the foreground but even these had been baked by pitiless sunshine to the same monotony of color and it was well i had not sown the whole of them for sparse sickly blades rose in the wake of the harrows where tall wheat should have been behind these stood the square log dwelling and straggling outbuildings of logs and sod all of a depressing ugliness while two shapeless yellow mounds blazing under the sunshine represented the strawpile granaries there was no touch of verdure in all the picture for it had been a dry season which boded ill for me  presently a horse and a rider whose uniform was whitened by the fibrous dust swung out of a shallow ravineor coulée as we called themand trooper cotton cantered towards me hotter than ever and i suppose that accounts for your downcast appearance he said ive never seen weather like it even the gophers are dead  it grows sickening but you are wrong in one respect i answered ruefully all the gophers in the country have collected around my grain and wells as they fall in after every hearty meal of wheat we have been drinking them you are just in time for breakfast and ill be glad of your company one overlooks a good deal when things are going well but the sordid monotony of these surroundings palls on one now and then  you are not the only man who feels it said the trooper while a temporary shadow crossed his face you have been to bonaventure too often ormesby of course its delightful to get into touch with things one has almost forgotten but i dont know that its wise for a poor man which is perhaps why i allowed haldane to take me in last night you however hardly come into the same category  i shall soon unless theres a change in the weather i answered with a frown but come in and tell me what haldaneor his daughterssaid to you  i didnt see much of miss haldane said cotton as we rode on together of course shes the embodiment of all a woman of that kind should be but i cant help feeling its a hospitable duty when she talks to me you see ive forgotten most of the little i used to know and she is with all respect uncomfortably superior to an average individual  i was not pleased with trooper cotton but did not tell him so presumably you find miss lucille understands you better i answered with a trace of illhumor  the lad looked straight at me im not responsible for the weather ormesby he said a trifle stiffly still since you have put it so its my opinion that miss lucille haldane would understand anybody she has the gift of making you feel it also to change the subject however i was over warning bryan about his fireguard furrows and yours hardly seem in accordance with the order  i laughed and said nothing further until a man in a big straw hat appeared in the doorway whos that asked cotton drawing his bridle  foster lane i answered he came over yesterday  ah said the trooper pulling out his watch on reflection perhaps i had better not come in i am due at the cree reserve by ten and as my horse is a little lame i dont want to press him this time you will excuse me  his excuse was certainly lame as i could see little the matter with the horse and being short of temper that morning i answered sharply i wont press you but is it a coincidence that you remember this only when you recognize lane  trooper cotton who was frank by nature and a poor diplomatist looked uneasy i dont want to offend you ormesby but one must draw the line somewhere and i will not sit down with that man he said i know hes your guest but you would not let me back out gracefully and if its not impertinent ill add that im sorry he is  i congratulate you on being able to draw lines but just now i myself cannot afford to be particular i answered dryly and when with a feeble apology cotton rode away it cost me an effort to greet the other man civilly  as breakfast was ready he took his place at the table and glanced at me whimsically foster lane was neither very prepossessing nor distinctly the reverse in appearance he was stout and somewhat flabby in face with strawcolored hair and a thicklipped mouth but while his little eyes had a humorous twinkle there was a suggestion of force as well as cunning about him he was of middle age and besides representing a sostyled development company was by profession land agent farmers financier and mortgage jobber and as naturally follows a usurer  say im not deaf yet ormesby he commenced with coarse goodhumor particular kind of trooper that one isnt he is he another brokenup british baronets youngest son orbecause they only raise his kind in the old countrywhat has the fellow done  hes a friend of mine i answered i never inquired of him still im sorry you overheard him  thats all right was the answer my hide is a pretty thick one and one needs such a protection in my business give a dog a bad name and you may as well hang him rancher ormesby although i flatter myself im a necessity in a new country how many struggling ranchers would go under in a dry season but for my assistance and how many fertile acres now growing the finest wheat would lie waste but for me yet when i ask enough to live on in return every loafer without energy or foresight abuses me its a very ungrateful world ormesby  lane chuckled as he wiped his greasy forehead and paused before he continued ive been thinking all night about carrying over the loan you mentioned and though moneys scarce just now this is my suggestion ill let you have threefourths of its present appraised value on crane valley and you can then clear gaspards trail and handle a working balance id sooner do that than carry oversee  i set down my coffee cup because i did not see i had expected he would have exacted increased interest on the loan due for repayment and interest in western canada is always very high but it seemed curious that he should wish to change one mortgage for another it also struck me that if in case i failed to make repayment crane valley would be valuable to him it should be worth at least as much to me  that would not suit me i said  no and lane spoke slowly rather as one asking a question than with a hint of menace feel more like letting me foreclose on you  you could not do that because i should pay you off i said i could do it though theres no use denying that it would cripple me just now as of course you know whatever i could realize on at present when everybody is short of money and trade at a standstill should bring twice as much next season that is why i wish the loan to run on  well and lane helped himself before he answered in that case ill have to tax you an extra ten per cent it seems high but no bank would look at encumbered property or a halfdeveloped place like crane valley take it or leave it at six months date that would give you time to sell your fat stock and realize on your harvest  i fancied there was a covert sneer in the last words because i had faint hope of any harvest and answered accordingly it seems extortionate but even so should pay me better than sacrificing now  moneys scarce said lane suavely im going on to lawrences and will send you in the papers lend me as good a horse as you have for a day or two  i did not like the mans tone and the request was too much like an order but i made no further comment though a load seemed lifted from me when he rode away and i started with my foreman to haul home prairie hay it was fiercely hot and thick dust rolled about our light wagon while each low rise cut off as it were from the bare levels floated against the horizon the glare tired ones vision and halfclosing my aching eyes i sank into a reverie for eight long years i had toiled late and early taxing the strength of mind and body to the utmost i had also prospered and lured on by a dream first dreamed in england i grew more ambitious breaking new land and extending my herds with borrowed capital that had also paid me until a bad season came and when both grain and cattle failed lane became a menace to my prosperity it was a bare life i and my foreman lived for every dollar hardly won was entrusted in some shape to the kindly earth again and no cent wasted on comforts much less luxuries but i had seldom time to miss either of them and it was not until haldane brought his daughters to bonaventure that i saw what a man with means and leisure might make of his life then came the reaction and there were days when i grew sick of the drudgery and heavy physical strain but still spurred on alternately by hope and fear i relaxed no effort  now artificial grasses are seldom sown on the prairie where usually the natural product grows only a few inches high and as building logs are scarce implements are often kept just where they last were used it was therefore necessary to seek hay worth cutting in a driedout slough or swamp and next to find the mower which might lie anywhere within a radius of four miles or so we came upon them both together the mower lying on its side red with rust amid a stretch of waisthigh grass the latter was harsh and wiry heavyscented with wild peppermint and made ready for us by the sun  there were however preliminary difficulties and i had worked myself into a state of exasperation before the rusty machine could be induced to run after a vigorous hammering and the reckless use of oil the pair of horses were at last just able to haul it groaning vehemently through the driedup swamp i was stripped almost to the skin by this time the dust that rose in clouds turned to mire upon my dripping cheeks and about my eyes while bloodthirsty winged creatures hovered round my head  this said foreman thorn as he wiped the red specks from his face and hands is going to be a great country we can raise the finest insects on the wide earth already the last time i was down to traverse a man came along from somewhere with a gospel tent and from what he said there wasnt much chance for anyone to raise cattle hed socked it to us tolerable for halfanhour at least when tompsons charlie gets up and asks him did you ever break halfthawn sod with oxen no my man but this interruption is unseemly says he its not a conundrum says charlie did you ever sleep in a mosquito muskeg or cut hay in a driedout slough and the preacher seeing we all wanted an answer shakes his head then you start in and try and find out that there are times when a man must talk or bust before you worry us says charlie but whos coming along now  i had been too busy to pay much attention to the narrative or to notice a rattle of wheels and i looked up only when a wagon was drawn up beside the slough a smoothshaven man with something familiar about his face sat on the drivingseat smiling down at me  goodmorning rancher ormesby wanting any little pictures of yourself to send home to friends in the old country he said pointing to what looked like the lens of a camera projecting through the canvas behind him ill take you for halfadollar as you are if youll give me the right to sell enlargements as a prairie study  the accent was hardly what one might have expected from one of the traveling adventurers who at intervals wandered across the country and i looked at the speaker with a puzzled air i have no time to spare for fooling and dont generally parade halfnaked before either the public or my civilized friends i said  some people look best that way answered the other regarding me critically whereupon thorn turned round and grinned the team and tall grass would make an effective background stand by inside there edmond its really not a bad model of a bare throat and torso and as i dont know that your face is the best of you the profile with a shadow on it would dojust so say i wonder did you know those old canvas overalls drawn in by the leggings are picturesque and become you thereim much obliged to you  a faint click roused me from the state of motionless astonishment his sheer impudence produced and when i strode forward thorns grin of amusement changed to one of expectancy you dont want any hairrestorer apparently though ive some of the best in the dominion at a dollar the bottle but i could give you a salve for the complexion continued the traveler and i stopped suddenly when about to demand the destruction of the negative or demolish his camera  good heavens boone is it you and what is the meaning of this mummery i asked staring at him more amazed than ever  just now im called adams if you please said the other holding out his hand i hadnt an opportunity for thanking you for your forbearance when we met at bonaventure but i shall not readily forget it this is not exactly mummery it provides me with a living and suits my purpose i could not resist the temptation of trying to discover whether you recognized me or whether i was playing my part artistically  are you not taking a big risk and why dont you exploit a safer district i asked and the man smiled as he answered i dont think theres a settler around here who would betray me even if he guessed my identity and the troopers never got a good look at me i live two or three hundred miles east you see and the loss of a beard and mustache alters any mans appearance considerably i also have a little business down this way have you seen anything of foster lane during the last week or two  yes i said he has just ridden over from my place to lawrences in crane valley  you have land there too said boone as though aware of it already and when i nodded added then if you are wise you will see that devil does not get his claws on it i presume you are not above taking a hint from me  i looked straight at him i know very little of you except that there is a warrant out for your arrest and i am not addicted to taking advice from strangers  boone returned my gaze steadily without resentment and i had time to take note of him he was a tall spare sinewy man deeply bronzed like most of us but now that he had as it were cast off all pertaining to the traveling pedlar there was an indefinite something in his speech and manner which could hardly have been acquired on the prairie he did not look much over thirty but his forehead was seamed and from other signs one might have fancied he was a man with a painful history then he flicked the dust off his jean garments with the whip and laughed a little  i am an englishman rancher ormesby and needless to say so are you we are not a superfluously civil people and certain national characteristics betray you i fancy we shall be better acquainted and that being so feel prompted to tell you a story which after what passed at bonaventure you perhaps have a right to know you will stop a while for lunch anyway and if you have no objections i will take mine along with you  i could see no reasonable objection to this and presently we sat together under the wagon for the sake of coolness while when the mower ceased its rattle the dust once more settled down upon the slough it was almost too hot to eat there was no breath of wind and the glare of the sunscorched prairie grew blinding  i should not wonder if you took most kindly to indirect advice and there is a moral to this story said boone when i lit my pipe some years ago a disappointed man who knew a little about land and horses came out from the old country to farm on the prairie bringing with him a woman used hitherto to the smoother side of life he saw it was a good land and took hold with energy believing the luck had turned at last while the woman helped him gallantly for a time all went well with them but the loneliness and hardship proved too much for the woman whose strength was of the spirit and not of the body and she commenced to droop and pine she made no complaint but her eyes lost their brightness and she grew worn and thin while the man grew troubled she had already given up very much for him he saw his neighbors prospering on borrowed capital and for the times were good determined to risk sowing a double acreage that meant comfort instead of privation if all went well and toiling late and early he sowed hope for a brighter future along with the grain so far it is not an uncommon story  i nodded when the speaker pausing stared somberly towards the horizon for since that english visit i also had staked all i hoped for in the future on the chances of the seasons  the luck went against him the narrator continued harvest frost drought and summer hail followed in succession and when the borrowed money melted the man who held the mortgage foreclosed he was within his rights in this but he went further for while there were men in that district who would out of kindliness or as a speculation have bought up the settlers possessions at fair prices the usurer had his grasp also on them and when a hint was sent them they did nothing therefore the auction was a fraud and robbery and all was bought up by a confederate for much less than its value there was enough to pay the loan offalthough the interest had almost done so alreadybut not enough to meet the iniquitous additions and the farmer went out ruined on to government land with a few head of stock a richer man he had once done a service to gave him but the woman sickened in the sod hovel he built there was no doctor within a hundred miles and the farmer had scarcely a dollar to buy her necessaries even then the usurer had not done with him he entered proceedings to claim the few head of cattle for balance of the twicepaid debt the farmer could not defend himself somebody took money for willful perjury to evade a clause of the homestead exemptions and the usurer got his order the woman lay very ill when he came with a band of desperadoes to seize the cattle they threatened violence a fracas followed and the farmers hands were for once unsteady on the rifle he did not mean to use for when a drunken cowboy would have ransacked his dwelling the trigger yielded prematurely and the usurer was carried off with a bullet through his leg the woman died and was buried on a lonely rise of the prairie and the man rode out with hatred in his heart and a price upon his head you should know the rest of the storybut the sequel is to follow it was not without an effort or a motive i told it you  i stretched out my hand impulsively towards the speaker it is appreciated i need not ask one name but the other  is foster lane and in due time he shall pay in full for all  boones voice which had grown a trifle husky sank with the last words to a deeper tone and the sinewy right hand he raised for a moment fell heavily tightclenched upon his knee he said nothing further for a while but i felt that if ever the day of reckoning came one might be sorry for foster lane  presently he shrugged his shoulders and rose abruptly i have a case of pomade to sell the swedes over yonder and if my luck is good some photographs to take he said resuming his former manner i presume you wouldnt care to decorate your house with tinframed oleographs of german manufacture i have a selection all of the usual ugliness whatever happens one must eat you know well lanes gone into crane valley and it happens im going that way too this i hope is the beginning of an acquaintance ormesby  he sold thorn a bottle of some infallible elixir before he climbed into his tented wagon and left me troubled as he jolted away across the prairie one thing however i was resolved upon and that was to pay off foster lane at the earliest opportunity by parting with my best stock at a heavy sacrifice it seemed just possible to accomplish it     chapter v  a surprise party   except when the snow lies deep one has scanty leisure on the prairie and when adams departed thorn and i hurriedly recommenced our task we had lost time to make up and vied with each other for i had discovered that even in a country where all work hard much more is done for the master who can work himself pitching heavy trusses into a wagon is not childs play at that temperature but just then the exertion brought relief and i was almost sorry when thorn went off with the lurching vehicle leaving me to the mower and my thoughts the latter were not overpleasant just then still the machine needed attention and the horses needed both restraint and encouragement for at times they seemed disposed to lie down and at others maddened by the insects inclined to kick the rusty implement into fragments and i grew hoarse with shouting while the perspiration dripped from me  it was towards six oclock and the slanting sunrays beat pitilessly into my face which was thick with fibrous grime when with thorn lagging behind i tramped stiffly beside the wagon towards my house my blue shirt was rent in places the frayed jean jacket being minus its buttons refused to meet across it and nobody new to the prairie would have taken me for the owner of such a homestead as gaspards trail thick dust through which mounted figures flitted rolled about the dwelling and a confused bellowing mingled with the human shouts that rose from behind the long outbuildings  its hendersons boys bringing shipping stock along somebodys been squeezing him for money or he wouldnt sell at present said thorn who rejoined me theyll camp here tonight and clean up the larder i guess most everybody knows how henderson feeds them  there are disadvantages attached to the prairie custom of free hospitality and i surmised that hendersons stock riders might have pushed on to the next homestead if they had not known that we kept a good table at gaspards trail nevertheless i was thankful that no stranger need ever leave my homestead hungry and only wondered whether my cooks comments would be unduly sulphurous when i reached the wirefenced corral which was filled with circling cattle and an intolerable dust a horseman flung his hand up in salute  were bound for the indian spring bottom with an h triangle draft he said the grass is just frizzled on the blackfeet run and we figured wed camp right here with you tonight  thats all right but couldnt you have fetched carsons by dusk without breaking anybodys neck and yonder beasts arent branded triangle h i said  the horseman laughed silently in prairie fashion well we might and we mightnt but carsons a close man and ive no great use for stale flapjacks and glucose drips no sir im not greedy and well just let carson keep them for himself those beasts marked dash circle are the best of the lot lanes put the screw on redmond and forced him to part redmonds down on his luck hes crawling round here somewhere cussing lane tremendous  lane seems to own all this country i answered irritably has he got a hold on your master too i told him and redmond i was saving that strip of sweet prairie for myself  he will own all the country if you bosses dont kick in time was the dry answer i dont know how ours is fixed but hes mighty short in temper and youve no monopoly of unrecorded prairie say it might save your boys a journey if we took your stock along with us and gave them a chance before this draft cleans all the sweet grass up redmond told me to mention it  the offer was opportune and i accepted it then hurried towards the galvanized iron shed which served as summer quarters for the general utility man who acted as cook he was a genius at his business though he had learned it on board a sailing ship he was using fiery language as he banged his pans about its a nice state of things when a cattlewhacking loafer can walk right in and tell me what he wants for his supper he commenced general jackson its bad enough when a blame cowboy outfit comes down on one like the locusts and cleans everything up but its worse just when im trying to fix a special highgrade meal  im not particular what is good enough for a cowboy is good enough for a rancher any time i said and the cook who was despotic master of his own domain jerked his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the house guess it mightnt be tonight get out and give me a fair show youre blocking up the light  i went on towards the house wondering what he could mean but halted on the threshold of our common room a moment too late we had worked night and day during spring and early summer and the sparelyfurnished room was inches deep in dust guns harness i had no time to mend and wornout garments lay strewn about it save where in a futile attempt to restore order i had hurled a pile of sundries into one corner neither was i in exactly a condition suitable for feminine society and beatrice haldane who had by some means preserved her dainty white dress immaculate leaned back in an oxhide chair regarding me with quiet amusement her father lounged smoking in the window seat and it was his younger daughter who when i was about to retreat came forward and mischievously greeted me  i believe you were ready to run away mr ormesby and you really dont seem as much pleased to see us as you ought to be she said you know you often asked us to visit you so you have brought this surprise party on your own head  i hope you will not suffer for your rashness but you see those men out there they generally leave famine behind them when they come i said  the girl nodded they are splendid i have been talking to them and made one sit still while i drew him please dont trouble about supper i have seen cookie and hes going to make the very things i like  miss haldanes eyebrows came down just a trifle and i grew uneasy wondering whether it was the general state of chaos or my own appearance which had displeased her but haldane laughed heartily before he broke in lucille is all canadian she has not been to europe yet and i am not sure that i shall send her she has examined the whole place already and decided that you must be a very  the girls lips twitched with suppressed merriment but she also reddened a little and i interposed a very busy man was it not now you must give me ten minutes in which to make myself presentable  i was glad to escape and for reasons withdrew sideways in crab fashion while what suspiciously resembled smothered laughter followed me by good luck and after upsetting the contents of two bureaus upon the floor i was able to find garments preserved for an occasional visit to the cities and flinging the window open i hailed a man below to bring me a big pail of water he returned in ten minutes with a very small one and with the irate cook expostulating behind him while i feared his comments would be audible all over the building  cook says the wells playing out and washings foolishness this weather the other pails got dead gophers in it and jardine allows he caught cookie fishing more of them out of the water he used for the tea  fling them out and for heavens sake let me have the thing im getting used to gophers and dead ones cant bite you i said fearing that if the indignant cook got to close quarters the precious fluid might be spilled then while i completed my toilet cotton came in  perhaps i was hardly civil this morning he commenced im out for four days fireguard inspecting and thought id come round and tell you  that you saw the bonaventure wagon heading in this direction i interposed well youre always welcome at gaspards trail and i presume you wont feel tempted to draw the line at my present guests  cotton dropped into my one sound chair i suppose i deserve it ormesby we shall not get such opportunities much longer and one cant help making the most of them he said  we went down together and there was no doubt that the cook had done his best while haldane laughed and his younger daughter looked very demure when as we sat down at table i stared about my room it had lost its bare appearance the thick dust had gone and there was an air of comfort about it i had never noticed before  you see what a womans hand can do lucille couldnt resist the temptation of straightening things for you observed the owner of bonaventure she said the place resembled a  the girl blushed a little and shook her head warningly at her father while as she did so her bright hair caught a shaft of light from the window and shimmered like burnished gold for a moment it struck me that she equaled her sister in beauty and she was wholly bewitching with the mischief shining in her eyes there was however a depth of kindliness beneath the mischief and i had seen the winsome face grow proud with a high courage one night when the snows whirled about bonaventure nevertheless i straightway forgot it when beatrice haldane set to work among the teacups at the head of the table for her presence transfigured the room i had often as i sat there through the bitter winter nights pictured her taking a foremost place in some scene of brightness in london or montreal but never presiding at my poor table or handling my dilapidated crockery with her dainty fingers she did it as she did everything very graciously while to heighten the contrast the lowing of cattle and the hoarse shouts of those who drove them mingled with whipcracks and the groaning of jolting wagons came in through the open windows  for a time the meal progressed satisfactorily haldane was excellent company and i had almost forgotten my fears that some untoward accident might happen when his younger daughter asked what is a gopher mr cotton i have heard of them but never saw one  i projected a foot in his direction under the table regretting i had discarded my working boots and haldane dropping his fork looked up sharply  a little beast between a rat and a squirrel which lives in a hole in the ground there are supposed to be more of them round gaspards trail than anywhere in canada answered the trooper incautiously thats quite correct ormesby you cannot contradict me  i did not answer but grew uneasy seeing that he could not take a hint and the girl continued are they fond of swimming  i dont think so answered cotton with a slightly puzzled air and then added with an infantile attempt at humor for which i longed to choke him im not a natural historian but ormesby ought to know i found him not long ago in a very bad temper fishing dozens of dead ones out of his well perhaps they swam too long and were too tired to climb out you know  lucille haldane who had been thirsty gave a little gasp and laid her hand on the cup cotton would have passed on for replenishing her sister glanced at her with some surprise and then quietly set down her own while i grew hot all over and felt savagely satisfied by the way he winced that this time i had got my heel well down on cottons toe then there was an awkward silence until haldane leaning back in his chair laughed boisterously when the lad attempting to retrieve one blunder committed another  i am afraid there are a good many at bonaventure and it is not ormesbys fault you see it is almost impossible for anybody to keep them out of the wells in dry weather but nobody minds a few gophers in this country  haldane had saved the situation but his elder daughter filled no more teacups and both my fair guests seemed to lose their appetite while i was almost glad when the meal i had longed might last all night was over and lucille and her father went out to inspect the cattle i however detained cotton who was following them with alacrity  your jokes will lead you into trouble some day and its a pity you couldnt have displayed your genius in any other direction i said  you need not get so savage over a trifle he answered apologetically i really didnt mean to upset thingsit was an inspiration no man with any taste could be held responsible for his answers when a girl with eyes like hers crossquestions him you really ought to cultivate a better temper ormesby  i let him go and joined beatrice haldane who had remained behind the rest she did not seem to care about horses and cattle and appeared grateful when i found her a snug restingplace beneath the strawpile granary  you are to be complimented since you have realized at least part of your aspirations she said as she swept a glance round my possessions is it fair to ask are you satisfied withthis  i followed her eyes with a certain thrill of pride wheat land many of the dusty cattle broad stretch of prairie barns and buildings were mine and the sinewy statuesque horsemen who came up across the levels behind further bunches of dappled hide and tossing horns moved at my bidding by physical strain and mental anxiety i had steadily extended the boundaries of gaspards trail and had i been free from lane would in one respect have been almost satisfied then i looked up at my companion whose paletinted draperies and queenly head with its clustering dark locks were outlined against the golden straw and a boldness as well as a great longing came upon me  it is a hard life but a good one i said there is no slackening of anxiety and little time for rest but the result is encouraging when i took hold with a few hundred pounds capital gaspards trail was sodbuilt and its acreage less than half what it is at present but this is only the beginning and i am not content bad seasons do not last forever and in spite of obstacles i hope the extension will continue until it is the largest holding on all this prairie but even that consummation will be valuable only as the means to an end  beatrice haldane looked at me with perfect composure is it all worth while and how long have you been so ambitious she asked with a smile the meaning of which i could not fathom  since a summer spent in england showed me possibilities undreamed of before i said and while it is possible that the vibration in my voice betrayed me the listeners face remained a mask beatrice haldane was already a woman of experience  one might envy your singleness of purpose but there are things which neither success nor money can buy she said probably you have no time to carefully analyze your motives but it is not always wise to take too much for granted even if you secured all you believe prosperity could give you you might be disappointed wiser men have found themselves mistaken rancher ormesby  you are right in the first case i answered but in regard to the other would not the effort be proof enough would any man spend the best years of his life striving for what he did not want  some have spent the whole of it which was perhaps better than having the longer time for disappointment answered the girl with a curious smile but are we not drifting as we have done before into a profitless discussion of subjects neither of us knows much about besides the sun is swinging farther west and the glare hurts my eyes while father and lucille appear interested yonder  beatrice haldane always expressed herself quietly but few men would have ventured to disregard her implied wishes and i took the hint fearing i had already said too much gaspards trail was not yet the finest homestead on the prairie and the time to speak had not arrived when we joined haldane it was a somewhat stirring sight we looked upon a draft of my own cattle came up towards the corral at a run mounted men shouting as they cantered on each flank while one swinging a whip twice raced at a gallop around the mass of tossing horns when the herd would have wheeled and broken away from the fence in a stampede the earth vibrated to the beat of hoofs human yells and a tumultuous bellowing came out of the dust and i sighed with satisfaction when cleverly turned by a rider who would have lost his life had his horses speed or his own nerve failed him the beasts surged pellmell into the enclosure much as i regretted to part with them their sale should set me free of debt  then the flutter of a white dress caught my eye and i saw lucille haldane who it seemed had already pressed the foreman into her service applauding when thorn cleverly roping a beast reined in his horse and jerking it to a standstill held it for her inspection it no doubt pleased him to display his skill but i saw it was with thorn as it had been with the sergeant a privilege to interest the girl she walked close up to the untamed creature which with heaving sides and spume dripping from its nostrils seemed to glare less angrily at her while thorn appeared puzzled as he answered her rapid questions and haldane leaned on the rails with his face curiously tender as he watched her trooper cotton coming up appropriated miss haldane with boyish assurance and her father turned to me  my girl has almost run me off my feet and now that she has taken possession of your foreman i should be content to sit down to a quiet smoke he said will you walk back to the house with me  i could only agree but i stopped on the way to speak to one of the men who had brought in the cattle he was a struggling rancher without enterprise or ability and generally spoken of with semicontemptuous pity im obliged to you redmond for suggesting that you would take my draft along but why didnt you come in and take supper with the rest this sort of banquet strikes me as the reverse of neighborly i said  the man fidgeted as he glanced at the dirty handkerchief containing eatables beside him i figured you had quite enough without me and i dont feel in much humor for company just now he said this season has hit me mighty hard  something more than the season has hit him commented haldane as we proceeded if ever i saw a weak man badly ashamed of himself that was one you cant think of any underhand trick he might have played you lately  no i answered lightly he is a harmless creature and has no possible reason for injuring me  quite sure asked haldane with a glance over his shoulder as we entered the door ive seen men of his kind grow venomous when driven into a corner however its cool and free from dust in here sit down and try this tobacco  haldane was said to be a shrewd judge of his fellowmen but i could see no cause why redmond should cherish a grudge against me and knew he had spoken the truth when he said the seasons had hit him hardly it was currently reported that he was heavily in debt and the stockrider had suggested that lane was pressing him when haldane had lighted a cigar he took a roll of paper off the table and tossed it across to me saying is that your work ormesby  no i never saw it before i answered when a glance showed me that the paper contained a cleverly drawn map of our vicinity and haldane nodded  to tell the truth i hardly expected it was some of your recent visitors must have dropped it and as my daughter found it among the litter during the course of her improvements and asked whether it should be preserved i could not well help seeing what it was look at the thing again and tell me what you conclude from it  that whoever made it had a good eye for the most valuable locations in this district i answered thoughtfully he has also shaded with the same tint part of my possessions in crane valley  exactly and haldane gazed intently into the blue cigar smoke does it strike you that the man who made the map intended to acquire those locations and that considering the possible route of the railway he showed a commendable judgment  it certainly does so now i answered and haldane favored me with a searching glance then when you discover who it is keep your eyes on him and especially beware of giving him any hold on you  i suspected that lane had made the map and it is a pity i did not take haldane into my full confidence but misguided pride forbade it and we smoked in silence until the opportunity was lost for he rose saying no peace for the wicked the girls are returning great heavens i thought the child had broken her neck  while thorn went round by the sliprails a slender whiterobed figure on a big gray horse sailed over the tall fence and came up towards the house at a gallop followed by the startled foreman haldane whose unshakable calm was famous in eastern markets quivered nervously and i felt relieved that there had been no accident for it was a daring leap then while cotton and beatrice haldane followed lucille came in flushed and exultant  we have had a delightful time father and you must leave me in charge of bonaventure when you go east she said but where did you get the ladys saddle mr ormesby  it is not mine i answered smiling it belongs to my neighbors sister sally steel she rode a horse over here for thorn to doctor  i regretted the explanation too late steel was a good neighbor but common report stigmatized his sister as a reckless coquette and by the momentary contraction of beatrice haldanes forehead i feared that she had heard the gossip if this were so however she showed no other sign of it  when a delicious coolness preceded the dusk it was suggested that cotton should sing to us and he did so fingering an old banjo of mine with no mean skill i managed to find a place by beatrice haldanes side and when the pale moon came out and the air had the quality of snowcooled wine her sister sang in turn to the troopers accompaniment i remember only that it was a song free from weak sentimentality with an heroic undertone but it stirred me and a murmur of voices rose from the shadows outside then foreman thorn stood broad hat in hand in the doorway  if it wouldnt be a liberty miss the boys would take it as an honor if you would sing that or something else over again theyve never heard nothing like it even down to winnipeg he said  the girl blushed a little and looked at me they were kind to me do you really think it would please them she asked  if it doesnt they will be abominably ungrateful but although we are not conventional the request strikes me as a liberty i said noticing that her sister did not seem wholly pleased  tell them i will do my best was the answer and after a conference with cotton lucille haldane walked towards the open door there was no trace of vanity or selfconsciousness in her bearing it was pure kindliness which prompted her and when she stood outside the building with the starstrewn vault above her and the prairie silvergray at her feet bareheaded slight and willowy in her thin white dress it seemed small wonder that the dusty men who clustered about the wire fence swung down their broad hats to do her homage  perfect stillness succeeded save for sounds made by the restless cattle then the banjo tinkled and a clear voice rang out through the soft transparency of the summer night all day long the reapers  there was a deep murmur when the last tinkle of the banjo sank into silence a confused hum of thanks and teamster and stockrider melted away and lucille haldane returning glanced almost apologetically at me  i just felt i had to please them she said even if you older people smile i am proud of this great country and it seems to me that these are the men who are making it what it will some day be dont you think that we who live idly in the cities owe a good deal to them  haldane laid his hand caressingly on his daughters arm impulsive as everbut perhaps you are right he said in any case it will be after midnight before we get home and you might ask for our team ormesby  every man about gaspards trail helped to haul up the wagon and harness the spirited team while in spite of cottons efforts thorn insisted on handing my youngest guest into the vehicle and it was with some difficulty i exchanged parting civilities with the rest as the vehicle rolled away amid the stockmens cheers     chapter vi  a holocaust   it was late one sultry night when i sat moodily beside an open window in my house at gaspards trail i had risen before the sun that morning but though tired with a long days ride i felt restless and illdisposed to sleep thomas steel whose homestead stood some leagues away lounged close by with his unlighted pipe on his knee and his coarse sunfaded shirt flung open showing his bronzed neck and the paler color of his ample chest he was about my own age and possessed the frame of a gladiator but there was limp dejection in his attitude  its just awful weather but theres a change at hand he said it will be too late for some of us when it comes  i merely nodded and glanced out through the window thick darkness brooded over the prairie though at intervals a flicker of sheet lightning blazed along the horizon and called up clumps of straggling birches out of the obscurity a fitful breeze which eddied about the building set the grasses sighing but it was without coolness and laden with the smell of burning faroff streaks of crimson shone against the sky in token that grassfires were moving downwind across the prairie they would however so far as we could see hurt nobody steel fidgeted nervously until i began to wonder what was the matter with him and when he thrust his chair backwards i said irritably for heavens sake sit still you look as ill at ease as if you had been told off to murder somebody  the stalwart farmers face darkened i feel most as bad and have been waiting all evening to get the trouble out he said fact is im borrowing money and if you could let me have a few hundred dollars it would mean salvation  i laughed harshly to hide my dismay the prairie settlers stand by one another in time of adversity and in earlier days steel had been a good friend to me but the request was singularly inopportune two bad seasons had followed each other when the whole dominion labored under a commercial depression and though my estate was worth at ordinary values a considerable sum it was only by sacrificing my best stock i could raise money enough to carry it on  if i get anything worth mentioning for the beasts ill do my utmost and by emptying the treasury perhaps i can scrape up two or three hundred now what do you want with it i said  i thought you would help me answered steel with a gasp of relief ive been played for the fool i am i got a nice little book from the  company and it showed how any man with enterprise could get ahead by the aid of borrowed capital then its representativevery affable mancame along and talked considerable i was a bit hard pressed and the end was that he lent me money there were a blame lot of charges and the money seemed to melt away while now if i dont pay up hell foreclose on me  i clenched my right hand viciously for the man who had trapped poor steel had also a hold on me and i began to cherish a growing fear of the genial lane  its getting a common story around here i said that man seems bent on absorbing all this country but if only for that very reason were bound to help each other to beat him it will be a hard pull but though it all depends on what the stock fetch ill do the best i can  steel was profuse in his thanks and i lapsed into a by no means overpleasant reverie so some time passed until a glare of red and yellow showed up against the sky where none had been before  looks like a mighty big fire theres long grass feeding it and it has just rolled over a ridge said steel seems to me somewhere near the indian spring bottom but redmond and the other fellow would drive the stock well clear  flinging my chair back i snatched a small compass from a shelf laid it on the windowledge and kneeling behind it with a knife blade held across the card i took the bearings of the flame its coming right down on the bottom and though by this time the stock is probably well clear im a little uneasy about it well ride over and make quite sure i said  of course steel answered and seemed about to add something but thought better of it and followed me towards the stable thorn who was prompt of action had also seen the fire for he was already busy with the horses and inside of five minutes we were sweeping at a gallop across the prairie save for the intermittent play of lightning the darkness was egyptian and the grass was seamed by hollows and deadly badgerholes but the broad blaze streamed higher for a beacon and risking a broken neck i urged on the mettled beast beneath me grass fires are common and generally are harmless enough in our country but that one seemed unusually fierce and an indefinite dread gained on me as the miles rolled behind us  its the worst ive seen for several seasons whole ridge is blazing panted steel as with a great crackling we swept neck and neck together through the tall grass of a slough in the midst of which thorns horse blundered horribly then we dipped into a ravine reeling down the slope and splashing through caked mire where a little water had been every moment might be precious and turning aside for nothing we rode straight across the prairie while at last i pressed the horse fiercely as a long rise shut out the blaze once we gained its crest the actual conflagration would be visible the horse was white with lather and i was almost blinded with sweat and dust when we gained the summit drawing bridle i caught at my breath the sweetwater ran blood red beneath us and the whole milewide hollow through which it flowed was filled with fire while some distance down stream on the farther side a dusky mass was discernible through the rolling smoke which blew in long wisps in that direction it seemed as though a cold hand had suddenly been laid on my heart for the mass moved and was evidently composed of closepacked and panicstricken beasts  its the gaspard draft held up by the wing fence a voice behind me rose in a breathless yell  i smote the horse and we shot down the declivity how the beast kept its footing i do not know for there were thickets of wild berries and here and there thin willows to be smashed through but we went down at a mad gallop the clods whirling behind us and the wind screaming past until we plunged into the sweetwater through a cloud of spray in places soft mire clogged the sinking hoofs in others slippery shingle rolled beneath them while the stream seethed whitely to the girth but steaming panting dripping we came through and i dashed halfblinded into the smoke a confused bellowing came out of the drifting wreaths ahead and there was a mad beat of hoofs behind but i could see little save the odd shafts of brightness which leaped out of the vapor as i raced towards the fire then somebody cried in warning and the horse reared almost upright aswhile i wrenched upon the bridlea running man staggered out of the smoke a red blaze tossed suddenly aloft behind him and as he turned the brightness smote upon his blackened face it was set and savage and the hair was singed upon his forehead  its blue ruin the green birches are burning and all your beasts are corraled in the fence wings he gasped fire came over the rise without warning in redmonds watch somehow he got the rest clear but your lot stampeded and the wire brought them up im off to the shanty for an axbut no living man could get them out  thorn pulled up his plunging horse as the other spoke and for a few seconds i struggled with the limpness of dismay then i said hoarsely if the flame hasnt lapped the wings yet well try  by this time the horses were almost in a state of panic and thorns nearly unseated him but we urged them into the vapor towards the fence fences were scarce in our district then but after a dispute as to the grazing i had shared the cost of that one with another man partly because it would be useful when sheep washing was forward and would serve as a corral when we cut out shipping stock it consisted of only two wings at right anglesa long one towards the summit of the rise and another parallel to the river which flowed deep beneath that rotten bank but the beasts on each side would seldom leave the rich grass in the hollow to wander round the unclosed end and if driven into the angle two riders could hold the open mouth now i could see that the simple contrivance might prove a veritable deathtrap to every beast within it  it was with difficulty we reached the crest of the rise but we passed the wing before the fire which now broke through the driving vapor a wavy wall of crimson apparently two fathoms high closing in across the full breadth of the hollow at no great pace but with a relentless regularity then i rode fiercely towards the angle or junction of the wires where the beasts were bunched together as in the pocket of a net thorn and steel came up a few seconds later  the outside cattle were circling round and jostling each other thrusting upon those before them the inside of the mass was as compact as if rammed together by hydraulic pressure and to judge by the bellowing those against the fence were being rent by the barbs or slowly crushed to death our cattle wander at large across the prairie and exhibit few characteristics of domestic beasts indeed they are at times almost dangerous to handle and when stampeded in a panic a squadron of cavalry would hardly turn them yet the loss of this draft boded ruin to me and it was just possible that if we could separate one or two animals from the rest and drive them towards the end of the fence the others might follow the mouth of the net might remain open for a few minutes yet  i guess its hopeless but weve just got to try said thorn who understood what was in my mind start in with that big one theres not a second to lose  steel leaning down from the saddle drove his knifepoint into the rump of one beast and when it wheeled i thrust my horse between it and the herd and smote it upon the nostrils with my clenched fist uselessly the terrified creature headed round again jamming me against its companions and when my horse backed clear one of my legs felt as though it were broken this however was no time to trouble about minor injuries or be particular on the score of humanity and while thorn endeavored to effect a diversion by twisting one beasts tail i pricked another savagely it wheeled when it felt the pain and when it turned again with gleaming horns and lowered head steel pushed recklessly into the opening then a thick wisp of smoke filled my eyes and i did not see how it happened but man and horse had gone down together when the vapor thinned and the victorious animal was once more adding its weight to the pressure on the rear of the surging mass  steel was up next moment struggling with his horse which with bared teeth was backing away from him at full length of its bridle but answering my shout he said breathlessly i dont know whether half my bones are cracked or not but they feel very much like it its no good ormesby well have to cut the fence from the other side and if we fool here any longer well lose the horses too  i saw there was truth in this and almost doubted if we could clear the fence wing now it was at least certain that nothing we could do there would extricate the terrified beasts and when steel got himself into the saddle we started again at a gallop there was less smoke and what there was towered vertically in a lull of the breeze but the crackling flame tossed higher and higher for a moment i fancied it had cut us off within the fence which would have made a dangerous leap but though the terrified horses were almost beyond guidance fear lent them speed and with very little room to spare steel and i shot round the end of the wire  look out for the settingup post nearest the corner and slack the turnscrews until the wire goes down while i try to cut the strand close in to the herd i roared is thorn behind you  no the answer came back good lord weve left him inside the fence  i managed to pull my horse up when a glance showed me the foremans stalwart figure silhouetted against the crimson flame as he strove to master his plunging horse it was evident that the horse had refused to face the fire which now rolled right up the wings of the fence  come down and let him go you can either climb the wires or crawl under them i shouted wondering whether the crackling of the flame drowned my husky voice  this horse is worth three hundred dollars and hes either going through or over the answer came back and i shouted in warning for it appeared impossible to clear that fence though the beast which was not of common bronco stock had good imported blood in him then there was a yell from the foreman as he recklessly shot forward straight at the fence the horse was ready to face anything so long as he could keep the fire behind him and i held my breath as he rose at the wire our horses are not good jumpers and the result seemed certain his knees struck the topmost wire there was a heavy crash and the man shooting forward as from a catapult alighted with a sickening thud while the poor brute rolled over and lay still on the wrong side of the fence thorn rose but very shakily and i was thankful i had lost only some three hundred dollars which i could very badly spare  nothing given out this trip he spluttered ive dropped my knife though go on and try the cutting ill follow when i can  in another few moments i dismounted abreast of the angle and hitched the bridle round a strand of the wire knowing that the possibility of getting away almost instantaneously when my work was done might make all the difference between life and death the fence was tall built of stout barbed wire strained to a few screw standards and stapled to thick birch posts i had neither ax nor nippers only a longbladed knife and densely packed beasts were wedging themselves tighter and tighter against the other side of the barrier already some had fallen and been trampled out of existence while others seemed horribly mangled and torn the man who had gone for an ax had not reappeared and i regretted i had not bidden him take one of our horses for the shanty was some distance away  slashing through the laces i dragged off one boot its heel was heavy and might serve for a mallet and holding the blade of my knife on the top strand close against a post i smote it furiously the wire was not nicked half through when it burst beneath the pressure and a barb on its flying end scored my face so that the blood trickled into my mouth and eyes but the next wire was of treble twist and as i struck and choked i regretted the thoroughness with which we had built the fence the knife chipped under the blows i rained upon it and when i shortened the blade its end snapped off in a fit of desperation i seized the lacerating wires with my naked fingers and tore at them frenziedly but what the pressure on the other side failed to accomplish the strength of twenty men might not do so when in a few seconds reason returned to me i picked up what remained of the knife and set to work again there was still no sign of thorn and as the wires did not slacken it was plain that steel had failed to loose the straining screws without convenient tools three slender cords of steel alone pent in the stock that were to set me free of debt but i had no implements with which to break them so they also held me fast to be dragged down helpless to beggary  at last the wire i struck at bent outward further and when i next brought the boot heel down there was a metallic ringing as one strand parted and i shouted in breathless triumph knowing the other must follow the fire was close behind the pentup herd now and i guessed that very shortly my life would depend on my horses speed just then steel dashed up mounted shouting into the saddle with you the fence is going  i saw him unhitch my horses bridle and struggle to hold the beast ready between himself and me but i meant to make quite certain of my part so i brought the boot heel down thrice again then i leaped backward clutched at the bridle and scrambled to the saddle as a black mass rolled out of the gap where the wire flew back i remember desperately endeavoring to head the horse clear of it along the fence and wondering how many of the cattle would fall over the remaining wires and be crushed before their carcasses formed a causeway for the rest but the horse was past all guidance and now that the fence had lost its continuity more fathoms of it went down and the dusky mass poured over it then something struck me with a heavy shock the horse stumbled as i slipped my feet out of the stirrups and we went down together i saw nothing further though i could feel the earth tremble beneath me then this sensation faded and i was conscious of only a numbing pain beneath my neck and my left arm causing me agony after this there followed a space of empty blackness  when i partly recovered my faculties the pain was less intense though my left arm which was tied to my side felt hot and heavy and the jolting motion convinced me that i lay in the bottom of a wagon  did you get the stock clear i gasped striving to raise my head from the hay truss in which it was almost buried and somebody who stooped down held a bottle to my lips  dont you tell him a subdued voice said and the man who i think was steel came near choking me as he poured more spirit than i could swallow down my throat and also down my neck  thats all right dont worry were mighty thankful we got you he said  then the empty blackness closed in on me again and i lay still wondering whether i were dead and buried and if so why the pricking between shoulder and breast should continue so pitilessly until that ceased in turn and i had a hazy idea that someone was carrying me through an interminable cavern after which there succeeded complete oblivion     chapter vii  a bitter awakening   the first day on which my attendants would treat me as a rational being was a memorable one to me it must have been late in the morning when i opened my eyes for the sun had risen above the level of the open window and i lay still blinking out across the prairie with at first a curious satisfaction i had cheated death and been called back out of the darkness to sunlight and life it seemed then i began to remember and the pain in the arm bound fast to my side helped to remind me that life implied a struggle raising my head i noticed that there had been changes made in my room and a young woman standing by the window frowned at me  i guess all men are worrying but youre about the worst i ever struck rancher ormesby just you lie back till i fix you or ill call the boys in to tie you fast with a girth  she was a tall fair wellfavored damsel with a ruddy countenance and somewhat bold eyes but i was disappointed when i saw her clearly even though her laugh was heartsome when i answered humbly i will try not to trouble you if you dont mean to starve me  miss sally steel for it was my neighbors sister shouted to somebody through the window and then turned to the man who rose from a corner you just stay right where you are when i call cookie ill see he comes ive been running this place as it ought to be run and you wont know gaspards when you get about rancher ormesby  the man laughed and i saw it was thorn though i did not know then that after doing my work and his own during the day he had watched the greater part of every night beside me  feeling pretty fit this morning he asked  comparatively so i answered i should feel better if i knew just what happened to me and to the stock you might tell me beginning from the time the fence went down  if he does therell be trouble broke in miss steel who i soon discovered had constituted herself autocratic mistress of gaspards trail he must wait until you have had breakfast anyway and i saw the cook stroll very leisurely towards the window carrying a tray  was anybody calling he commenced with the exasperating slowness he could at times assume and then catching sight of me would have clambered in over the low windowsill but that miss steel stopped him  anybody calling i should think there wasand when i want people theyll come right along she said no you can stop out thereisnt all the prairie big enough for you therell be some tone about this place before im through and the cook grinned broadly as he caught my eye  miss steels voice was not unpleasant though it had a strident ring and her face was gentle as she raised me on a heap of folded blankets with no great effort though i was never a very light weight after which between my desire to please her and a returning appetite i made a creditable meal  thats a long way better she said approvingly tom brought a fool doctor over from calgary who said youd got your brain mixed and a concussion of the head fix up his bones and dont worry about anything else i said it would take a steam hammer to make any concussion worth talking of on rancher ormesbys head  thorn has not answered my question i interrupted and miss steel flashed a glance at the foreman who seemed to hesitate before he answered it happened this way you were a trifle late lighting out when youd cut the fence steel said one of the beasts charged you and after that more of them stampeded right over you the horse must have kept some of them off for he was stamped out pretty flat and it was a relief to hear you growling at something when we got you out  how did you get me out i asked and thorn fidgeted before he answered it wasnt worth mentioning but between us steel and i managed to split the rush and the beasts went by on each side of us  at the risk of being stamped flat too i might have expected it of you and steel i said and the girls eyes sparkled as she turned to the foreman  then steel went back for the wagon after we found you had an arm and a collarbone broken i rode in to the railroad and wired for a doctor sally came over to nurse you and a pretty tough time she has had of it you had fever mighty bad  theres no use in saying im obliged to both of you because you know it well i made shift to answer and sally steel stroked the hair back from my forehead in sisterly fashion as she smiled at thorn but what about the stock did they all get through  thorns honest face clouded and sally steel laid her plump hand on my mouth youre not going to worry about that a herd of cattle stampeded over you and youre still alive isnt that good enough for you  i moved my head aside i shall worry until i know the truth all the beasts could not have got out how many did i asked  thorn looked at sally then sideways at me and i held my breath until the girl said softly you had better tell him  very few said the foreman and i hoped that my face was as expressionless as i tried to make it when i heard the count some of those near the fence got clear and some didnt steel had grubbed up a post and when the wires slacked part of the rest got tangled up and went down choking the gap it was worse than a chicago slaughterhouse when the fire rolled up  the horses too how long have i been ill and has any rain fallen i asked with the strange steadiness that sometimes follows a crushing blow and thorn moodily shook his head  both horses done for youve been ill bout two weeks i think no rain worth mentioningand the crop is clean wiped out  there was silence for some minutes and sally steel patted my uninjured shoulder sympathetically then i pointed to a litter of papers on the table and inquired if there were any letters in lanes writing thorn handed me one reluctantly and it was hard to refrain from fierce exclamation as i read the laconic missive lane regretted to hear of my accident but the scarcity of money rendered it necessary to advise me that as i had not formally accepted his terms repayment of the loan was overdue and he would be obliged to realize unless i were willing to pledge crane valley or renew the arrangement at an extra five per cent on the terms last mentioned  bad news said sally then i guess thorn shant worry you any more but its just when things look worst the turn comes that team will be bolting soon thorn ill sit right back in the corner and until you want to talk to me you can forget im there  the highpitched voice sank to a gentler tone and i felt grateful to sally steel her reckless vagaries often formed a theme for laughter when the inhabitants of the prairie foregathered at settlement or store but there was a depth of goodnature as well as an overdaring love of mischief in her and not infrequently a blessing accompanied the jest thorn was moving towards the door when recollecting another point i beckoned him  how was it that when they had or should have had time enough hendersons man and redmond did not stop the cattle bunching in the fence its very unlike our ways if they made no effort to save my beasts as well as their own masters property i said  foreman thorn looked troubled and i saw that sally was watching him keenly i dont understand it rightly and i guess no man ever will he said of course we struck hendersons jo with just that question and this is what he made of it he and redmond were camping in torkills deserted sodhouse and when they saw the fires were bad that night redmond said hed ride round the cattle their own lot was pretty well out of harms way east of the fence but jo told him to take a look at yours redmond started and as jo knew that hed be called if he were wanted he went off to sleep  that does not explain much i interjected when thorn halted rubbing his head as though in search of inspiration  there isnt an explanation jo waking later saw the fire coming right down the hollow and started on foot for the fence there was no sign of redmond anywhere jo couldnt get the stock out and he couldnt cut the fence and he was going back for an ax when we met him you know all the restcept this steel and i were standing over you and the fire was roasting the beasts mixed up in the fence when redmond comes along the way he stood the flame shone right on his face it seemed twisted and the man looked like a ghost he stood there blinking at the beastsand it wasnt a pretty sightthen shook all over as he stooped down and looked at you there was a good deal of blood about you from the horse  what the devils wrong with you stiffen yourself up says steel and redmonds voice cracked in the middle as he answered him im feeling mighty sick is he dead  looks pretty near it if youd seen those beasts clear he mightnt have come to this here take a drink well want you presently says steel and went on strapping you together with a girth and bridle while i watched redmond with one eye as you know there was never much grit in the creature and he had another shivering fit  get out until youre feeling better that kind of things catching and weve lots to do i said and he laughs with a cackle like an hysterical woman and blinks straight past me steel and i figured hed got hold of some smuggled whisky and been drinking bad but afterwards hendersons jo said no  its murder my god its horriblean he never done anyone no harm he says and falls to cussing somebody quietly i can talk pretty straight when im hot myself but that was icecold swearing with venom in it and when he got on to judas with the devil in his eyes i ripped up a big sod and plugged him on the head with it  if you dont let up or quit ill pound the life out of you says steel  well we got you fixed so you couldnt make the damage worse and when steel went for the wagon and i looked around for redmond he was gone dont know what to think of it anyway cept his troubles or bad whisky had turned his head you see he was never far from crazy  why didnt one of you get hold of him and make him talk next day i asked and thorn looked at me curiously  because hed gone lit out to nobody knows where and stopped there i dont know just what to think myself  sally took thorn by the shoulders and thrust him out but he left me with sufficient and unpleasant food for reflection the stock i had counted on were gone also when it was above all things desirable that i should be up and doing i must lie still for weeks useless as a log one thing at least i saw clearly and that was the usurers purpose to absorb my property and as i lay with throbbing forehead and tightclenched fingers which had grown strangely white i determined that he should have cause to remember the struggle before he accomplished it that redmond had been driven by him into shameful treachery appeared too probable though there was no definite proof of it and the thought stiffened my resolution my scattered neighbors patient as they were were ill to coerce and would doubtless join me in an effort before the schemers machinations left us homeless  then i could hardly check a groan as i remembered all that the brief glimpses of a brighter life at bonaventure had suggested a few months earlier it had appeared possible that with one or two more good seasons i might even have attained to it but since then a gulf had opened between beatrice haldane and me and the best i could hope for was a resumption of what now seemed hopeless drudgery it was a bitter awakening and i almost regretted that steel and foreman thorn had not been a few seconds later when the fence went down an hour passed and sally steel bringing a chair over to my side offered to read to me what she said was a real smart shadowing story i glanced at the invincible detective standing amid a scene of bloodshed depicted on the cover of the journal she held up and declined with due civility  i am afraid my nerves are not good enough i should sooner you talked to me sally i said  she laughed coquettishly and there was no doubt that steels sister was handsome as women on that part of the prairie go sun and wind had ripened the color in her face her teeth were white as ivory her lips full and red and perhaps most men would have found pleasure watching the sparkle of mischief that danced in her eyes as she answered demurely that would be just too nice what shall we talk about  you might tell me who was the first to come ask about me i said  the girl stretched out one plump arm with a comprehensive gesture they all came bringing things along most of them even the little icelander he loaded up his wagon with a keg of herringssaid they were best rawand lumps of grindstone bread oh yes they all came and i was glad to see them cept when some of their wives came with them  they are kind people in this country but how could the women worry you in any case i think you would be equal to them i commented and somewhat to my surprise the girl first blushed and then looked positively wicked  theywell they would ask questions and said things when they found tom was down to brandon she answered enigmatically still i guess i was equal to most of them rancher ormesbys not sending the hat round yet and that truck is not fit for any sick man to eat when its just about halfcooked i said you can either take it back or leave it for thorn to worry with fresh rocks wouldnt hurt his digestion just now im way too busy to answer conundrums  sally seemed glad to abandon that topic and did not look quite pleased when i hazarded another question with suppressed interest but as carelessly as i could did anybody else drive over  the girl laughed a trifle maliciously and yet with a certain enjoyment oh yes one day when i was too busy for anything the people from bonaventure drove over and wanted to take you back i dont know why but the way haldanes elder daughter looked about the place just got my back up you cant have him this is where he belongs i said  but he is ill and this place is hardly fit for him there are no comforts and we could take better care of him said the younger one and i turned round to her  thats just where youre wrong rancher ormesby has lived here for eight years and when hes sick he has plenty friends of his own kind to take care of him im one of them and we dont dump our sick people on to strangers i said  the elder one she straightens herself a little as though she didnt like my talk he could not be as comfortable as he would be at bonaventure which is the most important thing we will ask the doctor and have you any right to place obstacles in the way of mr ormesbys recovery says she and that was enough for me  ive all the right i want i answered im running gaspards trail and if you can find a man about the place who wont jump when i want him you neednt believe me that makes me a busy womanseeso ill not keep you go back to bonaventure and dont come worrying the people he belongs to about rancher ormesby  i groaned inwardly and only by an effort concealed my blank consternation what did they say next i asked  nothing much the younger oneand i was half sorry id spoken straight to heropened her eyes wide the elder one she looks at me in a way that made me feel fit to choke her while haldane made a little bow i have no doubt he is in capable hands and we need not trouble you further no i dont think you need mention that we called says he  sally tossed her head with an air of triumph as she concluded and i lay very still for it was too late to pray for deliverance from my friends though of all the rude succession this was about the most cruel blow what mischievous fiend had prompted the quicktempered girl to turn upon the haldanes i could never surmise but jealousy might have had something to do with it for trooper cotton had once been a favorite of hers in any case the result appeared disastrous for while i believed her no more than thoughtless there was no disguising the fact that some of the settlers lessfavored daughters spoke evil of sally steel and i feared their stories had reached bonaventure  when five minutes or so had passed she looked at me somewhat shyly youre not mad she said  i could hardly be vexed with you whatever happened after all you have done for me i was only thinking i made shift to answer still you might have been a little more civil sally  for a moment or two the girl appeared almost penitent then she bent her head towards my own and again the mischief crept into her eyes  id have brought them in to a banquet if i had only guessed she said and with a thrill of laughter she slipped out of the room it was with sincere relief i saw her go for i was in no mood for the somewhat pointed prairie banter and felt that in spite of her manifold kindnesses i could almost have shaken sally steel then i turned my head from the light remembering i was not only a ruined man without even power to move but had left a discordant memory with the friends whose good opinion i most valued and whom now i might never again meet on the old terms     chapter viii  how redmond came home   the weather continued pitilessly hot and dry when one afternoon trooper cotton returning from a tour of fireguard inspection sat near the windowseat in which i lay at gaspards trail i was glad of his company because the sight of the parched prairie and bare strip of plowland was depressing barns and granary alike were empty for the earth had failed to redeem her promise that season and an unnatural silence brooded over gaspards trail  i dont know what has come over this country the trooper said one used to get a cheery word everywhere but now farmer and stockman can hardly answer a question civilly and the last fellow i spoke to about his fireguards seemed inclined to assault me presumably its the bad times and ill be thankful when they improve it might put some of you into a more pleasant humor  if you had said bad men you might have been nearer the mark i answered dryly we are a peaceable people but theres an oppression worse than any governmental tyranny and from the rumors in the air its not impossible some of us may try to find our own remedy if we are pushed too far  thats a little indefinite said cotton with a laugh if you mean taking the law into your own hands there would be very unpleasant work for me still im sorry for all of you especially those whom that flabby scoundrel lane seems to be squeezing hes been driving to and from the railroad a good deal of late and its curious that twice when i struck his trail two traveling photographers turned up soon after him one was a most amusing rascal but i did not see the other who was busy inside the wagon tent and who apparently managed the camera ill show you a really tolerable picture of me he insisted on taking  it struck me that boone or adams had twice run a serious risk but i said nothing and cotton fumbling inside his tunic tossed a litter of papers on the table these were mostly official but there were odd letters among them for the trooper was not remarkable for preciseness and i noticed a crest upon some of the envelopes while after shuffling them he flung me a small card back uppermost i was surprised when turning it over the face of lucille haldane met my gaze  it is a charming picture but that is only natural considering the original how did you get this cotton i said  the trooper snatched it from me and a darker color mantled his forehead confound it i never meant to show you that he said  so i surmised i answered dryly and the lad frowned as he thrust the picture out of sight  you will understand ormesby that miss haldane did not give me this iwelli discovered it  wasnt it foolish of you i asked quietly and the trooper who strange to say did not seem to find my tone of paternal admonition ludicrous answered impulsively i dont know why i should strip for your inspection ormesby or why i should not favor you with a wellknown reply but it is perhaps best that you should not misunderstand the position i know what you are thinking but i havent forgotten im trooper cottonnor am i likely to its a strange life ormesby and the men who live it go under occasionally thisgod bless heris merely something to hold on by  i made no answer for there was nothing appropriate i could find to say but it occurred to me that lucille haldane might never receive a higher compliment than this lads unexpectant homage  here is the right one and you will obliterate the other from your memory he said passing me a second photograph the fellow who took it knows how to handle a camera  it was evident he did and knowing who he was the irony of the circumstances impressed me as i examined the picture he has an artistic taste and an eye for an effective pose are you going to send any copies to your people in england cotton i said  no answered the lad quietly they might not be pleased with it well i dare say you have guessed long ago that i am one of the legion most of my people were soldiers which was why when i had two dollars left i offered the nation my services at regina but i am the first of them to wear a police privates uniform  i nodded sympathetically and the trooper who looked away from me out of the window said talk of the devil all men it is said are equal in this country but i fancy theres a grade between most of us and your acquaintance foster lane the fellow has passed the corral and i cant get out without meeting him  i nodded with a certain grim sense of anticipation for i had determined to speak very plainly to foster lane and knew that cotton could on occasion display a refined insolence that was signally exasperating the next moment lane came in redfaced and perspiring and greeted me with his usual affability  im on the way to recovery but unable to ride far which explains my request for a visit i said and lane waved his large hands deprecatingly  business is business and you need not apologize because although i have come two hundred miles you will find firstclass expenses charged for in the bill i cant smoke on horseback will you and the trooper try one of these  no thanks said cotton with an inflection in his voice and a look in his halfclosed eyes that would have warned a more sensitive person but lane still holding out the cigarcase added with mild surprise by the price i paid for them they ought to be good  i dont doubt it drawled cotton glancing languidly at the speaker but a few of what you would call british prejudices still cling to me and i take cigars and things only from my friendsyou see  the stout man laughed a little though there was malice in his eye and we are not likely to be acquainted you are one might presume a scion of the english aristocracy come out to recruit your health or wait until its a little less sultry in the old country  i would hardly go so farand cotton drawled out the words as he turned upon his heel more unlikely things have happened at present i have the honor of serving her majesty asa police trooper  lane handed me his cigarcase when the lad strolled out of the door but i was in no mood to assume an unfelt cordiality i am not inclined for smoking hadnt we better come straight to business i said  lane struck a match and stretched his legs along the windowseat though he closed the case with a snap why certainly you are ready to redeem the mortgage on gaspards trail  he spoke pleasantly though there was a sneer in his eyes and he had both lighted his cigar in spite of my hint and laid his dusty boots on the cushions with a cool assurance that made me long to personally chastise him you probably know that i am not i said  i did hear you had lost some cattle he answered indifferently well in that case i wait your proposition  i am open to renew the loan at the original interest until this time next year when no matter what i may have to part with it will be paid off you have already had a very fair return on your money i said  it cant be done and lane looked thoughtfully at his cigar ill carry you on that long at double interest or make you a bid outright for crane valley  there is no reason in your first offer you asked only fifty per cent increase last time which was enough in all conscience what do you want with crane valley  lane smiled benignly you didnt accept that offer formally crane valleys a pretty location and ive taken a fancy to it  i took time to answer and set my brain to work the advantage lay with the enemy but while it appeared certain that he would dispossess me of gaspards trail i determined to hold on to crane valley you cant have it and i will not pay the extortionate interest that i think is plain enough i said  the financier shrugged his shoulders i hope you wont be sorry i havent quite decided on my program but you will hear what it is when im ready have you got your own fixed  i will have soon i answered my indignation gaining the mastery there is no advantage to be gained by further circumlocution and you may as well know that i will give you as much trouble as possible before you plunder me in the first place if we find redmond i shall try to strike you for conspiracy  do you know where redmond is and there was a curious note in the speakers voice though i stolidly refrained from any sign of either negation or assent neither do i but i have my suspicions that he wont be much use to you if you do find him the man is halfcrazy anyway did you ever hear about the fool bullfrog and the ox rancher ormesby  he leaned back against the logs and chuckled so complacently at his own conceit that it was hard to believe this easytempered creature was draining half my neighbors blood but i was filled with a great loathing for him  your simile isnt a good one even if it fits the case an ox is a hardworking honest and useful kind of beast but theres no use bandying words i said  just so and lane rose lazily its rather a pity you sent for me because you have not had much for your money being rather pressed just now i wont stay  i had no intention of requesting him to do so for the air seemed clearer without him and presently cotton returned for the first time i told him all my suspicions concerning redmond and he looked grave as he listened it would have saved some people sorrow if i could only have run that horseleach in he commented gazing regretfully after the diminishing figure of the rider yes its curious about redmond lane was over at his place a little while before your accident and i believe afterwards as well and since then nobody has seen redmond ill have a talk with mackay and put some of our men on his trail if hes still on top of the prairie theyll find him  cotton rode away and late that evening steel returned from his own holding with a very grim face while the eyes of his sister were suspiciously red  im to be sold up and am turned out now he said lane who wont wait any longer is foreclosing and hell fix things so there will be no balance left god knows whats to become of sally and me  you need not trouble about sally the girl said with a flash in her eyes well worry along somehow and well live to see that devil sorry  practical counsel seemed the best sympathy and after asking a few questions i said this is going to be a grainproducing country and there are plenty acres ready for breaking and horses idle at crane valley when lane seizes gaspards trail as he probably will we must see what can be done with them on the share arrangement and meantime since i paid two hired men off there is plenty for you to do here helping me  steel eventually agreed and as soon as i was fit for the saddle i rode over to mackays quarters but though he stated that if redmond were anywhere in the territories he would sooner or later be found nothing had so far resulted from his inquiries  it was some weeks later and towards the close of a sultry afternoon when i rode homewards with cotton and steel towards the sweetwater we had much thunder that season and though there had been a heavy storm the night before a stagnant oppressive atmosphere still hung over the prairie it suited the somber mood of two of the party while even cotton seemed unusually subdued  steels possessions had been sold off that day and bought up at ridiculously inadequate prices by two strangers who we all suspected had been financed by lane few of us had a dollar to spare and the auctioneer who was also probably under the moneylenders thumb demanded proof of ability to make the purchase when one or two neighbors attempted to force up the bidding steel rode with slack bridle and his head bent and i was heavy of heart for i held gaspards trail only on sufferance and the same fate must soon overtake me the prairie stretched before us a desolate waste fading on the horizon into gray obscurity and together with the gloom of the heavens above its forlorn aspect increased my depression so we came moodily to the dip to the sweetwater and i saw mackay standing beside a deeper pool below a rapid flowed into the head of it and the lines of froth shone with a strange lividness the time was then perhaps an hour before sunset when we dismounted to water and rest the horses mackay turned sharply and glanced at cotton  all went off quietly and the trooper nodded  yes i said we have a long patience sergeant but there were signs on some of the faces that things may go differently some day  ay said the sergeant fixing his keen eyes on me as he stood a lean bronzeskinned statue beside the river what were ye meaning rancher ormesby  i was merely giving you a hint i said we have paid all demanded from us and kept the law but now when the powers that rule us stand by and watch us ground out of existence to enrich a few unprincipled schemers it is hard to say what might not happen  ye did well was the dry answer it will be my business to see ye keep it still but in this country any man has liberty to talk just as foolishly as it pleases him can the law change the seasons for ye or protect the careless from their own improvidence but let be im older than most o ye and have seen that theres a measure set on oppression  he concluded with a curious assurance which approached solemnity but steel added with a western expletive that he had already let be until he was ruined then i broke in if i can find redmond and wring the truth from him i hope to prove that the limit has been reached and i purpose in the first place to see what the law will do for me have you any word of him  no and the sergeants tone was very significant if he were still above the prairiesod we should have found him but there was a bit freshet last nightand i am expecting him  steel i fancied shivered and though the speaker might well be mistaken anything that served to divert our thoughts was a relief and for a while we lay among the grasses smoking silently the sky was heavily overcast there was no breath of air astir and the slow gurgle of the river drifted mournfully down the hollow for some reason i felt strangely restless and expectant as though something unusual would shortly happen a faint drumming of hoofs rose up from somewhere far off across the prairie as well as a sound which might have been made by an approaching wagon  thats lane striking south for the railroad with a few of the boys behind him steel said listlessly therell be thunder before he reaches it and lardeaus team is wild but theres no use hoping theyll bolt and break lanes neck for him accidents do not happen to that kind of man  a little time had passed and the beat of horses feet broke in a rhythmic measure through the heavy stillness when cotton who had followed his sergeant along the bank raised a shout and i leaped to my feet for something that circled with the current was drifting down stream we ran our hardest and for i was not strong yet the others were standing very silent with tense faces and staring eyes when i rejoined them  yons redmond said sergeant mackay i was expecting him  the object he pointed to slid slowly by abreast of us and i felt a shock of physical nausea as i stared at it at that distance it was without human semblance a mere shapeless mass of sodden clothing save for the faint white glimmer of a face but the shock gave place to a fit of sullen fury heaven knows i cherished no anger against the unfortunate man indeed from the beginning i had regarded him as a mere helpless tool but death had robbed me of my only weapon and i remembered lanes prediction that redmond would be of little use to me if i found him  if one of ye has a lariat ye had better bring it said sergeant mackay  we followed the object down stream it floated slowly now halfsubmerged now rising more buoyantly with the blanched countenance turned towards the murky heavens out of which the light was fading until steel poising himself upon the bank deftly flung a coupled lariat the noose upon its end took hold and i shrank backwards when we drew what it held ashore for redmonds face was ill to look upon and seemed to mock me with its staring eyes  stan clear said the sergeant perhaps feeling speech of any kind would be a relief for nobody showed the least desire to crowd upon him if it had not been for the regulations a drop of whisky would have been acceptable seeing that its my painful duty to find out how he came by his end  the words were excusable but there was no whisky forthcoming and though perhaps only one man in a hundred would have undertaken that gruesome task the sergeant went through it with the grim thoroughness which characterized all his actions  theres no sign of a blow or bullet that i can find and im thinking only the almighty knows whether he drowned himself or it was accidental death ye can identify him all of ye  we thought we could but had been so intent that nobody noticed the trampling of horses hoofs until a wagon was drawn up close by and several riders reined in their beasts  heres a man who ought to said steel come down and swear to your partner lane  turning i saw my enemy start as he looked over the side of the wagon at what lay before him every eye was fixed upon him and steel stood quietly determined by the wheel  im in a hurry and dont fill the post of coroner the former said  will you come down steel added and there was a low growl from the assembly while lane shrank back from that side of the vehicle i guess its certain this man was the last to see redmond alive  drive on said lane to the teamster but the man hesitated while when his employer snatched up the reins there was another murmur deeper than before and mounted men closed about the wagon their figures cutting blackly against the fading light why they were journeying homewards in such company i did not learn but overtaking it they had perhaps ridden beside the wagon for the purpose of expressing their frank opinion of its occupant  ye cannot pass until ye have answered my questions said sergeant mackay if he does not dismount ye have authority to help him steel ye will hold the horses trooper cotton  lane slowly climbed down the wheel and neither mackay nor cotton interfered when as he showed signs of remaining at the foot of it steels hand closed firmly on his neck and forced him forwards apparently much against his wishes then the ruined farmer held him protesting savagely beside the body of his victim it was in its own way an impressive scenethe erect soldierly figures of the uniformed troopers the circle of silent mounted men who moved only to sooth their uneasy horses and the whitefaced man who shivered visibly as he looked down at the sodden heap at his feet there was also even had the two been strangers ample excuse for him  while protesting that this is an outrage i am ready to answer your questions he said huskily  who is this man did ye know him asked the sergeant whose face remained woodenly impassive  rancher redmond by his clothing was the answer yes if necessary i think i could swear to him and the sergeant asked again when and where did ye last see him  in the birch coulée at dusk three weeks past tuesday that would make it but the financier seemed unable to work out the simple sum and concluded you can figure the date for yourself  what business had ye with him and the sergeant smiled dryly at the answer that does not concern you  maybe no if ye have good reasons for not telling i will not press ye though ye may be called upon to speak plainly do ye know how he came into the river  no said lane a trifle too vehemently  do ye know of any reason why he should have drowned himself and lane turned upon the questioner savagely  ill make you all suffer for your inference why should i know i challenge the right of anyone but a coroner to detain me  ill let ye see my authority at the station if i find it necessary to take ye there said the sergeant grimly noo will ye answer do ye know why this man ye had dealings with should wish to destroy himself  youre presuming a good deal was the answer and lanes face grew malevolent as he glanced at steel and me how do you know he did destroy himself anyway and if he did i guess its an open secret he had trouble with ormesby and steel  i sprang forward but cotton laid a heavy hand on my shoulder and there was a threatening ejaculation from one of the bystanders well to satisfy you i solemnly declare i am in no way connected with what has befallen the deceased rancher and know of no reason why he should have attempted his life this isnt a court but because im in a hurry and to stop chattering tongues i call heaven to witness it is the truth  i believed that after a villainous attempt to divert suspicion to me the man was deliberately perjuring himself and several of the bystanders must have believed it too most of them were not wholly free from superstition and their faces were almost expectant as they stood strung up and intent about the dead man under the deepening gloom then a flicker of pale lightning filled the hollow each face was lit up for a second and lanes was livid and when the flash faded the dusk seemed to deepen suddenly and a boom of distant thunder rolled from swelling level to level across the prairie thunder had been very frequent during the last few weeks but the listeners seemed to find the coincidence significant  ye can pass said the sergeant whose voice seemed a trifle unsteady but it will be on horseback and we may want ye later lardeauits a charityye will lend redmond the wagon  you cant have it said lane i have a long journey before me and a rheumatic thigh if you take the wagon i hired what am i to do  you can ride with redmond his house is on your way and you cant hurt him anyway the poor devils beyond you now said a stern voice and lane who allowed the teamster to help him onto one of the horses which was replaced departed hurriedly  i congratulate ye said sergeant mackay significantly he was a fellowcreature boys wholl help me lift him in we will een need the same service ourselves some day  i shuddered but took my place with steel among the rest and when the task was accomplished the latter expressed both our feelings as he said i wouldnt for five hundred dollars do that again but it seemed the poor devils due after what we said about him i guess he wasnt quite responsible and was driven to it but when it comes to the reckoning god help the man who drove him  it was dark when we gained the level and followed the creaking wagon that jolted before us across the prairie few words were spoken a low rumbling of thunder rolled across the great emptiness while now and then a pale blue flash fell athwart the lathered horses and set faces of the men the beasts said one big farmer know considerably more than they can tell look at the near one sweating i guess they find redmond or the load hes carrying mighty heavy  then added another voice which broke harshly through the thuds of hoofs ten teams wouldnt move the man who rode away  the ways of the prairie dwellers are in some respects modern and crudely new but the highland servants of the hudsons bay company and the french halfbreed voyageur have between them left us a dowry of quaint belief and superstition and the growl of the thunder and the black darkness made a due impression on most of those who brought redmond home for my part i was thankful when a lonely loghouse loomed up ahead and the wagon came to a standstill four men improvising a stretcher took up their burden and halted as sergeant mackay and another neither of whom seemed to care about his errand knocked on the door  a young woman opened it holding aloft a lamp and under its uncertain light her face showed drawn and pale i breathed harder and heard some of those about me murmur compassionately for she looked very frail and young to bear what must follow the sergeants words did not reach us but a swift glare of blue flame that left us dazzled broke in upon them the whole space about the building was flooded with temporary brilliancy and redmonds daughter must have seen us standing about the wagon and the bearers waiting for she dropped the lantern which mackay seized in time and caught at the logs which framed the door as if for support a minute must have passed before the slight form once more stood erect upon the threshold  mackay thinks of everything steel said in my ear he sent gordon off to bring his wife along theres only the halfbreed here and shell need a white woman with her tonight poor soul  bring him in said a low voice and before the sergeant could prevent her the speaker snatching up the lantern moved forward to meet the bearers it was no sight for young eyes and i saw steel shudder but there was wild erse blood in the girl and holding one arm up she stood erect facing us again  this was my father and he was a kind man to me she said with a choking gasp that was not a sob and from which her voice broke high and shrill for the sake of a few acres and cattle he was driven to his death and may black sorrow follow the man who ruined him sorrow and bitterness with the fear that will drive sleep from him and waste him blood and bone until he takes the curse of the widow and orphan with him into the flame of hell  then the eerie voice sank again and it was with a strange dignity she concluded i thank you neighbors you can bring him in  another paler flash lit up the prairie as they carried redmond in and when a wagon came bouncing up to the fence steel said heres mrs gordon they have lost no time are you coming back ormesby ive had about enough of this  i had no wish to linger and when we rode homewards through the deluge that now thrashed our faces the sergeant who overtook us said man i feel creepy shes no quite canny and yon was awesome  it was impressive but you cant attach much importance to that poor girls halfdistracted raving i said partly to convince myself  maybe no said sergeant mackay superstition ye say but im thinking theres a judgment here as well as hereafter and id no care to carry yon curse about with me     chapter ix  a prairie study   so redmond came home and we buried him the following night by torchlight on a desolate ridge of the prairie it was his daughter who ordered this and if some of those who held aloft the flaming tow guessed his secret they kept it for the sake of the girl who stood with a stony tearless face beside the open grave he had doubtless yielded to strong compulsion when driven into a corner from which for one of his nature there was no escape and now that he was dead i had transferred my score against him to the debit of the usurer as we rode home after the funeral i said something of the kind to steel who agreed with me  if you concluded to try it thorn and jo and i taking our affidavits as to what we saw that night might make out a case for you but i dont know that we could fix it on lane and it strikes me as mean to drag a dead man into the fuss for nothing he said redmond has gone to a place where he cant testify but he has left his daughter and she already has about all she can stand  strikes me that way too and lanes too smart to be corraled added thorn  well get even somehow without redmond and to that end you two will have to run gaspards trail i said im going down to montreal with carolans cattle  a project had for some little time been shaping itself in my mind i had a small reversionary interest in some english property and though it would be long before a penny of it could accrue to me it seemed just possible to raise a little money on it considering western rates of interest nobody in winnipeg would trouble with such an investment but i had a distant and prosperous kinsman in montreal who might find some speculator willing montreal was however at least two thousand miles away and traveling expensive but the carolan brothers had promptly accepted my offer to take charge of their cattle destined for europe which implied free passes both ways it was not the mode of traveling one would have expected a prosperous rancher to adopt but i needed every available dollar for the approaching struggle and was well content when after the untamed stock had nearly wrecked the railroad depot we got them on board the cars  the only time i ever saw sergeant mackay thoroughly disconcerted was that morning we came up out of the empty prairie riding on the flanks of the herd the beasts had suffered from the scarcity of water and were in an uncertain temper while as luck would have it just as they surged closepacked between the bare frame houses mackay and a trooper came riding down the unpaved street of the little prairie town there was no opening either to right or to left and the more prudent storekeepers put up their shutters  look as if they owned the universe them police said the man who cantered up beside me sure it would take the starch out of them if anything did start the cattle  mackay pulled up his horse and looked dubiously at the mass of tossing horns rolling towards him tis not in accordance with regulations to turn a big draft loose on a peaceful town why did ye not split them up he said ye could be held responsible if theres damage done  im afraid these beasts dont understand regulations and i had to bring them as best i could i answered and my assistant shouted get out of the daylight sergeant dear while your shoes are good  mackay seemed to resent this familiarity and sat still with one hand on his hip an incarnation of official dignity though he kept his eyes upon the fast advancing herd until the big freight locomotive which was awaiting us set up a discordant shrieking and backed a row of clanging cars across the switches that was sufficient for the untamed cattle with a thunder of pounding hoofs they poured tumultuously down the rutted street and i caught a brief glimpse of the sergeant hurriedly wheeling his horse before everything was blotted out by the stirredup dust the streets of a prairie town are inches deep in powdered loam all summer and in bottomless sloughs all spring  a wild shout of faughaballagh rang out and i found myself riding faster than was prudent along the crazy plank sidewalk to pass and if possible swing the stampeding herd into the railroad corral how my horse gained the threefoot elevation and avoided falling over the drygoods bales and flour bags which lay littered everywhere i do not remember but my chief assistant dennis who yelling his hardest charged recklessly down the opposite one afterwards declared that his beast climbed up the steps like a kitten then as i drew a little ahead mackay became dimly visible riding bareheaded as though for his life with the horns that showed through the tossedup grit a few yards behind him fortunately the stockyard gates were open wide and dennis came up at a gallop in time to head the herd off from a charge across the prairie while a second man and i turned their opposite wing mackay did his best to wheel his horse clear of the gates but the beast was evidently bent on getting as far as possible from the oncoming mass and resisted bit and spur then there was a great roar of laughter from loungers and stockyard hands as the dust swept up towards heaven and the drove thundered through the opening  wheres the sergeant i shouted and dennis who chuckled so that his speech was thick made answer sure hes in the corral the beasts have run him in but its mighty tough beef theyd find him in the old country  dennis was right for when the haze thinned the sergeant appeared as white as a miller flattened up against the rails while a playful steer curveted in the vicinity as though considering where to charge him he was extricated by pulling down the rails and accepted my apologies stiffly  this he said disregarding the offer of a lounger to wash him under the locomotive tank is not just what i would have expected of ye rancher ormesby  while the stock were being transferred to the cars amid an almost indescribable tumult i met miss redmond on the little sod platform  i am glad i have met you because i am going to winnipeg and may never see you again she said there is much i do not understand but i feel you have been wronged and want to thank you for your consideration  redmonds daughter had received some training in an eastern convent it was said and i found it hard to believe that the very pale quietlyspoken girl was the one who had called down the curses upon foster lane still i knew there was a strain of something akin to insanity in that family and that in addition she was of the changeful nature which accompanies pure celtic blood  you should not indulge in morbid fancies and you have very little cause for gratitude we were sincerely sorry for you and tried to do what we could i said  ailin redmond fixed her black eyes intently upon me and i grew uneasy seeing what suggested a smoldering fire in them you are not clever enough to deceive a woman she said with a disconcerting composure i do not know all but perhaps i shall some day and then whatever it costs me you and another person shall see justice done it may not be for a long time but i can wait and i am going away from the prairie still i should like to ask you one questionhow did your cattle get inside the fence  the fire drove them but instead of fretting over such things you must try to forget the last two months as soon as possible i answered as stoutly as i could seeking meanwhile an excuse for flight which was not lacking those beasts will kill somebody if i neglect them any longer  ailin redmond held out her hand to me saying very quietly i shall never forget andit is no use protestinga time will come when i shall understand it all clearly until then may the good saints protect you from all further evil rancher ormesby  as i hurried away a tented wagon lurched into the station and when i last saw redmonds daughter she stood near the lonely end of the platform talking earnestly with the traveling photographer  dennis had not recovered from his merriment when much to the satisfaction of those we left behind the long cars rolled out of the station while many agents remembered our visit to the stations which succeeded blinding dust and fragments of ballast whirled about the cars as the huge locomotive hauled them rocking over the limitless levels from sunrise to sunset the gaunt telegraph poles reeled up from the receding horizon growing from the size of matches to towering spars as they came and then slowly diminishing far down the straightruled line again for hours we lay on sidetracks waiting until one of the great interocean expresses running their portion of the race round half the globe thundered past white with the dust of a fifteenhundredmile journey and then with cars and cattle complaining we lurched on our way again  at times we led the beasts out in detachments to water at wayside stations and there was usually much profanity and destruction of property before we got them back again and left the agent to assess the damage to his feelings besides splintered gangways and broken rails it was at portage or brandon i think that one showed me a warning received by wire through freight full of wild beasts coming along therell be nothing left of your station if you let the lunatics in charge of them turn their menagerie out  the beasts had however grown more subdued before the cars rolled slowly into winnipeg and gave us little trouble when leaving the prairie behind we sped eastwards ever past broad lake and foaming river into the muskegs of ontario so that i had time for reflection when the great locomotive panting on the grades hauled us poised giddily between crag face and deep blue water along the superior shore the haldanes were in montreal and i wondered in case chance threw me in their way how they would greet me and what i should say i was apparently a prosperous rancher when they last spoke with me and a tender of other mens cattle now while it might well happen that in their eyes a further cloud rested upon me  the long and weary journey came to an end at last and when the big engines ceased their panting beside the broad st lawrence i left dennis and his companions to divert themselves in montreal after the fashion of their kind and arraying myself in civilized fashion proceeded to my relatives offices  a clerk said that mr leyland who was absent desired me to follow him to his autumn retreat but i first set about the business which had brought me unassisted nobody however would entertain the species of investment i had to propose and it was with a heavy heart i boarded the cars again some days later  leyland and his wife appeared unaffectedly glad to see me at their pretty summerhouse which stood above the smooth white shingle fringing a wide lake and at sunset that evening i lay smoking among the boulders of a point while his son and heir sat close by interrogating me part of the lake still reflected the afterglow and after the monotonous levels of the prairie it rested my eyes to see the climbing pines tower above it in shadowy majesty their drowsy scent was soothing and through the dusk that crept towards me from their feet blinking lights cast trembling reflections across the glassy water several prosperous citizens retired at times to spend their leisure in what they termed camping on the islets of that lake  air you poor and wicked asked the urchin inspecting me critically  very poor and about up to the average for iniquity i said and the diminutive questioner rubbed his curly locks as though puzzled  well you dont quite look neither he commented poor men dont wear new store clothes the last one i saw had big holes in his pants and hadnt eaten nothing for three weeks he said pop he spanked me good cos i gave him four dollars offn the bureau to buy some dinner with say how long was it since you had a square meal anyway you did mighty well at supper i was watching you  it is about two months since i had a meal like that and then it was because a friend of mine gave it to me i answered truthfully and leyland junior rubbed his head again  noyou dont look very low down but you must be he repeated pop was talking bout you and he said youll do your best to see the poor devil has a good time twoinette from what i gather he needs it pretty bad  i laughed perhaps somewhat hollowly for the child commented wont you do that again its just like a loon theres one lives over yonder and he might answer ma she says people should never make a noise when they laugh but when i sent ted on the roof to get my ball and he fell into the rainbutt she just laughed worse than you and her teeth came out  your mother would probably spank you for telling that to strangers but who is ted i said remembering that a loon is a waterbird that sets up an unearthly shrieking in the stillness of the night and the urchin rebuked me with the cheerful disrespect for his seniors which characterizes the colonial born  say was you forgotten when brains were given out hes just ted caryl and i think hes bad pop says his firms meaner than road agents he comes round evenings and swops business lies with pop specially when bee is here but he cant be clever ma says he dont even know enough to be sure which girl he wants they is two of them and i like lou best  why i asked because the urchin seemed to expect some comment and he proceeded to convince me they is both pretty but lou is nicest i found it out one day id been eating corduroy candy and bee she just dropped me when i got up on her knee she didnt say anything but she looked considerable then i went to lou and she picked me up and gave me nicer candies out of a giltedge box ma says she must have been an angel because her dress was all sticky and i think she is there was one just like her with silver wings in the church at sault chaudiere one night ma and them was talking bout you and bee sits quite still as if she didnt care but she was listening lou she says poor i dont think it was poor devil  do you know where little boys who tell all they hear go to i asked and leyland junior pointed to a dusky sail that showed up behind the island before he answered wearily you make me tired ive been asked that one before heres ted and the others coming im off to see what they have brought for me  he vanished among the boulders and filling my pipe again i kept still feeling no great inclination to take part in the casual chatter of people with whose customs i had almost lost touch i was struck by the resemblance of the names the child mentioned to those of haldanes daughters but both were tolerably common and it did not please me that mrs leyland should make a story of my struggles for the amusement of strangers so some time had passed before i entered the veranda of the little wooden house and as it was only partially lighted by a shaded lamp managed to find a place almost unobserved in a corner thus i had time to recover from my surprise at the sight of beatrice and lucille haldane seated at a little table beneath the lamp two men i did not know leaned against the balustrade close at hand and several more were partly distinguishable in the shadows from where i sat some of the figures were projected blackly against a field of azure and silver for the moon now hung above the lake beatrice haldane was examining what appeared to be a bound collection of photographic reproductions  yes as mrs leyland mentions i have met the original of this picture and it is a good one though it owes something to the retoucher she said and i saw my hostess smile wickedly at her husband when somebody said tell us about him how interesting  beatrice haldane answered lightly there is not much to tell the allegorical title explains itself if it refers to the edict that it is by the sweat of his brow man shall earn his bread which most of our acquaintances seem to have evaded the west is a hard bare country and its inhabitants though not wholly uncivilized hard men i should like to send some of our amateur athletes to march or work with them this one is merely a characteristic specimen  i wondered what the subject of the picture was but waited an opportunity to approach the speaker while as i did so a young man said i should rather like to take up your sisters challenge pulling the big catboat across here inside an hour without an air of wind was not exactly play but can you tell us anything more about these tireless westerners miss lucille  the younger girl who sat quietly with her hands in her lap looked up it is the fashion never to grow enthusiastic but i am going to tell you ted those men were always in real earnest and that is why they interested me but i shouldnt take up the challenge if i were you we call this camping they lie down to sleep on many a journey in a snow trench under the arctic frost ride as carelessly through blinding blizzard as summer heat and i concluded generally work all day and half the night they are not hard in any other sense but very generous though they sometimes speak as they live very plainly  some of the listeners appeared amused others halfinclined to applaud the girl and there was a little laughter when miss haldane interposed this is my sisters hobby some of them you may remember seem to live upon gophers lucille  lucille haldane did not appear pleased at this interruption but the flush of animation and luster in her eyes wonderfully became her i do not know that even gophers would be worse than the canned goose livers and other disgusting things we import for their weight in silver she said all i saw in the west pleased me and because i am a canadian first and last i dont mind being smiled at for admitting that i am very glad i have seen the men who live there at their work they are doing a great deal for our country  they could not have a stancher or prettier champion my dear said a grayhaired man who sat near me it would be hard to grow equally enthusiastic about your profession ted  it is miss haldanes genius which makes the most of everybodys good points answered a young man with a frank face and stalwart appearance turning towards me i am afraid the rest of us would see only a tired and dusty farmer who looked as though twelve hours sleep would be good for him whats your idea of the west if i remember mrs leyland correctly you come from the land of promise dont you  we certainly work tolerably hard out there but it is no great credit to us when we have to choose between that and starvation and the west is the land of disappointment as well as promise i answered dryly  the rest glanced around in our direction and mrs leyland laughed mischievously if any of you are really interested my friend here who came in so quietly would i dare say answer your questions let me present you rancher ormesby  i bowed as endeavoring to remember the names that followed i moved towards the chair beside her when she beckoned it lay full in the light and i noticed blank surprise in the faces turned towards me beatrice haldane dropped the album and for some reason the clear rose color surged upwards from her sisters neck i stooped to recover the book which lay open and then stared at it with astonishment and indignation for the face of the man standing beside a weary team waistdeep in the tall grass of a slough was unmistakably my own i had forgotten the click of the camera shutter that hot morning  it was hardly fair of my hostess not to warn me and this print was published without my knowledge or consent i said still it shows how we earn a living in my country and i can really tell you little more we resemble most other people in that we chiefly exert ourselves under pressure of necessityand one would prefer to forget that fact during a brief holiday  the listeners either smiled or nodded goodhumoredly and it was lucille haldane who held out her hand to me while her elder sister returned my salutation with a civility which was distinct from cordiality how mrs leyland changed the situation i do not remember nor how when some of the party were inspecting fireflies in the grasses by the lake i found myself beside beatrice haldane at the end of the veranda i had schooled myself in preparation for a possible meeting but she looked so beautiful with the moonlight on her that i spoke rashly  we parted good friendsbut no one could have hoped you felt the slightest pleasure at the present meeting  frankness is sometimes irksome to both speaker and listener said the girl turning her dark eyes upon me steadily can you not be satisfied with the possibility of your being mistaken  no i answered doggedly and she smiled then suppose one admitted you had surmised correctly  i should ask the cause and beatrice haldane saying nothing looked a warning which being filled with an insane bitterness i would not take it would hurt me to conclude that those you honored with your friendship on the prairie would be less welcome here  she raised her head a little with the haldanes pride which though never paraded was unmistakable you should have learned to know us better neither your prosperity nor the reverse would have made any difference  then is there no explanation i asked forgetting everything under the strain of the moment and it was evident that beatrice haldane shared her sisters courage for though there was a darker spot in the center of her cheek she answered steadily there is we are disappointed in you rancher ormesby  then without another word she turned away and presently the rattle of oars and a gleam of moonlit canvas told that the catboat was returning across the lake  i hope you have enjoyed the meeting with your friends said mrs leyland presently very much i assure you i answered with an effort which i hope will be forgiven me     chapter x  a temptation   leyland had a weakness for what he termed hardening himself by occasional feats of endurance from which it resulted that i spent several days in his company wandering with a wholly unnecessary load of camp gear upon my back through a desolation of uncomfortably wooded hills now it is not easy for a business man of domesticated habits to emulate a pack mule and enjoy the proceeding and when mrs leyland after burdening her husband with everything she could think of desired to add a small tin bath there was little difficulty in predicting that our journey would not be extensive having a load of fifty pounds already i ignored the suggestion that i might carry the bath and hurried leyland off before his spouse could further hamper us one thick blanket a kettle and a few pounds of provisions would have amply sufficed so a largesized tent seemed to be distinctly superfluous to say nothing of the bag filled with hairbrushes towels and scented soap  leyland commenced the march with enthusiasm and certainly presented a picturesque appearance as he plodded along in leather jacket and fringed leggings with the folded tent upon his shoulders and a collection of tin utensils jingling about him i was somewhat similarly caparisoned and because it would have hurt his feelings i overcame the temptation to fling half my load into a creek we crossed though this would have greatly pleased me a fourth of the weight would have sufficed for a twohundredmile journey in the west  there is nothing like judicious exercise for bracing ones whole system panted my companion when we had covered the first league in two hours or so how a wide prospect like this rests the vision say cant we sit down and enjoy it a little  i nodded agreement and we spent most of that day in sitting down and smoking while as it happened a sudden breeze blew the tent over upon us at midnight and anybody who has crawled clear of the thrashing canvas in such circumstances can guess what followed leyland as generally happens wriggled headforemost into what might be termed the pocket of the net and it cost me some trouble to extricate him next morning he awoke with a toothache and general shortness of temper as a result of trying to sleep in the rain and appeared much less certain about the benefits to be derived from such excursions  if you will let me pick out the few things we really want and throw the rest away ill engage that you will enjoy the remainder of the march i said  i wish i could but it cant be done and leyland staring ruefully at his load shook his head twoinettes soso blamed systematic and if one of those brushes was missing shed have to start in from the beginning with a whole new toilet outfit of course you dont understand these things yet but you will some day a wife with cultured tastes requires to be considered accordingly  i was resting on one elbow gazing up between the pine branches at the blue of the sky with the cleanscented needles crackling under me and made no answer nevertheless it struck me that i might find too much culture irksome especially if it implied that i must carry half my household sundries upon my back whenever i started on an expedition hitherto i had not considered this side of the question when indulging in certain roseate visions but as leyland spoke there opened up unpleasant possibilities of having to stand by a mere director clear of the heat and dust of effort and pay others to do the work i found pleasure in then as i reflected that there was small need to trouble about such eventualities a face that was not beatrice haldanes rose up before my fancy it was forceful as well as pretty quick to express sympathy and enthusiasm and i decided that the man who won lucille haldane would have a helpmate who would encourage instead of restrain his energies and if need be take her place beside him in the struggle then i dismissed the subject as having nothing to do with me  leyland seemed loath to resume his rambles and on the following morning after he had i fancy lain awake abusing the mosquitoes all night his patience broke down im getting too old to enjoy this description of picnic as i used to he said the fact is if i mule this confounded bricàbrac around much longer i shall drop in my tracks  shall we turn back i asked him  the tired man shook his head well strike for water and if we cant find a canoe anywhere you can build a raft i wouldnt crawl through any more of those muskegs for a thousand dollars  i had no objections and leylands comments became venomous during the march for the lake was distant and the pine woods thick he fell into thickets and shed his burden broadcast across the face of each steeper descent so that it cost us many minutes to collect it again and once we spent an hour in the mire of a muskeg on hands and knees in search of a vinepattern mustard spoon leyland who became profane during the proceedings said his wife might consider that its loss would destroy the harmony of a whole dinner service at last howevermy comrade panting heavily and progressing with a crablike gait because he had wrenched one knee and blistered a heelthe broad lake showed up beneath the blazing maple leaves ahead they were donning their full glories of gold and crimson before the coming of the frost  thank heaven said leyland with fervent sincerity ill sit here forever unless you can find something that will float me home  he limped on until we were clear of the trees and then flung himself down among the boulders with a gasp of relief for fortune had treated him kindly there was a fresh breeze blowing and the broad stretch of water was streaked by lines of frothy white but we had come out upon a sheltered bay and a big catboat lay moored beneath a ledge a group of figures rose from about a crackling fire there was a shout of recognition and the young man i had been introduced to as ted caryl came forward to greet us  just in time the kettles boiling but have you been practicing for a strongman circus leyland he said my companion still retaining his recumbent position answered dryly i have been taking exercise and diverting myself  so one might have fancied from your exhilarated appearance commented caryl we can give you a passage home by water if you have had enough of it  ill go no other way if i have to swim said leyland grimly  then the younger man turned to me do you happen to know anything about seamanship  i spent all my spare time as a youngster helping to sail small craft on the english coast and was considered a fair helmsman for my age i said and caryl patted my shoulder approvingly  its a mercy because i know just next to nothing put up as a yacht club member and bought this craftshes a daisyfor five hundred dollars to give the girls a sail brought them down with a light fair wind smart enough but though its gone round the thing dont steer the way she ought to in a breeze so ive been getting mighty anxious as to how im to take them home again and feel too scared to say so  i looked at the craft which was a halfdecked boat evidently fitted with a centerboard of the broadbeamed shallow type common on the american coast she carried no bowsprit her lofty mast was stepped almost in her bows and the combination of heavy spars short body and wide flat stern presaged difficulties for an unskilled helmsman when running before any strength of breeze i think you have some reason for your misgivings i said if the wind freshens much i should almost recommend you to camp here all night  we had by this time approached the fire and i noticed with a slight inward hesitation that haldanes daughter and an elderly lady were busy preparing tea perhaps it was this which prevented beatrice from noticing me but lucille came forward and greeted us you have arrived at an opportune moment supper is just about ready and if it is not so good as the one you gave us at gaspards trail we will try to do our best for you she said  have you not forgotten that evening yet i asked a transitory expression i did not quite comprehend became visible in the girls face when she answered my smile it was pleasant to think she recalled the evening of which i had not forgotten the smallest incident  it was something so new to me and you were all so kind she said  there was dismay when caryl announced my opinion though the rest decided to postpone a decision in the hope that the weather might improve and it seemed useless to inform them that the reverse appeared more probable a pine forest rolled down to the waters edge and when the meal had been dispatched i lounged with my back against a tree when leyland came up you look uncommonly lazymore played out than i we want you to enjoy your stay with us and i hope i have not tired you he said  i laughed a little because leyland was hardly likely to tire any man fresh from the arduous life of the prairie its an oasis in the desert and you have made me so comfortable that i shall almost shrink from going back i said truthfully enough for before i left the strain at gaspards trail had grown acute  then what do you want to go back for anyway asked leyland who during the afternoon had made several pertinent inquiries concerning my affairs there are chances for a live man in the citiesin fact i know of one or two no doubt for a time its experience but it strikes me that this cattle roasting and losing of grain crops must mean a big loss of opportunities as well as grow monotonous  leyland i fancied had not previously noticed that miss haldane was seated on a fallen log close beside us and in the circumstances i was by no means pleased when he turned to her dont you think everybody should make the most of all thats in them he asked  somewhat to my surprise the girl looked straight at me as she answered considering the question in the abstract i agree with you it seems to me the duty of every man with talents to take the place he was meant for among his peers instead of frittering them away  there was an unusual earnestness in what she said which both surprised me and reminded me of the days in england for beatrice haldanes conversation had latterly been marked by a somewhat cynical languidness nevertheless the inference nettled me  talent is a somewhat vague term but suppose any unprofessional person possessed it what career among the thick of his fellows would you recommendthe acquisition of money on the markets or politics both are closed to the poor man i said  it may have been fancy but a faint angry sparkle seemed to creep into miss haldanes eyes as she answered are there no others it seems to me the place for such a person is where civilization moves fastest in the cities whether we progress towards good or evil you cannot move back the times and it is force of intellect or successful scheming if you will which commands the best the world can offer now as an outside observer it seems to me that considering the tendency towards centralization and combinations of capital the individual who refusing to accept the altered conditions insists on remaining an independent unit must soon go under or take a helots place dont you think so mr leyland  thats what i mean but you have put it more clearly said leyland approvingly i was hoping ormesby might see it that way  understanding my hosts manner i guessed that if i hinted at acquiescence this would lead up to a definite offer and it appeared that both in their own way were bent on persuading me the temptation was alluring when disaster appeared imminent and i afterwards wondered how it was i did not yield wounded pride or sheer obstinacy may however have restrained me for one of the most bitter things is to own ones self beaten but even then i felt that my place was on the prairie on the one hand there was only the prospect of grinding care and often brutal labor which wore the body to exhaustion and blunted the mental faculties on the other at least some rest and leisure contact with culture and refinement and perhaps even yet a vague possibility of drawing nearer to the woman beside me at that moment however lucille haldane halted in front of us and the trifling incident helped to turn the scale young as she was her views were mine and for some unfathomable reason i shook off what seemed a weak tendency to yield when i met her gaze  it will be a bad day for the dominion when what is happening across the frontier becomes general here i said it is the number of independent units which makes for the real prosperity of this country and the suggestion that there is only scope for intellect and force of will in the cities can hardly pass unchallenged the smallest wheat grower has to use the same foresight in his degree as a railroad financier and it probably requires more stamina to hold out against bad seasons and the oppression of scheming landgrabbers than is requisite say in engineering a grain corner against adverse markets then if one gets back to principles does it not appear that the poorest breaker of virgin land who calls wheat up out of the idle sod is of more use to the community than the gambler in his produce who creates nothing  there is no use arguing with any man who thinks that way said leyland solemnly and beatrice haldane laughed but whether at his comment or at my opinion did not appear  here is an ally for you you are looking very wise lucille she said languidly  i did not hear all you said but i think mr ormesby is partly right was the frank answer i just stopped on my way to the boat to get some wrappings it soon grows chilly  the girl refused our offers of assistance somebody called leyland away and i was left alone possibly against both our wishes in beatrice haldanes company still it was an opportunity that might not occur again and i determined to turn it to good account  although you expressed strong disapproval not long ago one could have fancied you were not speaking from a wholly impersonal standpoint and meant to give me good advice i said  the spirit which had carried haldane triumphantly through commercial panic was not lacking in either of his daughters and the elder one quietly took up the challenge perhaps the other could not be thrust aside and i have wondered whether you are wise in staking all your future on the chances of success on the prairie there are greater possibilities in the busy world that lies before you now but presently habit and the force of associations will bind you to the soil and you must remain a raiser of cattle and sower of grain is it not possible for the monotony and drudgery to drag one down to a steadily sinking level  the words stung me i had done my best in my vocation and it seemed had failed therein neither was it impossible that the last sentence possessed a definite meaning and suppressed longing and resentment against the pressure of circumstances held me silent after i had managed to check the rash answer that rose to my lips then a shout broke through the pause which followed and beatrice haldane sprang to her feet lucille has set the boat adrift go and help her if you can she said  a glance showed me the catboat sliding out towards open water before the angry white ripples that crisped the little bay for here the wind deflected by a hollow blew freshly offshore a slight whiteclad figure stood on the fore deck and i shouted jump down and fling the anchor over  there is no anchor the answer reached me faintly and i set off across a strip of shingle and boulders at a floundering run  the rest of the company were gathered in dismay upon a rocky ledge when i came up and caryl tore off his jacket leyland turned to me with consternation in his face as he said ted must have tied some fool knot and shes blowing right out across the lake none of us can swim  its my fault and im going to try anyway the water cannot be deep inside here gasped the valiant caryl  i saw that for inland waters a tolerable sea was running where the true wind blew straight down the lake sufficient to endanger the catboat if she drifted without control athwart it there was evidently no time to lose and i turned angrily upon caryl if you jump in here you will certainly drown and that will help nobody i said  then seeing some feet of water below the ledge i launched myself out headforemost the ripples ran white behind me when i rose and there was no great difficulty in swimming downwind even when cumbered by clothing but the boats side and mast exposed considerable surface to the blast and she had blown some distance to leeward before i overtook her it also cost me time and labor to crawl on boardan operation difficult in deep waterbut it was accomplished and turning to the girl i said cheerfully you need not be frightened we shall beat back in a few minutes if you will help me  lucille haldane showed the courage she had showed one snowy night at bonaventure for there was confidence in her face as she answered i will do whatever you tell me and im not in the least afraid     chapter xi  in peril of the waters   again i hazarded a glance about me the shallowdraughted craft had already drifted a distance offshore and was listing over under the pressure of the wind upon her lofty mast the white ripples had grown to short angry surges and because darkness was approaching and the narrow bay difficult to work into it was evident we must lose no time in getting back again there was no anchor on board and if i reefed the sail or rolled up the foot of it to reduce the area the boat would meanwhile increase her distance from the beach it therefore seemed necessary to attempt to thrash back under the whole mainsail  will you shove the centerboard down by the iron handle and then take hold of the tiller miss haldane i said  the girl stooping thrust at the handle projecting from the trunk containing the drawnup center keel the iron plate should have dropped at a touch but did not and i sprang to her side when she said something must be holding it fast  she was right caryl had either bent the plate by striking a rock or a piece of driftwood had jammed into the opening for do what i would the iron refused to fall more than a third of its proper distance and it was with a slight shock of dismay i relinquished the struggle a sailing craft of any description will only work to windward in zigzags diagonally to the breeze and then only provided there is enough of her under water to provide lateral resistance which the deep center keel should have supplied as it was i must attempt to remedy the deficiency by press of canvas at the risk of a capsize  fortunately my companion was quickwitted and cool and standing at the helm followed my instructions promptly while i dragged at the halliards and the loose folds of sailcloth rose thrashing overhead i was breathless when the sail was set but sprang aft to the helm lifted the girl to the weather deck and perched myself as high on that side as i could with the mainsheet round my left wrist and my right hand on the tiller wondering if the mast would bear the strain the boat swayed down until her leeward deck was buried in a rush of foam and her bending mast slanted half way to the horizontal little clouds of spray shot up from her weather bow as gathering way she swept ahead and then they gave place to sheets of water which lashed our faces and sluicing deep along the decks poured over the coaming ledge into the open well still we were in comparatively smooth water where one could risk a little and while the straining mainsheet which i dare not make fast sawed into my wrist i glanced at my companion her hat was soddenalready her hair clung in soaked clusters to her forehead and her wet face showed white against the dark water which raced past us yet it was still confident and her voice was level as she said let me help you that rope is cutting your wrist  i could have smiled at the thought of those slender fingers sharing that strain but thinking it would be well to keep her attention occupied nodded and was a trifle surprised at the relief when the girl seized the hard wet hemp if i saylet golift your hands at once i said  we were now tearing through the water at such pace that the boat flung a good deal of what she displaced all over her but a glance at the dark pines ashore showed that she was making very little to windward while when i looked over my shoulder at the boiling wake astern it was too plainly evident that owing to the loss of the centerboard we were driving bodily sideways as well as ahead also the snowy froth which lapped higher up the lee deck was perilously near the coaming protecting the open well still our expectant friends stood clustered among the boulders fringing one horn of the bay and i saw that caryl held a rope in his hand we might just pass within reach of it on the next tack  we must come round slip down and climb up on the opposite side as the sail swings over i said carefully shoving the tiller down  there was a thrashing of canvas as the boat came round and i breathed more easily as gathering way on the opposite tack she headed well up for the boulder point where caryl was somewhat awkwardly swinging the coil of rope the point drew nearer and nearer and i could see beatrice haldane standing rigidly still against the somber pines when as illluck would have it the dark branches set up a roaring as a wild gust swept down the boat swayed further over most of her forward was buried in a rush of foam and the water poured steadily into the well but i still held fast the sheet which would have loosed the sail for we might reach the rope in another two minutes the gust increased in violence foam and water poured over the coamings in cataracts and seeing that otherwise a capsize was inevitable i released the sheet the canvas rattled furiously the craft swayed upright and commenced to blow away sternforemost like a feather while i dropped into the bottom of her ankle deep in water  there is no help for itwe must reef take the tiller and hold itso i said  it was not without an effort i tied the tack or forward corner of the mainsail down then floundering aft hauled the afterside of it down to the boom that accomplished and the sail thus reduced by some two feet all along its foot there remained to be tied the row of short lines or reef points which would hold the discarded portion when rolled up and when part of these were knotted it was with misgivings i leaped up on the afterdeck the long jerking boom projected a fathom beyond the stern and i must hold on by my toes while leaning out over the water as i pulled the reef points at that end together  i am going to trust you with the safety of both of us miss haldane i said when you see the boom swing inwards pull the tiller towards you before it flings me off  the girl had grown a little paler and her hands trembled on the helm but she answered without hesitation dont be longer than you can helpbut i understand  she showed a fine intelligence and a perfect selfcommand or our voyage might have ended abruptly so the reefing was accomplished and i resumed the helm meanwhile however we had drifted well out into the lake and a few minutes of sailing proved that under her reduced canvas the boat would not beat back to the windward shore the figures among the boulders had faded into the deepening gloom but assuming a cheerfulness i did not feel i said it is quite impossible to return and as it is growing too late to look for a safe landing or path through the bush we must head for home and send back horses for the others it will be a fair wind  i was afraid so said the girl with a shiver but i hope we shall not be very long on the way we spent five hours coming  i knew we should travel at a pace approaching a steamers provided the craft could be kept from filling but enlarging upon the former point i tried to conceal the latter possibility as i put the helm up and the craft rising upright but commencing to roll horribly raced away downwind towards open water once out of the points shelter short but angry waves raced white behind her for one may find sufficient turmoil of waters when a fresh gale sweeps the canadian lakes the rolling grew wilder the long boom splashed heavily into the white upheavals that surged by on each side and our progress became a series of upward rushes and swoops until at times i feared the craft would run her bows under and go down bodily once i caught my companion glancing over the stern and knowing how ugly oncoming waves appear when they heave up behind a running vessel i laid a hand on her shoulder and gently turned her head aside  there you must look only that way and tell me if you see any islands across our course i said  it was practically dark now but i could distinguish the whiteness of her wet face and see her shiver violently my jacket was spongy i had nothing to wrap her in but she looked so wet and pitiful that i drew her towards me and slipped a dripping arm protectingly about her lucille haldane made no demur the wild rolling the flying spray and the rush of short tumbling ridges must have been sufficiently terrifying and perhaps she found the contact reassuring  one hand was all i needed there was now nothing any unassisted man could do except keep the craft straight before wind and sea but it was quite sufficient for one who had lost much of his dexterity with the tiller and at times the boat twisted on a white crest in imminent peril of rolling over worse than all the waves that smote the flat stern commenced to splash on board and the water inside the boat rose rapidly already the floorings were floating and i dare not for a second loose the tiller it was lucille haldane who solved the difficulty  is not all that water getting dangerous she asked with chattering teeth and knowing her keenness i saw there was no use attempting to hide the fact  why did you not tell me so earlier she continued it is only right that i should do my share and i can at least throw some of it out  you are not fit for such work and must sit still at this pace we shall see the lights of leylands house soon i said tightening my hold on her but the girl shook off my grasp  i am not so helpless that i cannot make an effort to do what is so necessary she said let me go mr ormesby or i shall never forgive you where is the bailer  i pointed to it and even in face of the necessity it hurt me to see her alternately kneeling in the water that surged to and fro and trying to hold herself upright while she raised and emptied the heavy bucket often she upset its contents over herself or me and several times a lurch flung her cruelly against the coaming but she persevered with undiminished courage until she stumbled in a savage roll and struck her head then she clung to the coaming the water draining from her and not daring to move from the tiller i could do nothing but growl anathemas upon the boats owner until the girl sank down in the stern sheets beside me  i must rest a little she said but what were you saying mr ormesby  only that i should like to hang the man who invented this unhandy rig and caryl for tempting you on board such a craft i answered hoping she had not heard the whole of my remarks you poor child it is shameful that you should have to do such work and whatever happens you shall not try again  her tresses released from whatever bound them streamed in the wind about her and she seemed to shrink a little from me as she struggled with them it is not caryls fault i clumsily let the rope go when i was pulling the boat in and as it is some little time since i was a child i do not care to be treated as one have i not done my best she asked  you have done gallantly more than many men unused to seamanshipcaryl for instancecould all this is due to his stupidity i answered and fancied there was a trace of resentment in her voice as she said poor ted he is brave enough at least i know he cannot swim and yet he was about to plunge into deep water when you stopped him  it appeared wholly ridiculous but even then lucille haldanes defense of caryl irritated me he is responsible for all you are suffering and i cant forgive him for it was that not rather the action of a lunatic i answered shortly  a wave which breaking upon the flat stern deluged my shoulders and drenched my companion afresh cut short the colloquy but i caught sight of a faint twinkle ahead and restrained her with a wet hand when she would have resumed the bailing it was also by gentle force for this time she resisted that i drew her down beside me so that i partly shielded her from the spray and the water came in as it willed as we drove onwards through thick obscurity still the light rose higher ahead and i strained my eyes to catch the first loom of leylands island large boulders studded the approach to it and we might come to grief if we struck one of them  it was now blowing viciously hard the boat halfburied in a white smother would scarcely steer and the bright light from a window ahead beat into my eyes bewildering my vision i could however dimly make out pines looming behind it and the beat of yeasty surges which warned me it would be risky to attempt a landing on that beach there would be shelter on the leeward side of the island but a glance at the balloonlike curves of the lifting mainsail showed that we could not clear its end upon the course we were sailing we must jibe or swing the mainsail over which might result in a capsize  i want your help miss haldane go forward and loose the rope you will find on your righthand side near the mast i said and as the girl obeyed the light shone more fully upon the dripping boat i had a momentary vision of several dark figures on the veranda and then while i held my breath saw only the slight form of the girl with draggled dress and wet hair streaming swung out above the whiteness of rushing foam as she wrenched at the halliard which had fouled then the head of the sail swung down and as she came back panting the steering demanded all my attention  hold fast to the coaming here i said as dragging with might and main at the sheet i put the tiller up  the craft twisted upon her heel the sail swung aloft and then while the sheet rasped through my fingers chafing the skin from them there was a heavy crash as the boom lurched over the boat swayed wildly under its impetus buried one side deep and a shout which might have been a cry of consternation reached me faintly then she shook herself free and reeled away into the blackness on a different course  the head of the island swept by and we shot into smoother water with a spit of shingle ahead on which i ran the craft ashore and it was with sincere relief i felt the shock of her keel upon the bottom lucille haldane said something i did not hear while she lay limp and wet and silent in my arms as floundering nearly waistdeep i carried her ashore and then towards a path which led to the house the night was black the way uneven but perhaps because i was partly dazed i did not set down my burden she had helped me bravely and it was only now when the peril had passed i knew how very fearful i had been for her safety indeed it was hard to realize she was yet free from danger and in obedience to some unreasoning instinct i still held her fast until she slipped from my grasp a few minutes later a light twinkled among the trees voices reached us and haldane followed by several others came up with a lantern  he stooped and kissed his daughter then turning held out his hand to me thank godbut where is beatrice he said  i told him my teeth rattling as i spoke and without further words we went on towards the house nevertheless the fervent handclasp and quiver in haldanes voice were sufficiently eloquent when we entered the house where mrs leyland took charge of lucille haldane asking very few questions looked hard at me i shall not forget this service he said quietly in the meantime get into some of leylands things as quickly as you can we are going to pull the boat ashore under shelter of the island and requisition a wagon at rideaus farm i believe we can reach the others by an old lumbermens trail  it was in vain i offered my services as guide haldane would not accept them and set out with the assistants whom fearing some accident he had brought with him while i had changed into dry clothing when his daughter came in what she had put on i do not know but it was probably something of mrs leylands intended for evening wear and in contrast to her usual almost girlish attire it became her she had suddenly changed as it were into a woman her dark lashes were demurely lowered but her eyes were shining  you are none the worse i said drawing out a chair for her and she laughed a little  none and i even ventured to appear in this fashion lest you should think so i also wanted to thank you for taking care of me  lucille haldanes voice was low and very pleasant to listen to but i wondered why i should feel such a thrill of pleasure as i heard it  shouldnt it be the reverse you deserve the thanks for the way you helped me though i am sorry it was necessary you should do what you did let me see your hands i said  she tried to slip them out of sight but i was too quick and seizing one held it fast feeling ashamed and sorry as i looked down at it the hard ropes had torn the soft white skin and the rim of the bucket or the coaming had left dark bruises admiration mingled with pity forced me to add it was very cruel i called you child you are the bravest woman i ever met  the damask tinge deepened a little in her cheeks and she strove to draw the hand away but i held it fast continuing no man could have behaved more pluckily butout of curiositywere you not just a little frightened  the lashes fell lower and i was not sure of the smile beneath them i was at first very much so but not afterwards i thought i could trust you to take care of me  i am afraid i seemed very brutal but i would have given my life to keep you safe i said that however would have been very little after all it is not worth much just now to anybody  i was ashamed of the speech afterwards especially the latter part of it but it was wholly involuntary and the events of the past few hours had drawn as it were a bond of close comradeship between my companion in peril and myself  i think you are wrong but i am glad you have spoken because i wanted to express my sympathy and feared to intrude she said we heard that bad times had overtaken you and your neighbors and were very sorry still they cannot last forever and you will not be beaten you must not be to justify the belief father and i have in you  the words were very simple but there was a naïve sincerity about them which made them strangely comforting while i noticed that mrs leyland who came in just then looked at us curiously i sat out upon the veranda until late that night filled with a contentment i could not quite understand to have rendered some assistance to beatrice haldanes sister and won her fathers goodwill seemed however sufficient ground for satisfaction and i decided that this must be the cause of it  the rest of the party returned overland next day and during the afternoon haldane said to me i may as well admit that i have heard a little about your difficulties and leyland has been talking to me if you dont mind the plain speaking one might conclude that you are somewhat hardly pressed well it seems to me that certain incidents have given me a right to advise or help you and if you are disposed to let the mortgaged property go i dont think there would be any great difficulty in finding an opening for you there are big homesteads in your region financed by eastern capital  he spoke with sincerity and evident goodwill but unfortunately haldane was almost the last person from whom i could accept a favor i am while grateful not wholly defeated and mean to hold on i said would you for instance quietly back out of a conflict with some wealthy combine and leave your opponents a free hand to collect the plunder  haldane smiled dryly it would depend on circumstances but in a general way i hardly think i should he said you will however remember advice was mentioned and i believe there are men who would value my counsel  i shook my head heaven knows what the end will be but i must worry through this trouble my own way i said  haldane was not offended and did not seem surprised you may be wrong or you may be right but if you and your neighbors are as hard to plunder as you are slow to take a favor the other gentlemen will probably earn all they get he said i presume you have no objections to my wishing you good luck  it was the next evening when i met beatrice haldane beside the lake and so you are going back tomorrow to your cattle she said  yes i answered it is the one course open to me and the only work for which i am fitted and miss haldane showed a faint trace of impatience  if you are sure that is so you are wise she said  before i could answer she moved away to greet mrs leyland and some time elapsed before we met again for i bade leyland farewell next morning     chapter xii  the selling of gaspards trail   the surroundings were depressing when one evening steel and i rode home for the last time to gaspards trail the still clear weather with white frost in the mornings and mellow sunshine all day long which follows the harvest had gone and the prairie lay bleak and gray under a threatening sky waiting for the snow crescents and wedges of wild fowl streaked the lowering heavens overhead as they fled southward in endless processions before the frost the air throbbed with the beat of their pinions which at that season emphasizes the human shrinking from the winter while the cold wind that shook the grasses sighed most mournfully  there was nothing cheering in the prospect for a man who badly needed encouragement and i smiled sardonically when steel who pushed his horse alongside me said theres a good deal in the weather and this mean kind has just melted the grit right out of me ill be mighty thankful to get in out of it and curl up where its warm and snug beside the stove sally will have all fixed up good and cheerful and the west rooms a cozy place to come into out of the cold  you must make the most of it tonight then for well be camping on straw or bare earth tomorrow i said confound you steel isnt it a little unnecessary to remind me of all that i have lost  i didnt mean it that way said the other with some confusion i felt i had to say something cheerful to rouse you up and that was the best i could make of it anyway well both feel better after supper and im hoping well yet see the man who turned you out in a tight place  you have certainly succeeded i answered dryly when a man is forced to stand by and watch a rascal cheat him out of the result of years of labor you cant blame him for being a trifle short in temper and if it were not for the last expectation you mention id turn my back tomorrow on this povertystricken country as it is  well stop right here until our turn comes some day then therell be big trouble for somebody said steel but youve got to lie low ormesby and give him no chances that man takes everyone he gets and if one might say it youre just a little hot in the head  ones friends can say a good deal and generally do i answered testily how long have you set up as a model of discretion steel still though there is rather more sense than usual in your advice doesnt it strike you as a little superfluous considering that lane has left us no other possible course  steel said nothing further and i was in no mood for conversation gaspards trail was to be sold on the morrow and lane had carefully chosen his time the commercial depression was keener than ever and there is seldom any speculation in western lands at that time of the year it was evidently his purpose to buy in my possessions  a cheerful red glow beat out through the windows of my dwelling when we topped the last rise but the sight of it rather increased my moodiness and it was in silence and slowly we rode up to the door of gaspards trail sally steel met us there and her eyelids were slightly red but there was a vindictive ring in her voice as she said suppers ready and im mighty glad youve come this place seems lonesome besides im most played out with talking and ive done my best today those auctioneering fellows have fixed up everything but it isnt my fault if they dont know how mean they are they finished with the house in a hurry and one of them said i cant stand any more of that shedevil  he did where are they now asked steel dropping his horses bridle and staring about him angrily but after a glance at sally who answered my unspoken question with a nod i seized him by the shoulder  steady who is hotheaded now i said  steel strove to shake off my grasp until his sister who laughed a little turned towards him i just took it for a compliment and theres no use in your interfering she said i guess neither of them feels proud of himself tonight and a cheerful row with somebody would spoil all the good ive done theyre camping yonder in the stable but youll tie up the horses in the empty barn  sally steel was a stanch partisan and knowing what i did of her command of language i felt almost sorry for the men who had been exposed to it a whole day in what was after all only the execution of their duty before steel returned one of them came out of the stable and approached me but catching sight of sally stopped abruptly and then as though mustering his courage came on again  i guess youre mr ormesby and im auctioneers assistant he said one could understand that you were a bit sore but i cant see that its my fault anyway and from what we heard you dont usually turn strangers into the stable  the man spoke civilly enough and i did not approve of his location but the rising color in sallys face would have convinced anybody who knew her that noninterference was the wisest policy  it is about the first time we have done so but this lady manages my house and if you dont like your quarters you must talk to her i said  the man cast such a glance of genuine pity upon me that it stirred me to faint amusement rather than resentment while the snap as we called it on the prairie which crept into sallys eyes usually presaged an explosion  if thats so i guess i prefer to stop just where i am he said  we ate our supper almost in silence and little was spoken afterwards sally did her best to rouse us but even her conversation had lost its usual bite and sparkle and presently she abandoned the attempt i lounged in a hide chair beside the stove and each object my eyes rested on stirred up memories that were painful now the cluster of splendid wheat ears above the window had been the first sheared from a bounteous harvest which had raised great hopes i had made the table with my own fingers and brought out the chairs with the crockery on the varnished shelf from winnipeg one winter when the preceding seasons operations had warranted such reckless expenditure the dusty elevator warrant pinned to the wall recalled the famous yield of grain whichbecause cattle had previously been our mainstayhad promised a new way to prosperity and now as i glanced at it led me back through a sequence of failure to the brink of poverty also bare and plain as it was that room appeared palatial in comparison with the elongated sod hovel which must henceforward shelter us at crane valley  the memories grew too bitter and at last i went out into the darkness of a starless night to find little solace there i had planned and helped to build the barns and stables which loomed about medenied myself of even necessities that the work might be better done and now when after years of effort and sordid economy any prairie settler might be proud of them all must pass into a strangers hands for very much less than their value tempted by a dazzling possibility i had staked too heavily and had lost and there was little courage left in me to recommence again at the beginning when the hope which had hitherto nerved me was taken away steel and his sister had retired before i returned to the dwelling and i was not sorry  the next day broke gloomily with a threat of coming storm but as it drew on all the male inhabitants of that district foregathered at gaspards trail they came in light wagons and buggies and on horseback and i was touched by their sympathy they did not all express it neatly indeed the very silence of some was most eloquent but there was no mistaking the significance of the deep murmur that went up when lane and two men drove up in a light wagon the former was dressed in city fashion in a great furtrimmed coat and his laugh grated on me as he made some comment to the auctioneer beside him then the wagon was pulled up beside the rank of vehicles and the spectators ceased their talking as dismounting he stood jaunty genial and débonnaire face to face with the assembly  even now the whole scene rises up before methe threatening lowhung heavens the desolate sweep of prairie the confused jumble of buildings the rows of wagons and the intent bronzed faces of the men in wellworn jean all were unusually somber but while a number expressed only aversion something which might have been fear mingled with hatred stamped those of the rest every eye was fixed on the little portly man in the fur coat who stood beside the wagon looking about him with much apparent goodhumor lane was not timid or he would never have ventured there at all but his smile faded as he met that concentrated gaze those who stared at him were for the most part determined men and even with the power of the law behind him and two troopers in the background some slight embarrassment was not inexcusable  goodmorning to you boys glad to see so many of you and i hope youll pick up bargains today he said and then twisted one end of his mustache with a nervous movement when again a growl went up it was neither loud nor wholly articulate though a few vivid epithets broke through it and the rest was clearly not a blessing several of the nearest men turned their backs on the speaker with as much parade as possible  dont seem quite pleased at something he said to me well it dont greatly matter whether theyre pleased or not may as well get on to business youve had your papers and didnt find anything to kick against ormesby  it is hardly worth while to ask considering your experience in such affairs the sooner you begin and finish the better ill be pleased i said  the auctioneers table had been set up in the open with the ticketed implements arranged behind it and the stock and horses in the wirefenced corral close beside he was of good repute in his business and i felt assured of fair play from him at least though i could see lanes purpose in bringing him out from winnipeg the latter was too clever to spoil a welllaid scheme by any superfluous petty trickery and with that man to conduct it nobody could question the legitimacy of the sale there was an expectant silence when he stood up behind his table  what is one mans gain is another mans loss and i feel quite certain from what i know of the prairie that none of you would try to buy a neighbors things way under their cost he commenced its mighty hard to make a fortune in times like these you know but anybody with sound judgment and the money handy has his opportunity right now youre going to grow wheat and raise beef enough down here to feed the world some day its a great country and the best bit in it youll find scheduled with its rights and acreage as the first lot i have to offer youthe gaspards trail holding with the buildings thereon the soil as you all know will grow most anything you want if you scratch it and the climate  needs a constitution of cast iron to withstand it interjected a young and sickly englishman who had benefited less than he expected from a sojourn on the prairie his comment was followed by a query from another disappointed individual say what about the gophers  im not selling you any climate was the ready answer even the gopher has its uses for without some small disadvantages the fame of your prosperity would bring out all europe here now gentlemen im offering you one of the finest homesteads on the prairie soil of unequaled fertility the best grass between winnipeg and calgary with the practical certainty of a railroad bringing the stock cars to its door and the building of mills and elevators within a mile from this corral  here lane standing close to the table whispered somethingunobserved he doubtless thoughtto the auctioneer whose genial face contracted into a frown lane had perhaps forgotten the latter was not one of the impecunious smaller fry who it was suggested occasionally accepted more than hints from him  the holder of the mortgage evidently considers that the railroad will not be built and it is very good of him to say soin the circumstances but we all know what a disinterested person he is continued the auctioneer and the honest salesman had at least secured the crowds goodwill a roar of derisive laughter and appreciation of the quickwitted manner in which he had punished unjustified interference followed the sally that after all is one persons opinion only and i heard from ottawa that the road would be built i want your best bids for the land and buildings with the stock cars thrown in youll never get a better chance but not all at once gentlemen  during the brief interval which followed i was conscious of quivering a little under the suspense the property if realized at normal value should produce sufficient to discharge my liabilities several times over but i dreaded greatly that under existing conditions a balance of debt would be left sufficient to give lane a hold on me when all was sold the auctioneers last request was superfluous for at first nobody appeared to have any intention of bidding at all and there was an impressive hush while two men from the cities who stood apart among the few strangers whispered together meanwhile i edged close in to the table so that i might watch every move of my adversary  lane wasnt wise when he tried to play that man the way he did said steel who stood beside me but i scarcely heeded him for carson haldane who must have reached bonaventure very recently nodded to me as he took his seat in a chair thorn brought him  then one of the strangers named a ridiculously small sum which steel amid a burst of laughter from all those who knew the state of his finances immediately doubled whereupon the bidder advanced his offer by a hundred dollars  another five hundred on to that cried steel and when my foreman thorn followed his cue with a shout of ill go three hundred better the merriment grew boisterous the spectators were strung up and uncertain in their mood very little i could see would rouse them to fierce anger and perhaps for that reason any opening for mirth came as a relief to them i had now drawn up close behind the table which formed the common center for every mans attention and scanning the faces about it saw lanes darken when the stranger called out excitedly ill raise him two hundred and fifty  lane rewarded thorn with a vicious glance and growled under his breath next he whispered something to the auctioneer who disregarded it while a few minutes later the bidder holding his hand up for attention said  i withdraw my last offer i came here to do solid business and not fool away my time competing with irresponsible parties who couldnt put up enough money to buy the chickenhouse is this a square sale mr auctioneer or is anybody without the means to purchase to be allowed to force up genuine buyers for the benefit of the vendor  thats lanes dummy and im going to do some talking now said steel  i was inclined to fancy that the usurer perhaps believing there was no such thing as commercial honesty had badly mistaken his man or that the auctioneer guided by his own quick wits saw through his scheme for he smote upon the table for attention  this is a square sale so square that i can see by the vendors looks he would sooner realize halfvalue than countenance anything irregular i took it for granted that these gentlemen had the means to purchase as i did in your own case no doubt you can all prove your financial ability  one of them is still in debt added the bidder  i had moved close behind lane and fancied i heard him say softly to himself ill fix you so youll be sorry for your little jokes byandby  a diversion followed goodwill to myself hatred of the usurer and excitement may perhaps have prompted them equally for after the wouldbe purchasers challenge those of my neighbors who had escaped better than the rest clustered about steel who had hard work to record the rolls of paper money thrust upon him hardly had his rival laid down a capacious wallet upon the table than steel deposited the whole beside it  i guess that ought to cover my call and now i want to see the man who called me irresponsible he said thats enough to raise me but to hint that any honest man would back up the thief of a mortgage holder is an insult to the prairie  a roar of laughter and approval followed but the laughter had an ominous ring in it and i saw sergeant mackay who had been sitting still as an equine statue in his saddle on the outskirts of the crowd push his horse through the thickest of the shouting men he called some by name and bantered the rest but there was a veiled warning behind his jest and two other troopers following him managed to further separate the groups the hint was unmistakable and the shouting died away while as the auctioneer looked at the money before him the man who had been bidding glanced covertly at lane  if you are satisfied with the good faith of these gentlemen ill let my offer stand he said  it doesnt count for much whether he does or not said haldane languidly ill raise him two hundred and fifty  im not satisfied with his broke in the irrepressible steel i cant leave my money lying round right under that mans hand mr auctioneer no sir i wont feel easy until ive put it where its safer besides he called me a friend of the mortgage holder and im waiting for an apology  the stranger from the cities grew very red in face and a fresh laugh which was not all goodhumor went up from the crowd but as the auctioneer prepared to grapple with this new phase of affairs a man in uniform reined in a gray horse beside the speaker and looked down at him there was a faint twinkle in his eyes though the rest of his countenance was grim and he laid a hard hand on the others shoulder  yell just wait a while longer charlie steel he said im thinking ye will at least be held fully responsible for anything calculated to cause a breach of the peace  thereafter the bidding proceeded without interruption haldane and his rival advancing by fifties or hundreds of dollars while when the prairie syndicates united treasury was exhausted which happened very soon a few other strangers joined in meanwhile the suspense had grown almost insupportable to me that i must lose disastrously was certain now but i clung to the hope that i might still start at crane valley clear of debt haldane was bidding with manifest indifference and at last he stopped  the auctioneer calling the price out looked at him but carson haldane shook his head and said with unusual distinctness the other gentlemen may have it i have gone further than i consider justifiable already  i saw lane glance at him with a puzzled expression and next moment try to signal the stranger who was clearly in league with him and fail in the attempt to attract his attention then i held my breath for after two more reluctant bids there was only silence when the auctioneer repeated the last offer  is there anyone willing to exceed this ridiculous figure its your last chance gentlemen going going and my hopes died out as he dropped the hammer  nothing left but to make the best of it said steel which was very poor consolation for i could see nothing good at all in the whole affair  there was much brisker bidding for the implements working oxen and remnant of the stock which were within the limits of my neighbors and who did their best but the prices realized were by comparison merely a drop in the bucket and i turned away disconsolate knowing that the worst i feared had come to pass all the borrowed money had been sunk in the improvement of that property and now the mortgage holder who had even before the sale been almost repaid owned the whole of it land and improvements and still held a lien on me for a balance of the debt  haldane met me presently and his tone was cordial as he said where are you thinking of spending the night  at crane valley with the others i answered shortly steel and my foreman are going to help me to restart there  i want you to come over to bonaventure for a few days instead he said a little rest and change will brace you for the new campaign and i am all alone except for my younger daughter  i looked him squarely in the face seeing that frankness was best my wits are not very keen today and i am a little surprised i said may i ask why you bid at all for my recent property you must have known it was worth much more than your apparent limit  haldane smiled goodhumoredly but in spite of this his face was inscrutable when i might at least have run the price up you wish to add well i had to redeem a promise made somewhat against my better judgment and i stoppedwhen it seemed advisable this as you may discover ormesby is not the end of the affair and if i could have helped you judiciously you may be sure that i would in the meantime are you coming back to bonaventure with me  he had told me practically nothing and yet i trusted him while the knowledge that his daughter had bidden him take measures on my behalf was very soothing after all beatrice haldane had not forgotten me it is very kind of you and i should be glad to do so sir i said  i found lane at the table as soon as the sale was over and he held out a sheet of paper you can verify the totals at leisure but you will see it leaves a balance due me he said it is rather a pity but the new purchaser requires immediate possession though he might allow you to use the house tonight ah here he is to speak for himself  the stranger who indorsed the statement looked first at lane and then at me in sidelong fashion there was nothing remarkable about him except that he had hardly the appearance of a practical farmer but the malicious enjoyment his masters eyes expressed and something in his voice set my blood on fire indeed i was in a humor to turn on my best friend just then  nothing would induce me to enter a house which belonged toyou i said turning to lane so far you have won hands down but neither you nor your tool has quite consummated your victory i shall see both of you sorry you ever laid your grasping hands on this property  you may be right in one way answered lane youll remember what happened to the fool bullfrog and youre looking tolerably healthy yet  i had hardly spoken before i regretted it the words were useless and puerile but my indignation demanded some outlet in any case lane shrugged his shoulders and the other man grinned while i had clearly spoken more loudly than i intended for several bystanders applauded and when i moved away sergeant mackay overtook me im surprised at ye rancher ormesby he said ye have not shown your usual discretion  i would not change it for yours i answered it is evidently insufficient to warn you that there are times when preaching becomes an impertinence  mackay only shook his head he wheeled his horse and with two troopers behind him rode towards the wagon which lane was mounting a deep growl of execration went up and the farewell might have been warmer but for the troopers presence as it was he turned and ironically saluted the sullenly wrathful crowd as the light wagon lurched away across the prairie then i was left homeless and was glad to feel haldanes touch on my arm light this cigar and jump in the team are getting impatient and lucille will be wondering what has kept us so long he said     chapter xiii  an unfortunate promise   haldane could command any mans attention when he chose to exert himself and i fancied made a special effort on my behalf during his homeward journey as a result of this i almost forgot that i was a homeless and practically ruined man as i listened to his shrewd predictions concerning the future of that region or occasionally ventured to point out improbabilities in some of them the depression however returned with double force when we came into sight of bonaventure soon after dusk and with it a curious reluctance to face the young mistress of the homestead  lucille haldane was my junior by several years indeed on our first meeting i had considered her little more than a girl but since then a respect for her opinions and a desire to retain her approval had been growing upon me perhaps it was because her opinions more or less coincided with my own but this fact would not account for the undeniable thrill of pleasure which had followed her naïve announcement that she believed in me hitherto with one exception i had figured before her as a successful man and i positively shrank from appearing as one badly beaten and brought down by his own overconfident folly i remembered how she once said you must not disappoint us  this seemed wholly absurd but the worst bitterness i had yet experienced made itself felt when haldane pulled up his team and pointing to a figure on the threshold of his homestead said lucille must have been getting impatient she is watching for us  i allowed him to precede me by as long a space as possible while i lingered to assist the hired man with a refractory buckle and then it was with an effort i braced myself for the interview haldane had vanished into the house but the slight graceful figure still waited upon the threshold and i wondered with a strange anxiety what his daughter would say to me  the question was promptly answered for as i entered the hall feeling horribly ashamed and with doubtless a very wooden face lucille haldane held out both hands to me her manner was halfshy wholly compassionate and i stood quite still a while comforted by the touch of the little soft fingers which i held fast within my own then she said very simply i am so sorry but you will have better fortune yet  a lamp hung close above us and it was perhaps as well that it did for the relief which followed the quiet words that vibrated with sincerity was more inimical to rational behavior than the previous causeless hesitation lucille haldane looked more girlish than ever and most bewitchingly pretty as glancing up at me partly startled by my fervent grasp she drew her hands away she seemed the incarnation of innocence freshness and gentle sympathy and perhaps as a result of the strain lately undergone there came upon me an insane desire to stoop and kiss her as or so at least it seemed a brother might have done  she may have grown suspicious for feminine perceptions are keen and though the movement was graceful and not precipitate a distance of several feet divided us next moment and we stood silent looking at each other while my heart beat at what appeared double its usual rate  you have given me new hope and those were the kindest words i have ever heard i said i think you meant them  lucille haldanes manner changed the change was indefinite but it existed and it was with a smile she answered me of course i did one does not generally trouble to deceive ones friends and we are friends are we not mr ormesby  no one could desire a better and i hope we shall always remain so i answered with an attempt at a bow and the girl turning preceded me into the big central hall  what kept you so long ormesby one could almost have fancied you had become possessed of an unusual bashfulness said haldane when we came in and i glanced apologetically at his daughter before i answered him  something of the kind happened and my excuse is that i had very little cause for selfconfidence now however i am only ashamed of the hesitation  you deserve to be said haldane with a mock severity which veiled a certain pride fortunately the young mistress of bonaventure atones for her fathers shortcomings and so long as she rules there will always be a welcome for anybody in adversity here as well as the best we can give to harassed friends it is a convenient arrangement for while according to my unsuccessful rivals i grow rich by paralyzing industries and unscrupulous gambling upon the markets lucille assists me to run up a counter score by proxy  the girls face flushed a little and it was pleasant to see the quick indignation sparkle in her eyes you never did anything unscrupulous and i do not think we are very rich she said  one might have fancied that haldane was gratified though he smiled whimsically and turned in my direction as he answered the last assertion at least is true if it proves anything for it is tolerably hard to acquire even a competence nowadays by strictly honest means isnt it ormesby you however do not know the inconvenience of having an uncomfortably elevated standard fixed for one to live up to and i am seriously contemplating a reckless attack on some national industry to prove its impossibility  the girls confidence in her father was supreme for though this time she laughed it was evident she did not believe a word of this it is well you are known by your actions and not your speeches she said there are commercial combinations which deserve to be attacked whyand her tone grew serious enoughdo you not crush the man or men who are doing so much mischief in our vicinity  haldane looked at his daughter and then across at me and while slightly ironical goodhumor was stamped on his face it was a mask there was more than one side to his character and when it pleased him to be so there was nobody more inscrutable it is a rather extensive order and men of that stamp are generally hard to crush he said still if those mistaken doctors should conspire to forbid me more profitable employment i might perhaps make the attempt some day  this was vague enough but i felt that haldane had intended the hint for me there was no further reference to anything financial for henceforward both my host and his daughter laid themselves out to help me to forget my troubles and were so successful in this that i even wondered at myself the troubles were certainly not far away but the financiers anecdotes and his daughters comments proved so entertaining that they diminished and melted into a somber background  when lucille left us haldane sat chatting with me over his cigar and at last he said abruptly i dare say you wondered at my halfhearted action today  i did sir i answered and the financier nodded goodhumoredly  there is nothing to equal plain speaking ormesby when a man knows just what he wants and asks for it he stands the best chance of obtaining it though i dont always act in accordance with the maxim myself well i made a few bids somewhat against my better judgment because i had promised to and then ceased because it seemed best to me that since you could not hold it lane should acquire the property  i dont quite see the reason sir on the other hand a stiff advance in prices would have meant a good deal to me i said  haldane answered oracularly that gentlemans funds are not inexhaustible and he already holds what one might call foreclosure options on a good deal of property i should not be sorry to see him take hold of further land so long as it did not lie west of gaspards trail it is possible that he has as we say in the vernacular bitten off more than he can chewconsidering the present scarcity of money i should take heart if i were you and hold on to crane valley whatever it costs you  cant you speak a little more directly i asked  haldane shook his head i am not in a position to do so yet but if surmises turn into certainties i will some day meanwhile are you open to train some of the bonaventure colts and look after my surplus stock on a profitdivision basis i have more than my staff can handle  i should be very glad to do so i answered seeing that while the offer was prompted by kindness it had also its commercial aspect but if there is anything going on say some plan for the exploitation of this district in opposition to lane can i not take my part in it  i have heard of no such scheme and if i had you could help it most by driving new straight furrows and raising further cattle said haldane with an enigmatical smile there are games which require a lifelong experience from the men who would succeed in them and because rome was not built in a day perhaps you were wiser to stick to your plowing ormesby one gets used to the excitement of the other life but the strain remains and that is one reason why you see me at bonaventure again  my hosts words encouraged me it was true he had said very little but that was always haldanes way and seeing that he now desired to change the subject i followed his lead i hope your health is not failing you again sir i said  save for one weakness my general health is good enough was the quiet answer still the weakness is there and for the second time this year physicians have ordered an interval of quietness and leisure one has to pay the penalty for even partial success you know and i am not so young or vigorous as i used to be  then if i may ask the question why not abandon altogether an occupation which tries you sir  haldane smiled over his cigar but a shadow crossed his face we are what the almighty made us ormesby and i suppose the restless gaming instinct was born in me even in my enforced leisure down here it is almost too strong for me and i indulge in it on a minor scale by way of recreation i cant sit down and quietly rust into useless inactivity further while handling a good deal of money my private share is smaller than many folks suppose it and i have my daughters future to ensure both have been brought up to consider a certain amount of luxury as necessary  i do not think the last words were intended as a hint for had haldane considered the latter necessary it is hardly likely i should have been welcomed so often at bonaventure in any case it would have been superfluous for i had already faced the worst and decided that beatrice haldane must remain what she had always been to mean ideal to be worshiped in the abstract and at a distance strangest of all once the knowledge was forced on me i found it possible to accept the position with some degree of resignation all this flashed through my mind as i looked into the wreaths of smoke and then haldane spoke  have you come across that photographer fellow lately  not for some time do you wish to see him i answered with a slightly puzzled air  i think i should like toand haldanes voice changed from its reflective tone do you know who he is ormesby  i should hardly care to say without consulting him sir i answered and haldane laughed  you need not trouble because i do if you chance upon him tell him what i said getting late isnt it goodnight to you  he left me equally relieved and mystified and that i should feel any relief at all formed part of the mystery whatever was the cause of it i was neither utterly cast down nor desperate when i sought my couch and i managed to sleep soundly  that was the first of several visits to bonaventure the acreage of crane valley was ample but the house a mere elongated sod hovel of which miss steel monopolized the greater portion although i reflected grimly that in existing circumstances it was quite good enough for me our life there was dreary enough and at times i grew tired of sallys alternate blandishments and railleries so when the frost bound fast the sod and but little could be done for land and cattle it was very pleasant to spend a few days amid the refinement and comfort which ruled at bonaventure during one of my journeys there i met cotton and rode some distance with him across the prairie i could see there was something he wished to say but his usually ample confidence seemed to fail him and finally he bade me farewell with visible hesitation where our ways parted i had however scarcely resumed my journey before he hailed me and when i checked my horse he rode back in my direction with resolve and irresolution mingled in his face  you are in a great hurry there was something i wanted to ask he commenced do you think this frost will hold ormesby  you have a barometer in the station havent you i answered regarding him ironically cotton you have something on your mind today and it is not the frost out with it man im in no way dangerous  i have he answered with a slight darkening of the bronze in his face it is not a great thing but your paternal advice and cheap witticisms pall on me now and then curious way to ask a favor isnt it but that is just what im going to do  well omit the compliments come to the point i said and the trooper made the plunge he had so much hesitated over  i want you to ride out on wednesday night and meet freighter walker coming in from the rail as you know he generally travels all night by the bitter lakes trail ask him for a packet with my name on the label then tear that label off and give mailcarrier steve the packet addressed to miss haldane those confounded people at the rail post office chatter so about every trifle and steve is too thick in the head to notice anything my rounds make it quite impossible for me to go myself and that fool of a freighter would certainly lose or smash the thing before he passed our way on his return journey it is not asking too much is it  no i said readily seeing the eagerness in the troopers eyes though that statement implied a long cold nights ride miss haldane is however in ottawa  i dont care where she is said cotton confoundof course i mean its very good of you but theres no use in assuming stupidity it is miss lucille haldane i mean you know  i might certainly have guessed it i said dryly it is no business of mine cotton but in return for your compliments i cant help asking do you think haldane would appreciate it  cotton straightened himself in his saddle and i was sorry for him he looked very young with that light in his eyes and the hot blood showing through his tan also i fancied very chivalrous  dont be under any misapprehension ormesby he said quietly that packet merely contains an article i heard miss haldane lamenting that she could not obtain it is of no value only useful but thursday is her birthday and i think she would be pleased to have it being trooper cotton i should never have presumed to send a costly present and you do not for a moment suppose miss lucille would appreciate the trifle for anything beyond its intrinsic utility this is the second time you have forced me to point out the absurdity of your conclusions  i was angry with him both for his infatuation and obtuseness for it struck me that in the circumstances the simple gift was made in a dangerously graceful fashion and calculated to appeal to a young womans sympathies i cant offer you advice i said  no was the answer one might surmise that you needed all your abilities in that direction for yourself still to prevent your drawing any unwarranted inference i may repeat that it would be quite unnecessary  i understand i said somberly feeling that there were two of us in the same position very glad to oblige you the times are out of joint for all of us just now cotton goodnightand on consideration i think the frost will hold  we rode in different directions and because i had made that unfortunate promise it was late on wednesday night when i prepared to leave bonaventure quietly haldane had journeyed to the railroad and could not return before midnight at earliest lucille informed me that she would be busy with some household affairs and as i could be back by morning it seemed possible that neither would miss me having promised the trooper secrecy i did not wish to answer questions or name excuses  as illluck would have it the last person i desired to meet chanced upon me as well wrapped in furs i was slipping towards the door and i must have looked confused when lucille haldane said where are you going mr ormesby  a little ride i answered i havei have some business to do and after two idle days begin to long for exercise  the girl looked hard at me and i saw she recognized that the excuse was very lame there is nobody living within reach of a short ride will you return tonight she asked  it was most unfortunate for i did not wish to anticipate the troopers gift i hardly think so i answered now i will make a bargain with you if you will keep my departure a secret you will discover what my errand is very shortly  very well said lucille haldane though she still seemed curious a safe journey to you but i dont envy you the exercise  i afterwards had cause to abuse trooper cotton and his errand but i swung myself into the saddle and when i reached the bitter lakes trail i patrolled it for two long hours under the nipping frost no lumbering oxteam however crawled up out of the white prairie though as yet the moon was in the sky and i decided that the freighter had as he sometimes did taken another trail it then fortunately occurred to me that i had promised to inspect some horses with a small rancher living four or five leagues away and so determined to do so in the morning a deserted sodhouse stood at no great distance which the scattered settlers kept supplied with fuel it served as a convenient halfway shelter for those who must break their long journey to the railroad settlement and i set out for it at a canter as i did so the moon dipped and darkness settled on the prairie     chapter xiv  the burning of gaspards trail   the hole in the roof of the sodhouse had been insufficiently stopped the green birch billets stored in a corner burned sulkily in the rusty stove so that the earthfloored room was bitterly cold still after tying my horse at one end of it and partly burying myself in a heap of prairie hay i managed to sink into a light slumber i awakened feeling numbed all through with the pain at the joints which results from sleeping insufficiently protected in a low temperature and looked about me shivering there was not a spark in the stove the horse was stamping impatiently and when a sputtering match had shown me that it was after two in the morning i rose stiffly anything appeared better than slowly freezing there and i strode out into the night leading the horse by the bridle  a cold wind swept the prairie and it was very dark but when we had covered a league or so and the exercise had warmed me a dull red glare appeared on the horizon a grass fire was out of the question at that season and it was evident that somebodys homestead was burning i was in the saddle the next moment and riding fast towards the distant blaze the frozen sod was rough the night very black and haste distinctly imprudent but i pressed on recklessly haunted by a fear that the scene of the conflagration was bonaventure reaching the edge of a rise i pulled the horse up with a sense of vast relief for a struggling birch bluff gave me my bearings and made it plain that neither haldanes homestead nor his daughter could be in peril  then it dawned on me that the fire was at gaspards trail and i sat still a minute irresolute i had no doubt that the recent purchaser was merely acting for lane and i felt tempted to resume my journey but curiosity or the instinct which calls out each prairie settler when his neighbors possessions are in jeopardy was too strong for me and i rode towards the blaze but much more slowly it was one thing to risk a broken limb when danger appeared to threaten bonaventure but quite another to do so for the sake of an unscrupulous adversary it would have been well for me had i obeyed the first impulse which prompted meand turned my back upon the fire  an hour had passed before i reached the house which had once been mine and after tethering the horse in shelter of an unthreatened granary i proceeded to look about me gaspards trail was clearly doomed one end of the dwelling had fallen in the logs dried by the fierce summer were blazing like a furnace and a column of fire roared aloft into the blackness of the night showers of sparks drove downwind barns and stables were wrapped in smoke but although the blaze lighted up the space about them there was nobody visible this was in one respect not surprising because the nearest homestead stood a long distance away but as the new owner had an assistant living with him i wondered what had become of them from the position of the doors and windows they could have had no difficulty in escaping so deciding that if the ostensible proprietor had deserted his property i was not called on to burn myself i proceeded to prowl about the buildings in case he should be sheltering inside one of them  finally i ran up against him carrying an armful of tools out of a shed and he dropped them at sight of me hallo where did you spring from blamed hard luck isnt it said he  niven for that was his name did not appear greatly disconcerted or was able to face his loss with enviable tranquillity he was a lanky thinfaced man with cunning eyes and i did not like the way he looked at me  i was out on the prairie and saw the blaze wheres your hired man and is there nothing better worth saving than these i asked  i havent seen wilkins since he woke me up was the answer he shouted that the place was burning and hed run the horses out of the stable and on to the prairie while i hunted up odd valuables and dressed myself he must have done it and ridden off to the nearest ranch for help for i havent seen him since the fire had got too good a hold for us to put it out  if i had hitherto entertained any doubts as to the ownership of gaspards trail the speakers manner would have dissipated them no man would in the circumstances have wasted time in speech had his own property been in danger and the sight of the homestead which i had spent the best years of my life in building now burning without an effort being made to save it filled me with indignation  youre the man who used to own this place arent you asked niven with a sidelong glance should have thought you would have had enough of it but you might as well help heave these things out now youre here  the question was innocent if unnecessary for i had spoken to him at the sale but the manner in which he put it made me long to assault him and i answered wrathfully ill see you and your master burned before i move a hand  im my own master worse luck said the other coolly before he commenced to gather up his load and then turned again as another man came up breathless  is that you ormesby come to see the last of it he said and i saw that the newcomer was boone or adams the photographer  i dont quite know what i came for i answered probably out of curiosity its too late to save anything even if there were more water in the well than there used to be  boone nodded as he glanced towards the house it was burning more fiercely than ever the straw roof of the stable which stood not far away was also well alight and we could scarcely hear each others voices through the crackling of blazing logs and the roaring of the flame it was moodily i watched it toss and tower now straight aloft now hurled earthwards by the wind in bewildering magnificence after many a hard days toil i had robbed myself of much needed sleep to fashion what the pitiless fire devoured and it seemed as though i had given my blood to feed the flame and that the hopes which had nerved me had dissipated like its smoke i can guess what youre feeling but a bad failure is sometimes the best way to success you will get over it said boone  i was grateful but i did not answer him for just then a rattle of wheels broke through the roar of the conflagration and two jolting wagons lurched into the glare black figures on horseback followed and a breathless man ran up trooper came round and warned us and theres more behind looks as if wed come too late he said  we formed the center of an excited group in a few more minutes for niven had joined us and when he had answered some of the many questions he asked one in turn it was my man wilkins warned you  i guess not was the answer trooper chapleau saw the blaze on his rounds and when the others had stated how the news had been passed on to them the new owner said then where in the name of thunder has the fool gone  a swift suspicion flashed upon me and i glanced at adams but his face was serene enough and when the question remained unanswered another thought struck me did you see him lead the horses out i asked  no was the answer he was good at handling beasts and i was way too busy to worry about him must have done it long ago i made sure hed lit out to ask for assistance when i saw the door had swung to  i twisted round on my heel whos coming with me to the stable boys i asked  the men looked at me and then at the fire the stable was built of the stoutest logs obtainable packed with sod and its roof of branches sod and straw piled several feet thick to keep out the frost a winddriven blaze eddied about one end of it but the rest of the low edifice appeared uninjured as far as we could see it through the smoke the glare beat upon the weatherdarkened faces of the spectators which glowed like burnished copper under it but if devoid of malicious satisfaction i thought i could read a resolve not to interfere stamped on most of them  theres nothing of yours inside and this fellow says the teams are clear said one a bigger fire wouldnt stop us if the place was ormesbys but when the man who allows he owns it does nothing ill not stir a finger to pull out a few forks and pails for that black thief lane  his comrades nodded and another man said its justice boys youll remember the night we brought redmond home  i knew the first speakers statement was true enough one and all would have freely risked their lives to assist even a stranger who had dealt fairly with them but they were stubborn men unused to oppression and recent events had roused all the slow vindictiveness that lurked within them i felt very much as they did but remembering something i was not quite certain that the teams were out of the stable and the dumb beasts had served me well before i could speak a police trooper came up at a gallop hallo what are you gaping at cant you stir around and pull anything clear of harms way boys he shouted  were not a montreal fire brigade and i forgot my big helmet said one  not a stir interjected another  wed pull the very sod up off the corral if youd run lane in for wholesale robbery added a third and it was not until the hoarse laugh which followed died away that i found my opportunity  im afraid the horses are inside there boys i said its not their fault they belong to lane and whether you come along or not im going to liberate them  there was a change in a moment i never saw even the most unfortunate settler illuse his beast though all young plow oxen and halfbroken broncos besides a good many old ones are sufficiently exasperating ormesbys talking now said somebody and there was an approving chorus get the poor brutes clear anyway coming right along then i started for the stable at a run with the rest of the company hard behind me  thick smoke rolled between us and the door and when we halted just clear of the worst of it a bright blaze shot up from the thatch the heat scorched our faces and one or two fell back with heads averted but the sound of a confused trampling reached us from the building weve got to get in before the poor brutes are roasted and do it mighty smartly said somebody  that at least was evident but the question how it was to be accomplished remained for i recoiled blinded and choking at the first attempt before i even reached the door i had framed it with my own hands of stout tenoned logs so that it would fit tightly to keep out the frost one of the posts loosened by the fire had settled apparently since the last person entered the building another man went with me the second time but though we managed to reach the handle the door remained immovable and once more we reeled back beaten when a strip of blazing thatch fell almost on our heads because the roof fed it the fire was mostly on the outside of the building  solid as a rock gasped my companion say somebody find a lariat and well heave her out by the roots  a rope was found and with difficulty hitched about the handle after which a dozen strong men grasped the slack of it a glance at their faces illumined by the glare showed that the thought of the suffering beasts had roused them and they were in earnest now there was a heave of brawny shoulders a straining of sinewy limbs and the line of bodies swayed backwards as one when a voice rose all together heave your best  i felt the straining hemp contract within my grasp trampling feet clawed for a firmer hold on the frozen sod and i could hear the men behind me panting heavily the door remained fast however and again a breathless voice encouraged us this time does it out she comes  the rope creaked the trampling increased and a man behind kicked me cruelly on the ankle during his efforts but instead of the jammed door its handle came out and the next moment we went down together in one struggling heap there was a good birch log by the granary well use it for a ram i gasped  two men brought the log which was unusually long and heavy for that region where the stoutest trees are small and boone and i staggered with the butt of it into the smoke the rest grasped the thinner end swung it back and drove the other forward with all the impetus they could furnish the door creaked but the most manifest result was the fall of a further strip of burning thatch on us  we must manage this time spluttered boone if we once let go it will be too late before anyone else takes hold again  once more the door defied us the heat was almost stifling the smoke thicker than ever but choking panting and dripping with perspiration we managed to swing and guide the end of the log until the battered frame went down with a crash and we two reeled over it into the building the fire which traveled along the roof had eaten a portion out but though one strip of the interior was flooded with lurid light the smoke of a burning hay pile rolled about the rest a horse was squealing in agony one stall partition had been wrenched away and another kicked to pieces while two panicstricken brutes blundered about the building the rest were plunging and straining at their tethers and there was a curious look in boones face as he turned to me  somebody will risk being kicked to death before we get them out i wish we could give their owner the first chance he said  several of the agonized beasts had been in times of loneliness almost as human friends to me others had in their own dumb faithful way helped me to realize my first ambitions and the sight of their suffering turned me savage do you know anything of this i asked  boone wheeled around on me with a menace in his eyes but apparently mastering his temper with an effort laughed unpleasantly no take care you are not asked the same question are you disposed to let the horses roast while we quarrel  the latter at least was out of the question and i had only paused to gather breath and consider a plan of operations for it is by no means easy to extricate frantic beasts from a burning building the others in the meantime were gathering around and we set about it as best we could at times thick smoke wreaths blew into our eyes the heat grew insupportable and the first horse i freed would have seized me with its teeth but that i smote it hard upon the nostrils two men were knocked down and trampled on another badly kicked but amid an indescribable confusion the task was accomplished until only one badly burned horse and another with a broken leg remained inside the building  we cant leave them to grill i said thorn used to keep an old shotgun inside the chopchest lid  it was boone who brought me the weapon and the burned horse was quickly put out of its misery but a portion of the roof fell in as i ran towards the other this one lay still and i saw recognized me it had carried me gallantly on many a weary ride and was the one on which lucille haldane had leaped across the fence i felt like a murderer when it turned its eyes on me with an almost human appeal for all that i could do was to press the deadly muzzle against its head the shock of the detonation shook down a shower of blazing fragments and i had turned away with a horrible sense of guilt when somebody shouted theres a man in the end stall  the stall was hidden by the smoke but now that the emptied stable was quieter a voice reached us faintly through the vapor wont anyone take me out of this  several of us made a rush in that direction but so far as memory serves only boone and i reached the stall and groping around it blindly came upon something which resembled a human form we lifted it between us and the man both groaned and swore then staggering through the vapor we came blackened burned a little and halfasphyxiated into the open the rest were already outside and when we laid down our burden they stood about him panting  youve nearly killed me between you boys but it wasnt your fault he gasped horse fell over me when i tried to turn him loose the halfarticulate words which followed suspiciously suggested that the sufferer was cursing somebody and i caught the name of lane before he lapsed into semiconsciousness  its pretty simple one of the onlookers said the way ormesby fixed that door it shut itself he got some bones smashed and was turned halfsilly by the shock couldnt make us hear him even if he had sense enough my place is the nearest and ill take him along  i heard my name called softly and saw boone standing apart from the rest i want to ask why you spoke as you did a little while ago he said  i did not stop to reflect just then but ill hear your explanation if you care to volunteer one before i apologize i said  i was camped under a bluff with the wagon when i saw the blaze and as the distance was not great i came in on foot was the answer that is the simple truth do you believe it  yes i said for his manner impressed me in turn you also hinted something  i was giving you a warning said boone you are dealing with a dangerous man and cant you see that if there is any doubt concerning the fires origin a charge might be worked up against you be careful what you say but as i see the sergeant yonder you need not mention my presence unless it is necessary  i alluded to haldanes desire to see him and when he vanished followed the rest into the presence of sergeant mackay who ubiquitous as usual had mysteriously appeared he sat motionless in his saddle with slightly compressed lips though his keen eyes moved along the encircling faces it was evident that he was making an official inquiry and the owner of the homestead was speaking  my name is niven late of the brandon district and i purchased this property recently he said  any partners asked the sergeant and i noticed a gleam of what appeared malicious satisfaction in the others face as he answered no you will find my name recorded as sole owner all was right when i turned in about ten oclock but i didnt notice the time when my hired man wilkins roused me to say the house was burning had too much to think about cant suggest any cause for the fire and it doesnt count much anyway for the result is certain house and stable burned outand all uninsured  had ye any other hired man than wilkins interposed the sergeant and niven answered no stable didnt seem to be burning when i first got up but wilkins said it was swept by sparks and hed get the horses out one of them must have knocked him down and he was only found at the last minute  who was the first man ye met when ye went out asked the sergeant  my predecessorormesby said niven  mackay appeared to meditate before he spoke again where did ye meet him and what did he say  slipping around the corner of a shed and he said hed see me burnt before he stirred a hand to help was the prompt answer then mackay questioned several others before he turned to me  how did ye happen to come to gaspards trail henry ormesby  i was riding out from bonaventure to intercept the freighter and saw the blaze i answered indignantly i certainly refused to help niven at first for i had little cause for goodwill towards him or the man behind him but afterwards i saved most of his working beasts  there was a murmur of assent from the bystanders but the sergeant disregarding it spoke again did ye meet the freighter  no i said bluntly  mackay smiled ye did not i passed him an hour gone by on the buffalo trail what was your business with him  to ask him for a package  all that should be easily corroborated was the answer and i was glad that the examination was over for remembering boones warning it appeared that my answers might give rise to unpleasant suspicions it also struck me that in the hurry and confusion nobody had noticed him or remembered it if they had done so while somewhat strange to say after the last brief interview i had full confidence in his statement that he knew nothing about the origin of the fire  im thinking that will do in the meantime chapleau yell ride in to the depot and wire for a surgeon now boys are any of ye willing to take niven home asked mackay  apparently none of them were willing though at last two offers were reluctantly made it was the only time i ever saw the prairie settlers deficient in hospitality but the mans conduct had confirmed their suspicions as to his connection with lane which was sufficient to prejudice the most generous maybe he would be comfortable if i took him along with me mackay said dryly  thereupon the assembly broke up and i rode back to bonaventure reaching it with the first of the daylight blackened and singed while as it happened lucille haldane was the first person i met where have you been your clothes are all burned she said  gaspards trail is burned down and i helped to save some of the horses i answered wearily and i never forgot the girls first startled look she appeared struck with a sudden consternation it vanished in a moment and though she looked almost guilty her answer was reassuring  of course that is just what you would do but you are tired and must rest before you tell me about it  i was very tired and slept until noon when i told my story to haldane and his daughter together the former made very few comments but presently i came upon lucille alone and laid my hand on her shoulder as i said do you know that somebody suggested it was i who burned gaspards trail  the girls color came and went under my gaze then she lifted her head and met it directly ii was afraid you might be suspected and for just a moment or two when you first came in looking like a ghost i did not know what to think she said but it was only because you startled me so  i would not like to think that you could believe evil against me i said and lucille drew herself up a little do not be ungenerous as soon as i could reason clearly i knew it was quitequite impossible  i hope any work of that kind is i said and lucille haldane turning suddenly left me     chapter xv  beauty in disguise   winter passed very monotonously with us in the sodhouse at crane valley when the seasons work is over and the prairie bound fast by iron frost the man whom it has prospered spends his wellearned leisure visiting his neighbors or lounging contentedly beside the stove but those oppressed by anxieties find the compulsory idleness irksome and i counted the days until we could commence again in the spring the goodwill of my neighbors made this possible for one promised seedwheat to be paid for when harvest was gathered in another placed surplus stock under my charge on an agreement to share the resultant profit while haldane sent a large draft of young horses and cattle he had hardly hands enough to care for under a similar arrangement  i accepted these offers the more readily because while prompted by kindness the advantages were tolerably equal to all concerned so the future looked slightly brighter and i hoped that better times would come if we could hold out sufficiently long the debt i still owed lane however hung as a menace over me while althoughdoubtless because it suited himhe did not press me for payment the extortionate interest was adding to it constantly some of my neighbors were in similar circumstances and at times we conferred together as to the best means of mutual protection  in the meantime the fire at gaspards trail was almost forgottenor so at least it seemed haldane much against his wishes spent most of the winter at bonaventure but his elder daughter remained in montreal boone the photographer appeared but once and spent the night with us he looked less like the average englishman than ever for frost and snowblink had darkened his skin to an indians color and when supper was over i watched him languidly as we lounged smoking about the stove sally steel had managed to render the sodhouse not only habitable but comfortable in a homely way and though she ruled us all in a somewhat tyrannical fashion she said it was for our good  theres a little favor i want to ask of you ormesby but i suppose you are all in one anothers confidence said boone  yes i answered we are all in one sense partners with a capital of about ten dollars and are further united by the fear of a common enemy  boone laughed silently though his face was a trifle sardonic that is as it should be and you may have an opportunity for proving the strength of the combination before very long i have as i once told you a weakness for horses and cattle and i couldnt resist purchasing some at a bargain a little while ago i want you to take charge of them for me here are particulars and my idea of an equitable agreement he laid a paper on the table and i glanced through it the conditions were those usual in arrangements of the kind which were not then uncommon but though cattle and horses were lamentably cheap they could not be obtained for nothing and the total value surprised me  we are as honest as most people down this way and we take one anothers word without any use for spilling ink observed the irrepressible sally  i once heard of a grasping storekeeper being badly beaten over a deal in butter by a clever young lady said boone and steel laughed while his sister frowned  he deserved it but you seem to know just everything she said  some people are born clever and some handsome but it is really not my fault said boone with a smile at sally for instance i know what ormesby is thinking he is wondering where i got the money to pay for those beasts  the laugh was against me but i answered frankly that was in my thoughts but i also wondered what i had done to merit the trouble you have taken to do me a kindness  dont flatter yourself said boone it is a matter of business and equally possible that i wished to do some other person the opposite you must decide tonight because i have a new assortment of beautifiers and cosmetics in my wagon which i must set about vending tomorrow they would not of course be of any use to miss sally but i am going on to the swedish settlement where the poor people need them  it was not delicate flattery but boone was quick at judging his listeners capacity and it pleased miss steelthe more so because a certain scandinavian damsel was her principal rival in the question of comeliness she drew herself up a little while boone smiled whimsically you know it is true he said  the man had always interested me he was at home anywhere and his tongue equally adept at broad prairie raillery or finely modulated english yet one could see that there was a shadow upon him  you need have no compunction ormesby i really made only one successful attempt at housebreaking in my life he said do you accept the offer  yes with many thanks though i dont quite see why you make it in writing i said there are however a good many other things i dont comprehend just now and sometimes i feel that i am being moved here and there blindly to suit other persons unknown purposes the position does not please me  boone laughed there is something in the fancy you are the kings bishop and im not sure that as yet even the players quite know their own game of course you are aware that lane holds a power of attachment against you  at present there is nothing but the prairie sod to attach though i dont see why he does not at once grab as much as he is entitled to of that i said if i get enough time i may be able to pay him off after harvest  i hope you will was boones answer and changing the topic he entertained us with the quaintest anecdotes  some time had passed since that evening and spring had come suddenly when i commenced my plowing hitherto little wheat had been grown so far west but the soil was good and i knew that sooner or later there would be grain elevators in crane valley though the subsoil was still frozen the black clods that curled in long waves from the moldboards side were steaming under the april sun and as i tramped down the quartermile furrow my spirits rose with the freshness of the spring it was good to be up and doing again and the coming months of strain and effort would help me to forget thorn and steel who were also plowing shouted jests as they passed and it was with a contentment long strange to us we rested at noon some distance divided the breaking from the house and we lay on the warm grasses basking in the radiance of the cloudless sun over our simple meal  the whole prairie was flooded with it the air sweet and warm and we recommenced our task with pulses which throbbed in unison with that of reawakening nature the long months of darkness and deathlike cold had gone green blades presaging the golden ears would soon shoot upwards from every furrow and one drank in the essence of hope eternal in every breath of air anxiety faded into insignificance and one rejoiced in the mere possession of physical strength while the tender greenness checkering the frostnipped sod testified again that seed time and harvest should not fail so long as the world rolled onward from darkness into light  we came home more cheerful than we had been for months but i felt an instinctive foreboding when i saw cotton talking to sally beside the corral fence she was apparently bantering him but there was satisfaction in his face as after some jests of hers he glanced at the stripes on his sleeve  i guess hes much too proud to look at you theyve made him a corporal said sally  there was a contrast between us spring plowing is not cleanly work and the mire which clung about our leggings had also freely spattered our old jean overalls cotton was immaculate in new uniform and sat a trim soldierly figure on his freshly caparisoned horse  here is a note for you from bonaventure he said i was riding in to the railroad with some dispatches and to bring out our pay when miss haldane asked me to give it to you  i saw a faint sparkle in sallys eyes at the mention of bonaventure as i said it was very good of you to ride so far round your superiors are punctilious are they not  with the exception of mackay whos away they dont leave one much discretion said the corporal still i have time to spare and dont suppose anybody will be much the wiser in any case miss haldane said the note was urgent andthough having to call at the reservation i might have passed this way on my homeward journeyi came at once  the missive brought a frown to my face our hired men are busy and corporal cotton will kindly take you this it ran father who went east for a day or two writes me to let you know immediately that lane is coming over shortly to attach your horses and cattle  i saw at once that if the moneylender seized our working beasts in the midst of plowing when nobody had a team to spare our prospects of a harvest would be ruined however i reflected with grim satisfaction that the beasts were not mine and that every man is entitled to protect the property entrusted to him read that i said passing it to thorn you had better start after supper and let the southside boys know ill warn the others and it strikes me that lane will have his work cut out to drive off a single head  we had forgotten the bearer of the message though once or twice i heard sallys voice and cottons laugh but on turning towards the house i saw he had backed his horse away from the corral and was somewhat dubiously regarding the fence sally leaned against it watching him with an assumption of ironical admiration  ill see that you keep your promise if i win he said and the girl laughed mockingly  if you dont ill try not to cry over you she retorted and i guessed the madcap had made some wager with him that he could not leap the fence sally afterwards declared penitently that she never fancied he would attempt it but i could see by the lads face he meant to take the risk  your horse is not fresh enough and youll certainly break your neck i shouted  cotton glanced over his shoulder then gathered up his bridle while as i ran towards him sallys heart must have failed her for she called out dont ill pay forfeit  we were both too late the corporal had touched the beast with the spurs and man and horse were flying towards the tall and wellbraced fence i held my breath as i watched for i had nailed the birch poles home securely and had not much faith in the beasts leaping powers it launched itself into the air then there was a crash and the top rail flew into splinters while horse and rider parted company the former after rolling over scrambled to its feet but the uniformed figure smote the ground with a distressful thud and lay very still sally screamed and must have climbed the fence for when we had run around by the slip rails she was bending over the limp figure stretched upon the sod her eyes were wide with terror  he is dead and i have killed him she said  i bent down with misgivings for cotton did not move and there was something peculiar about his eyes can you hear us are you badly hurt i asked  whats that he answered drowsily and i gathered courage remembering symptoms noticeable in similar cases but thorn had administered a dose of prohibited whisky before he became intelligible i was not wholly sorry for sally but seeing that she had been sufficiently punished i said there are no bones broken and his pulse is regaining strength  cottons scattered senses were evidently returning for he looked up saying im only shaken miss steel and i won the bet dont be in a hurry ormesby i hardly fancy i could get up just yet  we waited several minutes then forcibly refusing miss steels assistance carried him into the house and laid him on a makeshift couch in our generalroom his color was returning but his face was awry with pain and so he expressed it something had given way inside his back it was a dismal termination to an inspiriting day and the old depression returned with double force as i glanced at the untasted meal on the table at lucille haldanes note and around the disordered room sally looked badly frightened steel very grim and cotton seemed to be suffering  it will pass presently and you had better get your supper he said i must try to eat a morsel for i have a long way to ride tonight  you are not going to move off that couch until morning at least i said but the corporal answered i simply must is the horse all right  doesnt seem much the worse said steel and sally held a teacup to the corporals lips and afterwards coaxed him very prettily to eat a little seeing this the rest of us attacked the cold supper for we had duties that must be attended to returning to the house some little time later i found that sally had disappeared and cotton was standing upright he moved a few paces and then halted leaning heavily on the table while his face grew gray with pain  lie down at once you are not fit to move i said  it means degradation and heaven knows what besides unless i can reach the depot tonight he said mackay is away and the other mans a castiron martinet while i have just got my stripes and a hint of something better you see we are not supposed to undertake private errands when under definite orders and there are special reports and a receipt for the pay in my wallet  he made another attempt to reach the door then staggered and grasping his arm i settled him with some difficulty once more on the couch you are right theres nothing left but to face the inevitable he said trying to check a groan  i forgot my own anxieties in my regret i am very sorry this should have happened i said you were far too generous but cant one of us take in the papers and get the money  cotton tried to smile though his fingers twitched miss haldane asked me and it would be no use they wouldnt give you the money and if they did how would that get over the fact that im lying here helpless why couldnt it have happened on the return journey  did you tell miss haldane you were running a risk i asked  would one naturally do so when she asked a favor he answered with a trace of indignation  it was of course absurd of corporal cotton but i felt very sorry for him when he laid his head down with a groan and i subsequently surmised that sally had overheard part at least of the conversation for when the lad who had perhaps not wholly recovered from the weakness of the shock sank into sleep she called me  its all my fault and ill never forgive myself but i never guessed hed rush the fence she said they couldnt put him in prison  they might turn him out of the service which in his eyes would be worse i answered dryly it should be a lesson to you sally you cant help being pretty but that is no reason why you should so often lead some unfortunate man into difficulties  sallys penitent expression vanished and there was a flash in her eyes you are so foolish all of you and i guess you neednt look wise harry ormesby he is perhaps a little worse than the restand thats why one likes him when he wakes you and charlie have just got to take those tight things off him and put him in your berth if anybody wants him the next day or two theyll have to tackle me  we did so presently and after seeing that our patient was comfortable sally returned wearing his uniform tunic how does this fit me she asked  steel looked angry and i grew thoughtful nobody who knew her was as a rule astonished at sallys actions but she asked the question soberly with no trace of mischief  do you wish me to say that you would look well in anything i asked  i dont you can tell lies enough when you trade horses she answered tartly its a plain questionhow does this thing fit me  tolerably well and i surveyed her critically it is a trifle large but if you dont draw it in too much at the waist it wouldnt fit you badly are you going to turn police trooper sally  miss steel was not generally bashful but she looked a trifle confused as she answered dont ask any more fool questions  i went out soon afterwards to overhaul a plow under a shed and had spent considerable time over it when steel approached with a lantern have you seen anything of sally he asked  no i answered carelessly what mischief has she been contriving now  thats just what im anxious to know that and where the corporals horse is he said theyre both missing and cottons fast asleep iand steel used a few illegal expletives before he continuedi cant find his uniform either  it must be somewhere you cant have looked properly i said and steel restrained himself with an effort  you can try yourself and id give a hundred dollars if i had it to see you find it he said  i hurriedly left the plow but though we hunted everywhere could discover no trace of the missing uniform i didnt think we would said the harassed brother with a groan of dismay sheswell the lord only knows what sally would do if she took the notion and theres no shirking the trouble ive got to find out if she has the whole blame outfit on  ill leave you to settle that point i said and hearing the locked door of sallys portion of the house wrenched open and garments being hurled about i surmised that steel was prosecuting his inquiries he flung the split door to with a crash when he came out leaving as i saw by a brief glimpse ruin behind him and he grew very red in the face as he looked at me  it will be a mighty relief when she marries somebody he said gloomily the only comfort is that youre a sensible man and one could trust you ormesby you will never breathe a word of this theres no use trying to catch her for she can get as much out of a beast as any man  i pledged myself willingly smothering a wild desire to laugh and as it happened it was i who met the truant riding home very wearily two days later her mount was a chestnut while cottons horse was gray and there was a bundle strapped before her still except for a spattering of mire she was dressed in a manner befitting a young lady and actually blushed crimson when i accosted her  where have you been sally and where did you get the horse  in to the railroad and i borrowed him from carsleys wife theyll send the corporals over she said im very tired harry ormesby wont you get me supper instead of worrying me  silence seemed best and i could not resist the appeal and so hurried back to set about the supper while what passed between brother and sister i do not know though when they came in together sally appeared triumphant and steel in a very bad humor  im going to see whether you have let the patient starve youll come along with me she said when she came out of her own quarters with no trace of the journey about her we entered the leanto shed which steel and i occupied together and found cotton better in health though as depressed as he had been all day sally held out a bag and a handful of documents towards him  there are your papers and money now all you have to do is to get well again she said demurely  there was no mistaking the relief in the corporals face and he positively clutched at the articles she handed him you dont know what this has saved me from but how did you get them  a flush of telltale color crept into sallys cheeks and i noticed that her voice was not quite steady as she answered him you must solemnly promise never to ask that again or to tell anyone you were not at the depot yourself nobody will ask you we fixed it up so well now promise before i take them back again  the lad did so and sally glanced at me if harry ormesby ever tells you ill poison him  i do not think corporal cotton ever discovered sallys part or who personated him though he apparently suspected both steel and myself but when we went out together i turned to the girl just one question and then well forget it how did you manage at the depot sally  miss steel avoided my glance but she laughed it was very dark there was only a halftrimmed lamp and the agent was most asleep its pretty easy anyway to fool a man she said     chapter xvi  the defense of crane valley   it was two days before cotton could be sent to the police outpost in a wagon but so far as we could gather the officer temporarily in charge took it for granted he had been injured on his homeward ride around by the indian reserve which would have led him through crane valley some time however passed before he was fit for the saddle meanwhile steel and i discussed lanes latest move and the best means of counteracting it  if we knew just what he wanted it would give us a better show but we dont and lane doesnt tell anybody my comrade observed gloomily  its tolerably clear that he wants crane valley said i and steel proceeded then why doesnt he sail in and take all hes entitled to  a part would not satisfy him when he wants it all i said if he seizes the working beasts and breeding stock now we shall be left helpless for the season he will take just enough to cripple me and leave me still in debt while it would be useless to try to raise money to pay him off until the question of the railroad is settled  will it ever be built asked steel  it must be some day but whether that will be before we are ruined or buried heaven only knows i said haldane seems to think the time will not be long and judging by his tactics lane agrees with him still the newspapers take an opposite view  if it isntand steel frowned at the harness he was mendingwhat will we poor fools do  stand lane off as long as possible and then strike for the mines in british columbia that however concerns the future and we have first to decide what we will do if lane arrives tomorrow  steels face grew somber but he waited until i added then because theyre not my beasts as yet if he can take them by main forceand i almost hope hell tryhe is welcome to do so  now youre talking and steel smote a dilapidated saddle until the dust leaped forth from it the law on debt liens is mighty mixed but i figure that the man who can keep hold has the best of it jacques gordon and the rest will stand by us solid and id work two years for nothing to get a fair chance at lane  we both determined on resistance but it struck me that ours was a very forlorn hope and that the odds were heavily against two plain farmers equally devoid of legal knowledge and of capital who had pitted themselves against a clever unscrupulous man with the command of apparently an unlimited amount of money  lane did not come next day nor the following one  indeed a number passed without bringing any word of him and because idleness meant disaster we perforce relaxed our vigilance and resumed our plowing i had just yoked a pair of oxen to a double plow one morning when boones wagon came lurching up as fast as two whitened horses could haul it across the prairie  lane came in with a hardlooking band of rascals by the pacific mail last night he said they had got whisky somewhere and smashed the hotel windows because imrie wouldnt get them supper in the middle of the night he would start as soon as they were partly sober are you prepared to protect your property ormesby  i am ready to protect other peoples which will suit me a good deal better in this instance i said with a certain satisfaction that the time for open resistance had come at last though lane had cunningly chosen a season when every mans presence was necessary at his own homestead  dont count too much on that said boone if you have no documentary evidence even the actual owners might have difficulty in substantiating your claim now you see why i demanded a written agreement it strikes me that in this case possession is everything  if i can keep whole in body until sundown possession will remain with us i said but there is no time to spare for talking it will take hours to bring my neighbors up  of course you arranged with haldane to send you assistance said boone and hurled out an expletive when i answered stolidly that is just what i did not do i do not even know whether he is at home it is not necessary to drag all ones friends into a private quarrel  goodness knows why you are so unwarrantably proud and it is not worth while wasting time over that question now said boone roll up your thickheaded stockmen im going on to bonaventure for the one man whose presence would be worth a hundred of them  he lashed his horses as he spoke and i roused myself to action while long before his wagon dipped over the rim of the prairie thorn had set out at a gallop to bring our neighbors in a neighbor may dwell from one to ten leagues away in that country this left only steel and me to hold crane valley with the exception of sally the girl absolutely refused to leave us and it may not have been by accident that several heavyhandled brushes lay convenient beside the stove the stock were driven off as far as we dare follow them across the prairie and we hoped they would remain unseen in a hollow the working horses were made fast in the stable and when a few head of pedigree cattle had been secured in the corral we could only sit down and wait the siege  i spent several hours perched most uncomfortably on the roof with a pair of glasses but though the day was clear nothing appeared above the rim of the prairie it spread all around the horizon in low rolling rises empty and desolate my eyes grew dazzled the continued use of the glasses produced a distressful headache but still nothing moved on either rise or level and it was a relief when at last sally hailed me come down and get your dinner scenery wont feed anybody  i had forgotten there was such a thing as food and my throat and lips were dry but on descending i was surprised to find myself capable of making an excellent meal  youll feel considerably better after that said sally who watched our efforts with much approval i guess you have forgotten you had no breakfast either of you  thats so assented her brother its the first time i ever forgot it in my life say what are you going to do with that big haspbar sally  miss steels movements were perhaps a little nervous but she was evidently not troubled by timidity i figured if anybody wanted to come poking in here it might keep them outif it was nicely warmed she said  you must do nothing rash and you must keep out of harms way sally i said sternly they would be justified in seizing my household property  theres mighty little of it and miss steel glanced around the room with contempt do you figure lane would come out hundreds of miles for your old crockery anything thats pretty round this place is mine and im anxious to see the man whos going to take it from me  i looked at the excited girl and then at her brother who shook his head in signal that further remonstrance would be useless my ideas respecting women had changed of late and i somewhat resented the fact that they would not be content to sit still and be worshiped but must insist on playing an active and often a leading part in all that happened  when sally has made up her mind theres no use for anybody to talk said steel  i had hardly mounted to the roof again before a line of diminutive objects straggled up above the horizon and i called down theyre coming  which way was the eager question and steel stamped when i answered moodily from the south  lanes outfit cant you see the others he shouted  i swept the glasses around the circumference of the prairie and my voice was thick with disappointment as i answered no  then you and i will have all we can do and i wish to the lord sally were anywhere else said steel  the diminutive figures rapidly resolved themselves into mounted men with a wagon behind them but still all the rest of the prairie was empty and each time steel asked the question cant you see them yet i grew more doggedly savage as i answered no  at last when the moneylenders party were close at hand i called out that three horsemen were just visible in the north thats gordon jacques and the rest cant be here for a long while its time to come down said steel  i came down guessing that lane being on a lower level could not see our allies and waited with steel apparently unarmed though we had weapons handy in the space between the house and the stable sally had disappeared inside the dwelling and i trusted that she would remain there presently amid a rattle of gear and a confused trampling a band of men rode up to the homestead and ranged themselves in rude order on each side of a wagon some of them yelling in imitation of the american cowboy as they wheeled they were unkempt dirty and dissolute in appearance and i was not altogether surprised to see that most of them were english or americans one finds very little errant rascality on the canadian prairie perhaps because our money is very hardly earned and there are few people worth exploiting there but odd specimens exported from the great republic and from the old country by disgusted friends gravitate towards the smaller western cities when they find life in the waste too hard and lane had evidently collected some of the worst of them he sat in the wagon smoking and actually smiled at me  kind of surprise party isnt it ormesby he said ive come round to collect what i can in accordance with the notice served on you heres a wallet full of papers and this gentleman represents legal authority he had a partner but we lost him now ive no personal feeling against you and wont give you any trouble if it can be avoided  strange to say i believed he spoke no more than the truth and regarded us dispassionately as merely a source from which a little profit might be wrung neither steel nor i however could look at the matter with equal calmness we were standing for our rights and ready to strike for shelter and daily bread while the memory of former wrongs and a fierce revolt against the rich mans oppression fired our blood nevertheless i remembered that it was necessary to gain time and answered as coolly as i could  in the first place the stock and horses belong to my neighbors and in the second you will be overstepping limits if you violently break into any part of my homestead neither does the law allow any private individual to gather a band of ruffians and forcibly seize his debtors property  lane probed his cigar with slow deliberateness you are growing quite smart ormesby but isnt it a pity you didnt display your acumen earlier i dont know that a stable can be considered a dwelling under the homestead regulations and theres nothing to prevent any man from hiring assistance to drive home sequestrated cattle it is this gentlemans business to seize them not mine neither is it clear how far a proved agreement to feed another persons stock frees them of a lien for debt have you got any in writing  it was evident that in homely parlance my adversary held the best end of the stick the administration of justice is necessarily somewhat roughandready in the west and i saw that the representative of legal authority was at least twothirds drunk i also had little doubt that lanes mercenaries would act independently of him while if they exceeded legal limits there would be only our testimony to prove it against a dozen witnesses possession was evidently everything  lane had possibly guessed my thoughts for he said dont be mad enough to start a circus ormesby we have come a long way for the beasts and mean to get them cant you see that we could beat you if it came to testimony and i dont mind admitting that these rascals are not particular  his tranquillity enraged me but i managed to answer him if you drive a hoof off you will have to defend your action against richer men than i  well ill take my chances it would cost them piles of money and they would gain nothing then he said say officer hadnt you better begin  gotsh any papersh to prove objection demanded that individual turning to me and i took no pains to hide my disgust as i answered if i had i should not trouble to show them to you  steel however broke in we have ill show you a receipt for so many beasts to be fattened for roland adams  whersh you keep them demanded the other  where you wont find them way back on the prairie steel answered triumphantly  it was a blunder for the other who had a little shrewdness left straightened himself then all the beastsh heah belong to someone else he said with a tipsy leer and waved his hand to the rest no papersh worth a shent whasher foolin for well just walk into the stable  several men sprang from their saddles but steel reached the door ahead of them and stood with his back against it swinging a great birch staff nobody comes in here he said  i was at his side the next moment with a keen hayfork and the men halted in a semicircle at the sight of our grim faces  these points will reach anybody within six feet i said  better quit fooling while your hides whole theres most a dozen of us said one while another criticised my personal appearance in uncomplimentary terms one or two in the background advised their comrades as to how we might best be maimed but stood fast themselves for steel was big and brawny and looked coolly murderous as he balanced the heavy staff while whoever looked at me did so over the twin points of steel the interlude lasted at least a minute and i listened with strained attention for the thud of hoofs gordon could not be far off but he remained invisible behind a low rise even if the buildings had not obscured our view then a newcomer shoved his way through the rest and i saw that he was the genuine article as he stood before me in montana cattleriders dress  its a mighty poor show youre making boys he said contemptuously stand out of my way you can pick up the pieces when ive done with them  he danced up and down a few paces and yelled either to bewilder or to impress us and i was conscious of a grim amusement while steel watched him narrowly then for the man had spirit enough he leaped at steel like a panther with something in his hand that twinkled he was however a second too late for the birch staff met him in the center of his face and falling like a log he lay where he fell steel deliberately snapped the knife beneath his heel and lane shouted something as my comrade said the next man i down at that trick will get his skull smashed in  there was a wrathful cry from the others which convinced me that if we took our eyes off them for an instant the rush would come but they hesitated and steel standing poised with one foot forward and baleful eyes made the staff whistle round his head youre a mighty long time beginning whos nextor maybe you only brought one man along he said  wheres that blamed officer i guess this is his job said one but the worthy mentioned drew further back from the edge of the group  deputsh you my authority thish not a house only beastsh live in stables he explained  better get it over sail in said one of the biggest and there was a shout of look out from steel  four or five men made a rush upon us and not wishing to inflict lethal injuries unless my life were threatened i had barely time to reverse the fork before they were within striking distance another reeled backwards headlong beneath the staff and knowing that a thrust is more effective and harder to evade than a blow i used the longhafted fork bluntend foremost as a pike with considerable success the struggle continued for perhaps a minute and was sharp while it lasted several times a panting man got within my guard and steel brought him down but i was struck heavily and had only a blurred vision of waving arms scowling faces and the whirling staff while the air seemed filled with discordant shouts of encouragement from those outside either by sheer force of desperation or by the power of better weapons we wore them out and the group broke up one or two limped badly as they straggled back some swore and there was blood on the faces and garments of the rest  one fellow got me badly on the chest said steel who breathed heavily and i was conscious of several painful spots and when i had recovered breath i saw that lane had drawn his wagon back some distance and was apparently upbraiding his bodyguard in no measured terms  jump clear cried steel presently and i sprang aside a moment too late for an exultant shout went up when a heavy billet struck me on the head i felt the blood trickle warm and sticky into one eye and i fell against the door feeling faint and sick then stiffened myself again with the fork held points foremost this time lane it seemed had lost control of his followers and would doubtless rely on hard swearing to protect himself from unfortunate consequences for i now suspected there would be bloodshed unless help arrived very shortly  theyre going for the house and sallys inside there cried steel and for the first time i remembered that the dwelling was unprotected and feared that the girl had not slipped away as she might have done by a rear window  one of lanes men reached the threshold before we did and three or four others followed hard upon his heels the door was wide open and i sincerely trusted that sally had made her escape she had not however for the handle of a long brush swung out and the first ruffian who rushed at the entrance staggered backwards against the comrade behind him steel flung him headlong the next moment the rest yielded passage before the tines of the fork and we sprang into the house while our enemys reinforcements came up at a run so far we had succeeded better than might have been expected but our adversaries were growing furious and the defense of our property no longer appeared the main question the girl had dropped the brush and grasped a redended iron bar  give it to me and reach down that rifle sally i gasped and while steel dragged up furniture for a barricade the rest not knowing its magazine was empty recoiled before the winchester muzzle  ill be through in another minute keep them out steel said  a brief respite followed for the iron was glowing still and our enemies supply of missiles was evidently exhausted but as we waited wondering what would happen next i heard a beat of hoofs and sally cried out triumphantly as three wellmounted men swept up at a gallop  ride over them shouted somebody warning cries went up there was a scattering of lanes ruffians and the leading horseman pulled up his beast just outside the door he was dripping with perspiration bespattered all over and his horse was white with lather  couldnt get through earlier jacques boys are away but we sent a man to look for them and hell bring them along he said  we were very glad to see rancher gordon and his sturdy followers though it was bad news he brought further reinforcements could hardly arrive in time to be of service and where we had expected more than a dozen we must be content with three meanwhile lanes men had mounted and were trotting off across the prairie  they have probably gone in search of the loose stock come in we have got to talk over our next step i said  the newcomers did so and we were all glad of a breathing space my head was somewhat badly cut several purple bruises adorned my comrades countenance and the rest had ridden a long way in furious haste at first the conference was conducted in halfbreathless gasps then the voices deepened into a sonorous ring and i can recall the intent bronzed faces turned towards me the thoughtful pauses when each speaker had aired his views and how the slanting sunlight beat into the partly shadowed room last of all rancher gordon spoke we are waiting to hear your notions ormesby  the stable and corral must be held at any cost i said smearing my hands as i tried to clear my eye while red drops splashed from them on to the table while that ought to be possible we are hardly strong enough to force a fight in the open unless it is necessary lanes rascals may not find the stock and may only be trying to draw us off so my decision is to remain here if they are successful we can see them from the roof and must run the risk of taking their plunder from them should we fail we could follow them when our friends turn up  thats about my notion well see you through with it said gordon quietly  we had waited a considerable time before steel hailed us from the roof that he could see our enemies riding south behind a bunch of cattle and we mounted forthwith there were now three rifles among us but we had agreed these were not to be used unless somebody fired upon us riders and cattle dipped into a hollow and we had covered several miles before we sighted them again lane and the representative of authority no longer accompanied them the whole body wheeled around and halted when we came up there was sweet grass in the hollow so the cattle halted too and for a space we sat silent looking at one another i dare not risk a blunder in face of such odds though i determined to make an effort to recover the stock  you make us tired said the american whose face was partly covered by a dirty rag go to perdition before we make you  he waved his arm around the horizon as though to indicate where the place in question lay and i edged my horse a little nearer to him he was the leading spirit and it seemed possible that we might perhaps disperse the rest if i could dismount him the man had evidently recovered from steels blow  we are not going away without the cattle and you can see there are more of us now while two proved too many for you before i said still decreasing the distance between us but my adversary perhaps divined my intention for a short barrel glinted in his hand when he raised it  its going to be different this time keep back while youre safe he said  there was apparently no help for it and i was not quite certain he would shoot so balancing the long fork lance fashion i tightened my grip on the bridle when gordon drove his horse against me and gripped it violently hold on the boys are coming he said  friends and foes alike had been too intent to notice anything beyond each other during the past few minutes but now a drumming of hoofs rose from behind the rise which shut in the hollow then a drawnout line of mounted men came flying down the slope and steel flung his hat up with a triumphant yell its the bonaventure boys he said theres adams and miss haldane leading them  the american looked in my direction and raised his hand in ironical salute im sorry to miss a clinch with you it would have been a good one but i cant stay he said get on you skulking coyotes unless youre smart in lighting out those cow drivers wont leave much of you  his subordinates took the hint and bolted down the hollow as hard as they could ride while i drew a deep breath and turned towards the rescue party     chapter xvii  the raising of the siege   they were splendid horsemen who rode to our assistance and their beasts as fine but a slight figure led them a clear length ahead in another minute gordons men copied their leader who trotted forward with his broad hat at his knee and i rode bareheaded withthough i had forgotten thisan ensanguined face to greet the mistress of bonaventure she was glowing with excitement and i had never seen anything equal the fine damask in her cheeks she started at the sight of me and then impulsively held out a wellgloved hand  i hope you are not badly hurt she said  only cut a trifle i answered gripping the little hand fervently you have done a great deal for us and no doubt prevented serious bloodshed it was wonderfully  dont it was not in any way wonderful my father was absent when mr boone brought me the news and as you know i am responsible for the prosperity of bonaventure in his absence our cattle were in jeopardy  she ceased abruptly and grew pale while i felt ashamed when i saw the cause of it my hands had been reddened from clearing my eyes and glove and wrist were foul with crimson stains courageous as she was the girl had sickened at the sight of them  i cant excuse myself you must try to forgive me i said please dont look at it  lucille haldane promptly recovered from the shock of repulsion how could you help itand you were hurt protecting our cattle i can see the brand on some she said it was very foolish of me to show such weakness  you must come back to the house with me at once and rest i said im indebted to you boys but the best way you could help me would be to drive those cattle into the corral then for you are probably tired and hungry come up and see what sally steel can find for you  the newcomers hesitated and inquired whether they might not pursue and chastise our adversaries instead but lucille haldane rebuked them you will do just what rancher ormesby tells you she said and turning towards me added i am ready to go with you  lucille was still a trifle pale and wondering because i could not see myself that one with so much spirit should be affected by such a small thing i presently dismounted and led her horse by the bridle i had torn off the offending glove and when we halted by the corral would have removed the stains from the wrist with a handkerchief  no said lucile snatching her hand away just too late with a gesture of dismay do not touch it with that please  then i remembered that the handkerchief had last been used to rub out the fouled breach of a gun the girl looked at the blur of red and black which resulted from my efforts and frowned then broke out into a rippling laugh beatrice said your ways were refreshingly primitive and i think she was right she said  the laugh put heart into me but i still held the bridle with an ensanguined hand close beside the little smeared one and so followed by as fine an escort as a princess could desire we came to my door side by side  however when i helped lucille haldane from the saddle i had misgivings concerning the reception steels sister might accord her sallys loyalty to her friends was worthy of her name but she was stanchly democratic more than a little jealous and not addicted to concealing her prejudices the fears were groundless sally was waiting in the doorway she had defended and while i hoped for the best the two stood a moment face to face they were both worthy of inspection though the contrast between them was marked haldanes daughter was slight and slender with grace and refinement stamped equally on every line of her delicately chiseled face and on the curve of her dainty figure down to the little feet beneath the riding skirt sally was round and ruddy of countenance stalwart in frame with the carriage of an amazon and i think could have crushed lucille with a grip of her arms but both had an ample portion of the spirit of their race  then steels sister stepping forward took both the girls hands within her own stooped a little and kissed her on each cheek after which she drew her into the house leaving her brother and myself equally astonished he looked at me whimsically and though i tried i could not frown  thats about the last thing i expected how does it strike you he said afraid of committing yourself well i dont mind allowing i expected most anything else all women are curious but theres no understanding sally  we were not left long to wonder for miss steel reappeared in the doorway  you two still standing there as if there were nothing to do get a big fire on in the outside stove and kill about half the chickens youre not to come in harry ormesby until ive fixed you so youre fit to be seen  i feared that lucille heard her and wondered what she thought our mode of life was widely different from that at bonaventure and from what would have been for me possible had i not fallen into the hands of lane  we slew the chickens with the assistance of the newcomers and sat down on the grass to pluck them a fowl for every guest although i was slightly uncertain whether that would be sufficient there is a similarity between the very old and the very new and ancient poets perhaps best portray the primitive sometimes heroic life of effort the modern stockrider and plowman lead on the prairie  why did you bring miss haldane boone you should have known better than to allow her to run the slightest risk i said on opportunity and the photographer smiled enigmatically  miss haldane did not ask my permission and i am doubtful whether anybody could have prevented her she said she was mistress of bonaventure and the way the men stirred when she told them was proof enough that one could believe her  presently sally came out with a roll of stickingplaster and while every bachelor present offered assistance and advice she proceeded to fix me as she expressed it then amid a burst of laughter she stood back a little to survey her work with pride  i guess you can come in you look too nice for anything gordon and adams youll walk in too the rest will find all you want in the cook shed and it will be your own fault if you dont help yourselves  i was a little astonished when with a cloth bound round my head i entered the house for miss steel was in some respects a genius there was no trace of disorder sally was immaculately neat lucille haldane might never have passed the door of bonaventure and the two had apparently become good friends while a table had been set out with sallys pretty crockery and as i noticed an absolutely spotless cloth which was something of a rarity i was glad of the presence of boone for gordon was a big gaunt silent man and the events of the day had driven any conversational gifts we possessed out of both steel and myself when it pleased him adams by which name alone he was known to the rest could entertain anybody and that too in their own particular idiom there was no trace of the pedlar about him now and his english was the best spoken in the old country i noticed lucille haldane looked hard at him when she took her place at the table  it is curious but i have been haunted by a feeling that we have met before today she said if i am mistaken it must have been somebody who strongly resembles you  for just a moment boone looked uneasy but he answered with a smile i dont monopolize all the good looks on the prairie  the girl flashed a swift sidelong glance at me and i feared my countenance was too wooden to be natural i am sure of the resemblance now though there is a change it was one evening at bonaventure was it not she said have you forgotten me  that would be impossible and boone bent his head a little as he made the best of it i see that if necessary i could rely on miss haldanes kindness a second time  lucille looked thoughtful sally inquisitive and i feared the latter might complicate circumstances by attempting to probe the mystery neither gordon nor steel noticed anything but boone was a judge of character and lucille keen of wit he asked nothing further but i saw a question in his eyes  i think you could do so she said you seem to have trusty friends rancher ormesby though that is not surprising on the prairie  the words were simply spoken and wholly unstudied but lucille haldane had a very graceful way and there was that in her eyes which brought a sparkle into those of sally and i saw had made the silent gordon her slave her gift of fascination was part of her birthright and she used it naturally without taint of artifice  could anybody doubt it after today i said  then boone smiled dryly i suppose it devolves upon me to acknowledge the compliment and i am afraid that some of his friends are better than he deserves he said at least i am willing to testify that rancher ormesby does not importune them for i never met any man slower to accept either good advice or wellmeant assistance have you not found it so miss steel  all you men are foolish and most of you slow sally answered archly i had to convince one with a big hard brush today  this commenced the relation of reminiscences mostly humorous of the affray for we could afford to laugh and all joined in the burst of merriment which rose from outside when several horsemen came up at a gallop across the prairie a stockrider of caledonian extraction had borrowed my banjo to amuse his comrades and they appreciated his irony when he played the new arrivals in to the tune of the campbells are coming  then he took off his hat to the uniformed figure which led the advance yere surely lang in comin sergeant dear he said  there was another roar of laughter and i heard mackays voice it was no my fault and ye should ken what kind of horses ye sell the government but now im here im tempted to arrest the whole of ye for unlawful rioting  he halted in the doorway with displeasure in his face and disregarding my invitation waited until miss haldane bade him be seated while before commencing an attack upon a fowl he said dryly maybe i had better begin my business first it would be a poor return to eat your supper and than arrest ye ormesby  you had better make sure of the supper and if you can take me out of the hands of my allies you are welcome to i said  boones lips twitched once or twice as though in enjoyment of a hidden joke as he discoursed with the sergeant upon the handling of mounted men and horses he showed i fancied a curious knowledge of cavalry equipment and maneuvers and mackay was evidently struck with his opinions i also saw lucille haldane smile when the sergeant said if ever ye pass my station come in and see me its a matter o regret to me i had not already met ye  thanks said boone just moving his eyebrows as he looked across at me i narrowly missed spending some time in your company a little while ago  and now to business said mackay with a last regretful glance at the skeletonized chicken from what i gather ye are all of ye implicated i would like an account from mr adams and miss haldane first  how did you come here instead of gardiner and how do you know there is anything for you to trouble about i asked and the sergeant showed a trace of impatience  gardiner goes back tomorrow ye are my own particular sheep and it would take a new man ten years to learn the contrariness of ye i heard some talk at the railroad and came on in a hurry do ye usually nail your stable or cut your own head open rancher ormesby  each in turn furnished an account of the affray i last of all and mackay expressed no opinion until lucille haldane asked him was it not justifiable for me to take measures to protect my fathers cattle  supposing the bonaventure brand had not been on that draft and lanes men retained possession what would ye have done was the shrewd rejoinder and lucille smiled as she looked steadily at the speaker  i really think sergeant that i should have ridden over them  mackay seemed to struggle with some natural feeling but the silent rancher smote the table by the lord you would and id have given five hundred dollars to go through beside you he said  ye are quite old enough to ken better said mackay sententiously and the rancher squared his shoulders as he answered  im as good as any two of your troopers yet and was never run into a cattle corral when im old enough to be useless ill join the police  what were ye meaning asked the sergeant  gordon laughed just that for a tired man its a nice soft berth you take your money and as much care as you can that you never turn up until the troubles over  before mackay could retort lucille smiling raised her hand i think you should both know better and i want you to tell me sergeant what will be the end of this surely nobody has any right to drive off cattle and horses that dont belong to him  mackay looked somewhat troubled and one could guess that while eager to please the fair questioner he shrank with official caution from committing himself its not my part to express an opinion on points that puzzle some lawyers he said still i might tell ye that it will cost one man his position human natures aye deceitful miss haldane and if rancher ormesby prosecuted them it would be just two or three mens word against a dozen forby they might make out illegal resistance against him  sergeant said lucille haldane looking at him severely dare you tell me that you would not take the word of three ranchers against the oath of a dozen such men as lane  mackay smiled though he answered dryly theyre both hard to manage and ungrateful for their benefits but maybe i would still i am ye see neither judge nor jury would ye prefer a charge against them ormesby  i was willing enough to do so but had already reflected every moment of my time was needed the nearest seat of justice was far away and it would be only helping lane if i wasted days attempting to substantiate a charge i also surmised by his prompt disappearance when the fracas became serious that it would be very difficult to implicate my enemy even if he did not turn the tables on me boone when i looked at him made a just perceptible negative movement with his head  i must leave this affair to the discretion of the police i said several of lanes friends have good cause to be sorry for themselves already and it is hardly likely his action will be repeated  mackay said nothing further and shortly afterwards lucille said she must take her departure sally stood smiling in the doorway while the riders of bonaventure did her homage and those whose compliments did not please her suffered for their clumsiness when i rode out with lucille haldane there was a lifting of wide hats and the sergeant sitting upright in his saddle saluted her as we passed with several splendid horsemen riding on each side  i afterwards heard that sally said to him mischievously i guess you men dont quite know everything how long did it take you to break your troopers in yonders a slip of a girl who knows nothing of discipline or drill and theres not a man in all that outfit wouldnt ride right into the place where bad policemen go if she told him to as good as your troopers arent they what are you thinking now  the sergeant followed her pointing hand and as it happened lucille and i were just passing beyond the rise riding close together side by side mackay looked steadily after us and doubtless noticed that lucille rode very well i would not blame them im just thinking im sorry for corporal cotton he said  sally looked away across the prairie and turning saw a faint smile fade out of the sergeants face what do you mean cant you ever talk straight like a sensible man she asked  the corporals young an needs considerable convincing was the dry answer  when we dipped beyond the rise i turned to lucille haldane what did you think of sally she is a stanch ally but not always effusive to strangers i said  i could not at the moment understand lucille haldanes expression the question was very simple but the girl showed a trace of confusion and was apparently troubled as to how she should frame the answer this did not however last long and when she raised her eyes to mine there was in them the same look of confidence there had been when she said i believe in you it was very pleasant to see  i think a great deal of her and must repeat what i said already you have very loyal friends miss steel told me at length how kind you had been to her and her brother and i think they will fully repay you  my wits must have been sharpened for i understood and blessed both sally and the speaker if lucille haldane being slow to think evil had faith in those she knew it was possible she was glad of proof to justify the confidence and sally must have furnished it  they have done so already i said  there was always something very winning about my companion but she had never appeared so desirable as she did just then the day was drawing towards its close and the light in the west called up the warm coloring that the wind and sun had brought into her face and showed each grace of the slight figure silhouetted against it the former was perhaps not striking at first sight though with its setting of ruddy gold and its hazel eyes filled with swift changes it was pretty enough but its charm grew upon one and i noticed that when she patted the horses neck the dumb beast moved as though it loved her there was nothing of the amazon about its rider except her courage  i have heard a good deal about your enemy and yourself of late but there are several points that puzzle me and though i know you have his sympathies father is not communicative she said for instance if you do not resent the allusion he could with so little trouble have made a difference in the result of your sale  how could that be i asked merely to see how far the speakers interest in my affairs had carried her and she answered even if there had been nothing we needed at bonaventure he could have made the others pay fair prices for all they bought i cannot understand why he said it was better not to do so  i also failed to understand but a light broke in upon me did you suggest that he should i asked and the girl answered with some reluctance yes was it not natural that i should  no one who knew you could doubt it i said and lucille haldane presently dismissed me i sat still and watched her and her escort diminish across the long levels and then rode slowly back towards crane valley remembering haldanes mention of a promise the news that it was his younger daughter who sent him to my assistance brought at first a shock of disappointment i had already convinced myself that beatrice haldane must remain very far beyond my reach but the thought that she had remembered me and sent what help she could had been comforting nevertheless now it seemed that she had forgotten and that that consolation must be abandoned too and yet the disappointment was not so crushing but that i could bear it with the rest what might have been had passed beyond the limits of possibility and there was nothing in the future to look forward to except a struggle against poverty and the wiles of my enemy  steel took my horse when i rode up to the house and it was a coincidence that his first remark should be we beat him badly this time and hell lie low a while then i guess youll want both eyes open when he tries his luck again     chapter xviii  the vigilkeeper   it was a clear starlit night when i rode across a tract of the assiniboian prairie some two hundred miles east of crane valley a halfmoon hung in the cloudless ether and the endless levels lying very silent under its pale radiance seemed to roll away into infinity they had no boundary for the blueness above them melted imperceptibly through neutral gradations into the earth below which gathering strength of tone stretched back again to the center of the lower circle a vast sweep of silvery gray  there was absolute stillness not even a grass blade moved but the air was filled with the presage of summer and the softness of the carpet which returned no sound beneath the horses feet had its significance that sod had been bleached by windpacked snow and bound into iron hardness by months of arctic frost bird and beast had left it and the waste had lain empty under the coldness of death but life had once more conquered and the earth was green again even among the almost unlettered born upon it there are few men impervious to the influence of the prairie on such a night and in days not long gone by the halfbreed voyageurs told strange stories of visions seen on it during the lonely journeys they made for the great furtrading company its vastness and its emptiness impresses the human atom who becomes conscious of an indefinite awe or is uplifted by an exaltation which vanishes with the dawn for there are times when through the silence of measureless spaces mans spirit rises into partial touch with the greater things unseen  my errand was prosaic enoughmerely to buy cattle for haldane and others on a slidingscale arrangement i could see a possibility of some small financial benefit and that being so had reluctantly left crane valley where i was badly needed because the need of money was even greater also as time was precious i had decided to travel all night instead of spending it as a guest of the last farmer with whom i bargained i was at that time neither very imaginative nor oversentimental but the spell of the prairie was stronger than my will and yielding to it i rode dreamily so it seemed beyond the reach of petty troubles and the clamor of our sordid strife into a shadowy land of peace which defying the centuries had retained unchanged its solemn stillness the stars alone sufficed to call up the fancy for there being neither visible heavens nor palpable atmosphere only a blue transparency the eye could follow the twinkling points of flame far backwards from one to another through the unknown spaces beyond our little globe nothing seemed impossible on such a night and only the touch of the bridle and the faint jingle of metal material  it was in this mood that i became conscious of a shadow object near the foot of a rise it did not seem a natural portion of the prairie and when i had covered some distance it resolved itself into a horse and a dismounted man his broad hat hung low in his hand his head was bent and he stood so intent that i had almost ridden up to him before he turned and noticed me then as i checked my horse i saw that it was boone  what has brought you here i asked  that i cannot exactly tell you when we know so little of the influences about us on such a night as this it is at least one stage of a pilgrimage i must make he said  had this answer been given me in the sunlight i should have doubted the speakers mental balance but one sets up a new standard of sanity on the starlit prairie on a night of spring and i saw only that the spell was also upon him he held a great bunch of lilies which do not grow on the bare western levels in one hand and his face was changed even in boones reckless humor there had been a sardonic vein which sometimes added a sting to the jest and i knew what the shadow was that accounted for his fits of silent grimness now he seemed strangely calm but rather reverent than sad  i cannot understand you i said  no he answered quietly how soon you have forgotten but you helped me once come and i will show you  he tethered his horse to an iron peg beckoned me to do the same and then moving forward until we stood on the highest of the rise pointed to something that rose darkly from the grass then i remembered and swung my hat to my knee as my eyes rested on a little wooden cross following the hand he stretched out i could read the rude letters cut on ithelen boone  he stooped and i fancied with some surprise lifted a glass vessel from beneath a handful of withered stalks he shook them out gently laid the fresh blossoms in their place and a faint fragrance rose like incense through the coolness of the dew then he turned and i followed him to where we had left the horses there are still kind souls on this earth and one of them placed that vessel under the last flowers i left you have a partial answer to your question now  i bent my head and seeing that he was not averse to speech said quietly you come here sometimes it is a long journey  yes was the answer and boones voice vibrated she who sleeps there gave up a life of luxury for me and is a threehundredmile journey too much to make or a summer night too long to watch beside her i am drawn here and there are times when one wonders if it is possible for us to rise into partial communion with those who have passed into the darkness before us  it is all i answered gravely a mystery to me can you conceive such a possibility  not in any tangible shape to such as i but this at least i know in spite of the destruction of the mortal clay when i can see my way no further and lose courage in my task fresh strength comes to me after a night spent here  your task i said i guessed that there was a motive behind your wanderings  there is one and boones voice rose to its natural level the wagon journeys suit it well had lane ruined me alone i should have tried to pay my forfeit for inexperience and the risk i took gracefully but when i saw the woman who had lain down so much for me fading day by day that he might add to his power of oppressing others the money which would have saved her life the case was different the last part he played in the pitiful drama was that of murderer and the loss he inflicted on me one that could never be forgiven  and you are waiting revenge i asked  no boone looked back towards the crest of the rise at first i did so but it is justice that prompts me now i have a full share of human passions and once i lay in wait for him with a riflemy throat parched and a fire of torment in my heart but when he passed at midnight within ten paces i held my hand and let him go perhaps it was because i could not take the life of even that venomous creature in cold blood and feared he would not face me perhaps another will was stronger than my own for with every purpose strained against what seemed weakness it was borne in on me that i could not force him to stand with a weapon and that i dare not kill him groveling then the power went out of me and i let him go yet i have twice lain long hours in hot sand under a deadly rifle fire ormesby there are many mysteries and as yet it is very little that we know  but you are following him still are you not i asked and boone continued as i said it is for justice and it was here i learned the difference i would not take the reptiles life unless he met me armed in the daylight which he would never do but for the sake of othersyou and the rest whose toil and blood he fattens oni am waiting and working for the time when without a crime it may be possible to end his career of evil  we were both silent for a few minutes and i felt that boones task selfimposed or otherwise was a worthy one lane was a man without either anger or compassionan incarnation of cunning and avarice more terrible to human welfare than any legendary monster of the olden time it was no figure of speech to declare that he fattened on poor mens blood and agony and his overthrow could not be anything but a blessing still it was in prosaic speech that considering the practical aspect of the question i said i wish you luck but you will need a long patience besides time and money  i have them was the answer the first was the hardest to acquire timei could wait ages if i knew the end was certain and as to money when it came too late to save her someone died in the old country and part of the property fell to me well you can guess my purposeusing all means short of bloodshed and perjury to take him in his own net she who sleeps there was pitiful and gentle but she hated oppression and cruelty and i feel that if she knowsand i think it is soshe would smile on me  boones face was plain before me under the moon it was quietly confident calm and yet stamped with a solemn purpose he had it seemed mastered his passions and would perhaps be the more dangerous because he followed tirelessly with brain unclouded by hatred or impatience i felt that there was much i should say in the shape of encouragement and sympathy but the only words that rose to my lips were he has fiendish cunning  and i was once a careless fool said boone still the most cunning forget and blunder at times i however can never forget and when he does it will be ill for lane i havei dont know whyspoken to you ormesby as i have spoken to no man in the dominion before and i feel i need ask no promise of you i am going east with the sunrise but i must be alone now  i left him to keep his vigil with his dead and camped in a hollow some distance away that is to say i tethered the horse rolled a thick brown blanket round me and used the saddle for a pillow there was no hardship in this the grasses if a trifle damp were soft and springy the night still and warm and many a better man has slept on a worse bed in the western dominion slumber did not however come at first and i lay watching the stars neither asleep nor wholly awake until they grew indistinct and a womans figure impalpable as the moonlight gathered shape upon a rise of the prairie  it was borne in on me that this was helen boone risen from her sleep for she was ethereal and her face with its passionless calmness not that of a mortal while no shadow touched the grasses when she passed and fading gave place or changed into one i knew haldanes elder daughter looked down at me from the rise but she too seemed of another world wearing a cold serenity and a beauty that was not of this earth she also changed with a marvelous swiftness before my bewildered vision and it was now lucille haldane who moved across the prairie with soft words of pity on her lips and yet anger in her eyes she at least appeared not transcendental but a living breathing creature of flesh and blood subject to human weaknesses and i raised myself on one elbow to speak to her  the prairie was empty nothing moved on it even the horse stood still while when i sank back again moonlight and starlight went out together and perhaps it was as well for sleeping or waking a plain stockraiser has no business with such fancies and next morning i convinced myself that i had dreamed it all i had doubtless done so and the explanation was simple the influence of the night or the words of boone had galvanized into abnormal activity some tiny convolution of the brain but even that once granted it formed the beginning not the end of the question and boone had it seemed supplied the best solution when he said we know so little as yet  the sun was lifting above the prairie when i set out in search of boone with my horses bridle over my arm i met him swinging across the springy sod in long elastic strides but there was nothing about him which suggested one preyed upon by morbid fancies or the visionary his eyes were a little heavy but that was all for with both of us the dreams of the night had melted before the rising sun the air had been freshened by the dew and the breeze which dried the grasses roused one to a sense of human necessities and the knowledge that there was a days work to be done i was also conscious of an unfanciful and very prosaic emptiness  i wonder where we could get anything to eat i have a long ride before me said boone when he greeted me  it can hardly be safe for you to be seen anywhere in this neighborhood i said and boone smiled  i walked openly into the railroad depot and asked for a package yesterday you forget that i partly changed my appearance while so far as memory serves only two police troopers occasionally saw me the othersyou should know your own kind better ormesby do you think any settler in this region would take moneyand lane offered a round sumfor betraying me  no i answered with a certain pride that is to say not unless he were a nominee of the man you name  no proof of this was needed but one was supplied us a man who presently strode out of a hollow stopped and stared at boone he was to judge from his appearance one of the stolid bushmen who come out west from the forests of northern ontariotireless men with ax and plow but with little knowledge of anything else  im kind of good at remembering faces and ive seen you before he said you are the man who used to own my place  how often have you seen me asked boone  once in clear daylight twice back there at night answered the stranger  did you know that you could have earned a good many dollars by telling the police as much asked boone and the other regarded him with a frown  im a peaceable man when people will let me be but i dont take that kind of talk from anybody  i was sure or i shouldnt have asked you said boone they dont raise mean canadians yonder in the country you came from among the rocks and trees youre not overrich either are you to judge from my own experience for i put more money into the land than i ever took out of it however that doesnt concern the main thing just now im a hungry man  the big axmans face relaxed and he laughed the deep almost silent laugh which those like him learn in the shadow of the northern pines there is as little mirth in it as there is in most of their hard lives but one can generally trust them with soul and body  breakfast will be ready soons i get home you just come along he said  we followed him to the loghouse which had risen beside boones dilapidated dwelling a neatlydressed darkhaired woman was busy about the stove and our host presented us very simply heres the man who shot the moneylender and a partner lou  the woman who laid down the pan she held cast a quick glance of interest at my companion we have seen you and wondered why you never looked in she said  did you twice do a great kindness for me asked boone  the womans black eyes softened sure that was a little thing and dont count for much the posies were so pretty and i figured theyd keep fresh a little longer she said  it was one of the little things which count the most said boone  thereupon the womans olivetinted face flushed into warmer color while her longlimbed spouse observed shes of the french habitant stock and their ways of showing they havent forgotten arent the same as ours  breakfast was set before us and i think boone had made firm friends of our hosts before we finished the meal he had abilities in this direction they on their part were very simple people the man silent for the most part rugged in face and abrupt when he spoke but shrewd in his own way it seemed withal and probably as generous as he was hard at a bargain his wife was of the more emotional latin stock quick in her movements and one might surmise equally quick in sympathy  you are not the man who bought the place at the sale said boone at length i can remember him tolerably well and if i couldnt one would hardly figure you were likely to work under lane  no and the farmer laughed his curious laugh again no i shouldnt say we never worked for any master since my grandfather got fired for wanting his own way by the hudsons bay and i guess neither lane nor the devil could handle the rest of us he once came round to try  how i asked and the gaunt farmer sighed a little as he filled his pipe this way he was open to finance me to buy up a poor devils place and if id had a little less temper and a little more sense i might have obliged him and landed a good pile of money too  hes just talking dont you believe him broke in the woman with an indignant glance at her spouse  i fancied boone saw the drift of this which was more than i did and the farmer nodded oracularly in his direction when i asked what did you do instead  just reached for a big oxgoad and walked up to him like a blame millionaire or a hotheaded fool them negotiations broke right off and he lit out across the prairie talking bout assaults and violences at twenty mile an hour some other man will know better and thats just how lane will get badly left some day  the woman laughed immoderately it was way bettern a circus she said he didnt tell you he rammed the oxgoad into the skittish horse and lane he just hugged the beast  the picture of the fullfledged lane who made a very poor figure in the saddle at any time careering panic stricken across the prairie with his arms about the neck of a bolting horse appealed to me but as to the possibility of the usurers future discomfiture i was still in the dark and asked for enlightenment  its easy said the farmer lane he squeezes somebody until he cant hold on to his property then he puts up the money and another man buys the place dirtcheap for him in his own name suppose that man goes back on lane this place is my own says he well hes recorded owner isnt he and i figure lane wouldnt be mighty keen on dragging that kind of case into the courts  but he wouldnt put any man in unless he had him by the throat said i and the farmer grinned  juss so hell choke some fellow with grit in him a bit too much some day and when the wrong breed of scoundrel is jammed right up between the devil and the sea its quite likely hell go for the devil before he starts swimming  iand boone regarded the farmer fixedlyquite agree with you do you mind telling me what you gave for this place  our host named the sum without hesitation adding that he would be glad to show us over it and boones face grew somber as he said it is more than twice what it was sold for when it was stolen from me  we walked around the plowed land inspected the stock stables and barns and when after a cordial parting with our hosts we rode away boone turned to me it was an ordeal and harrowing to see what might have been but for an insatiable mans cunning and my poverty another halfhour of the memories would have been too much for me well we can let that pass they were kind souls and this last lesson may have been necessary strange isnt it that the simple are sometimes shrewder than the wise  for instance i said and boone smiled significantly  yonder very plain farmer has hit upon a weak spot in lanes armor which the keenest brain on this prairiei dont mean my own of coursehas hitherto failed to see  soon afterwards we separated each going his different way     chapter xix  the work of an enemy   whatever action the police took concerning lanes descent upon crane valley was not apparent and thorn may have been justified in deciding that they took none at all however that may have been lane left us in peace for a while and it was not by his own hands that the next bolt was launched against me he preferred as a rule to strike through another persons agency and usually contrived it so that when trouble resulted the agent bore the brunt of it  i was tramping behind the seeder one fine morning alternately watching the somewhat unruly team and the trickle of golden grain into the good black loam when two horsemen appeared on the prairie they headed for the homestead and living in a state of expectancy as we then did i shared the misgivings of thorn theyre coming our way in a hurry sure and the sight of anyone whose business i dont know worries me just now he said  if its bad news well learn it soon enough i said go on to the end of the harrowing that well have a frostnipped harvest if were not through with the sowing shortly is the one thing certain  the two horsemen drew nearer and it appeared that both wore uniform while i caught the glint of carbines this in itself was significant and i wondered whether mackay had discovered the identity of boone shortly i recognized the sergeant and cotton who a little later drew bridle beside the seeder mackays face was expressionless but cotton looked distinctly unhappy and once more i felt sorry for boone  i have a word for ye will ye walk to the house with me said the former i glanced at cotton who stooping pretended to examine his carbine thorn appeared suspicious for he dropped the lines he held and his eyes grew keen  im sorry that is the one thing i cant do just now when every moment of this weather is precious i said if you cant wait until we stop at noon theres no apparent reason why you shouldnt state your business here  ye had better come said mackay looking very wooden forby im thinking ye will sow no more today  im not in the humor for joking and intend to continue sowing until it is too dark to see i answered shortly have you any authority to prevent me  i have said the sergeant well if ye will have itauthority to arrest ye on a charge of unlawfully burning the homestead of gaspards trail  astonishment dismay and anger held me dumb between them for a few moments then as the power of speech returned i said confound you mackay you dont think i could possibly have had any hand in that  its no my business to think was the dry answer im here to carry out orders what was it ye were observing foreman thorn  only that niven or lane was a mighty long time finding this thing out and that while nobody expects too much from the police we never figured they were clean stark raging lunatics said thorn  im no expecting compliments said mackay ye will do your duty corporal cotton  you can put that thing back im not a wild beast and have sense enough to see that i must wait for satisfaction until some of your chiefs at headquarters hear of your smartness i said then cotton positively hung his head as he let the carbine slip back into its holster while mackay stared after the departing thorn who made for the homestead as fast as he could run  what is his business he said  his own i answered shortly unless you have also a warrant for his arrest it would be injudicious of you to stop him thorn has an ugly temper and would be justified in resenting the interference what is your program  to ride in to the railroad whenever ye are ready and deliver ye safely in empress city  i suppose one can only make the best of it but considering that you were probably consulted before a warrant was issued i cant help feeling astonished i said however there is no use in wasting words and an hour will suffice me to get ready in  i left the team standing before the seeder careless as to what became of them for even if acquitted i felt that my career was closed at last no forced labor could make up for time lost now and because justice in the west is slow it was perfectly clear why the charge had been made there was a scene with sally when we reached the homestead and cotton fled before her biting comments on police sagacity even mackay winced under certain allusions and when i asked him am i permitted to talk to my housekeeper alone assented readily  ye may he said and welcome i do not envy ye  if sallys tongue could be venomous her brain was keen and as steel was absent it was with confidence i left instructions with her thorn had vanished completely and the girl only looked mysterious when questioned concerning him at length all was ready and turning in the saddle as we rode away i waved my hat to sally who stood in the doorway of the homestead with eyes suspiciously dim i wondered with a strange lack of interest whether i should ever see either it or her again cotton also saluted her and the girl suddenly moved forward a pace holding up her hand  make sure of your prisoner sergeant she said whats the use of talking justice to the poor man when hes ground down by the thief with capital were getting tiredwe have waited for that justice so longand i give you and the fools or rogues behind you warning that if you jail ormesby the boys will come for him with rifles a hundred strong  mackay touched his beast with the spurs and as we passed out of earshot said to me if the boys have her spirit im thinking its not impossible your friends are not judicious henry ormesby  they are stanch at least and above being bought i said and mackay stiffened  what were ye meaning  i think my meaning was plain enough i answered him  many leagues divided us from the railroad and the way seemed very long the dejection that settled upon me brought a physical lassitude with it and i rode wearily jolting in the saddle before the journey was half done since the memorable night at bonaventure when i first met boone trouble after trouble had crowded on me and supported by mere obstinacy when hope had gone i still held on now it seemed the end had come and at the best i must retire beaten to earn a daily wage by the labor of my hands if i escaped conviction as a felon lane would absorb crane valley as he had done gaspards trail as if in mockery the prairie had donned its gayest robe of green and lay flooded with cloudless sunshine  mackay made no further advances since my last repulse but rode silently on my right hand cotton on my left holding back a little so that i could not see him and so birch bluff willows and emerald levels rolled up before us and slid back to the prairies rim until towards dusk on the second day cubes of wooden houses and a line of gaunt telegraph poles loomed up ahead  im glad said corporal cotton breaking into speech at last i dont know if youll believe it ormesby but this has been a sickening day to me im tired of the confounded serviceim tired of everything  yere young and tender on the bit and without the sense to go canny when it galls ye what ails ye at the service anyway interposed the sergeant  ill say nothing about some of the duties theyre a part of the contract answered cotton still i never bargained to arrest my best friends when i became a policeman  friends said mackay who were ye meaning and cotton turned in my direction with the face of one who had narrowly escaped a blunder  arent you asking useless questions i mean rancher ormesby  i observed ye used the plural said mackay  cotton answered shortly when one is going through a disgusting duty to the best of his ability he may be forgiven a trifling lapse in grammar  the light was failing as we rode up to the station some time before the train was due and looking back i saw several diminutive objects on the edge of the prairie they were i surmised mounted settlers coming in for letters or news but except that the blaze of crimson behind them forced them up it would have been hard to recognize the shapes of men and beasts round the other half of the circle the waste was fading into the dimness that crept up from the east and feeling that i had probably done with the prairie and closed another chapter of my life i turned my eyes towards the string of giant poles and the little railroad station ahead  there were fewer loungers than usual about it but when we dismounted cotton started as two feminine figures strolled side by side down the platform and said something softly under his breath  what has surprised you i asked and he pointed towards the pair  those are haldanes daughters by all that is unfortunate  there was no avoiding the meeting darkness had not settled yet and mackay who failed to recognize the ladies was regarding us impatiently ill do my best and they may not notice anything suspicious the corporal said  we moved forward mackay towards the office cotton hanging behind me but as illluck would have it both ladies saw us when we reached the track and before i could recover from my dismay i stood face to face with beatrice haldane she was it seemed to me more beautiful than ever but i longed that the earth might open beneath me  it is some time since i have seen you and you do not look well she said you once described the western winters as invigorating but one could almost fancy the last had been too much for you  i cannot say the same thing and if we had nothing more than the weather to contend with we might preserve our health i said i did not know you were at bonaventure or i should have ridden over to pay my respects to you  beatrice haldane did not say whether this would have given her pleasure or otherwise indeed her manner if slightly cordial was nothing more and i found it desirable to study a rail fastening when i saw her sister watching me  i arrived from the east only a few days ago and we are now awaiting my father who had some business down the line are you going out with the train  i am going to empress i said and lucille haldane interposed that is a long way and the last time he met you you told father you were too busy to visit bonaventure who will see to your sowingand will you stay there long  i heard corporal cotton grind his heel viciously into the plank beneath him and i answered in desperation  i do not know i am afraid so  perhaps the girl noticed by my voice that all was not well indeed beatrice also commenced to regard the corporal and myself curiously  what has happened mr ormesby you look positively haggard the younger sister said why are you keeping in the background corporal cotton have you done anything to be ashamed of then she ceased with a gasp of pained surprise and i read consternation in her eyes  you have guessed aright i am not making this journey of my own will i said  beatrice haldane turned with a swift movement which brought us once more fully face to face and unlike her sister she was strangely cold and grave  is it permissible to ask any questions she said and her even tone stung me to the quick one whisper against the speaker would have roused me to fury  everybody will know tomorrow or the next day and i may as well tell you now i said in a voice which sounded even in my own ears hoarse with bitterness i am to be tried for burning down the homestead of gaspards trail  beatrice haldane certainly showed surprise but she seemed more thoughtful than indignant and still fixed me with her eyes they were clear and very beautiful but i had begun to wonder if a spark of human passion would ever burn within them  it is absurdpreposterous come here at once sergeant a clear young voice with a thrill of unmistakable anger in it said but mackay seemed desirous of backing into the station agents office instead  i want you added lucille haldane come at once and tell me why you have done this  the sergeants courage was evidently unequal to the task for with a brief i will try to satisfy ye when i have transacted my business he disappeared into the office and i turned again to beatrice haldane  you see it is unfortunately true but you do not appear astonished i said  beatrice haldane looked at me sharply but without indignation for she was always mistress of herself and before she could speak her sister broke in do you wish to make us angry when we are only sorry for you mr ormesby everybody knows that neither you nor any rancher in this district could be guilty corporal cotton will you inquire if your superior has finished his business and tell him that i am waiting  the old heathen deserves it said cotton aside to me as with unfeigned relief he hurried away and it was only by an effort i refrained from following him the interview was growing painful in the extreme still i was respited for beatrice haldane turned from us suddenly  what can this mean there is a troop of horsemen riding as for their lives towards the station she said  it was growing dark but not too dark to see a band of mounted men converge at a gallop upon the station and for the first time i noticed how the loungers stared at them and heard the jingle of harness and thud of drumming hoofs none of them shouted or spoke they came on in ominous silence the spume flakes flying from the lathered beasts the clods whirling up until a voice cried  two of you stand by to hold up the train the rest will come along with me  amid a musical jingling the horses were pulled up close beside the track and men in embroidered deerskin with broad white hats and men in old bluejean leaped hurriedly down several carried rifles while guessing their purpose i pointed towards the frame houses across the unfenced track you must go at once miss haldane there may be a tumult i said  lucille seemed reluctant beatrice by no means hurried and i do not remember whether i bade either of them farewell for as the newcomers came swiftly into the station a gaunt commanding figure holding a carbine barred their way and corporal cotton leaped out from the office the station agent holding a revolver also placed himself between them and me  what are ye wanting boys a steady voice asked and the men halted within a few paces of the carbines muzzle i could just see that they were my friends and neighbors and i noticed that one who rode up and down the track seemed inclined to civilly prevent the ladies from retiring to the wooden settlement perhaps he feared they intended to raise its inhabitants  we want harry ormesby answered a voice i recognized as belonging to steel stand out of the daylight sergeant we have no call to hurt you  im thinking thats true said mackay and i admired his coolness as he stood alone save for the young corporal grimly eying the crowd it will however be my distressful duty to damage the first of ye who moves a foot nearer my prisoner noo will ye hear reason boys or will i wire for a squadron to convince ye ormesby ye cannot have and will ye shame your own credit and me  there was a murmur of consultation but no disorderly clamor the men whom thorn had raised to rescue me were neither habitual brawlers nor desperadoes but sturdy stockriders and tillers of the soil smarting under a sense of oppression they were all fearless and would i knew have faced a cavalry brigade to uphold what appeared their rights but they were equally averse to any bloodshed or violence that was not necessary  theres no use talking sergeant somebody said we dont go back without our man and it will be better for all of us if you release him you know as well as we do theres nothing against him  meanwhile i could not well interfere without precipitating a crisis the station agent who stated that mackay had deputed him authority stood beside me with the pistol in his hand neither was i certain what my part would be for stung to white heat by beatrice haldanes coldness which suggested suspicion and came as a climax to a series of injuries i wondered whether it might not be better to make a dash for liberty and leave the old hard life behind me there might be better fortune beyond the rockies and i felt that lane would not have instigated the charge of arson unless he saw his way to substantiate it  nevertheless i could watch the others with a strange and almost impersonal curiositythe group of men standing with hard hands on the rifle barrels ready for a rush the grim figure of the sergeant and the young corporal poised with head held high left foot flung forward and carbine at hip in front of them  well give you two minutes in which to make up your mind then if you cant climb down and anything unpleasant happens it will be on your head cant you see you havent the ghost of a show said one  turning my eyes a moment i noticed a fanshaped flicker swinging like a comet across the dusky waste far down the straightruled track and when a man i knew held up his watch beneath a lamp i had almost come to a decision if the sergeant had shown any sign of weakness it is perhaps possible that decision might have been reversed but mackay stood as though cast in iron and equally unyielding i would at least have no blood shed on my account and would not leave my friends to bear the consequences of their unthinking generosity meanwhile stockrider and teamster were waiting in strained attention and there was still almost a minute left to pass when a light hand touched my shoulder and lucille haldane appearing from behind me said you must do something go forward and speak to them immediately she was trembling with eagerness but the station agent stood on my other side and he was woodenly stolid  put down that weapon i will speak to them i said  youre healthier here was the suspicious answer and chiefly conscious of the appeal and anxiety in lucille haldanes eyes i turned upon him  stand out of my wayconfound you i shouted  the man fingered the pistol uncertainly and i could have laughed at his surmise that the sight of it would have held me then before even if he wished it his finger could close on the trigger i had him by the wrist and the weapon fell with a clash then i lifted him bodily and flung him upon the track while as amid a shouting cotton sprang forward mackay roared bide ye let him go  the shouting ceased suddenly when i stood between my friends and the sergeant with hands held up ill never forget what you have done boys but it is no use i said and paused to gather breath amid murmurs of surprise and consternation in the first place i cant drag you into this trouble  well take the chances willing a voice said and there was a grim chorus of approval weve borne enough and its time we did something  cant you see that if i bolted now it would suit nobody better than lane boys you know im innocent  again a clamor broke out and somebody cried it was lanes own man who did it if anybody fired gaspards trail  he may not be able to convict me and if instead of rushing the sergeant you will go home and help thorn with the sowing we may beat him yet i continued even if i am convicted ill come back again and stay right here until lane is broken or one of us is dead  the hoot of a whistle cut me short the brightening blaze of a great headlamp beat into our faces and further speech was out of the question as with brakes groaning the lighted cars clanged in  be quick sergeant before they change their minds i shouted and mackay and cotton scrambled after me on to a car platform no train that ever entered that station had i think so prompt dispatch for cotton had hardly opened the door of the vestibule than the bell clanged and the huge locomotive snorted as the cars rolled out i had a momentary vision of the agent who seemed partly dazed scowling in my direction a group of dark figures swinging broadbrimmed hats and lucille haldane standing on the edge of the platform waving her hand to me then the lights faded behind us and we swept out faster and faster across the prairie     chapter xx  leadenfooted justice   i had spent a number of weary days awaiting trial when a visitor was announced and a young smoothshaven man shown into my quarters he nodded to me pleasantly seated himself on the edge of the table and commenced your friends sent me along i hope to see you through this trouble rancher and want you to tell me exactly how your difficulties began think of all the little things that didnt strike you as quite usual  i should like to hear in the first place who you are i know your name is dixon but that does not convey very much i said  the stranger laughed goodhumoredly and such is fame now i had fancied everybody who read the papers knew my name and that i had won some small reputation down at winnipeg anyway im generally sent for in cases with a financial origin  then i remembered and looked hard at the speaker the last sentence was justified but he differed greatly from ones idea of the typical lawyer he was not even neatly dressed and his manner singularly lacked the preciseness of the legal practitioner  i must apologize for i certainly have read about you i said it was perhaps natural that as i did not send for you i should be surprised at your taking an interest in my case i am however afraid i cannot retain you for the simple reason that i dont know where to raise sufficient money to recompense any capable mans services  arent you a little premature my clients dont usually plead poverty until i send in my bill was the answer you own a tolerably extensive holding in crane valley dont you  i do but nobody except one man with whom i would not deal would buy a foot of it just now i answered then acceding to the others request i supported the statement by a brief account of my circumstances all this is quite beside the question i concluded  no said dixon as a matter of fact i find it interesting wont you go on and bring the story down to the present  i did so and the mans face had changed growing intent and keen before i concluded  i should rather like to manage this affair for you he said my feeswell from what one or two people said about you i can if necessary wait for them  you will probably never be paid who was it sent for you  charles steel who was however not quite so frank about finances as you seem to be was the answer it was also curious or otherwise that i was requested to see what could be done by two other gentlemen who offered to guarantee expenses that is about as much as i may tell you you are not the only person with an interest in the future of the crane valley district  i seem to be used as a stalkinghorse by friends and enemies alike and get the benefit of the charges each time they miss their aim the part grows irksome i said dryly however if you are willing to take the risks i need capable assistance badly enough  dixon seemed quite willing and asked further questions you seem a little bitter against the sergeant what kind of man is he he said i mean has he a tolerably level head or is he one of the disciplinemade machines who can comprehend nothing not included in their code of rules  i used to think him singularly shrewd but recent events have changed my opinion and you had better place him in the latter category i said and dixon chuckled over something  very natural i must see him from what you said already he doesnt strike me as a fool well i dont think you need worry too much mr ormesby  dixon had resumed his careless manner before he left me and for no particular reason i felt comforted we had several more interviews before the trial began and i can vividly remember the morning i was summoned into court it was packed to suffocation and the brilliant sunshine that beat in through the long windows fell upon faces that i knew their owners were mostly poor men and i surmised had covered the long distance on horseback sleeping on the prairie to encourage me there was indeed when i took my stand a suppressed demonstration that brought a quicker throb to my pulses and a glow into my face it was comforting to know that i had their approbation and sympathy if the life i had caught brief glimpses of at bonaventure was not for me these hardhanded tireless men were my equals and friendsand i was proud of them  so it was in a clear defiant voice i pleaded not guilty and presently composed myself to listen while sergeant mackay detailed my arrest bronzed faces were turned anxiously upon him when he was asked did the prisoner volunteer any statement or offer resistance  mackay looked down at the men before him and there was a significant silence in the body of the court then with a faint twinkle in his eyes he answered there was a bit demonstration at the station in the prisoners favor but he assisted us in maintaining order the charge he said was ridiculous  this i considered a liberal view to take of what had passed and my own comments and though i knew that mackay was never addicted to unfairly making the most of an advantage i remembered dixons opinion if he were actuated by any ulterior motive i had however no inkling of what it might be  nothing of much further importance passed until the man who had preferred the charge against me took his stand when watching him intently i was puzzled by his attitude he appeared irresolute though i felt tolerably certain that his indecision was quite untinged with compunction on my account he had also a sullen look which suggested one driven against his will and twice before he spoke made a slight swift movement as though under the impulse of a changed resolution  i am the owner of the lands and remains of the homestead known as gaspards trail he said i bought them at public auction when sold by the gentleman who held the prisoners mortgage twice that day the latter threatened both of us and his friends raised a hostile demonstration he told me to take care of myself and the property for he would live to see me sorry but i didnt count much on that thought he was only talking when naturally a little mad have had cause to change my opinions since i turned in early on the night of the fire and slept well i and my hired man wilkins being the only people in the house wilkins wakened me about two in the morning get up at once somebody has fired the place he said  i got upin a mighty hurryand got out my valuables one end of the house was most redhot there wasnt much furniture in it the prisoner had cleared out most everything whether it was in the mortgage schedule or whether it was not but there was enough to keep me busy while wilkins lit out to save the horses wind blew the sparks right on to the stable i went out when id saved what i could and as wilkins had been gone a long time concluded hed made sure of the horses met the prisoner when i was carrying tools out of a threatened shed asked him to help me ill see you burned before i stir a hand he said noticed he was skulking round the corner of a shed and seemed kind of startled at the sight of me but was too rattled to think of much just then didnt ask him anything more but seeing the fire had taken hold good sat down and watched it yes sir i told somebody it wasnt insured  byandby the prisoner came back with a dozen ranchers didnt seem friendly or even civil most of them and there was nothing i could do then i got worried about wilkins for hed been gone a long time and the stable was burning bad one of the ranchers said hed make sure there were no beasts inside it and the prisoner and the rest went along they found wilkins with some bones broken and got him and the horses out between them then when the place was burnt out sergeant mackay rode up i was homeless but none of the ranchers would take me in somebody said he wasnt sorry and id got my deserts believe it was the prisoner but cant be certain thats all i know except that before i turned in i saw all the lamps out and fixed up the stove am certain the fire didnt start from them  i was hunting among the ruins with wilkins a little while ago when i found a flattened coaloiltin under some fallen beams in the kitchen i never used that oil but heard at the railroad store that the prisoner did mightnt have taken the trouble to inquire but that i found close beside it a silver matchbox it was pretty well worn but anyone who will look at it close can read that it was given to h ormesby considering the prisoner must have dropped it there i handed both to the police  when niven mentioned the matchbox i started as though struck by a bullet it was mine undoubtedly and most of my neighbors had seen it that it was damning evidence in conjunction with the oiltin and had been deliberately placed there for my undoing i felt certain there was a halfaudible murmur in the court while the judge examined the articles and i read traces of bewilderment and doubt in the faces turned towards me that these men should grow suspicious roused me to a sense of unbearable injury and i sent my voice ringing through the court it is an infamous lie i lost the matchbox or it was stolen from me with a purpose a month after the fire  the judge dropped his notebook the prosecutor smiled significantly but i saw that the men from the prairie believed me and that was very comforting something resembling a subdued cheer arose from various parts of the building  silence said the judge sternly an interruption is neither admissible nor seemly prisoner you will be called on in turn  we need not trouble about the prisoners denial which was perhaps natural if useless because the witness statement will be fully borne out by the man who was present when he found the matchbox said the lawyer for the crown i will now call sergeant mackay again  mackays terse testimony was damaging and aroused my further indignation i had not expected that he would either conceal or enlarge upon anything that would tell against me but had anticipated some trace of reluctance or that he would wait longer for questions between his admissions instead he stood rigidly erect and reeled off his injurious testimony more like a speaking automaton than a human being  a trooper warned me that he had seen a reflected blaze in the sky he said we mounted and rode over to gaspards trail arriving there i found a number of men including the owner niven and the prisoner niven said the place was not insured they were unable to do anything i see no need to describe the fire the house was past saving but the ranchers with the prisoner among them broke into the burning stable to bring out the horses which had been overlooked and found the hired man wilkins partly suffocated in a stall he was badly injured but bore out the owners statement that lamps and stove were safe when they retired  i proceeded to question the spectators knew them all as men of good character and as they had newly ridden in saw no reason to suspect more than one in case the fire was not accidental asked niven whom he first met and he said it was the prisoner shortly after the fire broke out stated he met him slipping through the shadow of a shed and the prisoner refused to assist him was not surprised at this knowing the prisoner bore niven little goodwill since the latter bought his property had heard him threaten him and another man supposed to be connected with him in the purchase of gaspards trail  what reason have you to infer that any other man was concerned in the purchase of gaspards trail asked the prosecutor and mackay answered indifferently  it was just popular opinion that he was finding niven the money  we need not trouble about popular opinion said the lawyer somewhat hurriedly we will now proceed to the testimony of the hired man thomas wilkins  thomas wilkins was called for several times but failed to present himself and a trooper who hurried out of court came back with the tidings that he had borrowed a horse at the hotel and ridden out on the prairie an hour ago since then nobody had seen him  the crown prosecutor fidgeted the judge frowned and there was a whispering in the court until the former rose up as wilkins is one of my principal witnesses i must suggest an adjournment  it cost me an effort to repress an exclamation i had already been kept long enough in suspense and suspecting that wilkins did not mean to return knew that a lengthened adjournment would be almost equally as disastrous as a sentence  have you no information whatever as to why he has absented himself asked the judge receiving a negative answer he turned towards the trooper exactly what did you hear at the hotel  very little sir was the answer he didnt tell anybody where he was going but just rode out the hotelkeeper said he guessed wilkins had something on his mind by the way he kicked things about last night  it will be the business of the police to find him as speedily as possible in the meantime i can only adjourn the case until they do unless the prisoners representative proceeds with the examination of witnesses said the judge  dixon was on his feet in a moment with the exception of sergeant mackay and the witness niven who will be further required by my legal friend i do not purpose to trouble the witnesses he said while i can urge no reasonable objection to the adjournment it is necessary to point out that it will inflict a grievous injury on one whom i have every hope of showing is a wholly innocent man it is well known that this is the one time of the year when the prairie ranchers energies are taxed to the utmost and the loss of even a few days now may entail the loss of the harvest or the ruin of the stock my client has also suffered considerably from being brought here to answer what i cannot help describing as an unwarranted charge and it is only reasonable that bail should be allowed  is anyone willing to offer security asked the judge  there was a few moments silence and then a hum of subdued voices as a man rose up while i could scarcely believe my eyes when i saw it was boone in spite of the slight change in his appearance he must have been aware that he was running a serious risk for his former holding lay almost within a days journey i could also see that some of the spectators started as they recognized him  i shall be glad to offer security for the prisoners reappearance so far as my means will serve he said  you are a citizen of this place or have some local standing asked the judge  boone answered carelessly i can hardly claim so much but a good many people know me further west and i am prepared to submit my bankbook as a guarantee  he had scarcely finished when another man i had not noticed earlier stood up in turn i am authorized by carson haldane of bonaventure to offer bail to any extent desired  the judge beckoned both of them to sit down again and called up a commissioned police officer and sergeant mackay then i felt slightly hopeful guessing that a good deal depended on mackays opinion the others drew aside and my heart throbbed fast with the suspense until the judge announced his decision  as the charge is a serious one and the police hope to find the missing witness very shortly i must in the meantime refuse to allow bail  i had grown used to the crushing disappointment which follows shortlived hope but the shock was hard to meet it seemed only too probable that lane or his emissaries had spirited wilkins away and would not produce him until it was too late to save my crop still there was no help for it and i followed the officer who led me back to my quarters with the best air of stolidity i could assume  what did you think of it asked dixon who came in presently with a smile on his face and i answered ruefully the less said the better it strikes me as the beginning of the final catastrophe and if wilkins substantiates the finding of the matchbox conviction must follow what is the usual term of detention for such offenses  you neednt worry about that was the cheerful answer things are going just about as well as they could therell be a second adjournment and then perhaps another  and i must lie here indefinitely while my crops and cattle go to ruin that is hardly my idea of things going well and if you are jesting it is precious poor humor i broke in  dixon laughed i am not jesting in the least you seem to be one of those people ormesby who believe everything will go to ruin unless they hold control themselves now it would not surprise me if on your return you found your crops and cattle flourishing further the prosecution hold a poor case and i expect when my turn comes to see it collapse there isnt so much as you might fancy in the matchbox incident the men who burn down places dont generally leave such things about i have had a talk with the sergeant and though hes closer than an oyster i begin to catch a glimmering of his intentions  why cant you explain them then im growing tired of hints and feel tempted to tell my mysterious wellwishers to go to the devil together and leave me in peace i said  a little illhumor is perhaps excusable was the tranquil answer it is wisest not to prophesy until one is sure you know now im open as i said to do my best for you but in that case you have just got to let me set about it independently usual or otherwise it is my way  then i suppose ill have to let you your reputation should be a guarantee i answered moodily and dixon lifted his hat from the table  thanks he said dryly it is in fact the only sensible thing you can do     chapter xxi  against time   dixons prediction proved correct when i was brought into court a second time there was still no news of wilkins and after further testimony of no importance the case was again adjourned this time however bail was allowed and boone and rancher gordon stood surety for me the latter was by no means rich and had like the rest of us suffered severe losses of late dixon was the first to greet me when i went forth somewhat moodily a free man for the time being  you dont look either so cheerful or grateful as you ought to be he said  you are wrong in one respect i am at least sincerely grateful for your efforts  dixon in defiance of traditions smote me on the shoulder then whats the matter with the cheerfulness  it is not exactly pleasant to have a charge of this description hanging over one indefinitely and i have already lost time that can never be made up i said lane will no doubt produce his witness when he considers it opportune and there is small encouragement to work in the prospect of spending a lengthy time in jail while ones possessions go to ruin  you think lane had a hand in his disappearance dixon asked thoughtfully and when i nodded commented i cant quite say i do my reasons are not conclusive and human natures curious anyway but im not sure that wilkins will if he can help it turn up at all however in the meantime the dinner were both invited to will put heart into you  he slipped his arm through mine and led me into the leading hotel where as it was drawing near the time for the six oclock supper every man turned to stare at us as we passed through the crowded bar and vestibule i was making for the general diningroom when dixon said go straight ahead it was not easy to manage but our hosts were determined to do the thing in style  he flung a door open and boone and gordon greeted me in turn while i had never seen a menu in a western hostelry to compare with that of the following meal perhaps gordon noticed my surprise for he said it was adams who fixed up all this and came near having a scrimmage with the hotelkeeper about the wine this comes from california and i prefer it grown in france those labels arent much use to any man with a sense of taste says he this brand wherever they grew it is quite good enough for me but im wondering where adams learned the difference  boone smiled at me i have he said a good memory and learned a number of useful things during a somewhat varied experience  the meal was over and the blue cigar smoke curled about us when i turned to gordon there are two things i should like to ask you first and because i know what losses you have had to face how you raised the money to liberate me in the generous way you did and second how many acres are left unsown at crane valley  the gaunt rancher fidgeted before he answered you have said thank you once and i guess thats enough youre so blame thin in the hide and touchy ormesby and it wasnt i who did itat least not much of it  dixon appeared to be amused and when gordon glanced appealingly at boone the latter only smiled and shook his head seeing which i said quietly in short you sent round the hat  there was no doubt that the chance shot had told for gordon rose very red in face to his feet thats just what i didnt dont you know us yet send round the hat when the boys knew you were innocent and just how i was fixed no sir they came right in each bringing his roll of bills with him and if id wanted twice as much theyd have raised it and now ive given them awayjust what they made me promise not to  i had anticipated the answer but it stirred me nevertheless and while gordon stared at me half angry half ashamed of his own vehemence i filled a wineglass to the brim heres to the finest men and stanchest comrades on gods green earth i said looking steadily at him  it was dixon who brought us down to our normal level for setting his glass down empty he commented youre not overmodest ormesby considering that you are one of them still i think youre right people in the east are expecting a good deal from you and the good country that has been given you  gordon joined in the lawyers laugh but i broke in you have not answered my second question  well and the rancher smiled mischievously youre so mighty particular that i dont know what to say still things looked pretty tolerable last time i was down to crane valley  dixon accompanied us to the station when it was time to catch the train and as he stood on the car platform said to me its probably no use to tell you not to worry but id sit tight in my saddle and think as little as possible about this trouble if i were you  he dropped lightly from the platform cigar in hand as the train pulled out and though most unlike the traditional lawyer in speech or agility left me with a reassuring confidence in his skill  it was early morning when i rode alone towards crane valley feeling in spite of dixons good advice distinctly anxious it is true that thorn and steel were both energetic but no man can drive two teams at once and it was my impression that having more at stake i could do considerably more in person than either of them i had small comfort in the reflection that after all the question how much had been accomplished was immaterial because there was little use in sowing where while i lay in jail an enemy might reap and i urged my horse when i drew near the hollow in which the homestead lay and then pulled him up with a jerk gordon had said things had been going tolerably well but this proved a very inadequate description the plowed land had all been harrowed and sown and beyond it lay the shattered clods of fresh breaking where i guessed oats had been sown under the sod newly torn from the virgin prairie ten men of greater endurance could not have accomplished so much and i sat still humbled and very grateful with eyes that grew momentarily dim fixed on the wide stretch of black soil steaming under the morning sun it seemed as though a beneficent genie had been working for my deliverance while i lay almost despairing in the grip of the law  then steel springing out from the door of the sodhouse came up at a run with thorn behind him it was strangely pleasant to see the elation in their honest faces and steels shout of delight sent a thrill through me  this is the best sight ive seen since you left us he panted wringing my hand thorns that full up with satisfaction he cant even run we knew dixon and adams would see you through between them  has dixon been down here i asked for the lawyer had not told me so and thorn who came up gasped oh yes and a winnipeg man he sent down went round with adams most everywhere say did you strike niven for compensation  no i answered a trifle ruefully i am only free on bail and not acquitted yet  steels jaw dropped and his dismay would have been ludicrous had it not betrayed his wholehearted friendship while thorns burst of sulphurous language was an even more convincing testimony again i felt a curious humility and something enlarged in my throat as i looked down at them  if i cant stand lane off with you two and the rest behind me i shall deserve all i get and we must hope for the best i said but if you could handle three teams each you could not have done all this  thorn who was not usually vociferous in expressing his sentiments appeared glad of this diversion and after a glance at the plowed land strove to smile humorously think you could have done it any better yourself  its a fair hit i answered you know exactly how much i can do let me down easily how did you manage it  we didnt manage anything said thorn no sir the boys they did it all everybody came or sent a hired man and blame quaint plowing some of them cowchasers done put up a dollar sweepstake and ran races with the harrows they did and steel talked himself purple before he stopped them theyve busted the gangplow and one said he ought to have been a dentist by the way he pulled out the cultivator teeth  and where did you come in i asked and duly noted the effort it cost steel to follow his comrades lead  we just lay back and turned the good advice on he said tom he led the prayer meeting when after supper they turned loose on lane oh yes we rode in and out for provisions sally she would have the best in the settlement and sat up all night cooking dont know how youll feel when you see the grocery bill  i can tell you now i said i feel that theres nothing in the whole dominion too good for themor youand id be glad if necessary to sell my shirt to pay the bill  we went on to the house together and sally hiding her disappointment plunged with very kindly intentions into a spirited description of her visitors feats thats a testimonial she said pointing through the window to an appalling pile of empty tins i just had to get them when some of the boys brought their own provisions in i set one of them peeling potatoes all night to convince him  peeling potatoes i interpolated and steel smiling wickedly furnished the explanation  sally was busy in the shed when he came along and wanted to help her considerable feel like peeling half a sackful says sally and when the fool stockman allowed hed like it better than anything says she then as im tired you can she just left him with it while she talked to the other man but there was grit in him and he peeled away until morning wanted to marry her too he did  sallys glance foreboded future tribulation for the speaker and thorn frowned but steel disregarding it concluded gravely dessay he might have done it but he heard sally turn loose on me one day and took warning  in spite of the shadow hanging over me it was good to be at home and perhaps the very uncertainty as to its duration made the somewhat sordid struggle of our life at crane valley almost attractive lane it seemed only too probable would crush us in the end but there was satisfaction in the thought that every hours work well done would help us to prolong our resistance so the days of effort slipped by until i received a notice to present myself at court on a specified date and there being much to do i delayed my departure until the last day steel insisted on accompanying me to the railroad but protested against the time of starting one might fancy you were fond of jail by the hurry youre in to get back to it he said we could catch the cars if we left hours later  its as well to be on the right side i said for i had been in a state of nervous impatience all day wilkins had been found and now that a decision appeared certain i grew feverishly anxious to learn the bestor the worst  it was a day in early summer when we set out and pushed on at a good pace though already the sun shone hot steel indeed suggested there was no need for haste but after checking my beast a little i shot ahead again it might be your wedding you were going to he said  we had covered part of the distance left to traverse on the second day when a freighters lumbering oxteam crawled out of a ravine and steel pulled up beside him i dont know if youre mailing anything east but youre late if you are said the teamster  then theres something wrong with the sun said steel if hes keeping his time bill were most two hours too soon  you would have been last week answered the other while a sudden chill struck through me as i remembered the promised acceleration of the transcontinental express theyve improved the track in the selkirks sooner than they expected and theyre rushing the atlantic hummer through on the new schedule this month instead of next  before he concluded i had snatched out my watch and simultaneously touched the beast with the spurs the next moment the timepiece was swinging against my belt and with eyes fixed on the willows before me i was plunging at a reckless gallop down the side of the ravine the horse was young and resented the punishment but i had no desire to hold him and the further he felt inclined to bolt the better it would please me so we smashed through the thinner willows and somehow reeled down an almost precipitous slope reckless of the fact that there was a creek at the bottom while the trail wound round towards a bridge until the hoofs sank into the soft ground and we came floundering towards the tall growth by the waters edge there the spurs went in again and the beast which knew nothing of jumping rather rushed than launched itself at the creek there was a splash and a flounder a fountain of mire and water shot up and green withes parted before me as we charged through the willows on the farther bank the slope was soft and steep beneath the climbing birches and by the time we were half way up the beast had relinquished all desire to bolt but my watch showed me that go he must and it was without pity i drove him at the declivity meantime a thud of hoofs followed us and when racing south across the levels we had left the ravine two miles behind steel came up breathless  can you do it harry he panted  im afraid not i shouted still if i kill the horse under me im going to try hes carrying a good many poor mens money  a hurried calculation had proved conclusively that if the train were punctual i should miss it by more than an hour and there was of course not another until the following day still it was a long climb from vancouver city up through the mountains of british columbia to the kicking horse pass in the rockies and there then remained a wide breadth of prairie for the mammoth locomotives to traverse sometimes when the load was heavy they lost an hour or two on the wild upgrade through the cañons i was ignorant of legal procedure but greatly feared that my nonappearance in the court would entail the forfeiture of the sureties and as the session was near an end postpone the trial indefinitely therefore the train must be caught if it were in the power of horseflesh to accomplish it and i settled myself to ride as for my life  wouldnt the port arthur freight do shouted steel  no i answered its the atlantic express or nothing you can pick those things up on your homeward journey  without checking the beast i managed to loosen the valise strapped before me and hurled it down upon the prairie it contained all i possessed in the shape of civilized apparel except what i rode in and that was mired all over from the flounder through the creek but the horse already carried weight enough it was now blazing noon and in the prairie summer the sun is fiercely hot here and there the bitter dust of alkali rolled across the waste crusting our dripping faces and the coats of the lathered beasts my eyelashes grew foul and heavy blurring my vision so that it was but dimly i saw the endless levels crawl up from the far horizon a speck far down in the distance grew into the altitude of a garden plant and knowing what it must be i pressed my heels home fiercely waiting for what seemed hours until it should increase into a winddwarfed tree  it passed there was nothing but the dancing heat to break the great monotony of grass while the gray streak where it cut the skyline rolled steadily back in mockery of our efforts to reach it yet i was soaked in perspiration and steel was alkali white there was a steady trickle into my eyes and the taste of salt in my mouth while the drumming of hoofs rose with a staccato thudthud like distant rifle fire and the springy rush of the beasts beneath us showed how fast we were traveling steel shook his head as we raced up a rise which had tantalized me long stirrup to stirrup and neck to neck while the clots from the dripping bits drove past like flakes of windwhirled snow  if you want to get there ormesby this wont do he said youd break the heart of the toughest beast inside another hour  the need would justify a worse loss i panted snatching out my watch we have pulled up thirty minutes but are horribly behind still men who cant afford to lose it have put up the stakes i am riding for  steel made a gesture of comprehension but once more shook his head my beasts the better and hes carrying a lighter weight but hell never last at the pace were making save your own a little and when hes dead beat ill let up and change with you ill hang on in the meantime in case one of them comes to grief over a badgerhole its your one chance if youre bent on getting through  i would at that moment have gladly sold the rest of my life for the certainty of catching the train to give my enemy no advantage was a great thing and i felt that absence when my name was called would prejudice the most confiding against me but that was after all a trifle compared with what i owed the men who had probably stripped themselves of necessities to help me and i felt that if i failed them a shame which could never be dissipated would follow me nevertheless steels advice was sound and i tightened my grip on the bridle with a smothered imprecation then my heart grew heavier for the horse needed no pulling and responded with an ominous alacrity  we were still leagues from the railroad and the miles of grasses flitted towards us ever more slowly the last clump of birches took half an hour to raise and the willows which fled behind us had been five long minutes taking the shape of trees my watch was clenched in one hand and while bluff and ravine crawled its fingers raced around the dial with an agonizing rapidity in testimony of the feebleness of flesh and blood when pitted against steel and steam the clanging cars had swept clear of the foothills long ago and the track ran straight and level across the prairie a smooth empty road for the accelerated to save time on in its race between the pacific and the laurentian waterway when the prairie grew blurred before us as it sometimes did i could see instead the two huge locomotives veiled in dust and smoke thundering with a pitiless swiftness down the long converging rails while the drumming of hoofs changed into the roar of wheels whose speed would brand me with dishonor yet we were doing all that man or beast could do and at last a faint ray of hope and a new dismay came upon me the difference in time had further lessened but my horse was failing  go on as youre going shouted steel edging his whitened beast nearer im riding a stone lighter and this beast has another hours work left in him  i went on the horse growing more and more feeble and blundering in his stride until at last when it was a case of dismount or do murder i dropped stiffly from the saddle steel was down in a second and in another my jacket and vest were off and i laid my foot to the stirrup in white shirt and trousers with a handkerchief knotted around my waist  youll startle the folks in empress and you cant strip off much more said steel  id ride into the depot naked sooner than rob the boys i said and was mounted before my comrade could reopen his mouth when he did so his good luck sounded already faint and far away  steels horse had more life left in himone could feel it in his stride but now that there was some hope of success i rode with more caution sparing him up the low rises and trying so far as one might guess it to keep within a very small margin of his utmost strength so we pressed on until all the prairie grew dim to me and my only distinct sensation was the rush of the cool wind then a flitting birch bluff roused me once more to watch and minute by minute i strained my eyes for the first glimpse of the tall poles heralding the railroad track at last a row of what looked like matches streaked the horizon and grew in size until something that rose and fell with the heave of the prairie sea became visible beneath then as we topped one of its grassy waves a cluster of distant cubes loomed up and a glance at the watchs racing fingers warned me that i was already behind the time that the train was due to reach the settlement it might have passed and a new torture was added until when in an agony of suspense i strained my eyes towards the west a streak of whiteness crept out of the horizon  the run of the accelerated was at that time regarded as a national exploit forming as it did part of a new link binding japan and londonthe east and the west and i knew the conductor would hardly have waited for one of his own directors the white streak rapidly grew larger something sparkled beneath it and there was flash of twinkling glass through the dust and steam i fixed my eyes on the station and taxed every aching sinew in hand and heel for the weakening beast must bring me there in time or die a smoke cloud with bright patches beneath it rolled up to the station when i was nearly half a mile away the horse was reeling under me the power had gone out of the leaden hands on switch and bridle andfor the tension had produced a vertigomy sight was almost gone  hearing however still remained and shouts of encouragement reached me while i could dimly see the station close ahead and shapeless figures apparently waving hats and arms the clang of a big bell rang in my ears the twin locomotives snorted and i fell from the saddle sprang towards the track and clutched at the sliding rails of a car platform i missed them the car swaying giddily so it seemed rolled past and i hurled myself bodily at the next platform somebody clutched my shoulder and dragged me up and i fell with a heavy crash against the door of a vestibule  just in time said a man in uniform say are you doing this for a wager or are some mad cowchasers after you     chapter xxii  bad tidings   the dust was rolling about the cars and the gaunt poles whirled past before i could recover breath to answer the astonished conductor then it was with a gasp i said wont you get me a little water  the man vanished and i sat still vacantly noticing how the prairie reeled behind me until the door slid open and he returned with a tin vessel and a group of curious passengers behind him a piece of ice floated in the former and a man held out a flask i guess it wont hurt him adulterated some he said  never before had i tasted so delicious a draught hours of anxiety and effort under a blazing sun had parched and fouled my lips and my throat was dry as unslaked lime the tin vessel was empty when i handed it back and the railroad official looked astonished as he turned it upside down for the spectators information i guess a locomotive tank would hardly quench that thirst of yours he said  thanks ill get up it was not for amusement i boarded your train as i did i said and the rest opened a passage for me into the long colonist car there was a mirror above the basins in the vestibule and a glance into it explained their curiosity the white shirt had burst in places the grime of alkali had caked on my face leaving only paler circles about the eyes hardened mire crusted the rest of my apparel and each movement made it evident to me that portions of the epidermis had been abraded from me  its not my business how passengers board these cars so long as theyre tolerably decent and can pay their fare observed the conductor still although were not particular weve got to dress you a little between us and it mightnt be too much to ask what brought you here in such an outfit  it was evident that the others were waiting to ask the same question and i answered diplomatically i have money enough to take me to empress at colonist fare and was half way to the depot to catch the cars on the old schedule before i discovered you had commenced the accelerated service then i flung off every ounce of weight that might lose me the race  you must have had mighty important business somebody said and the door at the opposite end opened as i answered dryly i certainly had  hallo great columbus is that you ormesby a voice which seemed familiar said and turning angrily i saw a storekeeper with whom i had dealt staring at me in bewilderment  ormesby the name was repeated by several passengers and i read sudden suspicion in some of the faces and sympathy in the rest while one of them with western frankness asked youre the rancher ormesby weve been reading about  yes i answered making a virtue of necessity i am on my way to surrender for trial and redeem my bail now you can understand my hurry  several of the passengers nodded and the dealer said its tolerably plain you cant go like that theyre that proud of themselves in empress theyd lock you up so ill try to find you something in my gripsack still while i concluded you never done the thing id like to hear you say straight off you know nothing about the burning of gaspards trail  then listen a second i answered you have my word for it that i know no more what caused the fire than you do you will be able to read my defense in the papers and i need not go into it here  thats enough for me was the answer now gentlemen if you have got anything you can lend my friend here in your valises ill guarantee theyre either replaced or returned some of you know me and heres my business card  it may be curious but i saw that most of those present and they were all apparently from parts of the prairie fully credited my statement and one voiced the sentiments of the rest when he said ill do the best i can if mr ormesby had played the firebug he wouldnt be so mighty anxious to get back to court again  the position was humiliating but no choice was left me i must either accept the willing offers or enter empress half naked and accordingly i made a hasty selection among the garments thrust upon me twenty minutes spent in the lavatory with the colored porters assistance produced a comforting change and when i returned to the car one of the most generous lenders surveyed me with pride as well as approval  you do us credit rancher and you neednt worry about the thanks weve no use for them he said hope youll get off but if you are sent up for burning down that place ill be proud of having helped to outfit a famous man  perhaps my face was ludicrous with its mingled expressions of gratitude and disgust at this naïve announcement for a general laugh went up which i finally joined in and that hoarse merriment gave me the freedom of the colonist car rude burlesque is interspersed amid many a tragedy and i had seen much worse situations saved by the grace of even coarse humor thereafter no personal questions were asked and most of my fellowtravelers treated me with a delicacy of consideration which is much less uncommon than one might suppose among the plain hardhanded men who wrest a living out of the prairie  night had closed in some time earlier when i strolled out across the platform of the car and leaned upon the rails of the firstclass before it tired physically as i was the nervous restlessness which followed the mental strain would i think have held me wakeful even if there had been anything more than a bare shelf of polished maple which finds out every aching bone to sleep on this however was not the case for those who travel colonist must bring their own bedding or do without it it was a glorious summer night still and soft and effulgent with the radiance of the full moon which hung low above the prairie while the sensation of the swift travel was bracing  there was no doubt that the accelerated was making up lost time and the lurching clanking pounding roar of flying wheels and panting of mammoth engines both soothed and exhilarated me they were in one sense prosaic and commonplace sounds butso it seemed to me that nightin another a testimony to mans dominion over not only plant and beast upon the face of the earth but also the primeval forces which move the universe further the diapason of the great drivers and titanic snorting rising and falling rhythmically amid the pulsating din broke through the prairies silence as it were a triumphant hymn of struggle and effort and toil allconquering as dropping the leagues behind it the long train roared on i knew something of the cost paid in the sweat of tremendous effort and part in blood and agony of the smooth road along which the great machines raced across the continent  perhaps i was overstrung and accordingly fanciful but i gathered fresh courage which was indeed badly needed and i had grown partly reassured and tranquil when the door creaked behind me and there was a light step on the platform then turning suddenly i found myself within a foot of lucille haldane she was bareheaded the moon shone on her face which as i had dreamed of it looked at once ethereal and very human under the silvery light this at least was not a fancy born of overtaxed nerves for while given to heartsome merriment daring and occasionally imperious there was a large share of the spiritual in the character of the girl shrewd she certainly was yet wholly fresh and innocent and at times i had seen depths of pity and sympathy which it seemed were not wholly earthly in her eyes when one can name and number all the mysterious forces that rule the heart or brain of man it may be possible to tell why when beatrice haldanes idealized image was ever before me i would have done more for her sister than for any living woman  we were both a little surprised at the encounter and i fancied i had seen a momentary shrinking from me in the eyes of the girl this at once furnished cause for wonder and hurt me she had shown no shrinking at our last meeting  i did not expect to meet you when i came out for the sake of coolness are you going east i said  lucille haldane was usually frank in speech but she now appeared to be perplexed by and almost to resent the question yes i have some business which cannot be neglected in that direction she said  is miss haldane or your father on board the train i asked and lucille seemed to hesitate before she answered  no my father is in winnipeg and beatrice has gone to montreal but mrs hansen our housekeeper is here with me  i was partly but not altogether relieved by this information it was no doubt foolish but i had been at first afraid that every one of my friends from bonaventure had seen in what manner i boarded the train i would have given a good deal to discover whether lucille had witnessed the spectacle but i did not quite see how to acquire the knowledge  it must be important business which takes you east alone i said idlyto gain time in which to frame a more leading question but the words had a somewhat startling effect a trace of indignation or confusion became visible in the girls face as she answered i have already told you it is business which cannot be neglected and if you desire any further information i fear i cannot give it to you now suppose we reverse the positions what has made you so unusually inquisitive tonight mr ormesby  the positions were reversed with a vengeance somewhat to my disgust i had neither right nor desire to pry into lucille haldanes affairs and yet felt feverishly anxious to discover how much or how little she had seen at the station it was no use to reason with myself that this was of no importance for the fact remained  i must apologize if i seemed inquisitive i said it would have been impertinence but i will make a bargain with you if you will tell me whether you boarded the cars immediately the train came in and what seat you took i will tell you the cause of it  this struck me as a clever maneuver for if as i hoped she had seen nothing the story would certainly reach bonaventure and it seemed much better that she should hear it first and carefully toned down from my own lips lucille haldanes face cleared instantaneously and there was a note of relief in her laugh  must you always make a bargain you remember the last but here she broke off suddenly and favored me with a wholly sympathetic glance i did not mean to recall that unfortunate night you should come to the point always for you are not brilliant in diplomacy and shall have without a price the information you so evidently desire i was standing on the car platform when you rode up to the station  we are only mortal and i fear i ground one heel perhaps audibly but certainly viciously into the boards beneath me still i am certain that my lips did not open nevertheless i was puzzled by the sparkle in lucille haldanes eyes which the radiant moonlight emphasized there was more than mischief in it but what the more consisted of i could not tell have you forgotten the virtues of civilized selfrestraint she asked demurely  i could see no cause for these swift changes which would probably have bewildered any ordinary man and i made answer it may be so but on this occasion at least i said nothing  lucille haldane laughed and laid her hand lightly on my arm as the cars jolted then you certainly looked it but i am not blaming you i saw you ride into the station and i hardly grasp the reason for so much modesty i do not know what delayed you but i know you were trying to redeem the trust your neighbors placed in you  i was apparently a prey to all disordered fancies that night for it seemed a desecration that the little white hand should even bear the touch of another mans jacket and i lifted it gently into my own hard palm also i think i came desperately near stooping and touching it with my lips be that as it may in another second the opportunity was lacking for lucille grasped the rails with it some distance away from me and leaned out over them to watch the sliding prairie her light dress streaming about her in the whistling draught  the cars were very stuffy and i am glad i came out it is a perfectly glorious night she said  the remark seemed very disconnected but she was right the prairie there was deadlevel a vast rippling silver sea overhung by a spangled vault of softest indigo in spite of the rattling ballast and puffs of whirledup dust the lash of cool wind was grateful and the rush of the clanking cars stirred ones blood still in contrast to their bulk and speed the slight figure in the fluttering white dress seemed very frail and insecure as it leaned forth from the rails and i set my teeth when with a sudden swing and a giddy slanting we roared across a curving bridge before the dark creek whirled behind us i had flung my arm partly around the girls waist and clenched the rails in front of her  i am quite safe she said calmly after a curious glance at me you look positively startled  i was so i answered speaking no more than the truth for the fright had turned me cold and she once more looked down at the whirling prairie  that was very unreasonable you are not responsible for me  perhaps the fright had rendered me temporarily lightheaded for i answered on impulse no on the other hand you are responsible for me  i the girl said quietly with a demureness which was not all mockery how could that be such a responsibility would be too onerous for me  why it should be i cannot tell you but it is the truth i said twice when a crisis had to be faced it was your opinions that turned the scale for me and i think that growing hopeless i should have allowed lane to rob me and gone elsewhere in search of better fortune had it not been for the courage you infused into me once or twice also you pointed the way out of a difficulty and the clearness of your views was almost startling the most curious thing is that you are so much younger than i  i had spoken no more than the truth and was conscious of a passing annoyance when lucille haldane laughed there is no overcoming masculine vanity and i once heard my father say you were in some respects very young for your age she said i am afraid it was presumption but i dont mind admitting i am glad if any chance word of mine nerved you to continue your resistance her voice changed a little as she added of course that is because your enemys work is evil and i think you will triumph yet  neither of us spoke again for a time and i remember reflecting that whoever won lucille haldane would have a helpmate to be proud of in this world and perhaps by virtue of what she could teach him follow into the next i could think so the more dispassionately because now both she and her sister were far above me though knowing my own kind i wondered where either could find any man worthy  so the minutes slipped by while the great express raced on and blue heavens and silver prairie unrolled themselves before us in an apparently unending panorama there had been times when i considered such a prospect dreary enough but it appeared surcharged with a strange glamour that moonlit night  will miss haldane return to bonaventure i asked at length  i hardly think so said the girl we have very different tastes you know and as father will not keep more than one of us with him we can both gratify them beatrice will leave for england soon and in all probability will not visit bonaventure again  she looked at me with a strange expression as she spoke and when her meaning dawned on me i was conscious of a heavy shock i had braced myself to face the inevitable already but the knowledge was painful nevertheless and my voice was not quite steady when i said you imply that miss haldane is to be married shortly  it is not an impossible contingency  lucille spoke gravely and i wondered whether she had guessed the full significance of the intimation perhaps my face had grown a little harder or the tightening of my fingers on the rail betrayed me for she looked up very sympathetically i thought it would be better that you should know  there was such kindness stamped on her face that my heart went out to her and it was almost huskily i said i thank you you have keen perceptions  lucille smiled gravely one could see that you thought much of beatriceand i was sorry that it should be so  her tone seemed to challenge further speech and presently i found words again it was an impossible dream almost from the beginning but i awakened to the reality long ago still nothing can rob me of the satisfaction of having known your sister and you and your influence has been good for me one can at least cherish the memory and even a wholly impossible fancy has its benefits  the girl colored and said quietly it is not our fault that you overrate us and one finds the standard others set up for one irksome and yet you cannot be easily influenced from what i know  heaven knows how weak and unstable i have been at times but i learned much that was good for me at bonaventure and should whatever happens desire to keep your good opinion i said  i think you will always do that said the girl moving towards the door it is growing late but before i go i want to ask you to go to your trial tomorrow with a good courage and not to be astonished at anything you hear or see if you are you must try to remember that we canadians actually are as our orators tell us a free people and that the prairie farmers do not monopolize all our love of justice  she brushed lightly past me and the prairie grew dim and desolate as the door clicked to i had long dreaded the news just given me but such expectations do not greatly lessen ones sense of loss still it may have been that my senses were too dulled to feel the worst pain and i sat down on the top step of the platform with my arm through the railing in a state of utter weariness and dejection which mercifully acted as an anesthetic how long i watched the moonlit waste sweep past the humming wheels i do not know but tired nature must have had her way for it was early morning when a brakeman fell over me and by the time the resultant altercation was concluded the clustered roofs of empress rose out of the prairie     chapter xxiii  liberty   sleep had brought me a brief forgetfulness but the awakening was not pleasant when i painfully straightened my limbs on the jolting platform while the twin whistles shrieked ahead every joint ached from the previous days exertions my borrowed garments were clammy with dew and i shivered in the cold draught that swept past the slowing cars the sun had not cleared the grayness which veiled the east and frowned down upon by huge elevators which rose higher and higher against a lowering sky the straggling town loomed up depressingly out of the surrounding desolation the pace grew slower a thicket of willows choked with empty cans and garbage slid by then the rails of the stockyards closed in on each hand and we jolted over the switches into the station which was built as usual not in but facing the prairie town  there was no sign of life in its illpaved streets down which the dust wisps danced bare squares of wooden buildings devoid of all ornamentation save for glaring advertisements which emphasized their ugliness walled them in and the whole place seemed stamped with the dreariness which characterizes most prairie towns when seen early on a gloomy morning by anybody not in the best of spirits my fellowpassengers were apparently asleep but i was the better pleased having no desire for speech and i dropped from the platform as soon as the locomotive stopped hurrying out of the station i did not turn around until a row of empty farm wagons hid the track which action was not without results  one hotel door stood open but knowing that its tariff was not in accordance with my finances i passed it by and patrolled the empty streets until the others or a dry goods store should make ready for business one of the latter did so first and when i entered a mirror showed that the decision was not unnecessary the borrowed jacket was far too small the vest as much too large while somebodys collar cut chokingly into my sunburnt neck still the prices the sleepy clerk mentioned were prohibitive and after wasting a little time in somewhat pointed argumentof which he had the betteri strode out of the store struggling with an inclination to assault him western storekeepers are seldom characterized by superfluous civility and there are disadvantages attached to a life in a country so free that according to one of its sayings any man who cannot purchase boots may always walk barefooted  i dont know what the outfit youve got on cost you and shouldnt wonder by the way it fits if you got it cheap he said we dont turn out our customers like scarecrows anyway and if youd had the money we would have tried to make a decent show of you  i was nevertheless able after almost emptying my purse to replace at least the vest and jacket at a rival establishment whose proprietor promised to forward the borrowed articles to their legitimate owners i afterwards discovered that they never received them  you look smart as a city drummer the top half of you but it makes the rest look kind of mean you want to live up to that coat he said after a critical survey  i cant do it at the price unless you will take your chances of getting paid when the stock go east i said and the dealer shook his head sorrowfully  we dont trade that way with strangers and i dont know you  i was in a reckless mood and some puerile impulse prompted me to astonish him my name is henry ormesby  the man positively gasped and then with western keenness prepared to profit by the opportunity ill fit you out all for nothing if youll walk round to the photographers and give me your picture with a notice to stick in the window that you think my things the best in town he said it would be worth money every time the prairie boys come in and i dont mind throwing a little of it into the bargain  this was exasperating but i could not restrain a mirthless laugh and leaving the enterprising dealer astonished that any man should refuse such an offer i hurried out of the store but by the time the breakfast hour arrived all trace of even sardonic humor had left me it was with difficulty i had raised sufficient ready money for the journey and there now remained but two or three silver coins in my pocket while remembering that the dealer had been justified in pointing out the desirability of a complete renovation i reflected gloomily that it would be useless because in all probability the nation would shortly feed and clothe me i also remembered how i had seen men with heavy chains on their ankles roadmaking before the public gaze in a british columbian town  meanwhile i was very hungry and presently sat down to a simple breakfast in a crowded room while waiting a few minutes my eyes fell on a commercial article in a newspaper which while noting a revival of trade deplored the probable abandonment of much needed railroad extension the writer appeared well posted and mentioned the road we hoped so much from as one of the works which would not be undertaken i laid down the journal with a sigh and noticed that the men about me were discussing the coming trial  i expect theyll send ormesby up said one man between his rapid gulps dont know whether he done it but he threatened the other fellow and said hed see him roasted before he helped while that matchbox would fix most anybody up  well i dont know observed a neighbor the matchbox looks bad but i guess if id been burning a place up i shouldnt have forgotten it still it might be fatal unless he could disown it as to the other thing i dont count much on what he said a real firebug would have kept his mouth shut and helped all he was worth instead of saying anything  im offering five to one he goes up any takers said the first speaker and it was significant that although most westerners are keen at a bet nobody offered  id do it for less cept for the matchbox said one  i managed to finish my breakfast feeling thankful thatbecause so their appearance suggested those who sat at meat had driven in from the prairie to enjoy the spectaclenone of them recognized me the odds in their opinion were more than five to one against me and i agreed with them slipping out i found dixon and reported my presence to the police and after what seemed an endless waiting at the court it was early afternoon when dixon said to me theyll be ready in five minutes and i want you to keep a tight rein on your temper ormesby i can do all the fancy talking that is necessary you can keep your heart up too there are going to be surprises for everyone today  i was called in a few minutes and if the court had been thronged on previous occasions it was packed to suffocation now it was a bare ugly woodbuilt room even dirtier than it was dingy neither is there anything impressive save perhaps to the culprit about the administration of western justice and i was thankful for a lethargy which helped me to bear the suspense with outward indifference nothing striking marked the first part of the proceedings and i sat listening to the drawl of voices like one in a dream some of the spectators yawned and some fidgeted until there was a sudden stir of interest as the name thomas wilkins rang through the court  i guess thats the prosecutions trump ace said a man beneath me  i became suddenly intent as this witness took his stand he was of the usual type of canadianborn farm hand bronzed and wiry but not heavily built and hazarded what i fancied was a meaning glance at me i could not understand it for he seemed at once ashamed and exultant  i was hired by rancher niven to help him at gaspards trail and remember the night of the fire well guess anybody whod been trod on by a horse and left with broken bones to roast would he said and proceeded to confirm nivens testimony this was nothing new and the interest slackened but revived again when the witness approached the essential part of his story and i could hear my own heart thumping more plainly than the slow drawling voice  i was round at the wreck of the homestead some time after the fire dont know the date but niven made a note of it kind of precise man he was the place wasnt all burnt to the ground and niven he crawls in under some fallen logs into what had been the kitchen the door opened right on to the prairie and anybody could slip in if they wanted to niven grabbed at something on the floor come along and take a look at this says he and i saw it was a silver matchbox he held up there was h ormesby not quite worn off it niven he prospects some more and finds a flattened coaloil tin yes sir those you are holding up are the very things we dont use that brand of oil and buy ours in bigger cans says he  i could see by the spectators faces it was damaging testimony and dixons serene appearance was incomprehensible while for the benefit of those ignorant of western customs it may be explained that kerosene is sold in large square tins for the settlers convenience in several parts of the dominion  i went over to the store with niven next day continued the witness the man who kept it allowed that rancher ormesby was about the only man he sold that brand to in small cans  there were signs of subdued sensation and wilkins continued we gave them both to sergeant mackay and byandby i was summoned to come here and testify i came right along then it struck me it was mean to help in sending up the man whod saved my life so i just lit out and hid myself until the police trailed me  it was news to hear that lane had no hand in the witnesss disappearance and again he flashed an apparently wholly unwarranted reassuring glance in my direction then while i wondered hopelessly whether dixon could shake his testimony the latter stood up  i purpose to ask thomas wilkins a few questions later and will not trouble him about the matchbox being perfectly satisfied as to the accuracy of the facts he states he said  i could see the spectators stare at him in surprise and wondering if he had lost his senses settled myself to listen as the storekeeper deposed to selling me oil of the description mentioned adding reluctantly that very few others took the same size of can this and a lengthy speech closed the prosecutors case and it seemed when he had finished that nothing short of a miracle could save me the audience was also evidently of the same opinion  dixon commenced feebly by submitting evidence as to my uprightness of character which his opponent allowed to pass unchallenged with a somewhat contemptuous indifference then he said it will be remembered that in his evidence sergeant mackay deposed that the witness niven told him the burning homestead was not insured and i will call the western agent of a famous fire office  the evidence of the gentleman in question was brief and to the point i have heard the statement that gaspards trail was not insured and cant understand it the witness niven took out a policy three months before the fire and sent in his claim straight off to me the company declined to meet it until this case was settled am i quite certain or can i offer any explanation well heres our premium receipt foil and record of the policy cant suggest any explanation except that somebody is lying  this was received with some sensation and dixon smiled at me as if there were more in store you will observe that the witness niven cannot be considered a very truthful person i will recall thomas wilkins he said  wilkins had lost his shamefacedness when he reappeared i said the prisoner saved my life and meant just that he said answering a question it was he who took me out of the fire and i had sense enough to see he was leading the boys who saved all nivens horses its my opinionyou dont want opinions well ill try to pitch in the solid facts  your master went east for a few days before the fire and brought a case of groceries home with him said dixon will you tell us if you opened that case  i did was the answer he sent me into the station for it with the check said our storekeeper was a robber and hed saved money by buying down east it was a blame heavy case so i started to open it in the wagon and had just pulled the top off when niven came along  did you see anything except groceries in it asked dixon and there was a stirring in the court when wilkins answered i did i had lit on to the top of three coaloil tins when the boss came in  did he look pleased at your diligence  no sir he looked real mad if youll do what youre asked to without mixing up my private things it will be good enough for me get your horses fixed right now he said  you are sure about the oil tins were they large or smalland did you ever see them or the groceries again  dead sure was the answer i stowed the groceries in the kitchen but never saw the oil it was a smaller size than we used any way didnt think much about it until i read a paper about this trial not long ago begin to think a good deal now  i drew in a deep breath and the movements of expectant listeners grew more audible when reminded that his impressions were not asked for wilkins stepped down hope was beginning to dawn for i could see that dixon was on the trail of a conspiracy everybody seemed eager the prosecutor as much so as the rest and there was a deep silence when dixon folded up the paper on which he had been making notes  my next witness is miss lucille haldane of bonaventure he said  there was a low murmur every head was turned in the same direction and i grew hot with shame and indignation when haldanes younger daughter walked into the witness stand it seemed to me a desecration that she should be dragged forward into an atmosphere of crime as part of the spectacle before a sea of curious faces and i had never felt the enforced restraint so horribly oppressive as when i read admiration in some of them had it been possible to wither up dixon with a glance it is hardly likely that he would ever have handled a case again the girl looked very young and pretty as with a patch of almost hectic color in each cheek and a brightness in her eyes she took her place she wore no veil and held herself proudly as without sign of weakness she looked down at the assembly while she did so there was without articulate sound something that suggested wonder and approval in the universal movement and i heard a man beneath me say shes a daisy now were coming right into the business end of the play  you know the prisoner ormesby asked dixon and though her voice was low its clear distinctness seemed to permeate the building as she answered i do he is a friend of my fathers and visited us at bonaventure occasionally  did you ever see a silver matchbox in his possession and if so could you describe it  i did on several occasions he wore it hooked on to his watchchain and once handed it to me to light a lamp with it had an oakleaf engraving with a partly obliterated inscriptionfrom  to h ormesby  i think that is an accurate description said dixon and when the judge who held up a little silver object and passed it on to the jury signified assent i glanced in savage bewilderment at the speaker it had appeared shameful cruelty to hale that delicate girl into a crowded court now it also appeared sheer madness she never once glanced in my direction but stood with head erect one hand resting on the rails where the pitiless sunlight beat full upon her with eyes fixed only on the judge but in spite of her courage i could see that her lips trembled while the little gloved fingers tightened spasmodically on the rails then i hung my head for very shame that i had been the unwitting cause of such an ordeal feeling that i would prefer to suffer ten convictions rather than that she should become a subject for discussion in every saloon and the free commentary of the western press even if she could have saved me  when did you last see the matchbox asked dixon  on the morning of the wednesday in the third week after the fire i am sure of the day because the visit of some friends from montreal impressed it on my memory henry ormesby had stayed all night at bonaventure and left early in the morning a maid brought me the matchbox which she had found on the bureau with one or two articles of clothing and as he did not return i told her to slip the matchbox inside the packet and forward them i forgot the incident until the trial recalled it  as lucille ceased it flashed upon me that i had wondered how the matchbox had made its way into a pocket in which i never carried it then i was borne down by a great wave of gratitude to the girl who it seemed had saved me she was rigorously crossexamined and while i do not know whether the prosecutor exceeded due limits in his efforts to shake her evidence i grew murderously inclined towards him as i noticed how his victims color came and went and the effort it cost her not to shrink under the questions but her courage rose with the emergency and when the indignation crept into her eyes there was several times subdued applause as her answer to some innuendo carried a rebuke with it  at last the approbation was no more subdued but swelled into a hoarse murmur which filled all the court when she drew herself up at the question and it was because you were a firm friend of the prisoners you recollected all this so opportunely and in spite of the diffidence any lady in your position would feel volunteered to give evidence  the damask patch had spread to lucille haldanes forehead but instead of being downcast her eyes were filled with light no she said and the vibration in her voice had a steely ring it was because i am a canadian and accordingly desired to see justice done to an innocent man can you consider such a desire either uncommon or surprising  a full minute had elapsed before the case proceeded during which an excitable juryman rose and seemed on the point of haranguing the assembly until a comrade dragged him down then laughter broke through the murmurs as he gesticulated wildly amid shouts of order  a scandinavian domestic quaintly corroborated her mistresss statement and there was no doubt that the scale was turned but dixon did not leave his work halfcompleted and the next witness confirmed this evidence  i keep the railroad hotel its not a saloon but a hotel with a big h he said know harry ormesby well saw him about three weeks after the fire lighting a cigar i gave him from a silver matchbox oh yes im quite sure about the box had several times seen the thing before was pretty busy when the boys started smoking round the stove after supper and forgot to pick up something bright beneath ormesbys chair was going to tell him hed dropped his box when somebody called me the boys cleared out when the cars came in and i saw niven among them knew him as a customerdont want to as a friend got too much of the coyote about him my chinaman was turning out the lights when i saw somebody slip back quietly he grabbed at something by the chair and went out by the other door there was only a light in the passage left and i didnt quite recognize him could swear it wasnt ormesby and think he was more like niven asked niven about it afterwards and he said it wasnt he didnt see ormesby but wired his lawyer when id read the papers dont believe ormesby had enough malice in him to burn up a henhouse  there were further signs of sensation and sergeant mackay was called again he had ridden over to gaspards trail the day following the fire and decided to clear out the refuse dump he said then the whole audience grinned when being asked why he did so he glanced at the jury as if for sympathy answering i was thinking i might find something inside it a man must do his duty but it was a sairly distressful operation he found two unopened coaloil tins resembling the flattened one and was certain by the appearance of the dump they had been placed there some time before the fire  there was no further evidence dixon said very little but that little told the jury had scarcely retired before one of them reappeared and with a rush of blood to my forehead and a singing in my ears i caught the wordsnot guilty  then when the judge and even the prosecuting counsel said he fully concurred the murmurs swelled until they filled the court again and presently i was standing outside a free man in the center of an excited crowd for western citizens are desperately fond of any sensation how many cigars and offers of liquid refreshment were thrust upon me i do not remember but they were overwhelmingly numerous and i was grateful when dixon came to the rescue  mr ormesby is much obliged to you gentlemen but its quiet he wants just now he said while we had hardly reached the leading hotel where dixon led me than there was a clamor in the direction of the court and i looked at him inquiringly  i expect theyve issued a warrant for niven on a charge of conspiracy or arson and the boys have heard of it he said however i have had sufficient professional occupation for today and were going to get supper and afterwards enjoy ourselves as we can  i had nevertheless determined to thank my benefactress first and ignoring dixons advice sent up my name i was informed that miss haldane would receive nobody and the lawyer smiled dryly when i returned crestfallen i dont think you need feel either hurt or surprised he said  the inhabitants of the prairie towns differ from the taciturn plainsmen in being vociferously enthusiastic and mercurial and to my disgust the citizens came in groups to interview me while one who shoved his way into our quarters by main force said the rest would take it kindly if i made a speech to them  you can tell them i feel honored but nobody can charge me with ever having done such a thing in my life i said and the representatives of the populace retired to find another outlet for their energies as we presently discovered  i owe my escape solely to a ladys courage and your skill dixon but why didnt you try to implicate lane i said and the lawyer laughed  any reasonable man ought to be satisfied with the verdict and demonstration it would have been difficult if not useless while i fancy that if lane is allowed a little more rope his time will shortly come he said hallo here are more enthusiastic citizens desirous of interviewing you  keep them out for heavens sake i said but before dixon could secure the door sergeant mackay strode in  i have come to congratulate ye it will be a lesson til ye ormesby he announced  i did not see the hand he held out im in no mood for sermons and cant appreciate your recent actions as they perhaps deserve i said and the sergeants eyes twinkled mischievously  it should not be that difficult and ye have the consolation that we served the state he said it was in the interests of justice wewellwe made use of ye to stalk the other man  theres no use pretending im grateful i commenced but dixon broke into a boisterous laugh and the sergeants face grew so humorous that my own relaxed and we made friends again the reunion had not long been consummated when a rattle of wheels followed by the tramp of many feet and the wheezy strains of a cornet rose from below and striding to the window i said with dismay lock the door theyre coming with a band and torches now  im thinking ye need not said mackay dryly its a farewell to miss haldane theyre giving  we gathered at the opened window looking down at a striking spectacle a vehicle stood waiting and behind it lighted by the glow of kerosene torches a mass of faces filled the street the heads were uncovered almost simultaneously and lucille haldane appeared upon the hotel steps with her attendants behind her at first she shrank back a little from the gaze of the admiring crowd to whom her spirit and beauty had doubtless appealed but when one of them urged something very respectfully with his hat in his hand she moved forward a pace and stood very erect a slight but queenly figure looking down at them  i am honored gentlemen she said falteringly though her voice gained strength it was merely a duty i did but i am gratified that it pleased you just because it shows that all of us are proud of our country and eager for its credit to crush oppression and see justice done to the downtrodden  the street rang with the cheer that followed and when dixon seized his hat the action was infectious the next minute we were moving forward amid the ranks of the enthusiastic crowd behind the vehicle which jolted slowly towards the station and i discovered later that the uncomfortable sensation at the back of my neck was caused by the hot oil from a torch which dripped upon it in the meantime i noticed nothing but the sea of faces the tramp of feet and the final burst of cheering at the station in which mackay holding aloft his forage cap joined vociferously  its only fit and proper shes as good and brave as shes bonny he said     chapter xxiv  a secret tribunal   some little time had elapsed since my acquittal when one pleasant summer morning i rode out from the railroad settlement bound for bonaventure the air was soft and balmy the sunshine brilliant and the prairie sod which by that time had in most years grown parched and dry formed a springy green carpet beneath the horses feet there had but once before been such a season within my memory and my spirits were almost as buoyant as the wallet in my pocket was heavy the lean years had passed and left us perhaps a little more grave in face and quiet in speech to look forward to a brightening future while the receipts i had brought back from the nearest town meant freedom at least  i was also unwearied in body for the roll of paper money in the wallet had made a vast difference to me and instead of riding all night after a long railroad journey i had slept and breakfasted well at the wooden hotel indeed i almost wondered whether i were the same man who had previously ridden that way in a state of sullen desperation spurred on by hatred and dogged obstinacy instead of hope now i was however rather thankful than jubilant for my satisfaction was tempered by a perhaps unusual humility steel thorn and i had in our own blundering fashion made the best fight we could but it was the generosity of others and the winds of heaven which had brought us the victory  distance counts for little in these days when the steel track and the modern cargo steamer together girdle the face of the globe and the loss of others had been our gain there had been scarcity in argentina and australian grass was shriveling for want of rain famine had smitten india and the great cattlebarons beyond our frontier had been overbusily engaged attempting the extermination of the smaller settlers to attend their legitimate business so buyers in europe were looking to canada for wheat and cattle our own beasts had flourished and before the usual season we had driven every salable head in to the railroad riding in force behind them that drive and the events which followed it were worth remembering  i sold the cattle in winnipeg for excellent prices and deducting my own share of the proceeds took the first train westward to visit lane and paid him down threefourths of the balance of the loan having bought wisdom dearly i took a lawyer with me lane showed neither surprise nor chagrin though he must have felt both and i could almost admire the way he bore defeat he was less a man than a moneymaking machine and the more to be dreaded for his absence of passion rage was apparently as unknown to him as pity and though he knew he had lost crane valley and with it the completion of a welllaid scheme he actually pushed a cigarbox towards me as he signed the receipt i drew a deep breath of relief as i passed the papers to the lawyer for the harvest would more than cover what remained of the debt and then i laid down certain sums on behalf of others lane smiled almost affably as he tossed the quittances upon the table  theyre all in order rancher a capable man dont need to use secondrate trickery and im open to allow that the bullfrog was hard to squash he said  i pocketed the documents and went out in silence speech would have been useless because the man had no sensibilities that could be wounded but the interview struck me as a grotesquely commonplace termination of a struggle which had cost me months of misery indeed i found it hard to convince myself that what had happened was real and the heavy burden flung off at last being by no means a mere passionless moneymaking machine i had nevertheless not finished with lane  it was evening the next day when i reached bonaventure and was shown into the presence of its owner who had lately returned there from the east he looked haggard and did not rise out of the chair he lounged in though his voice was cordial you have been successful ormesby i can see it by your face he said  i have sir i answered more so than i dared to hope and i fancy you will be astonished when you count these bills the bonaventure draft played a leading part in my release and now i find it difficult to realize that the luck has changed at last  it was not quite dark outside but the curtains were drawn and haldane sat beside a table littered with papers under a silver readinglamp his face looked curiously ascetic and thin but the smile in his keen eyes was genial boone sat opposite him smoking and nodded goodhumoredly to me  you will soon get used to prosperity and there is no occasion for gratitude haldane said tossing the roll of paper money across the table but taking up the account i laid beside it i notice that you have earned me a profit of twenty per cent you have tolerable business talents in your own direction ormesby and i shall expect your good counsel in the practical management of bonaventure which i have undertaken  the management of bonaventure i said and haldanes forehead grew wrinkled as he nodded  exactly the verdict has been given no more exciting corners or supposititious heaping up of unearned increments for me i am sentenced by the specialists to a dormant life and openair exercise and have accordingly chosen the rearing of cattle on the salubrious prairie  i guessed what that sentence meant to a man of his energies but he had accepted it gracefully and i was almost startled when he said do you know that i envied you ormesby even when things looked worst for you  i could only murmur a few not overappropriate words of sympathy though i fancied that had haldane been under the same grip he might have envied me less  it takes time to grow used to idleness which is why i sent for you tonight he said with a swift resumption of his usual tone i purpose to teach lane that he is not altogether so omnipotent as he believes himselfpartly by way of amusement and to forward certain views of my own and partly because my younger daughter insists that he is a menace to every honest man on the prairie boone appears inclined to agree with her  i might even go a little further sir said boone  haldane ignored the comment and pointed to the papers of which there appeared to be a bushel i have been posting myself in my new profession and conclude that the prospects for grain and live stock are encouraging he said news from chile california and the austral all confirm this view and remembering it we will consider lanes position boone has taken considerable pains to discover that as i expected his resources are far from inexhaustible and circumstances point to the fact that he has set his teeth in too big a morsel at present neither the speculative public nor wouldbe emigrants have grasped the position and therefore lane would get little if he realized on his stolen lands just now  that is plain but what results from it i said  prosperity to poor men according to my daughter and haldanes smile was not wholly cynical we purpose that he should realize as soon as possible boone discovered that he is raising money to carry on by quietly selling out his stock in the investment company which has consistently backed him and i feel inclined for a speculation in that direction especially as the public will shortly be invited to increase the companys capital lastly i am in possession of accurate information while lane is not contrary to general opinion the railroad will be hurried through very shortly  it was great news and the possible downfall of my enemy perhaps the least of it it implied swift prosperity for all that district and while i stared at the speaker the blood surged to my forehead though fate had robbed me of the best part of what i had toiled and fought and suffered for was to come about at last and the calmness of the others appeared unnatural haldanes eyes were keen but he showed no sign of unusual interest boones face was merely grim and i guessed that the man whose heel had been on my neck would fare ill between them  if he had used legitimate weapons one could almost be sorry for him i said it will try even his nerve to lose all he has plotted for when the prize is actually if he knew it within his grasp  he deserves no mercy boone broke in this is justice ormesby neither more nor less and unless we cripple him once for all he will take hold again with the first bad season what you will shortly hear should demonstrate the necessity for decisive measures but our host forgot to mention that he declines to profit individually by this opportunity  if anyone wishes to learn my virtues he can apply to certain company promoters in montreal said haldane languidly boone will remember that i came here to farm for my health and have been coerced into assisting at this vehmgericht those wheels however give warning that the first sitting will commence  a minute or two later i started wrathfully to my feet as niven was ushered into the room he on his part seemed equally astonished and i think would have backed out again but that boone adroitly slammed the door behind him it may be mentioned that he had been tried in my place and to the disgust of sergeant mackay just escaped conviction  i need not introduce mr ormesby who will kindly resume his place said haldane pleasantly sit down and choose a cigar if you feel like it you sent word you wanted to talk to me  i didnt want to talk to that man and niven scowled at me while haldane shrugged his shoulders  i cant turn him out you see now hadnt you better explain what you want with me  there was a languid contempt beneath the speakers surface goodhumor which was not lost on the fidgeting man but he lighted a cigar with an air of bravado and commenced  thinking over things i figured both you and adams had your knife in lane and haldanes mild surprise was excellently assumed well ive got my own knife in him too its this way lane put up the money for me to buy out ormesby and made a mighty close bargain thinking i darent kick it would have been inconvenient and i didnt mean to but when those blame police ran me in for a thing i never done he just turns his back and wouldnt put up a dollar to defend me ive no use for blunderers of your kind says he  one could understand that it is necessary for him to make sure of his subordinates abilities said haldane reflectively and niven who stared hard at him appeared to gulp down something before he proceeded  well he cant fool with me and it comes to this im recorded owner of gaspards trail paid for it with my own checklane fixed that up now what i want to ask you is hows lane going to turn me out if i hold on to the place strikes me he cant do it  in spite of this assurance the speaker looked distinctly eager until haldane answered we need not discuss the moral aspect of the case because it apparently hasnt one and you might not understand it if it had speaking from a purely business point of view i feel tolerably certain that in the circumstances he would not take legal proceedings against you though i have no doubt he might arrange the affair in some other way  feel quite sure asked niven and haldane answered i may say i do  nivens grin of triumph would have sickened any honest man but i was not sorry for his employer i guess ill take my chances of the other way and im coming straight to business will you stand behind me its not going to be a charity there is money in gaspards trail and im open to make a fair deal with the man who sees me through  i saw haldanes lips set tightly for a moment and my hand itched for a good hold of nivens collar but the master of bonaventure next regarded him with a quiet amusement which appeared disconcerting  i fancy your worthy master was correct when he described you as a blunderer he said it would be quite impossible for me to make a bargain of thator any otherkind with you you might also have added that he inspired you to more than the buying of gaspards trail  there was pluck in niven for he laughed offensively i got my verdict and if you wont deal i may as well be going anyhow youve told me what i most wanted to know  he departed without further parley and haldane smiled at me it would have been a pity to detain him and lane was wrong in choosing an understudy he could not scare into submission that rascal will hold on to gaspards trail and the loss of it will further hamper his master  some little time passed and boone who appeared impatient said at last she is late but gordon may have been too busy to drive her over earlier and she promised me faithfully that she would come  haldane said nothing though he seemed dubious until there was another sound of wheels and i had a second surprise when a lady was ushered into the room for i could scarcely believe my eyes when i saw that it was redmonds daughter she had changed greatly from the girl who called down vengeance on the oppressor when we brought her father home although the glitter in her eyes and the intentness of her face showed the strain of emotional nature in her still she was handsomely and tastefully dressed and carried herself with dignity  this is mr haldane miss redmond and i am sure he will be grateful to you for coming said boone who i noticed appeared relieved when the new arrival laid a packet on the table i may explain for ormesbys benefit that miss redmond who is winning fame as a singer has something of importance to show him he added  the girls hand was very cold when it touched my own and her movements nervous as she drew a book in tattered binding out of its wrappings  i hope mrs gordon will spare you as long as possible and that your visit to the prairie will do you good said haldane placing a chair for her  once i fancied i could never look at the prairie without a shudder but of late i have been longing for sunshine and air and shall perhaps be happier when this is over said the girl it is a very hard thing i have to do and i must tell you the whole painful story  we can understand that it must be said haldane gently  when i left home for winnipeg i joined a secondrate variety company i had inherited a gift for singing and those who heard me were pleased with the old irish ballads my mother taught me so there was soon no fear of poverty and i was trying to bury the past when the night i first sang to a packed audience in winnipeg it was once more dragged up before me i came home from what the newspapers said was a triumph and because one critic had questioned a verse of an old song i looked for a book of my mothers among the relics i had brought from the prairie i foundthisinstead  ailin redmond ceased with a little gasp and glancing at the dilapidated account book she touched i wondered what power it could have had to change her triumph into an agony  i sat all that night beside the stove trying to force myself to burn the book and yet afraid she continued perhaps we are superstitious but i felt that i dare not and its secret has been a very burden ever since sometimes i thought of the revenge it would give me and yet i could not take it without blackening my fathers memory so i kept silence until my health commenced to fail under the strain and meeting mr boone at brandan where i sang at the time mr ormesbys trial filled the papers i felt i must tell him part of my discovery had the trial not ended as it did he would have consulted with lawyer dixon afterwards though i hated lane the more i pledged mr boone to secrecy and kept silent until when i could bear the load no longer i told my trouble to père louis if you only desire vengeance it would be better to burn the book but if you can save innocent men from persecution and prevent the triumph of the wicked silence would be a sin he said then i wrote to mr boone and told him i would show the papers to mr ormesby  i opened the battered volume handed me with a strong sense of anticipation and as i did so the girl shrank back shivering redmonds writing was recognizable and i thrilled alternately with pity and indignation against another person as i read his testimony omitting other details the dated entries arranged in debit and credit fashion told the whole story  deep snow and stock very poor the first i glanced at ran received from ormesby three loads of hay sure tis a decent neighbor for he wouldnt take no pay entered so if i ever have the luck to send it back to him  plowoxen sick horseteam sorebacked seven days plowing done by ormesby saymoney at harvest or to be returned in help stock driving  fifty dollars loan from ormesby see entry overdue grocery bill  is it necessary for me to read any more of these i asked  no if you are satisfied that he at least recognized the debt pass on to the other marked pages answered the writers daughter  i set my lips as i did so for there was only one inference to be drawn from the following entries which ran dated in a series demand for fifteen hundred dollars from lane no credit ten dollars in the house lane came over and part renewed the loan in return for services to be rendered black curses on the pitiless devil took twenty head of prime stock to be driven to the hollow with ormesbys started out with the stock for gaspards trail  there were no further entries and miss redmond who had been watching me said with a perceptible effort  you will remember all those dates well now read what is written on the loose leaf when i came in one night the book lay on the table with that leaf projecting but as my father was always fretting over the accounts i did not glance at it as i replaced the book  the writing was blurred and scrawlingthe work of an unstable man in a moment of agony and some of the halfcoherent sentences ran it was lane and his master the devil who drove me i did not mean to do what i did but when the fire came down remembered he said any convenient accident i knew it was murder when i saw ormesby with the blood on his face further lines were almost unintelligible but i made out judas no room on earth lane says he is dying fast you will hate the man who drove me for ever and ever  i folded up the paper and not having read the whole of it handed it to the girl i am almost sorry you were brave enough to show me this but i can only try to forget it i said  miss redmonds eyes were dry but she moved as if in physical pain and clenched one hand as she said that secret has worn me down for weary months and i dare not change my mind again i shall never rest until it is certain that wicked man shall drive no one else to destruction you must show mr haldane all you have read  haldane laid down the book and sat silent for at least a minute will you please tell us miss redmond how far you can allow us to make use of this he said  the girl shuddered before she answered it must not be made public but if in any other way you can strike lane down i will leave it you you can hardly guess what all this has cost me but god forgive me the hate i feel is stronger than shameand his last words are burned into my brain  ailin redmond rose as she spoke and i saw that part of père louiss admonition had fallen upon stony ground her face and pose were what they had been when she had bidden us bring the dead man in she came of a passionate race but there had also been a signal lack of balance in her fathers temperament and perhaps it was this very strain of wildness which had made her singing a success  haldane with expressions of sympathy led her to the door and returning sat staring straight before him with a curious expression i dont know that the stolid emotionless person is not far the happiest he said at last she must have suffered a good dealpoor soul and even allowing that you had not seen those pitiful papers im doubtful if you acted quite wisely boone however the question now is how are we going to use them  nobody but ourselves must see them i managed to answer savage as i was  i would make one exception said the owner of bonaventure that one is the man responsible it can be no enlightenment to him and the fact that he would not suspect us of any reluctance to make the most of our power strengthens our ability to deal with him  our conference ended shortly and when we joined the others i saw that lucille haldane had taken redmonds daughter under her wing how she had managed it of course i do not know but the latter appeared comforted already and there was a gentle dimness instead of the former hard glitter in her eyes then and it was not for the first time i felt that i could have bowed down and worshiped the mistress of bonaventure  it was evident that boone had also been observant for he afterwards said with unusual gravity women resembling miss lucille haldane are the salt of this sorrowful world there was only one i ever knew to compare with her and she being too good for it was translated to what if only because she was called there must be a better  i agreed with his first statement entirely and took his word for the rest but made no answer boone did not appear to desire one and again a strange longing filled his eyes while the shadow crept into his face i remembered it was written that the heart knows its own bitterness     chapter xxv  a change of tactics   the fires of sunset were fading low down on the verge of the prairie when i spoke for the last time with beatrice haldane as it happened beside the splendid wheat it was changing from green to ochre and there was a play of varied light athwart the rigid blades which in its own way emphasized the symmetry of the tall figure in paletinted draperies miss haldane was stately of presence but it was symbolic of the difference between us that while we of the prairie ever turned our eyes instinctively towards the west she stood looking back towards civilization and the darkening east with a cold green brilliancy burning behind her head it matched the face projected against it which was that of a statue perfect in modeling as i still think if almost as colorless and serene beatrice haldane was very beautiful and every curve and fold of the simple dress was immaculate and harmonious because it seemed a part of her  my threadbare jean clung shapelessly about me there was thick dust on my old leggings and a rent in my broad hat which trifles were by comparison not without significance beatrice haldane was clearly born to take a leading place with the eyes of many upon her where life pulsed fastest in the older world i was a plain rancher conscious in spite of theories concerning its dignity of the brand of rude labor and the stain of the soil but at least my eyes were opened so that i had seen the utter impossibility of a once cherished dream  the prairie is very beautiful tonight and surely this grain promises a splendid yield she said i am glad that it is so for it will leave a pleasant memory i shall probably never stand beside the wheat again  this i knew was true beatrice haldane would leave for montreal and paris in a day or two and paying bonaventure a farewell visit she had ridden over with her father who had business with me strange to say i could now contemplate her approaching marriage with equanimity  there are many drawbacks but it is a good country i answered thoughtfully  beatrice haldane looked at me and again i felt that she could still draw my soul to the surface for inspection if she desired to i also fancied she knew her power and wished to exercise it but not from pride in its possession  and yet you can now hardly hope for more than a laborious life and moderate prosperity the prairie is often dreary and the toil almost brutalizing are you still content  the sympathy in the voice robbed the words of any sting and i answered cheerfully it is all that you say but there are compensations and i think no effort is thrown away i can only repeat the old argument one can feel that he is playing a useful part in a comprehensive scheme even in the muddiest tramp down a halfthawn furrow and that every ear of wheat called up or added head of cattle is needed by the world perhaps the chief care of threefourths of humanity concerns their daily bread of course our principal motive is the desire to attain our own and you may not understand that there is a satisfaction in the mere discovering of how much one can do without and possibly as a result of this that ones physical nature rises equal to the strain  and what do you gainthe right to work still harder she asked i can grasp the halfformed ideal in your mind and it is old for thousands of years before thoreau men enlarged on it still it has always seemed to me that the realization is only possible to the very few and to the rest the result mostly destructive to the intellect  i laughed a little and i am very much of the rank and file but at least i have no hope of emulating either the medieval devotees or the modern hindoo visionaries we practice selfdenial from the prosaic lack of money or to save a little to sink in a longer furrow and endure fatigue more often to pay our debts than to acquire a bank balance yet the result is not affected the world is better fed  yes she said thoughtfully it seems that whatever your motives may be these things possess virtue in themselvesbut the virtues do not necessarily react upon those who practice them  that is true i answered perhaps it is the motives that count  beatrice haldane looked away towards the dying fires there was a time when you would not have been content  the wondrous green transparency had almost gone the dew touched the wheat and we stood alone in the emptiness under the hush that crept up with the dimness from the east and through which one could almost hear the thirsty grasses drink i knew now that i had never loved beatrice haldane as a man usually loves a woman but had offered an empty homage to an unreality still the semblance had once been real enough to me and i could not wholly hold my peace and let her go furthermore both she and her sister possessed the gift of forcing ones inmost thoughts and there was a power in the quiet voice stronger than my will  no i once had my ambitions and an ideal i said at first their realization seemed possible but i had my lesson even when i knew the ideal was unattainable the knowledge did not decrease its influence and now while smiling at past presumption i can at least cherish the memory i think you must have known part of this  beatrice haldane had by knowledge attained to a perfection of simplicity and while my own was either the result of ignorance or born in me we met upon it as man and womanthe latter too queenly to stoop to any small assumption of diffidence  i guessed it long ago and there was a time when i was pleased she said however it was doubtless well for you that when contact with the world taught me what we both were i knew it was impossible when we met again on the prairie you could not see that i was not the girl you knew in england she had in the meantime bought enlightenment dearly though whether it or her earlier fancies were nearer the hidden truth she does not know  in one respect you can never change to me i said the sunnyfaced girl in england will always live in my memory  beatrice haldane smiled though the fast fading light showed the weariness in her eyes until you find the substance better than the shadow and she must always have been unreal still we are not proof against such assurances and i am even now partly pleased to hear you say so do you know that you have shamed me harry ormesby  that would be impossible i said and my companion smiled  hold fast by your blunt directness if you are wise she said i was blinded by the critical faculty and you rebuked me by clinging to your visionary ideal while imisjudged you i do not mind admitting now that it hurt me the more so when i found that lucille beingand there is truth in the phraseunspotted by the world believed in you implicitly it was because of this i allowed you to speak as you have done i felt that i must ask your forgiveness because we shall probably never meet again  whether beatrice haldane was correct in her own estimate i do not know but she was the most queenly woman i had ever met and i lifted the rent hat as i said circumstances betrayed me and you could do no wrong even if that had been possible how far would one suspicion count against all that the girl in england has done for me now it only remains for us to part good friendsand with full sincerity i wish you every happiness  thank you said beatrice quietly and without another word we walked back towards the house together through the velvet dusk i noticed that lucille glanced at us sharply as we entered  you will not forget our appointment in winnipeg said haldane as they drove away and i stood still long after the vehicle had melted into the prairie what i thought i do not remember but it was with a dreamy calmness that now the worst had passed i returned to crane valley  reluctance mingled with my anticipation when i proceeded to winnipeg at the appointed time the harvest was almost ready and a brief holiday possibly justifiable in anticipation of that time of effort but the journey was long and expensive while after our severe economies i had fallen into the habit of slow consideration each time i spent a dollar steel laughed when i said so and pointed to the grain its easier to get used to prosperity than the other thing he said there is plenty money yonder to start you again if necessary you can remember you have earned a good time  the sight of the long waves of deepening ochre that rolled before the warm breeze was very reassuring though belief came slowly and for days i had feared some fresh disaster their rhythmical rustle swelled by the murmur of the wheat heads and the patter of the oats made sweet music for their undertone was hope while the flash and flicker of the bending blades presaged the glitter of hardwon goldgold that would set me a free man again then i was ashamed and my voice a trifle husky as i said i am certainly going to winnipeg steel if it had not been for the others the harvest would have left me in the grip of lane and now that the time has come i mean to stand by them  i boarded the cars the more contentedly that there was a note in my pocket from lucille haldane father tells me the time is ripe for you and your friends to strike at last it ran i want to ask you to assist him in every way you can and i wait anxiously to hear of your success  i did not understand the whole plan of campaign but gathered that haldane with the support of our prairie committee would make a bear attack on the companywhich while lane held stock in it had largely financed himand i looked forward with keen interest to the struggle we others had done our best with plow and bridle not to mention birch staff and fork but we had hitherto acted chiefly on the defensive and now an attack was to be pushed home with the aid of money and a superior intellect  haldane was in excellent spirits when accompanied by boone he greeted me in winnipeg station i feel less rusty already and you look several years younger than you did a few months ago he said but we have breakfast ready and can talk comfortably over it  the meal was a luxurious one and haldanes explanations interesting mr boone has taken a great deal of trouble to inquire into lanes affairs with the assistance of a man dixon recommended considering the difficulties i hardly think i should have succeeded better myself he said  boone said this was an unmerited compliment and haldane laughed well the result as anticipated is this lane has most of his money locked up in mortgages which he does not wish to foreclose on immediately while we conclude that the rest is represented by shares in the territories investment company which concern proposes to increase its capital and as somebody has been trying to sell that stock quietly in small lots one may decide that he is short of money we purpose to scare off buyers and depreciate his shares by selling them in handfuls as publicly as possible or in other words to hammer the company  there are two points i am not clear about i said we have not the stock to sell and wouldnt it be a trifle hard on innocent shareholders  we are finding out your capacities by degrees said haldane with a quizzical glance at me in the first place we take the risk of being able to procure the stock when frightened holders rush on the market if they dontwell there will be a difficulty in the second place there are no innocent holders or only a very few the corporation is a semiprivate concerncombination of secondrate sharpers of your friends own kidney and the few outsiders are professional speculators who take such risks as they comethey are only now thinking of an appeal to the general public here is the latest balance sheet and i presume you are not anxious to see a continuance of that dividend wrung out of your friends on the prairie  my anger flamed up once more as i glanced at the figures i had seen how that profit was earnednot by the companys agents but by careworn men and suffering women who toiled under a steadily increasing burden which was crushing the life out of them i had also received a laconic message from a combination of such as these have paid in  dollars to the b o m well sell our boots to back you if haldanes standing in do the best you can  then i brought my fist down on the table as i said id walk out a beggar tomorrow before that should happen if this concern lives only by such plunder for heavens sake let us demolish it i cant eat another morsel isnt it time to begin  haldane smiled and touched a bell my principal broker should be waiting  a little spectacled man with a shrill voice and insignificant appearance was ushered in and as i inspected him haldanes choice reminded me of the hebrew shepherds sling he appeared a very feeble weapon to use against the giant who had oppressed us so grievously territories have been offering at several dollars reduction he said dont know why unless its the railroad uncertainty you couldnt get hold of one under full premium until lately  the speaker in spite of his declared ignorance answered haldanes smile and the latter said you can begin at a further five dollars down come round in the afternoon and tell us how you are progressing isnt there a race meeting somewhere about this place today  the broker said there was and i was astonished when haldane suggested that we might as well attend it for this part of the conflict was evidently to be fought on wholly novel lines we drove to the meeting and after the monotony of crane valley the sight of the lighthearted crowd the hum of voices and laughter the gay dresses and above all the horses was exhilarating nevertheless it was some time before the scene compelled my whole attention for the issues of the business which had brought me to winnipeg appeared far too serious to justify such trifling by degrees however i yielded to the influence of the stirring spectacle and was at length amazed to find myself shouting wildly with the rest when a handsome chestnut broke out from the ruck of galloping horses a furlong from the post then indeed for a few seconds i was oblivious of everything but the silkclad figure and the beautiful animal rushing past the dim sea of faces in the blaze of sunshine behind while the roar of hoofs and the human clamor set me quivering it was all so different from anything i had heard or seen on the silent prairie boone returned presently and i stared at the silver coins he placed in my palm  you dont look satisfied ormesby with the result of your few dollars are you sorry i did not lay a decent stake or have you been infected by lane he said and i answered him dryly im sorry that without telling me you staked anything at all it is so long since i had any money to risk on such amusementsand it does not seem fair to the anxious men waiting on the prairie  haldane laughed it is generally wise to make the most of a pleasant interlude because the average man does not get too many of them if this strikes you as trifling ormesby you will find grim enough amusement before we are through  it was afternoon when we returned to the city and we recommenced the campaign by a sumptuous lunch during which the broker came in ive been offering territories until im hoarse he said there was some surprise and talking but nobody wanted to buy and while its an honor to serve you i dont see much of a commission in this  you will if i know my opponents said haldane significantly take off two more dollars and if there are any buyers dont let them think youre not in earnest you can put another of your friends on  the broker departed and left me wondering it struck me that to reduce the value by open quotations should have been enough without saddling ourselves with contracts when we did not hold the stock but it seemed that cautious slowness was not haldanes way he next insisted on playing billiards with me and he played as well as i did badly for my fingers had grown stiff from the grip of the plowstilts and bridle and we had small opportunity for such amusements on the prairie nothing of importance happened during the remainder of the day but i have a clear recollection of how the throb of life from the busy city reacted on me as we sat together on a balcony outside the smokingroom after dinner it was a hot night and the streets were filled with citizens seeking coolness in the open air the place seemed alive with moving figures that came and went endlessly under the glare of the great arc lights while the stir and brilliancy appeared unreal to me the air throbbed with voices the clank of great freight trains in the station and the hum of trolley cars while only one narrow strip of sky appeared between the rows of stores and that strip was barred by a maze of interlacing wires i felt as though i had awakened from a centurys sleep on the prairie  somewhat different from crane valley said haldane pointing with his cigar towards the crowded wires i wonder how many of those are charged with our businessit is tolerably certain that some of them are we have cheerfully thrown down the glove and now the forces of fire and air and water are all pressed into the service of spreading our challenge across the continent theres a mammoth printing machine in yonder building reeling it off by the thousands of copies every hour in its commercial reports and those papers will be rushed east and west to warn holders in quebec or vancouver tonight also by this time lane wherever he is will be spending money like water to keep the wires humming feel uneasy about the explosion now that you have helped to fire the train  i feel curious both as to why you should take so much trouble to help us sir and as to the enemys first move i said  to keep myself from rusting for one thing and because lane is one man too many down our way was the careless answer if that does not appear a sufficient motive i may perhaps mention another when we have won as to the other affair lane will so long as his means hold out buyor urge his friends towhile we sell just how far can you and the men behind you go  i named a sum which haldane noted with what boone and i have decided to put up it will be enough if all goes well if notbut we will not trouble about that this contract strikes me as a trifle too big for lane he said  i retired early but scarcely slept all night i felt that the struggle would commence in earnest on the morrow and haldanes words had warned me that our nerve and treasury might be taxed to the utmost before we made good the challenge we had so lightly it seemed to me sent broadcast across the dominion     chapter xxvi  the turning of the tide   i rose early next morning and a stroll through the awakening city which was cool and fresh as yet braced me for the stress of the day haldane looked thoughtful at breakfast boone was silent and suspiciously stolid for he betrayed himself by the very slowness with which he folded back the newspaper brought him to expose the commercial reports he handed it to haldane who nodded saying nothing it was a relief to me at least when the meal was over but afterwards the morning passed very heavily for i spent most of it haunting a dark telephone box where haldane received and dispatched cabalistic messages i did not approve of conflict of this description in which the uninitiated could neither follow the points lost or won nor see the enemy and i should have preferred the hayfork and a background of sunlit prairie  noon seemed a very long time coming and the report of the broker who arrived with it far from reassuring we have sold a fair block of stock and i brought you the contracts to sign he said settlement and all conditions as usual each time that we offered a round lot grahams salesman and another man took them up  lane is taking hold he has stirred up his allies said haldane ill put my name to these papers and you can call down another few dollars when you start again i suppose there is no other person selling  no said the broker there were a good many other men curious about our game and i fancy one or two of them had instructions but they did nothing well work up a sensation during the afternoon  it would have greatly pleased me to hear of other persons parting with their shares but haldane still looked confident and boone appeared to place implicit faith in his generalship i however grew more and more anxious as the afternoon dragged by for my sense of responsibility to the men behind me increased when each tinkle of the telephone bell was followed by a message reporting further sales somebody was steadily taking up the stock we offered and when for the fourth time haldane had answered my question any sign of weakness yet in the negative i could stay indoors no longer and found it a relief to stride briskly through the busy streets towards a grain buyers offices  my own personal risk was heavy enough but i knew also what it had cost my prairie neighbors to raise the sum they had credited me with and i felt that if beaten i dare not return and face them with the news that losing all in an unsuccessful gamble we had left them doubly helpless at the mercy of a triumphant enemy the interview with the grain merchant was however in a measure comforting he admitted that prices were improving stated approximate figures which almost surprised me and volunteered the information that when my crop should be gathered he would be glad to make me an offer although prospects were good in western canada cereals were scarce everywhere else and i returned so involved in mental calculations that i walked into several citizens one of whom swore fluently he wore toothpickpointed shoes and in my abstraction i had it seemed trodden cruelly on his toes  boone came up while i attempted to apologize and tapped me on the shoulder what do you think of this amusement ormesby it seems to have had the effect of dazing you he said you were walking right past the hotel as though your eyes were shut  to be candid i think very little of it i said still i was puzzling over a slightly complicated sum to ascertain how muchcounting every remaining beast salable implement and load of grainwould when i have paid off lane remain my own  planning your campaign for next year asked boone with a trace of dryness  no i answered it will not be a great deal but im open to stake the last cent on beating lane  good man said boone we are going to beat him and to show that i am prepared to back my convictions i may say that i have already hypothecated every pennyworth of my english property  haldane was waiting for us when we came in our men have had a busy afternoon all the shares they offered were bought up and there is no sign of any weakness yet he said  we formed a somewhat silent company during the earlier portion of the evening haldane sat busy pencil in hand and finally passed a page of his notebook across to us i dont quite know who is backing lane but his purse is a tolerably long one he said you see we must produce shares or the difference between their value at that time and the price we sold at to this extent on settling day ormesby  of which nobody would apparently sell us one i answered ruefully  haldane nodded you mean of course today a good many people may be willing to do so before this hour tomorrowif not it will be time then to consider seriously meanwhile the best we can do is to seek innocent relaxation and i see that miss redmond is singing at the opera house  i was hardly in the mood to enjoy a concert though i was curious to hear redmonds daughter but inaction had grown almost insufferable and when we took our places in the crowded building i felt glad that i had come the sight of the closepacked multitude and the hum of many voices helped to hold in check my nervous restlessness nevertheless though a lover of music i scarcely heard a word of the first three songs and only became intent when a clapping of hands rolled round the building as a darkhaired girl stood forward in the glare of the footlights it was evidently she who had drawn the perspiring crowd together and that alone was an eloquent testimonial considering the temperature  ailin redmond was very plainly dressed and she smiled her acknowledgments with a simplicity that evidently pleased the audience while perhaps in compliment to them she wore as sole adornment a few green maple leaves then i settled myself to listen and continued almost spellbound to the end of the song wondering where the girl i had seen herding cattle barefooted not very long ago had acquired such power she was not from a technical view perhaps a finished singer but western audiences can feel if for the most part they cannot criticise and i think she drove the full meaning of the old irish ballad home to the hearts of all of them a wailing undertone rang through it and the effect of the whole was best expressed as uncanny it was no doubt the strangeness of her themes and the contrast she presented to her stereotyped rivals which had led to the girls success  in any case the applause was vociferous and continued until the singer returned and stood still with hands lightly clasped looking not at the expectant audience but directly at us there was a curious expression in her eyes which were fixed steadily on myself and haldane beside me then i gained understanding as she commenced to sing for there was no mistaking the fact that she meant the song for us it was a clever resetting of such an oldworld ballad as i think no anglosaxon could have written its burden was a mourning over ancient wrongs and hunger for revenge but the slender darkhaired girl held the power to infuse her spirit into me my lips and hands closed tight as i saw what i think she wished me to helen boone dying in a sod hovel and the wagon that bore the dead man rolling through murky blackness across the prairie  then i shook all misgivings from me feeling that though every acre and bushel of grain must go and we failed they would be well spent in an attempt to pull down the man who had brought about such things that others might suffer with him counted little then they had clutched at their dividendsdividends wrung by him out of the agony of poor men and their ignorance which was scarcely possible did not free them from responsibility  there was dead stillness for several seconds between the accompanists final chord and the tumultuous applause which the slightly puzzled audience accorded while when it died away i saw that boones forehead was beaded and his lips slightly quivering even haldane appeared less than usually at ease  miss redmond is a young lady of uncommon and even uncomfortable gifts he said women as you will discover some day ormesby are responsible for most of the mischief that goes on as well as a large amount of good for instance it was the encouragement of one of them which helped to start me on this campaign and now when slightly doubtful respecting the wisdom of the step another must sing eerie songs to me with a purpose i think we will walk round and call on her  we did so and redmonds daughter did not keep us waiting long she sailed down a broad stairway and stood smiling under the glaring lamps very slight and slim and graceful so that it seemed fitting haldane should bend over the hand she gave him  there is no need for my poor compliments after the verdict of the multitude but did you sing that song to us he said  yes said the girl quietly while the smile sank out of her eyes we have a good many friends and hear much gossip so i knew at once who was directing the attack on lanes company as to the songi had some slight education down east you knowits choice was not without a meaning you will remember how on the eve of battle shakespeares ghosts prophesied to one man ruin and to another victory  yes said haldane looking puzzled i think i do  thenand ailin redmond seemed to shiver a littledo you think there are no ghosts on the prairie  i have not met any of them said haldane and the girl answered with infectious gravity that does not prove there are none and even if you call it a childish fancy i felt as i sang that they will bring you victory tomorrow  you are far too clever and pretty to fill your head with such fancies my dear said haldane and when we went out into the open he repeated with a shrug of his shoulders in spite of her talents that is a most uncomfortable young woman but heaven send her prophecy comes true  again i passed a restless night but our agent procured us admission into the inner precincts of the exchange on the morrow and as i listened to the eager shouting and watched the excited groups surge about the salesmen i began to comprehend the fascination that speculation wields over its votaries our little spectacled broker however held my eye as he flitted to and fro and now and then with a strident cry gathered a mob of gesticulating men about him somebody accepted his offers on each occasion and he approached us with an almost dismayed expression when the market closed at noon  you are an old hand at this business sir but i feel its my duty to warn you that things dont look well he said your friends of the opposition are evidently able to stand considerable hammering the sum you mentioned would be no use now to pull us straight and unless theres a break pretty soon theyll squeeze you like a screw vice on settling day it would be hard to figure the price theyll make you pay  you dont suppose i havent foreseen such a contingency said haldane the break will probably come this afternoonif not tomorrow tell your allies to sell further small lots down at a moderate reduction  our lunch was as the others had been luxurious but my throat was dry and i could not eat boones appetite had also failed and i may have guessed aright at part of his story when i saw him after thrice emptying his glass glance still thirstily at the wine and then thrust the decanter away  it is time to consider said haldane unless somebody is soon scared into selling lanes company will be able to fleece us horribly on settling day but experience of such affairs teaches me that sooner or later the smaller holders must break under a persistent hammering now i dont mind admitting that i did not anticipate such an obstinate defense and the cause of my interference is mainly this i had promised to take my younger daughter on a trip to europe but am not overfond of traveling and lucille is tolerably contented with her own country so when she first suggested and then insisted that i should make a campaign fund of what it would cost i was not wholly sorry to agree and figured that with careful handling the money might be sufficient to scare lane into making some rash move at present it seems that i was mistaken and that before we break him i must throw bonaventure into the scale you may save your protests gentlemen im a born speculator and my daughter has set her heart on this thing if she hadnt id have a very great reluctance to being beaten by a singlehorsepower company  every acre of crane valley i can find a buyer for goes in too i said and boone added quietly you have my last dollar sir already  nothing of moment happened until next day but it appeared to me that there was an almost insupportable tension in the very atmosphere our chief broker was clearly excited and his tone significant when he called to inform us that while no other sellers had followed his challenge only very small parcels of the stock he offered were being taken up and so the matter stood until the afternoon  i was now anxious as well as determined it did not require much knowledge of such affairs for me to realize that unless other persons flung their shares on the market we should be left absolutely at the mercy of the men who had the stock to sell and while i had nerved myself to part with everything it would be inexpressibly galling to strip myself to enable lane to reap a handsome profit neither do i think it was mere lust of revenge that impelled me the man was a menace to the prosperity of every struggling rancher and had shown no mercy whilesetting aside the fact that he himself deserved noneit seemed that my neighbors right to existence depended on our efforts to overthrow him haldane appeared unusually serious when i glanced at him  if nothing happens in an hour we shall have to hold a council as to how we may cut our losses he said  half an hour passed very slowly and then warned by a message we strolled into the market to find there was comparative silence in the long echoing room as those who congregated there grew languid and drowsy under the heat of the afternoon its atmosphere seemed suffocating and before i had been present long the suspense reacted upon me physically for my throat resembled a limekiln and the superficial arteries of my forehead throbbed painfully boone at intervals moistened his dry lips with his tongue and haldane alone leaned calmly against a pillar jotting down figures in the notebook he held  then a few listless men gathered round a broker and suddenly became intent while a murmur of interest rose through the drowsy heat the voices grew louder the group swelled and i started at the call any more of you with territories to sell  it must be lanes last throw said haldane quietly ah the tide is turning there is somebody who doesnt belong to us making a deal with him  the bystanders surged to and fro about the speakers in a manner that reminded me of corraled cattle others hurried towards them and our brokers voice rang out ill trade with you at two dollars better  then there was a confused shouting ill beat him by another two more dollars down and every unoccupied man in the room joined the crowd out of which rose indistinguishable offers comments questions and counteroffers these swelled into a deafening clamor but through them all i could hear or feel the hurried beating of my heart and my voice sounded hollow as i touched haldanes arm tell me the meaning of it i said  we have beaten them said haldane quietly there are other men hurrying to sell the weak holders have broken at last and because a panic is infectious most of the others will follow them ah it is beginning there go the telegrams and i hear both telephone bells the fun will commence in earnest when the answers come in and meanwhile a breath of fresher air would brace one you may have noticed that its a trifle choky inside here  i had but my feet seemed glued to the floor and my eyes on the swaying crowd so that it cost me an effort to tear them free and follow boone and haldane into the open air he presently led us into the grateful coolness of a big basement saloon and scarcely drawing breath i emptied the contents of a tumbler filled with iced liquid and then i looked at boone who had pushed aside the glass set before him and reached for the ice bowl  i have bought my experience ormesby he said with a smile which once more flashed a sidelight on his history in times like these it is better to confine ones self to natures distillery a cigar no thank you sir do you feel like smoking ormesby  i did not for in spite of the cool beverage the bite of tobacco would have been insufferable then but haldane lay back in a big lounge chewing a cigar he said nothing whatever and though he appeared satisfied the lines on his forehead had deepened and his face appeared older in spite of my impatience we must have remained nearly an hour before our leader rose a little stiffly and proceeded with unusual slowness towards the scene of the conflict it was raging fiercely some of the speculators howled like wild beasts others wrestled with their fellows to reach the clear space in the center of the ring and standing on the plinth of a column i could see gesticulating men hard at work with their notebooks how they were able to record any bargain or to comprehend any offer amid that pandemonium was more than i could discover for everybody interested appeared to be shouting at once and the rest of the assembly cheering them on one irate individual indeed dragged a neighbor backwards by the collar and then plunged blindly into the midst of the circle when the other retaliating drove his hat down over his eyes  haldane listened keenly for several minutes and then turned to me its going our way ormesby holders are getting out as fast as they can and various speculative gentlemen who have been waiting for the first sign of weakness are hammering them we have done our part and can safely leave the rest to them see if you can give our broker this note for me and then if you have had sufficient excitement we will take a drive somewhere until dinners ready  i had certainly had sufficient excitement in that form to last the rest of my life and i managed to reach the broker without personal injury after which we solaced ourselves with a drive through the city and across some very uninteresting prairie i saw little of either and was conscious of scarcely anything beyond the allimportant fact that lanes power was broken and henceforward my neighbors would enjoy the fruits of their own labor instead of swelling heavy dividends with threefourths of them  when we returned to the hotel our agent who appeared in an exultant mood was waiting us and he positively beamed upon haldane as he said its an honor to work for a man with your nerve and judgment sir and we have whipped the last grit out of them i let up altogether when i saw every outside bear come ramping in and if youre inclined that way we might cover a little quietly without stiffening prices  i do not know what haldanes instructions were indeed the reaction of relief prevented my remembering anything at all very clearly except that as we sat at dinner haldane said i shouldnt wonder if those physicians were right and i think i have made my last stake this afternoon i dare say you understand ormesby that as we could now purchase the stock below the price at which we sold there will be a profit in the transaction individually i did not undertake this matter as a speculation  haldane made light of our anxiety lest he should have suffered i have long known i should have to sink into idleness and it was a good piece of work to retire on he said but what about the profit  i had no hesitation about the answer it was no desire of profit that brought me here and as one experience of the kind is sufficient i intend henceforward to stick to my horses and cattle i will not touch a dollar of the money beyond actual expenses and would propose that setting aside any portion necessary to secure us against reprisals and to complete our work the rest should be handed to miss haldane to distribute as she thinks best in charity  boone expressed his full compliance and haldane smiled at me do you think you can run up a contra account in that way ormesby  i believe we are justified but justified or not i will not touch a dollar of the gains i said i am going back to the prairie tomorrow to express our deepest gratitude to miss haldane as to yourself sir a good many hardpressed men will never forget you  then boone rose up gravely with a wineglass in his hand the task is too big for ormesby or any other man he said may every good thing follow the mistress of bonaventure     chapter xxvii  illumination   the binders were clanking through the wheat when i next met haldane at crane valley having embarked upon his new career with characteristic energy he rode over from bonaventure with his daughter to watch our harvesting and incidentally came near bewildering me with his questions some of them were hard to answer and i felt a trace of irritation as well as surprise that a few hours observation should enable him to hit upon the best means of overcoming difficulties which had cost me months of experimenting to discover  thorn i remember stared at him in wonder and afterwards observed you and i have just got to keep on trying until we find out the best way of fixing things and if our ways certain its often expensive that man just chews on his cigar and it comes to him when i take up my located land and get worried about the money im going to try cigarsmoking  you will have considerably less of it if you experiment with the brand that haldane keeps i answered jerking the lines and my binder rolled on again behind the weary team when each minute was worth a silver coin we dare not spare the beasts and i had worn out four of them in as many days and then sat almost nodding in the driving seat with a deep sense of satisfaction in my heart which i was too tired to express  oat sheaves ridging the bleached prairie blazed in yellow ranks before my heavy eyes and each heave of the binders arms flung out behind me a truss of golden wheat the glare was blinding for we worked under the full heat of a scorching afternoon as we had done and would do by the pale light of the moon thick dust rolled about us clogging my lashes and fouling the coats of the beasts while the crackle of the flinty stems the rasp of shearing knives the rhythm of trampling hoofs and the clink of metal throbbing harmoniously through the drowsy heat were flung back by other machines at work across the grain there is however a limit to human powers and i must have been driving mechanically and nearly asleep when a clicking warned me that it was time to fit another spool of twine i remember that during the operation i envied the endurance of the soulless but otherwise almost human machine  steel came up with his binder before it was completed a creak and thud and tinkle swelling in musical crescendo as the jaded team loomed nearer through the dust there was a flash of varnished wood that rose and fell and twinkling metal and i saw the driver sitting stiffly with hands that were almost blackened clenched on the lines peering straight before him out of halfclosed eyes while the moisture that ran from his forehead washed coppertinted channels through the grime it was by an effort he held himself to his task but that was nothing unusual for the prairie does not yield up her riches lightly and by the golden wake he left behind him the effort was justified the earth had been fruitful that season and harvest had not failed while having sown in deep dejection uncertain who would reap it was a small thing to strain ones strength to the utmost to gather the bounteous yield we were already free and every revolution of the binders arms set us so much farther on the road to prosperity  twice i jerked the lines but the team stood still and i was preparing to encourage them more vigorously when haldane and his daughter approached both had insisted on my leaving them to their own devices and now lucille appeared to regard the beasts and myself compassionately  they look very tired and they have done so much she said glancing down the long rows of piledup grain is not that sufficient to justify your resting a little  i am afraid not i answered with a somewhat rueful smile you see prosperity has made us greedy while all the grain cut up to the present belongs to lane  the girl looked indignanthaldane thoughtful i have been wondering whether you would feel inclined to contest his claim for the balance of the debt he said considering that he has taken from you twice the value of his loan and the story in miss redmonds book you might be ethically and legally justified  no i said i made the bargain and i intend to keep my part of it that accomplished i shall have the fewer scruples about using every effort to utterly crush the man all we cut henceforward is my own and i can only repeat that i should be glad to devote every bushel to help forward his defeat  i think you are right said lucille haldane with a trace of pride in her approval though her eyes were mischievous as she continued it is however unfortunate you are so very busy because as father is riding and as the team are a little wild we hoped you would drive them home for me  i climbed down from the iron saddle shouting to steel and lucille smiled demurely we could not tear you away from that machine when you would grudge every minute she said remember that bonaventure is a long way off and even if we allowed it you could hardly return before tomorrow  i nevertheless fancied she was pleased at my eagerness and for haldane had passed on i felt suddenly oppressed by the recognition of what i owed her yet had it been possible i should not have lightened the debt i looked down at her gravely noticing how young and fresh and slender she seemedbright as the blaze of sunshine in which she stoodand then i pointed towards the long ranks of sheaves and the sea of stately ears  i am not in the least inconsistent and should not be if every moment were thrice as precious i said i remember most plainly that you gave me all this strange as it may seem it is nevertheless perfectly true  the girl blushed prettily and then glanced from me towards the tired horses and the standing machine after which her eyes rested with approval on the stalwart form of thorn who came up urging on his plodding team  it would be something to be proud of if one could believe you rancher but i am not wholly pleased with the last part of the speech she said with a faint halfmocking inclination of the head i can guess what you are thinking and you are a trifle slow to learn women are very well in their own place are they not however you find it perplexing when they will not stay there but because some of them grow tired of breathing incense they descend and interfere in masculine affairs it is truly strange that there should be more forces in the world than those centered in big dusty men and splendid horses  you must be a witch but i am learning by degrees i said and the girl laughed merrily  you have not progressed very far to judge by the comparison witches were usually pictured as malevolent old and ugly  i meant a beneficent fairy but the surprise was not quite unnatural i said who could suspect in such a slender and fragile person the power she possesses to banish gloom and poverty legions of men and horses could not accomplish so much  now you go too far in the opposite direction and my companion shook her head it is the sense of balance you need  the sunblaze turned the clustered hair under her wide hat into the likeness of burnished goldthe gold of our own northwest with a coppery warmth in itbut the light in her hazel eyes eclipsed its brilliancy the lithe figure fitted its gorgeous background of yellow radiancy and again i felt all my pulses quicken as i paid haldanes daughter silent homage magnificent as the wheat alike to eye and understanding when one remembered its mission her presence seemed the crown and complement of all that splendid field it was hard to refrain from telling her so and possibly my voice was not pitched quite in its normal key when i said it is short of the truth but there is just one thing i should like to know and that is whether any other motive than pure benevolence prompted you  why  then i answered boldly because it would be worth the rest to fancy that in some small measure it was due to individual goodwill towards rancher ormesby  the girl looked away from me across the grain and as she turned her head it was with a thrill of pleasure which may not have been wholly artistic that i noticed the polished whiteness of her neck and a dainty pinktinted little ear that peeped out from the clusters of her hair then she laughed perhaps at thorn who argued quaintly if forcibly with his reluctant beasts and turned to me  if you desire another motive you may conclude as you heard before that it was love of justice which really ought to satisfy you  it is a creditable one i answered but i fear that it does not  we left crane valley shortly haldane on horseback his daughterbecause something had gone wrong with the bonaventure vehiclebeside me in our light wagon which if it in no way resembled the cumbrous contrivance bearing that name in england was i was uneasily conscious by no means overclean on the way we met the threshers and stronger teams hauling the machines towards crane valley for our threshing is done mostly in the field we stopped to bid them hurry and haldane learning they had met gordon whom he desired to see bade us proceed while he looked for the rancher i was not sorry to do so and accordingly it was without him that we approached the dip to the sweetwater hollow  the afternoon was waning and the air very still the tiny birch leaves had ceased their whispering but the sound of running water came musically out of their cool shadow all the winding valley was rolled in green an oasis of verdure in the sweep of whitebleached prairie and pulling the team up between the first of the slender trunks i pointed down towards the halfseen lane of sliding water  i might never have known you if it had not been for a trifling accident by yonder willow clump i said i remember your sister suggested that very night that our meeting might be the first scene of a drama and considering all that has happened since then her prediction has proved strangely accurate  lucille haldane nodded it is a coincidence that i was thinking of the same thing and wondering now that the play must be drawing towards its close what the end will be the meeting must however have been unlucky for you because all your troubles date from that beginning  and my privileges i answered smiling the present is at least a happy augury when i met boone beside the river there was not a leaf on the birches and their branches were moaning under a blast which makes one shiver from mere recollection remember the harvest at crane valley and look down on yonder shining water and cool greenery it was you who brought us the sunshine and even the memory of the dark days is now melting like that nights snow  that is exaggerated sentiment and i have heard invertebrate youths in the cities say such things more neatly commented the girl with an air of mock severity and then glanced dreamily into the hollow while as silence succeeded fate sent a little stingfly to take a partas to confound mans contriving trifles often doin ending the play the team were illbroken broncos which had already given me trouble and when the fly bored with envenomed proboscis through the hide of one the beast flung up his head and kicked savagely  the reins which i held loosely were whisked away and before it was possible to recover them both horses had bolted the light wagon lurched giddily and the next moment it swept like a toboggan down the declivity  hold fast i shouted leaning recklessly down and the first shock of enervating consternation vanished when i gripped the reins still there was cold fear at my heart when bracing both feet against the wagonfront i strove uselessly to master the team the brutes mouths seemed made of iron impervious to the bit the slope was long and steep birches and willows straggled athwart it everywhere and the soil was treacherous i could not break them from the gallop and not daring to risk the sharp bends of the zigzag trail i let them go straight for the slide of water in the bottom of the hollow  it was not the first time i had been run away with a fall from a stumbling horse or a wagon upset is a very common and considering the halftamed beasts we use by no means surprising accident in our country but at first it was only by a fierce effort i shook off an almost overmastering terror as i contemplated the danger to my companion i hazarded one glance at her and saw that her face was white and set then dare look at nothing but the reeling trees ahead i strained every sinew to swing the team clear of them sometimes the beasts responded sometimes they did not and it was by a miracle the trunks went by the wagon bounced more wildly the slope grew steeper and even if i could have checked the team this would only have precipitated a catastrophe so helpless i clung to the reins until the end came suddenly  several birches barred our way the brutes would swerve neither to right nor to left and with a hoarse shout of warning i strove desperately to hold them straight for the one passage wondering whether there was room enough in the narrow gap between the trunks it was immediately evident that there was not simultaneously with a heavy shock the wagon appeared to dissolve beneath me and i was hurled bodily into the air fortunately i alighted upon soft ground headforemost and perhaps for that reason escaped serious injury it is possible that in different circumstances i might have lain still partly stupefied or spent some time in ascertaining whether any bones had broken but as it was i sprang to the overturned wagon breathless with fear  lucille haldane lay mercifully just clear of it a pitiful white figure and my heart stood still as i bent over her she was pale and limp as a crushed lily and as beautiful and it was with awe i dropped on one knee beside her there was no sign of any breathing coldness seemed to emanate from her waxlike skin and though i had seen many accidents i dare scarcely venture to lay a finger on the slackly throbbing artery in her wrist then i groaned aloud borne down with an overwhelming grief for with the suddenness of a lightning flash i knew the words spoken but such a little while ago had been more than true it was she who had brought all the sunshine and sweetness into my life reason and power of action returned with the knowledge and i started for the river at a breathless run smashing savagely through every cluster of dwarf willows which barred my way filled my hat with the cold water and returning dashed it on her face the action appeared brutal but terror was stronger than any sentimental fancies then and i dare neglect no chance with that precious life at stake  the slender form moved a little and it was with relief unspeakable i heard a fluttering sigh then i raised the wet head upon my knee and fell to chafing the cold hands vigorously the time may have been five minutes or less but i had never spent such long days in my life as those seconds while i waited quivering in every limb for some further sign of returning animation it was very still in the hollow and the song of the hurrying water maddened me its monotonous cadence might drown the faint breathing for which i listened with such intensity even in that space of agony two other incidents flashed through my memory and i understood my fear during the dark voyage and on the moonlit night when the cars lurched across the bridge life would be very empty if the breath died out of that tender shaken body  the suspense was mercifully ended lucille haldane half opened her eyes and looked up at me without recognition closed them and caught at her breath audibly while i held her hands fast in a restraining grasp then as she looked up again the blood came back mantling the clear skin and she said brokenly i fell out of the wagon did i not how long have i been hereand my head is wet ii must get up  i still held one hand fast but stooping slipped one arm beneath her shoulder and raised her a little you must wait another few moments first  the girl appeared reluctant but made no resistance and when finally i raised her to her feet i found it was necessary to lean against a birch trunk to hide the fit of trembling that seized me  i am not much hurt she said and my voice broke as i interjected thank god for it  i fancied that lucille haldane shaken as she was flashed a swift sidelong glance at me and that the returning color did not diminish in her cheek then she said hurriedly yes i am not hurt but i see the horses yonder and you had better make sure of them we are still some distance from home  i turned without further speech and found the vicious brutes which had broken the wagonpole held fast by the tangled gear which had fouled a fallen tree it was almost with satisfaction i saw the bolter had lamed himself badly there was a change in lucille haldane when i led them back she had recovered her faculties but not her old frank friendliness and said almost sharply the wagon is useless what do you propose to do  to fold up the rug in the box and make some kind of saddle for you i said and proceeded to do so cutting up the gear which was almost new so recklessly that my companion seemed even then surprised  do you know that you are destroying a good many dollars worth of harness she asked  it would not greatly matter if i spoiled a dozen sets so long as you reached home safely and it is a very small fine for my carelessness i answered i should never have forgiven myself if you had been injured but are youquitesure that you are none the worse  i do not think i am much the better said the girl still i am not badly hurt and it was not your fault  though still languid in her movements she seemed chary of accepting much assistance when i helped her into the improvised saddle and then because the other horse was useless i waded through the ford with my hand on the bridle it was some distance to bonaventure and my companion was not communicative but i did not find the silence irksome conflicting emotions would have made me slow of speech and i was content with the fact that she rode beside me whole in limb and unspoiled in beauty indeed so much had the sight of her lying white and apparently lifeless impressed me that i cast many apprehensive glances in her direction before i could convince myself that all was well  haldane who overtook us desired me to remain at bonaventure but every pair of hands was needed at crane valley and i wished for solitude so stiffly mounting a borrowed horse i set off homeward across the prairie i had risen at three that morning after an insufficient rest and was worn out in body but clear in mind for a time at least while the brilliancy of the starshine and the silence of the waste helped me to think i was by turns thankful ashamed dejected and eager to clutch at an elusive hope illumination had followed disillusion and i knew at last that even while i was uplifted by vain imaginings lucille haldane had little by little and unwittingly extended her dominion over my heart i had it seemed spent the best years of my life striving after an unattainable and shadowy ideal while perhaps the real living substance endowed with the best of all pertaining to flesh and blood lay within my grasp it was true that the mistress of bonaventure was much too good for me but with all her graces she was of like fiber to us and her few weaknesses rendered her more desirable in proof of the fact that beatrice haldane was worthy of all adulation remained equally true but it was hard to comprehend how blinded by folly i had mistaken the respect i paid her for the warm tide of passion which now pulsed through me neither was the latter of sudden origin for looking back i could see how little by little and imperceptibly admiration gratitude and tenderness had merged into it until terror opened my eyes and full understanding came at last  there remained however one burning questiondid lucille haldane in any degree reciprocate what i feltand this lacked an answer knowing her generous nature it was clear that what she had done for me had not been done wittingly for a lover but on the other hand i could recall many trifles which may have had their significance thus alternate hopes and fears surged through my brain until when i had decided that being yet a poor man i must wait the advent of the railroad at least before putting my fate to the test my thoughts commenced to wander and i must have guided the horse mechanically for his sudden stopping roused me with a jerk to recognize the corral at crane valley there is a limit beyond which no emotion may galvanize into continued activity the exhausted body and we not infrequently reach it on the prairie i do not know whether i was asleep or awake when i led the beast into the stable but the sun was high when sally steel roused me from a couch of trampled hay unpleasantly near his feet  you have had a tolerable sleep and dont seem particular where you camp she said come right along and do your best with the second breakfast ive got waiting  i glanced with consternation at my watch why didnt one of the others waken me do you know its ten oclock sally i asked  just because i wouldnt let them youve got to last through harvest anyway and i guess miss haldane wouldnt have much use for a dead man said sally and was retiring with mischievous laughter when i recalled her  you have been too good a friend to me to make such jokes again i said  im not the only one all the folks are talking said the girl  thereupon i answered grimly if i hear any of them amusing themselves in that fashion i shall do my best to choke them     chapter xxviii  the enemy capitulates   some time had elapsed since the overturning of the wagon and i had seen nothing of lucille haldane when one evening i visited bonaventure at her fathers request all had gone well in the interval the last bushel of grain had been threshed and sold and the balance of my debt to lane with every surcharge his ingenuity could invent wiped out haldane who remained some time in winnipeg with boone had also concluded operations successfully for as he had foreseen once the turning point was passed he had no lack of allies eager to assist in plundering the vanquished and before these had satisfied their rapacity he had been able to unobtrusively cover most of our sales without advancing prices boone explained that the new assailants considered the purchases a last effort on the part of the companys supporters alsobecause there is little mercy for the beatenimpoverished storekeeper and plundered farmer commenced to air their grievances and it became evident that the company or those whom it financed had occasionally exceeded the limits of the law  it was accordingly to a meeting of what haldane called the vehmgericht that i was summoned and on arriving at bonaventure i found gordon and several of our neighbors already there the day had been sunny but our autumn nights are sharp with a sting of frost in the air which made the crackling fire in the open hearth acceptable a shaded silver lamp flung a soft light about the room which in no way suggested that it was to be used for a tribunal there were decanters cigar boxes and british columbian fruit on the table while haldane lounged in a velvet chair with feet neatly encased in patent leather stretched out towards the fire all this seemed inappropriate to the occasion even though i had grown used to haldanes way  a glance at the others however showed that they were in deadly earnest the men were lean and hard and grim and their weatherdarkened faces bore the stamp of the conflict some of them had long overworked brain and body halffed that lane and those who backed him might reap an iniquitous profit others had seen wife and daughter toiling in the dust of the harrows or riding weary leagues behind the herds and had not forgotten i noticed they accepted haldanes offers of wine and tobacco dubiously and i surmised it was only personal respect for him that prevented disapproving comments on this manner of procedure  boone doubtless guessed their thoughts for he said whimsically i see no reason why you shouldnt have a good time boys there are easier ways of killing a coyote than beating his head in with the butt of a gun and i can assure you that we mean solid business for one i find these cigars better than the tin flag plug  tin flag and a man with wrinkles round his eyes laughed harshly dried willow bark had to do for us this kind of thing takes time to get used to after living for most two years on damaged flour and molasses maybe youre used to luxuries and dont know what it is to see the wife fall sick when one couldnt raise a decent morsel to feed her  boones face grew as stern as that of the speaker and the shadow i knew crept into his eyes i think i do my wife died for want of comforts that lane might twice collect his debt and i am not likely to forget it tonight he said  a silence followed and through it i heard one or two of the others draw a deep breath while their faces hardened as they too remembered grievous injuries for my own part i was grimly expectant for i had suffered long enough and had sufficient sense to know that it was not often that struggling men had such an opportunity for dictating terms to a powerful adversary we were all i think democratic in the words most liberal sense cherishing no grievance against the rich and quick to recognize advantages offered us by capitalists legitimate enterprise but now that the balance had swung to our side we were equally determined to place further mischief beyond the power of the man who for the sake of a few dollars would have crushed us out of existence it appeared a duty to the community but i had not studied human nature sufficiently to discover exactly how far that motive influenced me  if none of you have any further suggestions to make i want to ask if you are willing to leave this affair to me said haldane presently lane in his own way is a smart man and would be quick to seize an advantage which anybody speaking without consideration might give him i offer my services merely because during an extensive business experience i have had to deal with such men before  there is nobody in the dominion better able to handle this case for us said boone and the others nodded assent  well sit quieter than graven images unless he turns vicious if youll draw his sting said one thats no use anyway a comrade interjected the insect would grow another one what we want is his blame back broken  i will metaphorically speaking try to oblige you both said haldane with a smile he is a little weak in the spine already or he would have declined to meet us at all  nobody made any further comment but the eyes of most of us were turned expectantly upon the clock until at last gordon stood up when a rattle of wheels drew nearer this is going to be a great night boys he said the pernicious insects come  lane entered and nodded to us all comprehensively when he saw that haldane did not hold out his hand the mans assurance was apparently boundless for he was at first sight as débonnaire and almost as genial as everalmost but not quite for when he moved nearer the lamp i noticed a shiftiness in his eyes and an occasional contraction at the corners of his mouth  this is a little business meeting and we appreciate your attendance but the former is no reason why you should not be comfortable said haldane sit down and help yourself to anything you take a fancy to i need not introduce any of these gentlemen  lane was not readily taken aback for while we afterwards had cause to believe he had never discovered the movements of boone he looked at him significantly but without surprise i knowallof them with thanks i will he said as to the visit i am always ready to oblige my clients but as you know time means money it remains to be seen on whose bill i shall charge it  i took the last sentence as a preliminary defiance and fancied haldane did so too but he only laughed as he said i should not wonder if you were not paid that bill  lane nodded as though he understood that the swords were crossed and when he poured out a glass of wine the rest of us prepared to watch the duel with the comforting assurance that our champion was armed with the better weapons as well as with the justice of his quarrel it was characteristic of the enemy that he smiled indulgently when as he raised his glass to his lips steel and another man thrust their own aside the inference could not have been plainer  suppose we come straight to business said haldane presently it may save time if i recapitulate what is known of your position if i am wrong in details you can of course correct me  you can sail ahead and lane stretching out his feet leaned back in his chair in an attitude of contemplative attention  to commence with you hold a number of mortgages on land in this vicinity from which after recouping yourself for the loan you are still drawing what i venture to call extortionate interest these and your shares in the territories investmentwhich cannot be soldi believe represent your assets also after taking firstclass legal opinion we find that owing shall i say to indiscretions on your part it may be possible to prevent your foreclosing on several of those mortgages while one subordinate i believe refuses to be turned out of gaspards trail on the other hand you have certain tolerably extensive liabilities i need not enumerate and you want money badly law suits are expensive and you have a promising crop of them on hand it was with a view of obtaining it you suggested the issue of new territories stock and seeing that hang fire unobtrusively endeavored to sell your shares i dont think the public would look at either just now in short you have taken too big a mouthful you cant hold on without money and you cant obtain that because for some reason respectable banks fight shy of you it will simplify matters if you admit all this  im not going to admit anything lane said sturdily after drinking another glass of wine  haldane smiled as he answered in that case we will take for granted what i have said now we have the money time and determination to fight you over every mortgage and to rake up as a claim for damages every indiscretion  one of the listeners chuckled in a manner expressive of surprise and satisfaction when haldane ceased and through the brief stillness which followed i could feel if i could not see that the others were in a state of strungup expectancy  better come to the point lane said the question is what do you want from me  its pretty simple was haldanes answer we want you out of this country its unfortunate that we cant help considering you an obstacle in the way of its prosperity but not being highway robbers we are open to make you a fair offer for your property here is a schedule i have drawn up and you will see by examination that we purpose to buy the mortgages at their face value paying you any interest due at current bank rates we also purpose to buy back on the same conditions the lands on which you have already foreclosed  lane was difficult to astonish but now he actually gasped and several of those present who were still within his clutches sprang to their feet a glacier wouldnt be cooler than you lane said you must know theyre worth or will be about three times as much  exactly said haldane and gordon and another chuckled silently that is just why we want to see you safely out of this country the man who drives that kind of bargain gives nobody else a show please sit down gentlemen ill answer your questions later  i think lane in spite of his refusal to admit anything must have felt himself driven into a corner indeed for almost the first time during my acquaintance with him he showed signs of temper for his lips straightened and there was a gleam of malice in his eyes  your hand looks a good one but its not good enough he said im going to tell you to do your worst say dont you count too much on mr haldane the rest of you if this is fun to him its bread and cheese to me and i dont let up on my living easily stand out from under before he gets tired and the roof falls on you you all know me  the listeners had good reason to do so but they had not only lost their fear of himthe fear which makes a coward of a brave man when he becomes a debtorbut had found his yoke so galling that they would have risked the worst by defying him in spite of it he must have read as much in the contemptuous laugh and lowering faces  i think we could beat you with it but we hold still better cards said haldane quietly for instance you have squeezed niven a little too hard and he is prepared to risk his liberty to testify on one or two points against you i refer to incidents connected with gaspards trail  lane brought his hand down on the table and for some unexplainable reason i actually believed him as he said gaspards trail was burnt by accident  we wont question the statement said haldane it was at least an accident that you were quick to profit by this ace however takes the trick just run through this account book andremembering that we can produce miss redmond and three men who will swear to what her father said when ormesbys cattle which did not get there by accident were burned in the fenceconsider what might be done with it  lane seemed to shake himself together after he had read the first few entries while watching him closely i once more saw the telltale contraction at the corners of his mouth this was the only sign he made however save that presently he moved forward a little in his chair which was close before the fire and held up the tornout page as though he wished the lamplight to fall on it more directly the action which was made very naturally suggested nothing to myself or even to haldane but when the reader moved again boone rose suddenly and laid a restraining hand on his arm  you have had time enough to grasp the significance of what is written there and ill take the papers back he said of course knowing whom we dealt with we have a duly attested copy  i do not know whether lane had actually intended to destroy part at least of the dead mans testimony or not but he was capable of anything and the fire was hot in any case he calmly handed book and paper back to boone with the careless comment you thought of that must be considerably smarter than you used to be  yes said boone dryly i have learned a good deal since i first met you we will now with mr haldanes concurrence give you five or if necessary ten minutes in which to consider your decision  without being in the least sorry for him i fancied i could understand lanes feelings and his state of mind could not have been enviable it is true that haldanes offer allowed him a fair return for all sums invested perhaps almost as much as he would have obtained by legitimate enterprise but that must have been as nothing to the man who had schemed for a fortune while one could have fancied that he found it inexpressibly galling to discover that those whom he had considered his helpless dupes now held him at their mercy yet he showed small sign of discomfiture and his voice was steady as he said its robbery but im open to admit you have fixed the thing tolerably neatly suppose it was dixon who gave you the pointers this man here must have some grit for he knows that even now i could make it hot for him do you know who he is  i consider the terms are liberal and we arranged the affair ourselves said haldane you could hardly expect mr dixon to involve himself in what im afraid is virtually the compounding of a felony it is also possible that some people would call our proceedings by unpleasant names but you left us no choice of weapons we might have squeezed you further but i believe its wise to leave a back way open for a beaten enemy i am perfectly acquainted with mr boones history and understand that now that his work is finishedfor most of the scheme was hishe will surrender himself to the police he does not however apprehend any trouble with them because by the time he surrenders the prosecutor will have removed himself across the frontier now hadnt you better consider your decision  lane sat still for at least five minutes and i could see that some of the rest were not quite convinced that the battle was over they had experienced such a taste of his quality that they probably expected some bold countermove rather than submission nevertheless the man was beaten for at last he said its your game i must have the money down and your solemn promise youll make no use of what you know until im across the frontier  if you will meet me at gordons at noon tomorrow well settle the bill together said haldane quietly and rose as if to signify that the interview was over  lane no longer looked jaunty for although he evinced no great dismay there was a subtle change in him as he also rose and brushed the dust off his hat everybody gets tripped up now and then and must make the best of it he said quaint isnt it that it should be a man of ormesbys kind who most helped to bring me up well it seems i cant stay any longer with you boys but no one knows what may happen and ill try to square the deal with you if ever i come back again  nobody answered him and with a shrug of his shoulders he passed out of the room and though i fancied that was the last i should see of him i was mistaken  then boone said reflectively i wonder whether we have been too easy with him sir i cant help feeling by the way he yielded that the rascal has something up his sleeve  before our host could answer he was plied with congratulations and questions about the money for the redemption of the mortgages and raising his hand for silence stood up smiling at the men before him  ill find part of it in the meantime and there is the profit on the campaign fund you raised he said you neednt be bashful gentlemen im a business man and will have no objection to charging you three or four per cent more interest than the banks it will considering the prospects be money sunk on good security now that we have got our stumbling block out of the way i see possibilities for this district and am presently going to ask you to form a committee to consider whether we cant put up a small flour mill or coöperative dairy  he proceeded to sketch out a project with a vigor of conception and a grasp of practical details that astonished the listeners who presently departed with sincere if not very neatly expressed gratitude and with hope and exultation in their weatherdarkened faces i tried to express my own sentiments and i believe failed but haldane smiled quaintly  dont make any mistake ormesby im not setting up as a public benefactor he said one cant do absolutely nothing and i dont quite see why i shouldnt earn a few honest dollars where i can i dare say the others will profit and i should prefer them as friends rather than enemies but this scheme is going to pay mein fact as you say hereit has just got to     chapter xxix  the exit of lane   early one evening after lanes capitulation i sat in the hall at bonaventure waiting its owners return lucille haldane occupied the windowseat opposite me embroidering with an assiduity which while slightly irritating did not altogether displease me since the wagon accident she had in an indefinite manner been less cordial and i on my part was conscious of an unwonted restraint in her presence it is unnecessary to say that she made a pretty picture with the square of still sunlit prairie behind her though her face was tantalizingly hidden in shadow and i could only admire the graceful pose of her figure and the lissom play of the little white fingers across the embroidery the girl must have been sensible of my furtive regards for at last she laid down the sewing and looked up sharply  is there nothing among all those papers worth your attention or have you taken an interest in embroidery she asked pointing to the littered journals on the table do you know that it is a little disconcerting to be watched when at work  i was uneasily conscious that my forehead grew hot but hoped the hue that wind and sun had set upon it would hide the fact dont you think the trespass was almost justifiable i said you are responsible for spoiling us and unaccustomed prosperity must be commencing to make me lazy i was thinking  that is really interesting said the girl has sudden prosperity also rendered you incapable of expressing your thoughts in speech  in this case circumstances had certainly done so i had been thinking how pretty and desirable the speaker looked but the trouble was that although silence cost me an effort i could not tell her so i hoped to say as much and more besides some day but this moment was not opportune lucille haldane was mistress of bonaventure and i as yet a struggling man who thanks to her good nature and her fathers business skill had barely escaped sinking into poverty it would be time to speak when my position was a little more secure meanwhile in spite of the sternly repressed longing and uncertainty which daily grew more painful it was very pleasant to bask in the sunshine of her presence and i dare not risk ending the privilege prematurely  i was thinking what a change has come over this part of the prairie i said framing but one portion of my thoughts into words not long ago one saw nothing but anxious faces and gloomy looks while now i fancy there is only one downcast man in all this vicinity and he the one from whom your father and boone have just parted the change considering that a single person is chiefly responsible is almost magical but remembering a past rebuke that hardly sounds very pretty does it  lucille haldane laughed mischievously to one of the superior sex but are you not forgetting that this season the heavens fought for you it certainly might have been more neatly expressed do you know that the education you mentioned is not yet quite finished  i know there is much you could teach me if you would i said with a humility which was not assumed choking down bolder words which had almost forced themselves into utterance and perhaps the effort left its trace on me for lucille turned her head towards the prairie  here is sergeant mackay i wonder what he wants she said  mackay dusty and damp with perspiration was ushered in a few minutes later and for the first time i felt all the bitterness of jealousy as i saw the friendly manner in which the girl greeted cotton who followed him there was nothing of the coquette in lucille haldane and the knowledge of this added to the sting but i did not think that even she was always so unnecessarily gracious mackay however appeared intent and grim and by no means in a humor for casual conversation  im wanting your father and fresh horses at once miss haldane he said ye had a visit from lane yesterday  we certainly had what do you want with him asked lucille and mackay smiled dryly when i added a similar question  just his body and your assistance as a loyal subject henry ormesby ye were once good enough to say ye could not expect too much from the police but its long since your natural protectors had eyes on the thief who was robbing ye niven when he wasnt quite sober told a little story and theres another bit question of a debt agreement forgery ye will let us have the horses miss haldane  lucille bade them follow her and i heard her giving orders to one of the hired men then she returned alone in haste to me you saw where my father put the book miss redmond gave him she said  yes i answered wondering he locked it inside that bureau and put the keys into his pocket  the girl wrenched at the handle and i noticed by the creaking of the bureau how strong in spite of her slenderness she was the lock would not yield and she turned imperiously to me dont waste a moment but smash that drawer in  it is a beautiful piece of maple and why do you wish to destroy it i said and for she had a high spirit fancied lucille haldane came near stamping one little foot impatiently  can you not do the first thing i ask you without asking questions she said  there was nothing more to be said and stooping for the poker i whirled it around my head one end of the bar doubled on itself but the front of the drawer crushed in and when i had wrenched out the fragments lucille drew forth the book  i know what my father promised and there is miss redmond to consider she has suffered too much already she said tearing out whole pages in hot hurry sergeant mackay is much less foolish than i once heard you call him and i have no doubt suspects something of this cant you see that he could force us to give the papers up i am going to burn them  that at least you shall not do i said taking them from her with as much gentleness as possible but by superior force and then positively quailed before the anger and astonishment in the girls face  you are still so afraid of lane that you would risk bringing fresh sorrow on that poor girl in order to protect yourself she said with biting scorn  no i answered stolidly without pausing for reflection i only wish to declare it was i who destroyed this evidence if there is any trouble over the affair  i tore the book to pieces and rammed the fragments deep among the burning logs as i spoke and when this was accomplished i did not look up until lucille haldane called me by name gentle as she could be i had a wholesome respect for her wrath  i deserved it she said with a bewitching deepening of the crimson in her cheeks and a shining in her eyes you will forgive me i had not time to think  thereupon i longed for eloquence or boones ready wit but no neat speech came to my relief and while i racked my clouded brains the girl must have guessed what was taking place for merriment crept into her eyes then just as an inspiration dawned on me as usual too late a hurried tread drew nearer along the passage  it is sergeant mackay and he must not come in here said my companion with a nervous laugh as she glanced at the shattered bureau is it quite impossible for you to hurry then before i realized what was happening she had placed one hand on my shoulder and positively hustled me out of the door hardly knowing what i did i clutched at the little fingers and missed them and the next moment i plunged violently into the astonished sergeant  mr ormesby is ready and so are the horses i hope your chase will be successful a voice which sounded a little uneven though there was a trace of laughter in it said and the door swung to  mackay looked at me curiously and when we had mounted said im asking no questions but yon was surely a bit summary dismissal  its just as well you are not because i am afraid i should not answer them i said and mackay frowned upon his subordinate when cotton laughed  we had ridden a league before he vouchsafed any explanation i could not call in my other men in time and as we may have to divide forces demanded your assistance in virtue of the powers entrusted me he said formally well call first at gordons on the odd chance our man is there and pick up adams though lanes away hotfoot for the rail by now im thinking he had no a bad nerve to cut it so fine  did the confounded rascal know there was a warrant out i gasped almost pulling my horse up in my indignation as i remembered boones hint  we did not advertise the fact but yon man knows everything and im no saying its quite impossible mackay answered dryly but what ails ye that yere drawing bridle harry ormesby  i drove the spurs in the next second and shot clear a length ahead and though the bonaventure horses were good the others had hard work to catch me during the next mile or two if lane suspected the issue of the warrant he had victimized us to the end for he had tricked us into furnishing him with not only the means of escape but sufficient ready money to start him upon a fresh career in another land we met boone and haldane returning from gordons ranch and while the former advised the sergeant that lane must be well on his way to the station by this time i drew haldane aside and hurriedly related what had happened at bonaventure  lane is a capable rascal and will certainly catch the westbound train there is little to be gained either by wiring the bank he said he insisted on taking a large share in paper currency and as the draft was one i had by me he would no doubt arrange for his friends to cash it before i could warn the drawer do you know the bureau you smashed in cost me sixty dollars ormesby  i was endeavoring to express my contrition when haldane laughed i am not sure that you are the only person responsible for the destruction of my furniture  mackay had started before our conversation was finished and it cost boone and me a long gallop to come up with him while it was only by dint of hard riding that we eventually reached the station some hours after the departure of the train mackay first of all wired to the stations down the line and then explained thats just a useless duty yon man is keen enough to know he might find the troopers waiting for him hell leave the cars at the flag station where theres nobody to detain him and buying a horse at the first ranch strike south for the border it would be desirable that we grip him before he reaches it  because various formalities must be gone through before a canadian offender is handed over by the americans this was clear enough though i did not see how it was to be accomplished until mackay had exchanged high words with the station agent a freight locomotive and an empty stock car rolled out of the siding and we took our places therein men and horses together  sorry i havent got a new bogie drawingroom for you but its getting time the police gave some other station a share of their business said the exasperated railroad official i also overheard him tell the engineer you have got to be back by daylight and neednt be particular about shaking them  it was not the fault of the engineer if he did not shake the life out of us canadian lines are neither metalled nor ballasted with much solidity and with only one car to steady it the huge machine appeared to leap over each inequality of the track there was also nipping frost in the air the prairie glittered under the stars and bitter draughts pulsed through the lurching car it was not an easy matter to keep the horses on their feet or to maintain our own balance but the swish of the dust and the rattle of flungup ballast brought some comfort as an indication of our speed  its a steeplechase already gasped boone holding on by a headrope as we roared across a bridge i looked at the gaugeglass and the engineer can hardly have full steam up yet well be lucky to escape with whole limbs when he has  the prediction was fully justified for the bouncing jolting and hammering increased with the pace and i made most of the journey holding fast by a very cold rail as for my life while halfseen through the rush of ballast i watched the prairie race past when one could look forward there was nothing visible but a field of dancing stars and a smear of white below athwart which the blaze of the great headlamp drove onwards with the speed of a comet all of us were thankful when the locomotive was pulled up before a lonely shed and while we dragged the horses out the man who drove it grinning at his stoker said i guess theres no bonus for beating the record on this contract  no said mackay dryly ye have the satisfaction of knowing ye served the state  by good fortune we found a sleepy man in the galvanized iron shed and he informed us that lane had alighted from the last train and started on foot towards the nearest ranch which lay about a league away inside of fifteen minutes we were pounding on its door and the startled owner said that the man we asked for had bought a good horse from him and inquired the shortest route to the american frontier  four hours start said mackay as we proceeded again ye can add another three for the making of inquiries and searching for his trail it will be a close race im thinking  it certainly proved so as well as a long one because we lost much time halting at lonely ranches and still more in riding in wrong directions for lane had evidently picked up somebody perhaps a contrabandist well versed in the art of laying a false trail neither did he strike straight for the border and after dividing and joining forces several times it was late one evening when we found ourselves close behind him  oh yes a man like that paid me forty dollars to swap horses with him and his partner it might be an hour ago said the last rancher at whose dwelling we stopped seemed in a mighty hurry to reach montana how long might it take you to reach the frontier well thats a question of horses and ive no more in my corral you ought to get there by daylight or a little earlier follow the wheel trail and youll see a boundary stake on the edge of the big coulée to the left of it  though we had twice changed horses our beasts were jaded but there was solace in the thought that lane was an indifferent rider and must have almost reached the limits of his endurance while though used to the saddle i was too tired to retain more than a blurred impression of that last nights ride there was no moon but the blue heavens were thick with twinkling stars and the prairie glittered faintly under the white hoar frost it swelled into steeper rises than those we were used to while at times we blundered down the crumbling sides of deep hollows destitute of verdure in which the bare earth rang metallically beneath the hoofs still the wheel trail led straight towards the south and aching all over we pushed on as best we could until i grew too drowsy even to notice my horses stumbles or to speculate what the end would be before that happened however i had considered the question and decided that there was no need for any scruples in seizing lane if the chance fell to me we had merely promised to refrain from pressing one particular charge against the fugitive and were willing to keep our bargain though he on his part had deceived us into making it  at last when only conscious of the cruel jolting and the thud of tired hoofs which rose and fell in a drowsy cadence through the silence mackays voice roused me and i fancied i made out two mounted figures faintly projected against the sky ahead yons them and yell each do your best were distressfully close on the frontier now he said  once more the spurs sank into the jaded beast and when it responded i became suddenly wide awake it was bitterly cold and that hour in the morning when mans vitality sinks to its lowest ebb but one and all braced themselves for the final effort boone in spite of all that i could do drew out ahead and we followed as best we might blundering down into gullies and over rises where the grass grew harsh and high while thrice we lost the man who led us as well as the fugitives nevertheless they hove into sight again before a league had passed and it even seemed that we gained a little on the one who lagged behind until at last the blue of the heavens faded and grayness gathered in the east  it spread over half the horizon the two figures before us grew more distinct and boone rode almost midway between ourselves and them when as though by magic the first one disappeared mackay roared to cotton when topping a rise there opened before us a winding hollow and boone wheeling his horse waved an arm warningly  its the wrong man doubling come on your hardest until the trail forks and then try left and right he shouted before he too sank from view beneath the edge of the hollow  there were birches in the ravine as well as willow groves and the fugitives had vanished among them leaving no trace behind there were unfortunately also several trails and because time was precious the noise we made pressing up and down them would have prevented our hearing any sound mackay who in spite of this sat still listening used a little illicit language and rated cotton for no particular cause while i had managed to entangle myself in a thicket when boones voice fell sharply from the opposite rise gone away he has taken to the open  with many a stumble we compassed the steep ascent and as we gained the summit the growing light showed me a solitary figure already diminishing down a stretch of level prairie its our last chance roared mackay pointing to what looked like a break in the grasses ahead im fearing yons the boundary  our beasts were worn out their riders equally so but we called up the last of our failing strength to make a creditable finish of the race the coulée was left behind us and lanes figure grew larger ahead for mackay who certainly did not wish to declared he could see no boundary post then as the first crimson flushed the horizon a lonely homestead rose out of the grass and when lane rode straight for it the sergeant swore in breathless gasps a little smoke curled from its chimney for the poorer ranchers rise betimes in that country we saw lane drop from the saddle and disappear within the door while when we drew bridle before it two gaunt brownfaced men came out and regarded us stolidly  what place is this asked mackay with a gasp  one of them seemed to consider before he answered him well its generally allowed to be todhunters wells  thats not what i want said the sergeant wheres the boundary this time the other man laughed as he pointed backwards across the prairie we had traversed  bout a league behind you no sir youre not in canada this as the song says is the land of the free youll find the big stake by the coulée if you dont believe me  beaten said mackay dropping his bridle and added aside whisky smugglers by their manners im thinking as we endeavored to master our disappointment lane himself appeared in the doorway he looked very weary his fleshy face was haggard and mottled by streaks of gray but the humorous gleam i hated shone mockingly in his eyes  sorry to disappoint you sergeant but you cant complain about the chase he said even cannuck policemen and amateur detectives arent recognized here and as there are two respectable witnesses im afraid youll have to apply to the washington authorities you can tell mr haldane ormesby that theres no use in stopping his check i dont think there is anything else i need say except that as i have booked all the accommodation here they might give you breakfast at the ranch in the coulée  he actually nodded to us and thrusting his hands into his pockets leaned against the lintel of the door with an air of amusement which was not needed to remind us that he was master of the situation and for the last time set my blood on fire there was however nothing to be gained by virulence and when mackay who disdained to answer a word wheeled his jaded horse we silently followed him towards the coulée  i wish the americans joy of him the grizzled sergeant said at length theres just one bit consolationwe can very well spare him and yell mind what the douce provost said in the songjust een let him be the toon is weel quit o that deil o dundee  boone smiling curiously closed with the speaker there is one thing i expected he did not do and as it could hardly be due to magnanimity he must have forgotten it he said you will not go back emptyhanded sergeant are you aware that you hold a warrant for me  mackay pulled his horse up and stared at him i cannot see the point of yon joke he said  there isnt one was the answer now that my work is finished i see no further need of hiding the fact that while you knew me as adams my name isboone  mackay still stared at him then laughed a little as it were in admiration but silently im understanding a good deal nowand that was why ye helped run yon thief down well ill take your parole and im thinking ye will have little trouble since the prosecutors gone     chapter xxx  the last toast   lane troubled us no further and there came a time when those who had suffered under him and at last assisted in his overthrow would laugh boisterously at my narrative of his hasty exit from the prairie with the troopers hard upon his heels they appeared to consider the description of how with characteristic audacity he bade us an ironical farewell one cold morning from the doorway of a lonely ranch an appropriate finale and bantered the sergeant upon his tardiness the latter would answer them dryly that the dominion was well quit of lane  some time however passed before this came about and meanwhile winter closed in on the prairie it was save for one uncertainty which greatly troubled me a tranquil winterfor i had in addition to promising schemes for the future a balance in the bankbut not wholly uneventful before the first snow had fallen men with theodolites and compasses invaded crane valley and left inscribed posts behind them when they passed this was evidently a preliminary survey but it showed the railroad was coming at last although as the men could tell us nothing there remained the somewhat important question whether it would follow that or an alternative route  also a month or two later thorn and steel sought speech with me the former looking almost uncomfortable when his companion said ive been talking with haldane about taking up my old place and dont see how to raise the money or feel very keen over it we never did much good there since my father went under the fact is we two pull well together and you have the longest head wont you run both places and make me a kind of foreman with a partners interest  the suggestion suited me in many ways but bearing in mind what might be possible i saw a difficulty i dare say we might make a workable arrangement and i couldnt find a better partner but havent you sallys interests to consider i said  steel smiled in an oracular fashion thats toms business he said with a gesture which though i think it was involuntary suggested that he felt relieved of a load sally is a daisy and ive done my best for her but though theres nobody got more good points i dont mind allowing she was a blame big handful now and then of course we are all friends here  we wont be if you start in apologizing for sally broke in the stalwart thorn and as i glanced at his reddened face a light dawned on me  thats all right said the smiling brother theres no use in wasting words on him he has had fair warning and im not to blame  it struck me that the best thing i could do was to shake hands with the wrathful foreman and i did it very heartily  he will think differently some day and you will have a good wife tom i said well miss you both badly at crane valley but must try to give you a good start off when you take up your preëmpted land  it must be recorded that henceforward sally was a model of virtue so much so that i marveled while at times her brother appeared to find it hard to conceal his astonishment she was more subdued in manner and gentle in speech while i could now understand the soft light which filled her eyes when they rested upon my foreman the former spirit however still lurked within her for returning to the house one evening when spring had come around again i saw cotton who had once been a favorite of hers leap out of the door with a brush whirling through the air close behind him  what is the meaning of this cotton i asked sharply and the corporal who looked slightly sheepish glanced over his shoulder as though expecting another missile  the truth is that i dont quite know he said perhaps miss steel is suffering from a bad toothache or something of the kind today  that does not satisfy me i said as severely as i could hoping he would not discover it was mischief which prompted me i presume my housekeeper did not eject you without some reason  why dont you ask her then said cotton awkwardly still i suppose an explanation is due to you if you insist on it i went in to talk to sally while i waited for you and said somethingperfectly innocent i assure you about wellconfound itif i did say id been heartbroken ever since i saw her last was that any reason why she should hurl a brush at me she used to appreciate that kind of foolery  circumstances alter cases i said dryly dont you know that sally will leave here as mrs thorn in a few weeks or so  on my word of honor i didnt and cotton laughed boyishly go in and make my peace with her if you can i am positively frightened to say im deeply contrite andconfoundedly hungry  supper was just ready but there were only four plates on the table and when i ventured to mention that cotton waited repentant and famishing without sally regarded me stonily he can just stay there and starve she said  even thorn who i think knew sallys weak points and how they were counterbalanced by the warmheartedness which would have covered much worse sins laughed but the lady remained implacable and as a result of it cotton hungry without untilwhen the meal was almost finisheddixon who was accompanied by sergeant mackay astonished us by alighting at the door he brought startling news  the first carloads of rails and ties for the new road were ready for dispatching and it would pass close by my possessions while after we had recovered from our excitement he said i have been searching for a corporal cotton and heard he might be here do you know where he is  i looked at sally who answered for me frigidly you might find him trying to keep warm in the stable  dixon appeared astonished and mackays eyes twinkled while after some consideration the autocrat at the head of the table said if its important business charlie may tell him that he may come in  cotton seemed glad to obey the summons and knowing that he had ridden a long way since his last meal i signaled dixon to wait when sally relenting set a double portion before him it was therefore some time later when the lawyer glancing in his direction said you are charles singlehurst cotton born at halton edge in the county of warwick england  the effect was electrical cotton thrust back his plate and straightened himself staring fixedly at the speaker with wrath in his gaze i am corporal c cotton of the northwest police and whether i was born in england or canada concerns only myself  dixon smiled indulgently and mackay looking towards me nodded his head with a complacent air of one who has witnessed the fulfilment of his prophecy  if i had any doubts before after inspecting a photograph of you i have none at present the former said mr ormesby forgot to mention that i am a lawyer by profession and messrs james tillotson  james of london whose name you doubtless know requested me through a correspondent to search for you having business with mr haldane i came in person have you any objection to according me a private interview  cotton looked at me interrogatively and i nodded you can safely trust even family secrets to mr dixon he is or will be one of the foremost lawyers in the dominion  dixon made me a little semiironical bow and when he and cotton passed out together into my own particular sanctum a leanto shed mackay beamed upon me man did i not tell ye he said  it was some time before cotton came back looking grave and yet elated and turning towards us said mr dixon has brought me unexpected news both good and bad it is necessary that i should accompany him to winnipeg sergeant you have the power to grant me a weeks leave of absence  mackay pursed his lips up and with overdone gravity shook his head im fearing we cannot spare ye with the new mounts to train  dixon chuckled softly im afraid charles singlehurst cotton will break no more police horses for you he has a good many of another kind of his own he said he has also influential relatives who require his presence in england shortly and have arranged things so that your chief authorities will probably release him before his term of service is completed the signature to this note should remove any scruples you may have about granting him leave  mackay drew himself up and returned the letter with the air of one acknowledging a commanders orders then let his hand drop heavily on cottons shoulder his tone was slightly sardonic but there was a very kindly look in his eyes as he said yell no be above accepting the congratulations of the hard old sergeant who licked ye into shape it was no that easy and maybe it galled ye some but ye have learned a few useful things while ye rode with the northwest troopers ye never would have done in england we took ye a raw liddie some bit overproud of himself and now im thinking well miss ye when we send ye back the makings of a man away ye go with mr dixon so long as its necessary  it struck me as a graceful thought for cotton stood straight as on parade with the salute to a superior as he said ill report for duty in seven days sir then laid his brown hand in mackays wrinkled palm every words just as true as gospel and ill thank you in years to come  he took my arm and drew me out upon the starlit prairie i cant sleep tonight and my horse is lame you will lend me one he said then when i asked whether he was not going with dixon to the station he laughed and flung back his head  im going to spend all night in the saddle it will be best for me he said ill tell you the whole story later and meantime may say that over the sea yonder somebody is dead i know what usually sends such men as i out here but while i should like you to remember that i neither broke any law of the old country nor injured any woman i wouldnt see which side my bread was butteredand there are various ways of playing the fool  we have mackays assurance that the colonial cure has proved a success and in all seriousness you have my best wishes for the future i said  the corporal answered gravely if it had not i should never venture to visit bonaventure tomorrow as i intend doing  visit bonaventure i said a little thickly  of course said cotton with both exultation and surprise in his tone cant you see the best this news may have made possible to me  i was thankful that the kindly darkness hid my face and turned towards the stables without a word while after the corporal had mounted i found it very hard to answer him when he said simply yet with a great air of friendship although you were irritating sometimes ormesby you were the first man i ever spoke frankly to in this country wont you wish me luck  if she will have you there is no good thing i would not wish for you both i said but in spite of my efforts my voice rang hollow and i was thankful when cotton who did not seem to notice it rode away  i did not return to the house until long after the drumming of hoofs growing fainter and fainter had finally died away and said little then i even flung the journals dixon brought which were full of the new railroad unread away my rival was young and handsome generous and likable even in his weaknesses he was also as it now appeared of good estate and birth and granting all that i could on my own side the odds seemed heavily in favor of cotton while a certain knowledge of the worst would almost have been preferable to the harrowing uncertainty as to how the mistress of bonaventure would make the comparison it lasted for two whole weeksweeks which i never forgot for i could not visit bonaventure until i learned whether cottons errand had resulted successfully and he sent no word to lessen the anxiety  at last i rode in to the settlement whither i knew haldane had gone to inspect the progress of the road and met boone and mackay on the prairie has cotton returned i asked  he has said mackay dryly this is his last days duty he loitered at the settlement and ye will meet him presently im not understanding what is wrong with him but hes uncertain in the temper and im thinking that sudden good fortune does not agree with him  i met cotton riding very slowly and looking straight ahead he pulled up when i greeted him and seeing the question in my eyes ruefully shook his head ive had my answer ormesbygiven with a gentleness that made it worse he said  he must have misunderstood my expression and perhaps my face was a study just then for he added grimly it is perfectly true and really not surprising hopeless from the firstand i think there is someone else though heaven knows where in the whole dominion she would find any man fit to brush the dust from her little shoes including myself well there is no use repining and ill have years in which to get over it but its lucky im leaving this country andfor one cant shirk a painful dutyill say goodby to you with the others at bonaventure tomorrow  i was glad that he immediately rode on for while i pitied him my heart leaped within me had it happened otherwise i should have tried to wish him well and now my satisfaction which was nevertheless stronger than all such considerations appeared ungenerous  when i reached it the usually sleepy settlement presented a stirring scene long strings of flat cars cumbered the trebled sidetrack rows of huts had risen as by magic and two big locomotives moved ceaselessly to and fro dozens of oxen and horse teams hauled the great iron scoops which tore the sod up to form the roadbed while the air vibrated with the thud of shovels the ringing of hammers and the clang of falling rails the track lengthened yard by yard as i stood and watched in another week or two the swarming toilers would have moved their mushroom town further on towards crane valley and i was almost oppressed by a sense of what all this tremendous activity promised me it meant at least prosperity instead of penury the realizing of ambitions perhaps a road to actual affluence also it might be far more than this i scarcely saw haldane until he grasped my hand  it is a great day ormesby he said no man can tell exactly how far this narrow steel road may carry all of you still one might almost say that you have deserved itand it has come at last  it will either be the brightest day in all my lifeor the worst i said will you listen to me for two minutes sir  haldane did so and then leaned against a flat car with the wrinkles deepening on his forehead for what appeared to be an inordinately long time i may tell you frankly that i had not anticipated thisand am not sure i should not have tried to prevent it if i had he said i know nothing that does not testify in your favor as an individual ormesby but as even you admit there are objections from one point of view still this road and our new schemes may do much for you and well i never refused my daughter anything and if she approves of you and you will not separate us altogether i wont say no  i had expected nothing better and dreaded a great deal worse and my pulses throbbed furiously when after some further speech haldane strolled away with a halfwistful halfregretful glance at his daughter who approached us as we spoke she was in high spirits and greeted me cordially  you ought to be happy and you look serious this is surely the best you could have hoped for she said  it seemed best to end the uncertainty at once and yet remembering cottons fate i was afraid nevertheless mustering courage i looked straight at the speaker and slowly shook my head lucille was always shrewd and i think she understood for her lips quivered a little and the smile died out of her eyes  you are difficult to satisfy is it not enough she said  her voice had in it no trace of either encouragement or disdain and a boldness i had scarcely hoped for came upon me as i answered in itself it is worth nothing to me what you said is true for i have set my hopes very high there is only one prize in the dominion that would satisfy me and that isyou  lucille moved a little away from me and i could not see her face for she looked back towards the train of cars which came clanking down the track but for once words were given me and when i ceased she looked up again though the rich damask had deepened in her cheek there was a significant question in her eyes  are you sure you are not mistaken rancher ormesby men do not always know their own minds she said  the underlying question demanded an answer and i do not know how i furnished it for i had already found it bewildering when asked by myself but with deep humility i framed disjoined words and gathered hope once more when i read what might have been a faint trace of mischief and something more in my companions eyes  it is not very convincingbut what could you say and you are after all not very wise she said i wonder if i might tell you that i knew part of this long ago but the rest i did not know until the evening the team bolted in the hollow still and lucille grew grave again would it hurt you very much if i said i could not listen because i feared you were only dreaming this time too  it would drive me out of canada a brokenhearted man i said it was you for whom i strove always youeven when i did not know itsince the first day i saw you i would fling away all i own tomorrow and  the words broke off suddenly for lucille looked up at me shyly this time and from under halflowered lashes i think she said very slowly and with a pause during which i did not breathe that would be a pity harry ormesby  it was sufficient all that the world could give seemed comprised within the brief sentence and it was difficult to remember that we stood clear in the eyes of the swarming toilers upon the level prairie neither do i remember what either of us next said for there was a glamour upon me but as we turned back towards haldane side by side i hazarded a query and lucille smiled you ask too many questionsare you not yet content still since you ask i think i did not understand aright either until a little while ago  haldane appeared satisfied though perhaps that is not the most appropriate word for he himself supplied a better one and when we were next alone and i ventured thanks and protestations laughed in the whimsical fashion he sometimes adopted i think to hide his inward sentiments  you need not look so contrite for i suppose you could not help it and i am resigned he said there we will take all the rest for granted and you must wait another year then although haldane smiled again he laid his hand on my shoulder in a very kindly fashion as he added lucille might like her sister have shone in london and paris but it seems she prefers the prairieand after all i do not know that she has not chosen well  the story of my failures mistakes and struggles ended then and there for henceforward even when passing troubles rested upon us i could turn for counsel and comfort to a helpmate whose wisdom and sympathy were equalled only by her courage nevertheless two incidents linger in my memory and were connected with the last meeting of what had now ceased to be a prairie tribunal at bonaventure it was an occasion of festivity but regret was mingled with it for boone and cotton would leave us that night and there was not one of the bronzed men gathered in the great hall at bonaventure who would not miss them boone it may be mentioned had after entering into recognizances to appear if wanted been finally released from them by the police at length haldane stood up at the head of the long table  this has been a day to remember and i think what we have decided tonight will set its mark upon the future of the prairie he said where all did well there were two who chiefly helped us to win what we have done and it is to our sorrow that one goes back to his own country now that his work is well accomplished we will not lightly forget him the other will i hope be spared to stay with you and share your triumphs as he has done your adversity i have to announce my daughters approaching marriage to your comrade henry ormesby  it pleased me greatly that cotton was the first upon his feet and mackay the next although it was but for a second because almost simultaneously a double row of weatherdarkened men heaved themselves upright cottons face was flushed and his eyes shone strangely under the candlelight but he looked straight at me as he solemnly raised the glass in his hand  the mistress of bonaventure god bless her and send every happiness to both of them he said  the very rafters rang to the shout that followed and it was the last time that toast was honored for when next my neighbors gathered round me with goodwill and festivity
