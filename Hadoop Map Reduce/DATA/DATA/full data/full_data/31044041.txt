once upon a time in a certain country there lived a king whose palace was surrounded by a spacious garden but though the gardeners were many and the soil was good this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits not even grass or shady trees  the king was in despair about it when a wise old man said to him  your gardeners do not understand their business but what can you expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters how should they have learned to cultivate your garden  you are quite right cried the king  therefore continued the old man you should send for a gardener whose father and grandfather have been gardeners before him and very soon your garden will be full of green grass and gay flowers and you will enjoy its delicious fruit  so the king sent messengers to every town village and hamlet in his dominions to look for a gardener whose forefathers had been gardeners also and after forty days one was found  come with us and be gardener to the king they said to him  how can i go to the king said the gardener a poor wretch like me  that is of no consequence they answered here are new clothes for you and your family  but i owe money to several people  we will pay your debts they said  so the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded and went away with the messengers taking his wife and his son with him and the king delighted to have found a real gardener entrusted him with the care of his garden the man found no difficulty in making the royal garden produce flowers and fruit and at the end of a year the park was not like the same place and the king showered gifts upon his new servant  the gardener as you have heard already had a son who was a very handsome young man with most agreeable manners and every day he carried the best fruit of the garden to the king and all the prettiest flowers to his daughter now this princess was wonderfully pretty and was just sixteen years old and the king was beginning to think it was time that she should be married  my dear child said he you are of an age to take a husband therefore i am thinking of marrying you to the son of my prime minister  father replied the princess i will never marry the son of the minister  why not asked the king  because i love the gardeners son answered the princess  on hearing this the king was at first very angry and then he wept and sighed and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter but the young princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry the gardeners son  then the king consulted his ministers this is what you must do they said to get rid of the gardener you must send both suitors to a very distant country and the one who returns first shall marry your daughter  the king followed this advice and the ministers son was presented with a splendid horse and a purse full of gold pieces while the gardeners son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of copper money and every one thought he would never come back from his journey  the day before they started the princess met her lover and said to him  be brave and remember always that i love you take this purse full of jewels and make the best use you can of them for love of me and come back quickly and demand my hand  the two suitors left the town together but the ministers son went off at a gallop on his good horse and very soon was lost to sight behind the most distant hills he traveled on for some days and presently reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a stone  goodday to you young traveler said she  but the ministers son made no reply  have pity upon me traveler she said again i am dying of hunger as you see and three days have i been here and no one has given me anything  let me alone old witch cried the young man i can do nothing for you and so saying he went on his way  that same evening the gardeners son rode up to the fountain upon his lame gray horse  goodday to you young traveler said the beggarwoman  goodday good woman answered he  young traveler have pity upon me  take my purse good woman said he and mount behind me for your legs cant be very strong  the old woman didnt wait to be asked twice but mounted behind him and in this style they reached the chief city of a powerful kingdom the ministers son was lodged in a grand inn the gardeners son and the old woman dismounted at the inn for beggars  the next day the gardeners son heard a great noise in the street and the kings heralds passed blowing all kinds of instruments and crying  the king our master is old and infirm he will give a great reward to whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of his youth  then the old beggarwoman said to her benefactor  this is what you must do to obtain the reward which the king promises go out of the town by the south gate and there you will find three little dogs of different colors the first will be white the second black the third red you must kill them and then burn them separately and gather up the ashes put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own color then go before the door of the palace and cry out a celebrated physician has come from janina in albania he alone can cure the king and give him back the strength of his youth the kings physicians will say this is an impostor and not a learned man and they will make all sorts of difficulties but you will overcome them all at last and will present yourself before the sick king you must then demand as much wood as three mules can carry and a great cauldron and must shut yourself up in a room with the sultan and when the cauldron boils you must throw him into it and there leave him until his flesh is completely separated from his bones then arrange the bones in their proper places and throw over them the ashes out of the three bags the king will come back to life and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old for your reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant you everything you desire go my son and do not forget any of my instructions  the young man followed the old beggarwomans directions on going out of the town he found the white red and black dogs and killed and burnt them gathering the ashes in three bags then he ran to the palace and cried  a celebrated physician has just come from janina in albania he alone can cure the king and give him back the strength of his youth  the kings physicians at first laughed at the unknown wayfarer but the sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted they brought the cauldron and the loads of wood and very soon the king was boiling away toward midday the gardeners son arranged the bones in their places and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old king revived to find himself once more young and hearty  how can i reward you my benefactor he cried will you take half my treasures  no said the gardeners son  my daughters hand  no  take half my kingdom  no give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything i wish for  alas said the king i set great store by that marvelous ring nevertheless you shall have it and he gave it to him  the gardeners son went back to say goodby to the old beggarwoman then he said to the bronze ring  prepare a splendid ship in which i may continue my journey let the hull be of fine gold the masts of silver the sails of brocade let the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance dressed like kings st nicholas will be at the helm as to the cargo let it be diamonds rubies emeralds and carbuncles  and immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every particular the description given by the gardeners son and stepping on board he continued his journey presently he arrived at a great town and established himself in a wonderful palace after several days he met his rival the ministers son who had spent all his money and was reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish the gardeners son said to him  what is your name what is your family and from what country do you come  i am the son of the prime minister of a great nation and yet see what a degrading occupation i am reduced to  listen to me though i dont know anything more about you i am willing to help you i will give you a ship to take you back to your own country upon one condition  whatever it may be i accept it willingly  follow me to my palace  the ministers son followed the rich stranger whom he had not recognized when they reached the palace the gardeners son made a sign to his slaves who completely undressed the newcomer  make this ring redhot commanded the master and mark the man with it upon his back  the slaves obeyed him  now young man said the rich stranger i am going to give you a vessel which will take you back to your own country  and going out he took the bronze ring and said  bronze ring obey thy master prepare me a ship of which the halfrotten timbers shall be painted black let the sails be in rags and the sailors infirm and sickly one shall have lost a leg another an arm the third shall be a hunchback another lame or clubfooted or blind and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars go and let my orders be executed  the ministers son embarked in this old vessel and thanks to favorable winds at length reached his own country in spite of the pitiable condition in which he returned they received him joyfully  i am the first to come back said he to the king now fulfil your promise and give me the princess in marriage  so they at once began to prepare for the wedding festivities as to the poor princess she was sorrowful and angry enough about it  the next morning at daybreak a wonderful ship with every sail set came to anchor before the town the king happened at that moment to be at the palace window  what strange ship is this he cried that has a golden hull silver masts and silken sails and who are the young men like princes who man it and do i not see st nicholas at the helm go at once and invite the captain of the ship to come to the palace  his servants obeyed him and very soon in came an enchantingly handsome young prince dressed in rich silk ornamented with pearls and diamonds  young man said the king you are welcome whoever you may be do me the favor to be my guest as long as you remain in my capital  many thanks sire replied the captain i accept your offer  my daughter is about to be married said the king will you give her away  i shall be charmed sire  soon after came the princess and her betrothed  why how is this cried the young captain would you marry this charming princess to such a man as that  but he is my prime ministers son  what does that matter i cannot give your daughter away the man she is betrothed to is one of my servants  your servant  without doubt i met him in a distant town reduced to carrying away dust and rubbish from the houses i had pity on him and engaged him as one of my servants  it is impossible cried the king  do you wish me to prove what i say this young man returned in a vessel which i fitted out for him an unseaworthy ship with a black battered hull and the sailors were infirm and crippled  it is quite true said the king  it is false cried the ministers son i do not know this man  sire said the young captain order your daughters betrothed to be stripped and see if the mark of my ring is not branded upon his back  the king was about to give this order when the ministers son to save himself from such an indignity admitted that the story was true  and now sire said the young captain do you not recognize me  i recognize you said the princess you are the gardeners son whom i have always loved and it is you i wish to marry  young man you shall be my soninlaw cried the king the marriage festivities are already begun so you shall marry my daughter this very day  and so that very day the gardeners son married the beautiful princess  several months passed the young couple were as happy as the day was long and the king was more and more pleased with himself for having secured such a soninlaw  but presently the captain of the golden ship found it necessary to take a long voyage and after embracing his wife tenderly he embarked  now in the outskirts of the capital there lived an old man who had spent his life in studying black artsalchemy astrology magic and enchantment this man found out that the gardeners son had only succeeded in marrying the princess by the help of the genii who obeyed the bronze ring  i will have that ring said he to himself so he went down to the seashore and caught some little red fishes really they were quite wonderfully pretty then he came back and passing before the princesss window he began to cry out  who wants some pretty little red fishes  the princess heard him and sent out one of her slaves who said to the old peddler  what will you take for your fish  a bronze ring  a bronze ring old simpleton and where shall i find one  under the cushion in the princesss room  the slave went back to her mistress  the old madman will take neither gold nor silver said she  what does he want then  a bronze ring that is hidden under a cushion  find the ring and give it to him said the princess  and at last the slave found the bronze ring which the captain of the golden ship had accidentally left behind and carried it to the man who made off with it instantly  hardly had he reached his own house when taking the ring he said bronze ring obey thy master i desire that the golden ship shall turn to black wood and the crew to hideous negroes that st nicholas shall leave the helm and that the only cargo shall be black cats  and the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him  finding himself upon the sea in this miserable condition the young captain understood that some one must have stolen the bronze ring from him and he lamented his misfortune loudly but that did him no good  alas he said to himself whoever has taken my ring has probably taken my dear wife also what good will it do me to go back to my own country and he sailed about from island to island and from shore to shore believing that wherever he went everybody was laughing at him and very soon his poverty was so great that he and his crew and the poor black cats had nothing to eat but herbs and roots after wandering about a long time he reached an island inhabited by mice the captain landed upon the shore and began to explore the country there were mice everywhere and nothing but mice some of the black cats had followed him and not having been fed for several days they were fearfully hungry and made terrible havoc among the mice  then the queen of the mice held a council  these cats will eat every one of us she said if the captain of the ship does not shut the ferocious animals up let us send a deputation to him of the bravest among us  several mice offered themselves for this mission and set out to find the young captain  captain said they go away quickly from our island or we shall perish every mouse of us  willingly replied the young captain upon one condition that is that you shall first bring me back a bronze ring which some clever magician has stolen from me if you do not do this i will land all my cats upon your island and you shall be exterminated  the mice withdrew in great dismay what is to be done said the queen how can we find this bronze ring she held a new council calling in mice from every quarter of the globe but nobody knew where the bronze ring was suddenly three mice arrived from a very distant country one was blind the second lame and the third had her ears cropped  ho ho ho said the newcomers we come from a far distant country  do you know where the bronze ring is which the genii obey  ho ho ho we know an old sorcerer has taken possession of it and now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in his mouth by night  go and take it from him and come back as soon as possible  so the three mice made themselves a boat and set sail for the magicians country when they reached the capital they landed and ran to the palace leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of the boat then they waited till it was night the wicked old man lay down in bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth and very soon he was asleep  now what shall we do said the two little animals to each other  the mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp full of oil and a bottle full of pepper so she dipped her tail first in the oil and then in the pepper and held it to the sorcerers nose  atisha atisha sneezed the old man but he did not wake and the shock made the bronze ring jump out of his mouth quick as thought the lame mouse snatched up the precious talisman and carried it off to the boat  imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and the bronze ring was nowhere to be found  but by that time our three mice had set sail with their prize a favoring breeze was carrying them toward the island where the queen of the mice was awaiting them naturally they began to talk about the bronze ring  which of us deserves the most credit they cried all at once  i do said the blind mouse for without my watchfulness our boat would have drifted away to the open sea  no indeed cried the mouse with the cropped ears the credit is mine did i not cause the ring to jump out of the mans mouth  no it is mine cried the lame one for i ran off with the ring  and from high words they soon came to blows and alas when the quarrel was fiercest the bronze ring fell into the sea  how are we to face our queen said the three mice when by our folly we have lost the talisman and condemned our people to be utterly exterminated we cannot go back to our country let us land on this desert island and there end our miserable lives no sooner said than done the boat reached the island and the mice landed  the blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two sisters who went off to hunt flies but as she wandered sadly along the shore she found a dead fish and was eating it when she felt something very hard at her cries the other two mice ran up  it is the bronze ring it is the talisman they cried joyfully and getting into their boat again they soon reached the mouse island it was time they did for the captain was just going to land his cargo of cats when a deputation of mice brought him the precious bronze ring  bronze ring commanded the young man obey thy master let my ship appear as it was before  immediately the genii of the ring set to work and the old black vessel became once more the wonderful golden ship with sails of brocade the handsome sailors ran to the silver masts and the silken ropes and very soon they set sail for the capital  ah how merrily the sailors sang as they flew over the glassy sea  at last the port was reached  the captain landed and ran to the palace where he found the wicked old man asleep the princess clasped her husband in a long embrace the magician tried to escape but he was seized and bound with strong cords  the next day the sorcerer tied to the tail of a savage mule loaded with nuts was broken into as many pieces as there were nuts upon the mules back1   1 traditions populaires de lasie mineure carnoy et nicolaides paris maisonneuve 1889     prince hyacinth and the dear little princess   once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess but she could not marry anyone because she was under an enchantment so the king set out to seek a fairy and asked what he could do to win the princesss love the fairy said to him  you know that the princess has a great cat which she is very fond of whoever is clever enough to tread on that cats tail is the man she is destined to marry  the king said to himself that this would not be very difficult and he left the fairy determined to grind the cats tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all  you may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the princess and puss as usual marched in before him arching his back the king took a long step and quite thought he had the tail under his foot but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air and so it went on for eight days till the king began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilverit was never still for a moment  at last however he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out so the king without losing a moment set his foot upon it heavily  with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man who fixing his angry eyes upon the king said  you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment but i will have my revenge you shall have a son who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you you shall vanish away instantly and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again  though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter he could not help laughing at this threat  if my son has such a long nose as that he said to himself he must always see it or feel it at least if he is not blind or without hands  but as the enchanter had vanished he did not waste any more time in thinking but went to seek the princess who very soon consented to marry him but after all they had not been married very long when the king died and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son who was called hyacinth the little prince had large blue eyes the prettiest eyes in the world and a sweet little mouth but alas his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face the queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked that it was a roman nose and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose the queen who was devoted to her baby was pleased with what they told her and when she looked at hyacinth again his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large  the prince was brought up with great care and as soon as he could speak they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses no one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own and the courtiers to get into favor with the queen took to pulling their babies noses several times every day to make them grow long but do what they would they were nothing by comparison with the princes  when he grew sensible he learned history and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses  his room was hung with pictures all of people with very large noses and the prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter  when his twentieth birthday was passed the queen thought it was time that he should be married so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see and among the others was a picture of the dear little princess  now she was the daughter of a great king and would some day possess several kingdoms herself but prince hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort he was so much struck with her beauty the princess whom he thought quite charming had however a little saucy nose which in her face was the prettiest thing possible but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think but this did not do at all before the prince who quite failed to see the joke and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the dear little princesss tiny nose  the others taking warning from this learned to think twice before they spoke and one even went so far as to tell the prince that though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose still a womans beauty was a different thing and he knew a learned man who understood greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful cleopatra herself had a tiptilted nose  the prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news and at once sent ambassadors to ask the dear little princess in marriage the king her father gave his consent and prince hyacinth who in his anxiety to see the princess had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when to the horror of all who stood by the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning and snatching up the dear little princess whirled her away out of their sight  the prince was left quite unconsolable and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him he mounted his horse and rode sadly away letting the animal choose his own path  so it happened that he came presently to a great plain across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house and horse and rider were terribly hungry when as the night fell the prince caught sight of a light which seemed to shine from a cavern  he rode up to it and saw a little old woman who appeared to be at least a hundred years old  she put on her spectacles to look at prince hyacinth but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short  the prince and the fairy for that was who she was had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter and cried at the same moment oh what a funny nose  not so funny as your own said prince hyacinth to the fairy but madam i beg you to leave the consideration of our nosessuch as they areand to be good enough to give me something to eat for i am starving and so is my poor horse  with all my heart said the fairy though your nose is so ridiculous you are nevertheless the son of my best friend i loved your father as if he had been my brother now he had a very handsome nose  and pray what does mine lack said the prince  oh it doesnt lack anything replied the fairy on the contrary quite there is only too much of it but never mind one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long i was telling you that i was your fathers friend he often came to see me in the old times and you must know that i was very pretty in those days at least he used to say so i should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time i ever saw him  indeed said the prince when i have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it but consider madam i beg of you that i have had nothing to eat today  the poor boy is right said the fairy i was forgetting come in then and i will give you some supper and while you are eating i can tell you my story in a very few wordsfor i dont like endless tales myself too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose and i remember when i was young that i was so much admired for not being a great chatterer they used to tell the queen my mother that it was so for though you see what i am now i was the daughter of a great king my father  your father i dare say got something to eat when he was hungry interrupted the prince  oh certainly answered the fairy and you also shall have supper directly i only just wanted to tell you  but i really cannot listen to anything until i have had something to eat cried the prince who was getting quite angry but then remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the fairys help he added  i know that in the pleasure of listening to you i should quite forget my own hunger but my horse who cannot hear you must really be fed  the fairy was very much flattered by this compliment and said calling to her servants  you shall not wait another minute you are so polite and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable  plague take the old lady how she does go on about my nose said the prince to himself one would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks if i were not so hungry i would soon have done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little how stupid people are not to see their own faults that comes of being a princess she has been spoiled by flatterers who have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker  meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table and the prince was much amused to hear the fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak especially he noticed one maid who no matter what was being said always contrived to praise her mistresss wisdom  well he thought as he ate his supper im very glad i came here this just shows me how sensible i have been in never listening to flatterers people of that sort praise us to our faces without shame and hide our faults or change them into virtues for my part i never will be taken in by them i know my own defects i hope  poor prince hyacinth he really believed what he said and hadnt an idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him just as the fairys maid was laughing at her for the prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could do so without the fairys noticing her  however he said nothing and presently when his hunger began to be appeased the fairy said  my dear prince might i beg you to move a little more that way for your nose casts such a shadow that i really cannot see what i have on my plate ah thanks now let us speak of your father when i went to his court he was only a little boy but that is forty years ago and i have been in this desolate place ever since tell me what goes on nowadays are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever in my time one saw them at parties theatres balls and promenades every day dear me what a long nose you have i cannot get used to it  really madam said the prince i wish you would leave off mentioning my nose it cannot matter to you what it is like i am quite satisfied with it and have no wish to have it shorter one must take what is given one  now you are angry with me my poor hyacinth said the fairy and i assure you that i didnt mean to vex you on the contrary i wished to do you a service however though i really cannot help your nose being a shock to me i will try not to say anything about it i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose to tell the truth it would make three reasonable ones  the prince who was no longer hungry grew so impatient at the fairys continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away but wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad for they all talked of his nose and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome  the old fairy who wished to make him happy at last hit upon a plan she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess who on her part stretched out her hand that he might kiss it but turn which way he might he never could raise it to his lips for his long nose always prevented it for the first time he realized how long it really was and exclaimed  well it must be admitted that my nose is too long  in an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters and the old fairy taking the dear little princess by the hand said to the prince  now say if you are not very much obliged to me much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose you would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it hadnt hindered you from doing what you wanted to you see how selflove keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body our reason tries in vain to show them to us we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests  prince hyacinth whose nose was now just like anyones else did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received he married the dear little princess and they lived happily ever after1   1 le prince desir et la princesse mignonne par madame leprince de beaumont     east of the sun and west of the moon   once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who had many children and little to give them in the way either of food or clothing they were all pretty but the prettiest of all was the youngest daughter who was so beautiful that there were no bounds to her beauty  so onceit was late on a thursday evening in autumn and wild weather outside terribly dark and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that the walls of the cottage shook againthey were all sitting together by the fireside each of them busy with something or other when suddenly some one rapped three times against the windowpane the man went out to see what could be the matter and when he got out there stood a great big white bear  goodevening to you said the white bear  goodevening said the man  will you give me your youngest daughter said the white bear if you will you shall be as rich as you are now poor  truly the man would have had no objection to be rich but he thought to himself i must first ask my daughter about this so he went in and told them that there was a great white bear outside who had faithfully promised to make them all rich if he might but have the youngest daughter  she said no and would not hear of it so the man went out again and settled with the white bear that he should come again next thursday evening and get her answer then the man persuaded her and talked so much to her about the wealth that they would have and what a good thing it would be for herself that at last she made up her mind to go and washed and mended all her rags made herself as smart as she could and held herself in readiness to set out little enough had she to take away with her  next thursday evening the white bear came to fetch her she seated herself on his back with her bundle and thus they departed when they had gone a great part of the way the white bear said are you afraid  no that i am not said she  keep tight hold of my fur and then there is no danger said he  and thus she rode far far away until they came to a great mountain then the white bear knocked on it and a door opened and they went into a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone with gold and silver likewise a large hall in which there was a wellspread table and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to make anyone understand how splendid it was the white bear gave her a silver bell and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell and what she wanted would appear so after she had eaten and night was drawing near she grew sleepy after her journey and thought she would like to go to bed she rang the bell and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in it had pillows of silk and curtains of silk fringed with gold and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver but when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down beside her and behold it was the white bear who cast off the form of a beast during the night she never saw him however for he always came after she had put out her light and went away before daylight appeared  so all went well and happily for a time but then she began to be very sad and sorrowful for all day long she had to go about alone and she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and sisters then the white bear asked what it was that she wanted and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain and that she had to go about all alone and that in her parents house at home there were all her brothers and sisters and it was because she could not go to them that she was so sorrowful  there might be a cure for that said the white bear if you would but promise me never to talk with your mother alone but only when the others are there too for she will take hold of your hand he said and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone but that you must by no means do or you will bring great misery on both of us  so one sunday the white bear came and said that they could now set out to see her father and mother and they journeyed thither she sitting on his back and they went a long long way and it took a long long time but at last they came to a large white farmhouse and her brothers and sisters were running about outside it playing and it was so pretty that it was a pleasure to look at it  your parents dwell here now said the white bear but do not forget what i said to you or you will do much harm both to yourself and me  no indeed said she i shall never forget and as soon as she was at home the white bear turned round and went back again  there were such rejoicings when she went in to her parents that it seemed as if they would never come to an end everyone thought that he could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for them all now they had everything that they wanted and everything was as good as it could be they all asked her how she was getting on where she was all was well with her too she said and she had everything that she could want what other answers she gave i cannot say but i am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her but in the afternoon after they had dined at midday all happened just as the white bear had said her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber but she remembered what the white bear had said and would on no account go what we have to say can be said at any time she answered but somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her and she was forced to tell the whole story so she told how every night a man came and lay down beside her when the lights were all put out and how she never saw him because he always went away before it grew light in the morning and how she continually went about in sadness thinking how happy she would be if she could but see him and how all day long she had to go about alone and it was so dull and solitary oh cried the mother in horror you are very likely sleeping with a troll but i will teach you a way to see him you shall have a bit of one of my candles which you can take away with you hidden in your breast look at him with that when he is asleep but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him  so she took the candle and hid it in her breast and when evening drew near the white bear came to fetch her away when they had gone some distance on their way the white bear asked her if everything had not happened just as he had foretold and she could not but own that it had then if you have done what your mother wished said he you have brought great misery on both of us no she said i have not done anything at all so when she had reached home and had gone to bed it was just the same as it had been before and a man came and lay down beside her and late at night when she could hear that he was sleeping she got up and kindled a light lit her candle let her light shine on him and saw him and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever beheld and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must die if she did not kiss him that very moment so she did kiss him but while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon his shirt and he awoke what have you done now said he you have brought misery on both of us if you had but held out for the space of one year i should have been free i have a stepmother who has bewitched me so that i am a white bear by day and a man by night but now all is at an end between you and me and i must leave you and go to her she lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon and there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long and she now is the one whom i must marry  she wept and lamented but all in vain for go he must then she asked him if she could not go with him but no that could not be can you tell me the way then and i will seek youthat i may surely be allowed to do  yes you may do that said he but there is no way thither it lies east of the sun and west of the moon and never would you find your way there  when she awoke in the morning both the prince and the castle were gone and she was lying on a small green patch in the midst of a dark thick wood by her side lay the selfsame bundle of rags which she had brought with her from her own home so when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and wept till she was weary she set out on her way and thus she walked for many and many a long day until at last she came to a great mountain outside it an aged woman was sitting playing with a golden apple the girl asked her if she knew the way to the prince who lived with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three ells long how do you happen to know about him inquired the old woman maybe you are she who ought to have had him yes indeed i am she said so it is you then said the old woman i know nothing about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and west of the moon you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get to it at all but you shall have the loan of my horse and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine perhaps she can tell you about him when you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again but you may take the golden apple with you  so the girl seated herself on the horse and rode for a long long way and at last she came to the mountain where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold cardingcomb the girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but she said what the first old woman had said i know nothing about it but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon and that you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get there at all but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me perhaps she may know where the castle is and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again then she gave her the gold cardingcomb for it might perhaps be of use to her she said  so the girl seated herself on the horse and rode a wearisome long way onward again and after a very long time she came to a great mountain where an aged woman was sitting spinning at a golden spinningwheel of this woman too she inquired if she knew the way to the prince and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but it was only the same thing once again maybe it was you who should have had the prince said the old woman yes indeed i should have been the one said the girl but this old crone knew the way no better than the othersit was east of the sun and west of the moon she knew that and you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get to it at all she said but you may have the loan of my horse and i think you had better ride to the east wind and ask him perhaps he may know where the castle is and will blow you thither but when you have got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and he will come home again and then she gave her the golden spinningwheel saying perhaps you may find that you have a use for it  the girl had to ride for a great many days and for a long and wearisome time before she got there but at last she did arrive and then she asked the east wind if he could tell her the way to the prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon well said the east wind i have heard tell of the prince and of his castle but i do not know the way to it for i have never blown so far but if you like i will go with you to my brother the west wind he may know that for he is much stronger than i am you may sit on my back and then i can carry you there so she seated herself on his back and they did go so swiftly when they got there the east wind went in and said that the girl whom he had brought was the one who ought to have had the prince up at the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon and that now she was traveling about to find him again so he had come there with her and would like to hear if the west wind knew whereabout the castle was no said the west wind so far as that have i never blown but if you like i will go with you to the south wind for he is much stronger than either of us and he has roamed far and wide and perhaps he can tell you what you want to know you may seat yourself on my back and then i will carry you to him  so she did this and journeyed to the south wind neither was she very long on the way when they had got there the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon for she was the girl who ought to marry the prince who lived there oh indeed said the south wind is that she well said he i have wandered about a great deal in my time and in all kinds of places but i have never blown so far as that if you like however i will go with you to my brother the north wind he is the oldest and strongest of all of us and if he does not know where it is no one in the whole world will be able to tell you you may sit upon my back and then i will carry you there so she seated herself on his back and off he went from his house in great haste and they were not long on the way when they came near the north winds dwelling he was so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before they got there what do you want he roared out from afar and they froze as they heard said the south wind it is i and this is she who should have had the prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon and now she wishes to ask you if you have ever been there and can tell her the way for she would gladly find him again  yes said the north wind i know where it is i once blew an aspen leaf there but i was so tired that for many days afterward i was not able to blow at all however if you really are anxious to go there and are not afraid to go with me i will take you on my back and try if i can blow you there  get there i must said she and if there is any way of going i will and i have no fear no matter how fast you go  very well then said the north wind but you must sleep here tonight for if we are ever to get there we must have the day before us  the north wind woke her betimes next morning and puffed himself up and made himself so big and so strong that it was frightful to see him and away they went high up through the air as if they would not stop until they had reached the very end of the world down below there was such a storm it blew down woods and houses and when they were above the sea the ships were wrecked by hundreds and thus they tore on and on and a long time went by and then yet more time passed and still they were above the sea and the north wind grew tired and more tired and at last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer and he sank and sank lower and lower until at last he went so low that the waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying art thou afraid said the north wind i have no fear said she and it was true but they were not very very far from land and there was just enough strength left in the north wind to enable him to throw her on to the shore immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but then he was so weary and worn out that he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own home again  next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with the golden apple and the first person she saw was the maiden with the long nose who was to have the prince how much do you want for that gold apple of yours girl said she opening the window it cant be bought either for gold or money answered the girl if it cannot be bought either for gold or money what will buy it you may say what you please said the princess  well if i may go to the prince who is here and be with him tonight you shall have it said the girl who had come with the north wind you may do that said the princess for she had made up her mind what she would do so the princess got the golden apple but when the girl went up to the princes apartment that night he was asleep for the princess had so contrived it the poor girl called to him and shook him and between whiles she wept but she could not wake him in the morning as soon as day dawned in came the princess with the long nose and drove her out again in the daytime she sat down once more beneath the windows of the castle and began to card with her golden cardingcomb and then all happened as it had happened before the princess asked her what she wanted for it and she replied that it was not for sale either for gold or money but that if she could get leave to go to the prince and be with him during the night she should have it but when she went up to the princes room he was again asleep and let her call him or shake him or weep as she would he still slept on and she could not put any life in him when daylight came in the morning the princess with the long nose came too and once more drove her away when day had quite come the girl seated herself under the castle windows to spin with her golden spinningwheel and the princess with the long nose wanted to have that also so she opened the window and asked what she would take for it the girl said what she had said on each of the former occasionsthat it was not for sale either for gold or for money but if she could get leave to go to the prince who lived there and be with him during the night she should have it  yes said the princess i will gladly consent to that  but in that place there were some christian folk who had been carried off and they had been sitting in the chamber which was next to that of the prince and had heard how a woman had been in there who had wept and called on him two nights running and they told the prince of this so that evening when the princess came once more with her sleepingdrink he pretended to drink but threw it away behind him for he suspected that it was a sleepingdrink so when the girl went into the princes room this time he was awake and she had to tell him how she had come there you have come just in time said the prince for i should have been married tomorrow but i will not have the longnosed princess and you alone can save me i will say that i want to see what my bride can do and bid her wash the shirt which has the three drops of tallow on it this she will consent to do for she does not know that it is you who let them fall on it but no one can wash them out but one born of christian folk it cannot be done by one of a pack of trolls and then i will say that no one shall ever be my bride but the woman who can do this and i know that you can there was great joy and gladness between them all that night but the next day when the wedding was to take place the prince said i must see what my bride can do that you may do said the stepmother  i have a fine shirt which i want to wear as my wedding shirt but three drops of tallow have got upon it which i want to have washed off and i have vowed to marry no one but the woman who is able to do it if she cannot do that she is not worth having  well that was a very small matter they thought and agreed to do it the princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could but the more she washed and rubbed the larger the spots grew ah you cant wash at all said the old trollhag who was her mother give it to me but she too had not had the shirt very long in her hands before it looked worse still and the more she washed it and rubbed it the larger and blacker grew the spots  so the other trolls had to come and wash but the more they did the blacker and uglier grew the shirt until at length it was as black as if it had been up the chimney oh cried the prince not one of you is good for anything at all there is a beggargirl sitting outside the window and ill be bound that she can wash better than any of you come in you girl there he cried so she came in can you wash this shirt clean he cried oh i dont know she said but i will try and no sooner had she taken the shirt and dipped it in the water than it was white as driven snow and even whiter than that i will marry you said the prince  then the old trollhag flew into such a rage that she burst and the princess with the long nose and all the little trolls must have burst too for they have never been heard of since the prince and his bride set free all the christian folk who were imprisoned there and took away with them all the gold and silver that they could carry and moved far away from the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon1   1 asbjornsen and moe     the yellow dwarf   once upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great many children and of them all only one daughter was left but then she was worth at least a thousand  her mother who since the death of the king her father had nothing in the world she cared for so much as this little princess was so terribly afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her and never tried to correct any of her faults the consequence was that this little person who was as pretty as possible and was one day to wear a crown grew up so proud and so much in love with her own beauty that she despised everyone else in the world  the queen her mother by her caresses and flatteries helped to make her believe that there was nothing too good for her she was dressed almost always in the prettiest frocks as a fairy or as a queen going out to hunt and the ladies of the court followed her dressed as forest fairies  and to make her more vain than ever the queen caused her portrait to be taken by the cleverest painters and sent it to several neighboring kings with whom she was very friendly  when they saw this portrait they fell in love with the princessevery one of them but upon each it had a different effect one fell ill one went quite crazy and a few of the luckiest set off to see her as soon as possible but these poor princes became her slaves the moment they set eyes on her  never has there been a gayer court twenty delightful kings did everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable and after having spent ever so much money in giving a single entertainment thought themselves very lucky if the princess said thats pretty  all this admiration vastly pleased the queen not a day passed but she received seven or eight thousand sonnets and as many elegies madrigals and songs which were sent her by all the poets in the world all the prose and the poetry that was written just then was about bellissimafor that was the princesss nameand all the bonfires that they had were made of these verses which crackled and sparkled better than any other sort of wood  bellissima was already fifteen years old and every one of the princes wished to marry her but not one dared to say so how could they when they knew that any of them might have cut off his head five or six times a day just to please her and she would have thought it a mere trifle so little did she care you may imagine how hardhearted her lovers thought her and the queen who wished to see her married did not know how to persuade her to think of it seriously  bellissima she said i do wish you would not be so proud what makes you despise all these nice kings i wish you to marry one of them and you do not try to please me  i am so happy bellissima answered do leave me in peace madam i dont want to care for anyone  but you would be very happy with any of these princes said the queen and i shall be very angry if you fall in love with anyone who is not worthy of you  but the princess thought so much of herself that she did not consider any one of her lovers clever or handsome enough for her and her mother who was getting really angry at her determination not to be married began to wish that she had not allowed her to have her own way so much  at last not knowing what else to do she resolved to consult a certain witch who was called the fairy of the desert now this was very difficult to do as she was guarded by some terrible lions but happily the queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of millet flour sugarcandy and crocodiles eggs this cake she prepared with her own hands and putting it in a little basket she set out to seek the fairy but as she was not used to walking far she soon felt very tired and sat down at the foot of a tree to rest and presently fell fast asleep when she awoke she was dismayed to find her basket empty the cake was all gone and to make matters worse at that moment she heard the roaring of the great lions who had found out that she was near and were coming to look for her  what shall i do she cried i shall be eaten up and being too frightened to run a single step she began to cry and leaned against the tree under which she had been asleep  just then she heard some one say hm hm  she looked all round her and then up the tree and there she saw a little tiny man who was eating oranges  oh queen said he i know you very well and i know how much afraid you are of the lions and you are quite right too for they have eaten many other people and what can you expect as you have not any cake to give them  i must make up my mind to die said the poor queen alas i should not care so much if only my dear daughter were married  oh you have a daughter cried the yellow dwarf who was so called because he was a dwarf and had such a yellow face and lived in the orange tree im really glad to hear that for ive been looking for a wife all over the world now if you will promise that she shall marry me not one of the lions tigers or bears shall touch you  the queen looked at him and was almost as much afraid of his ugly little face as she had been of the lions before so that she could not speak a word  what you hesitate madam cried the dwarf you must be very fond of being eaten up alive  and as he spoke the queen saw the lions which were running down a hill toward them  each one had two heads eight feet and four rows of teeth and their skins were as hard as turtle shells and were bright red  at this dreadful sight the poor queen who was trembling like a dove when it sees a hawk cried out as loud as she could oh dear mr dwarf bellissima shall marry you  oh indeed said he disdainfully bellissima is pretty enough but i dont particularly want to marry heryou can keep her  oh noble sir said the queen in great distress do not refuse her she is the most charming princess in the world  oh well he replied out of charity i will take her but be sure and dont forget that she is mine  as he spoke a little door opened in the trunk of the orange tree in rushed the queen only just in time and the door shut with a bang in the faces of the lions  the queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another little door in the orange tree but presently it opened and she found herself in a field of thistles and nettles it was encircled by a muddy ditch and a little further on was a tiny thatched cottage out of which came the yellow dwarf with a very jaunty air he wore wooden shoes and a little yellow coat and as he had no hair and very long ears he looked altogether a shocking little object  i am delighted said he to the queen that as you are to be my motherinlaw you should see the little house in which your bellissima will live with me with these thistles and nettles she can feed a donkey which she can ride whenever she likes under this humble roof no weather can hurt her she will drink the water of this brook and eat frogswhich grow very fat about here and then she will have me always with her handsome agreeable and gay as you see me now for if her shadow stays by her more closely than i do i shall be surprised  the unhappy queen seeing all at once what a miserable life her daughter would have with this dwarf could not bear the idea and fell down insensible without saying a word  when she revived she found to her great surprise that she was lying in her own bed at home and what was more that she had on the loveliest lace night cap that she had ever seen in her life at first she thought that all her adventures the terrible lions and her promise to the yellow dwarf that he should marry bellissima must have been a dream but there was the new cap with its beautiful ribbon and lace to remind her that it was all true which made her so unhappy that she could neither eat drink nor sleep for thinking of it  the princess who in spite of her wilfulness really loved her mother with all her heart was much grieved when she saw her looking so sad and often asked her what was the matter but the queen who didnt want her to find out the truth only said that she was ill or that one of her neighbors was threatening to make war against her bellissima knew quite well that something was being hidden from herand that neither of these was the real reason of the queens uneasiness so she made up her mind that she would go and consult the fairy of the desert about it especially as she had often heard how wise she was and she thought that at the same time she might ask her advice as to whether it would be as well to be married or not  so with great care she made some of the proper cake to pacify the lions and one night went up to her room very early pretending that she was going to bed but instead of that she wrapped herself in a long white veil and went down a secret staircase and set off all by herself to find the witch  but when she got as far as the same fatal orange tree and saw it covered with flowers and fruit she stopped and began to gather some of the orangesand then putting down her basket she sat down to eat them but when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared and though she looked everywhere not a trace of it could she find the more she hunted for it the more frightened she got and at last she began to cry then all at once she saw before her the yellow dwarf  whats the matter with you my pretty one said he what are you crying about  alas she answered no wonder that i am crying seeing that i have lost the basket of cake that was to help me to get safely to the cave of the fairy of the desert  and what do you want with her pretty one said the little monster for i am a friend of hers and for the matter of that i am quite as clever as she is  the queen my mother replied the princess has lately fallen into such deep sadness that i fear that she will die and i am afraid that perhaps i am the cause of it for she very much wishes me to be married and i must tell you truly that as yet i have not found anyone i consider worthy to be my husband so for all these reasons i wished to talk to the fairy  do not give yourself any further trouble princess answered the dwarf i can tell you all you want to know better than she could the queen your mother has promised you in marriage  has promised me interrupted the princess oh no im sure she has not she would have told me if she had i am too much interested in the matter for her to promise anything without my consentyou must be mistaken  beautiful princess cried the dwarf suddenly throwing himself on his knees before her i flatter myself that you will not be displeased at her choice when i tell you that it is to me she has promised the happiness of marrying you  you cried bellissima starting back my mother wishes me to marry you how can you be so silly as to think of such a thing  oh it isnt that i care much to have that honor cried the dwarf angrily but here are the lions coming theyll eat you up in three mouthfuls and there will be an end of you and your pride  and indeed at that moment the poor princess heard their dreadful howls coming nearer and nearer  what shall i do she cried must all my happy days come to an end like this  the malicious dwarf looked at her and began to laugh spitefully at least said he you have the satisfaction of dying unmarried a lovely princess like you must surely prefer to die rather than be the wife of a poor little dwarf like myself  oh dont be angry with me cried the princess clasping her hands id rather marry all the dwarfs in the world than die in this horrible way  look at me well princess before you give me your word said he i dont want you to promise me in a hurry  oh cried she the lions are coming i have looked at you enough i am so frightened save me this minute or i shall die of terror  indeed as she spoke she fell down insensible and when she recovered she found herself in her own little bed at home how she got there she could not tell but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons and on her finger was a little ring made of a single red hair which fitted so tightly that try as she might she could not get it off  when the princess saw all these things and remembered what had happened she too fell into the deepest sadness which surprised and alarmed the whole court and the queen more than anyone else a hundred times she asked bellissima if anything was the matter with her but she always said that there was nothing  at last the chief men of the kingdom anxious to see their princess married sent to the queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as soon as possible she replied that nothing would please her better but that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry and she recommended them to go and talk to the princess about it themselves so this they at once did now bellissima was much less proud since her adventure with the yellow dwarf and she could not think of a better way of getting rid of the little monster than to marry some powerful king therefore she replied to their request much more favorably than they had hoped saying that though she was very happy as she was still to please them she would consent to marry the king of the gold mines now he was a very handsome and powerful prince who had been in love with the princess for years but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all you can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of marrying the princess but after all bellissima could not have married twenty kingsindeed she had found it quite difficult enough to choose one for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world who was worthy of her  preparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever been held at the palace the king of the gold mines sent such immense sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought it messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined courts particularly to the court of france to seek out everything rare and precious to adorn the princess although her beauty was so perfect that nothing she wore could make her look prettier at least that is what the king of the gold mines thought and he was never happy unless he was with her  as for the princess the more she saw of the king the more she liked him he was so generous so handsome and clever that at last she was almost as much in love with him as he was with her how happy they were as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together sometimes listening to sweet music and the king used to write songs for bellissima this is one that she liked very much    in the forest all is gay   when my princess walks that way   all the blossoms then are found   downward fluttering to the ground   hoping she may tread on them   and bright flowers on slender stem   gaze up at her as she passes   brushing lightly through the grasses   oh my princess birds above   echo back our songs of love   as through this enchanted land   blithe we wander hand in hand   they really were as happy as the day was long all the kings unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair they said goodby to the princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them  ah madam the king of the gold mines said to her how is this why do you waste your pity on these princes who love you so much that all their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you  i should be sorry answered bellissima if you had not noticed how much i pitied these princes who were leaving me for ever but for you sire it is very different you have every reason to be pleased with me but they are going sorrowfully away so you must not grudge them my compassion  the king of the gold mines was quite overcome by the princesss goodnatured way of taking his interference and throwing himself at her feet he kissed her hand a thousand times and begged her to forgive him  at last the happy day came everything was ready for bellissimas wedding the trumpets sounded all the streets of the town were hung with flags and strewn with flowers and the people ran in crowds to the great square before the palace the queen was so overjoyed that she had hardly been able to sleep at all and she got up before it was light to give the necessary orders and to choose the jewels that the princess was to wear these were nothing less than diamonds even to her shoes which were covered with them and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered with a dozen of the suns rays you may imagine how much these had cost but then nothing could have been more brilliant except the beauty of the princess upon her head she wore a splendid crown her lovely hair waved nearly to her feet and her stately figure could easily be distinguished among all the ladies who attended her  the king of the gold mines was not less noble and splendid it was easy to see by his face how happy he was and everyone who went near him returned loaded with presents for all round the great banqueting hall had been arranged a thousand barrels full of gold and numberless bags made of velvet embroidered with pearls and filled with money each one containing at least a hundred thousand gold pieces which were given away to everyone who liked to hold out his hand which numbers of people hastened to do you may be sureindeed some found this by far the most amusing part of the wedding festivities  the queen and the princess were just ready to set out with the king when they saw advancing toward them from the end of the long gallery two great basilisks dragging after them a very badly made box behind them came a tall old woman whose ugliness was even more surprising than her extreme old age she wore a ruff of black taffeta a red velvet hood and a farthingale all in rags and she leaned heavily upon a crutch this strange old woman without saying a single word hobbled three times round the gallery followed by the basilisks then stopping in the middle and brandishing her crutch threateningly she cried  ho ho queen ho ho princess do you think you are going to break with impunity the promise that you made to my friend the yellow dwarf i am the fairy of the desert without the yellow dwarf and his orange tree my great lions would soon have eaten you up i can tell you and in fairyland we do not suffer ourselves to be insulted like this make up your minds at once what you will do for i vow that you shall marry the yellow dwarf if you dont may i burn my crutch  ah princess said the queen weeping what is this that i hear what have you promised  ah my mother replied bellissima sadly what did you promise yourself  the king of the gold mines indignant at being kept from his happiness by this wicked old woman went up to her and threatening her with his sword said  get away out of my country at once and for ever miserable creature lest i take your life and so rid myself of your malice  he had hardly spoken these words when the lid of the box fell back on the floor with a terrible noise and to their horror out sprang the yellow dwarf mounted upon a great spanish cat rash youth he cried rushing between the fairy of the desert and the king dare to lay a finger upon this illustrious fairy your quarrel is with me only i am your enemy and your rival that faithless princess who would have married you is promised to me see if she has not upon her finger a ring made of one of my hairs just try to take it off and you will soon find out that i am more powerful than you are  wretched little monster said the king do you dare to call yourself the princesss lover and to lay claim to such a treasure do you know that you are a dwarfthat you are so ugly that one cannot bear to look at youand that i should have killed you myself long before this if you had been worthy of such a glorious death  the yellow dwarf deeply enraged at these words set spurs to his cat which yelled horribly and leaped hither and thitherterrifying everybody except the brave king who pursued the dwarf closely till he drawing a great knife with which he was armed challenged the king to meet him in single combat and rushed down into the courtyard of the palace with a terrible clatter the king quite provoked followed him hastily but they had hardly taken their places facing one another and the whole court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to watch what was going on when suddenly the sun became as red as blood and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all the thunder crashed and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything the two basilisks appeared one on each side of the bad dwarf like giants mountains high and fire flew from their mouths and ears until they looked like flaming furnaces none of these things could terrify the noble young king and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured those who were looking on and perhaps even embarrassed the yellow dwarf himself but even his courage gave way when he saw what was happening to his beloved princess for the fairy of the desert looking more terrible than before mounted upon a winged griffin and with long snakes coiled round her neck had given her such a blow with the lance she carried that bellissima fell into the queens arms bleeding and senseless her fond mother feeling as much hurt by the blow as the princess herself uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that the king hearing them entirely lost his courage and presence of mind giving up the combat he flew toward the princess to rescue or to die with her but the yellow dwarf was too quick for him leaping with his spanish cat upon the balcony he snatched bellissima from the queens arms and before any of the ladies of the court could stop him he had sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize  the king motionless with horror looked on despairingly at this dreadful occurrence which he was quite powerless to prevent and to make matters worse his sight failed him everything became dark and he felt himself carried along through the air by a strong hand  this new misfortune was the work of the wicked fairy of the desert who had come with the yellow dwarf to help him carry off the princess and had fallen in love with the handsome young king of the gold mines directly she saw him she thought that if she carried him off to some frightful cavern and chained him to a rock then the fear of death would make him forget bellissima and become her slave so as soon as they reached the place she gave him back his sight but without releasing him from his chains and by her magic power she appeared before him as a young and beautiful fairy and pretended to have come there quite by chance  what do i see she cried is it you dear prince what misfortune has brought you to this dismal place  the king who was quite deceived by her altered appearance replied  alas beautiful fairy the fairy who brought me here first took away my sight but by her voice i recognized her as the fairy of the desert though what she should have carried me off for i cannot tell you  ah cried the pretended fairy if you have fallen into her hands you wont get away until you have married her she has carried off more than one prince like this and she will certainly have anything she takes a fancy to while she was thus pretending to be sorry for the king he suddenly noticed her feet which were like those of a griffin and knew in a moment that this must be the fairy of the desert for her feet were the one thing she could not change however pretty she might make her face  without seeming to have noticed anything he said in a confidential way  not that i have any dislike to the fairy of the desert but i really cannot endure the way in which she protects the yellow dwarf and keeps me chained here like a criminal it is true that i love a charming princess but if the fairy should set me free my gratitude would oblige me to love her only  do you really mean what you say prince said the fairy quite deceived  surely replied the prince how could i deceive you you see it is so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by a simple princess but even if i am dying of love for her i shall pretend to hate her until i am set free  the fairy of the desert quite taken in by these words resolved at once to transport the prince to a pleasanter place so making him mount her chariot to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which generally drew it away she flew with him but imagine the distress of the prince when from the giddy height at which they were rushing through the air he saw his beloved princess in a castle built of polished steel the walls of which reflected the suns rays so hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook leaning her head upon her hand and weeping bitterly but just as they passed she looked up and saw the king and the fairy of the desert now the fairy was so clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the king but even the poor princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen  what she cried was i not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to which that frightful yellow dwarf brought me must i also be made to know that the king of the gold mines ceased to love me as soon as he lost sight of me but who can my rival be whose fatal beauty is greater than mine  while she was saying this the king who really loved her as much as ever was feeling terribly sad at being so rapidly torn away from his beloved princess but he knew too well how powerful the fairy was to have any hope of escaping from her except by great patience and cunning  the fairy of the desert had also seen bellissima and she tried to read in the kings eyes the effect that this unexpected sight had had upon him  no one can tell you what you wish to know better than i can said he this chance meeting with an unhappy princess for whom i once had a passing fancy before i was lucky enough to meet you has affected me a little i admit but you are so much more to me than she is that i would rather die than leave you  ah prince she said can i believe that you really love me so much  time will show madam replied the king but if you wish to convince me that you have some regard for me do not i beg of you refuse to aid bellissima  do you know what you are asking said the fairy of the desert frowning and looking at him suspiciously do you want me to employ my art against the yellow dwarf who is my best friend and take away from him a proud princess whom i can but look upon as my rival  the king sighed but made no answerindeed what was there to be said to such a clearsighted person at last they reached a vast meadow gay with all sorts of flowers a deep river surrounded it and many little brooks murmured softly under the shady trees where it was always cool and fresh a little way off stood a splendid palace the walls of which were of transparent emeralds as soon as the swans which drew the fairys chariot had alighted under a porch which was paved with diamonds and had arches of rubies they were greeted on all sides by thousands of beautiful beings who came to meet them joyfully singing these words    when love within a heart would reign        useless to strive against him tis   the proud but feel a sharper pain        and make a greater triumph his   the fairy of the desert was delighted to hear them sing of her triumphs she led the king into the most splendid room that can be imagined and left him alone for a little while just that he might not feel that he was a prisoner but he felt sure that she had not really gone quite away but was watching him from some hidingplace so walking up to a great mirror he said to it trusty counsellor let me see what i can do to make myself agreeable to the charming fairy of the desert for i can think of nothing but how to please her  and he at once set to work to curl his hair and seeing upon a table a grander coat than his own he put it on carefully the fairy came back so delighted that she could not conceal her joy  i am quite aware of the trouble you have taken to please me said she and i must tell you that you have succeeded perfectly already you see it is not difficult to do if you really care for me  the king who had his own reasons for wishing to keep the old fairy in a good humor did not spare pretty speeches and after a time he was allowed to walk by himself upon the seashore the fairy of the desert had by her enchantments raised such a terrible storm that the boldest pilot would not venture out in it so she was not afraid of her prisoners being able to escape and he found it some relief to think sadly over his terrible situation without being interrupted by his cruel captor  presently after walking wildly up and down he wrote these verses upon the sand with his stick       at last may i upon this shore        lighten my sorrow with soft tears      alas alas i see no more        my love who yet my sadness cheers       and thou o raging stormy sea        stirred by wild winds from depth to height      thou holdst my loved one far from me        and i am captive to thy might       my heart is still more wild than thine        for fate is cruel unto me      why must i thus in exile pine        why is my princess snatched from me       o lovely nymphs from ocean caves        who know how sweet true love may be      come up and calm the furious waves        and set a desperate lover free   while he was still writing he heard a voice which attracted his attention in spite of himself seeing that the waves were rolling in higher than ever he looked all round and presently saw a lovely lady floating gently toward him upon the crest of a huge billow her long hair spread all about her in one hand she held a mirror and in the other a comb and instead of feet she had a beautiful tail like a fish with which she swam  the king was struck dumb with astonishment at this unexpected sight but as soon as she came within speaking distance she said to him i know how sad you are at losing your princess and being kept a prisoner by the fairy of the desert if you like i will help you to escape from this fatal place where you may otherwise have to drag on a weary existence for thirty years or more  the king of the gold mines hardly knew what answer to make to this proposal not because he did not wish very much to escape but he was afraid that this might be only another device by which the fairy of the desert was trying to deceive him as he hesitated the mermaid who guessed his thoughts said to him  you may trust me i am not trying to entrap you i am so angry with the yellow dwarf and the fairy of the desert that i am not likely to wish to help them especially since i constantly see your poor princess whose beauty and goodness make me pity her so much and i tell you that if you will have confidence in me i will help you to escape  i trust you absolutely cried the king and i will do whatever you tell me but if you have seen my princess i beg of you to tell me how she is and what is happening to her  we must not waste time in talking said she come with me and i will carry you to the castle of steel and we will leave upon this shore a figure so like you that even the fairy herself will be deceived by it  so saying she quickly collected a bundle of seaweed and blowing it three times she said  my friendly seaweeds i order you to stay here stretched upon the sand until the fairy of the desert comes to take you away and at once the seaweeds became like the king who stood looking at them in great astonishment for they were even dressed in a coat like his but they lay there pale and still as the king himself might have lain if one of the great waves had overtaken him and thrown him senseless upon the shore and then the mermaid caught up the king and away they swam joyfully together  now said she i have time to tell you about the princess in spite of the blow which the fairy of the desert gave her the yellow dwarf compelled her to mount behind him upon his terrible spanish cat but she soon fainted away with pain and terror and did not recover till they were within the walls of his frightful castle of steel here she was received by the prettiest girls it was possible to find who had been carried there by the yellow dwarf who hastened to wait upon her and showed her every possible attention she was laid upon a couch covered with cloth of gold embroidered with pearls as big as nuts  ah interrupted the king of the gold mines if bellissima forgets me and consents to marry him i shall break my heart  you need not be afraid of that answered the mermaid the princess thinks of no one but you and the frightful dwarf cannot persuade her to look at him  pray go on with your story said the king  what more is there to tell you replied the mermaid bellissima was sitting in the wood when you passed and saw you with the fairy of the desert who was so cleverly disguised that the princess took her to be prettier than herself you may imagine her despair for she thought that you had fallen in love with her  she believes that i love her cried the king what a fatal mistake what is to be done to undeceive her  you know best answered the mermaid smiling kindly at him when people are as much in love with one another as you two are they dont need advice from anyone else  as she spoke they reached the castle of steel the side next the sea being the only one which the yellow dwarf had left unprotected by the dreadful burning walls  i know quite well said the mermaid that the princess is sitting by the brookside just where you saw her as you passed but as you will have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her take this sword armed with it you may dare any danger and overcome the greatest difficulties only beware of one thingthat is never to let it fall from your hand farewell now i will wait by that rock and if you need my help in carrying off your beloved princess i will not fail you for the queen her mother is my best friend and it was for her sake that i went to rescue you  so saying she gave to the king a sword made from a single diamond which was more brilliant than the sun he could not find words to express his gratitude but he begged her to believe that he fully appreciated the importance of her gift and would never forget her help and kindness  we must now go back to the fairy of the desert when she found that the king did not return she hastened out to look for him and reached the shore with a hundred of the ladies of her train loaded with splendid presents for him some carried baskets full of diamonds others golden cups of wonderful workmanship and amber coral and pearls others again balanced upon their heads bales of the richest and most beautiful stuffs while the rest brought fruit and flowers and even birds but what was the horror of the fairy who followed this gay troop when she saw stretched upon the sands the image of the king which the mermaid had made with the seaweeds struck with astonishment and sorrow she uttered a terrible cry and threw herself down beside the pretended king weeping and howling and calling upon her eleven sisters who were also fairies and who came to her assistance but they were all taken in by the image of the king for clever as they were the mermaid was still cleverer and all they could do was to help the fairy of the desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave of the king of the gold mines but while they were collecting jasper and porphyry agate and marble gold and bronze statues and devices to immortalize the kings memory he was thanking the good mermaid and begging her still to help him which she graciously promised to do as she disappeared and then he set out for the castle of steel he walked fast looking anxiously round him and longing once more to see his darling bellissima but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with their sharp talons if it had not been for the mermaids diamond sword for no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell at his feet quite helpless and he killed them with one blow but he had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered with scales that were harder than iron frightful as this encounter was the kings courage was unshaken and by the aid of his wonderful sword he cut them in pieces one after the other now he hoped his difficulties were over but at the next turning he was met by one which he did not know how to overcome fourandtwenty pretty and graceful nymphs advanced toward him holding garlands of flowers with which they barred the way  where are you going prince they said it is our duty to guard this place and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you and to us we beg you not to insist upon going on do you want to kill fourandtwenty girls who have never displeased you in any way  the king did not know what to do or to say it went against all his ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do but as he hesitated a voice in his ear said  strike strike and do not spare or your princess is lost for ever  so without reply to the nymphs he rushed forward instantly breaking their garlands and scattering them in all directions and then went on without further hindrance to the little wood where he had seen bellissima she was seated by the brook looking pale and weary when he reached her and he would have thrown himself down at her feet but she drew herself away from him with as much indignation as if he had been the yellow dwarf  ah princess he cried do not be angry with me let me explain everything i am not faithless or to blame for what has happened i am a miserable wretch who has displeased you without being able to help himself  ah cried bellissima did i not see you flying through the air with the loveliest being imaginable was that against your will  indeed it was princess he answered the wicked fairy of the desert not content with chaining me to a rock carried me off in her chariot to the other end of the earth where i should even now be a captive but for the unexpected help of a friendly mermaid who brought me here to rescue you my princess from the unworthy hands that hold you do not refuse the aid of your most faithful lover so saying he threw himself at her feet and held her by her robe but alas in so doing he let fall the magic sword and the yellow dwarf who was crouching behind a lettuce no sooner saw it than he sprang out and seized it well knowing its wonderful power  the princess gave a cry of terror on seeing the dwarf but this only irritated the little monster muttering a few magical words he summoned two giants who bound the king with great chains of iron  now said the dwarf i am master of my rivals fate but i will give him his life and permission to depart unharmed if you princess will consent to marry me  let me die a thousand times rather cried the unhappy king  alas cried the princess must you die could anything be more terrible  that you should marry that little wretch would be far more terrible answered the king  at least continued she let us die together  let me have the satisfaction of dying for you my princess said he  oh no no she cried turning to the dwarf rather than that i will do as you wish  cruel princess said the king would you make my life horrible to me by marrying another before my eyes  not so replied the yellow dwarf you are a rival of whom i am too much afraid you shall not see our marriage so saying in spite of bellissimas tears and cries he stabbed the king to the heart with the diamond sword  the poor princess seeing her lover lying dead at her feet could no longer live without him she sank down by him and died of a broken heart  so ended these unfortunate lovers whom not even the mermaid could help because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword  as to the wicked dwarf he preferred to see the princess dead rather than married to the king of the gold mines and the fairy of the desert when she heard of the kings adventures pulled down the grand monument which she had built and was so angry at the trick that had been played her that she hated him as much as she had loved him before  the kind mermaid grieved at the sad fate of the lovers caused them to be changed into two tall palm trees which stand always side by side whispering together of their faithful love and caressing one another with their interlacing branches1   1 madame daulnoy     little red riding hood   once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl the prettiest creature was ever seen her mother was excessively fond of her and her grandmother doted on her still more this good woman had made for her a little red ridinghood which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her little red ridinghood  one day her mother having made some custards said to her  go my dear and see how thy grandmamma does for i hear she has been very ill carry her a custard and this little pot of butter  little red ridinghood set out immediately to go to her grandmother who lived in another village  as she was going through the wood she met with gaffer wolf who had a very great mind to eat her up but he dared not because of some faggotmakers hard by in the forest he asked her whither she was going the poor child who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf talk said to him  i am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma  does she live far off said the wolf  oh ay answered little red ridinghood it is beyond that mill you see there at the first house in the village  well said the wolf and ill go and see her too ill go this way and you go that and we shall see who will be there soonest  the wolf began to run as fast as he could taking the nearest way and the little girl went by that farthest about diverting herself in gathering nuts running after butterflies and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with the wolf was not long before he got to the old womans house he knocked at the doortap tap  whos there  your grandchild little red ridinghood replied the wolf counterfeiting her voice who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma  the good grandmother who was in bed because she was somewhat ill cried out  pull the bobbin and the latch will go up  the wolf pulled the bobbin and the door opened and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit he then shut the door and went into the grandmothers bed expecting little red ridinghood who came some time afterward and knocked at the doortap tap  whos there  little red ridinghood hearing the big voice of the wolf was at first afraid but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse answered  tis your grandchild little red ridinghood who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you  the wolf cried out to her softening his voice as much as he could  pull the bobbin and the latch will go up  little red ridinghood pulled the bobbin and the door opened  the wolf seeing her come in said to her hiding himself under the bedclothes  put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool and come and lie down with me  little red ridinghood undressed herself and went into bed where being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes she said to her  grandmamma what great arms you have got  that is the better to hug thee my dear  grandmamma what great legs you have got  that is to run the better my child  grandmamma what great ears you have got  that is to hear the better my child  grandmamma what great eyes you have got  it is to see the better my child  grandmamma what great teeth you have got  that is to eat thee up  and saying these words this wicked wolf fell upon little red ridinghood and ate her all up     the sleeping beauty in the wood   there were formerly a king and a queen who were so sorry that they had no children so sorry that it cannot be expressed they went to all the waters in the world vows pilgrimages all ways were tried and all to no purpose  at last however the queen had a daughter there was a very fine christening and the princess had for her godmothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom they found seven that every one of them might give her a gift as was the custom of fairies in those days by this means the princess had all the perfections imaginable  after the ceremonies of the christening were over all the company returned to the kings palace where was prepared a great feast for the fairies there was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold wherein were a spoon knife and fork all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies but as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy whom they had not invited because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted  the king ordered her a cover but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others because they had only seven made for the seven fairies the old fairy fancied she was slighted and muttered some threats between her teeth one of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled and judging that she might give the little princess some unlucky gift went as soon as they rose from table and hid herself behind the hangings that she might speak last and repair as much as she could the evil which the old fairy might intend  in the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the princess the youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most beautiful person in the world the next that she should have the wit of an angel the third that she should have a wonderful grace in everything she did the fourth that she should dance perfectly well the fifth that she should sing like a nightingale and the sixth that she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection  the old fairys turn coming next with a head shaking more with spite than age she said that the princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound this terrible gift made the whole company tremble and everybody fell acrying  at this very instant the young fairy came out from behind the hangings and spake these words aloud  assure yourselves o king and queen that your daughter shall not die of this disaster it is true i have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done the princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle but instead of dying she shall only fall into a profound sleep which shall last a hundred years at the expiration of which a kings son shall come and awake her  the king to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old fairy caused immediately proclamation to be made whereby everybody was forbidden on pain of death to spin with a distaff and spindle or to have so much as any spindle in their houses about fifteen or sixteen years after the king and queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure the young princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the palace when going up from one apartment to another she came into a little room on the top of the tower where a good old woman alone was spinning with her spindle this good woman had never heard of the kings proclamation against spindles  what are you doing there goody said the princess  i am spinning my pretty child said the old woman who did not know who she was  ha said the princess this is very pretty how do you do it give it to me that i may see if i can do so  she had no sooner taken it into her hand than whether being very hasty at it somewhat unhandy or that the decree of the fairy had so ordained it it ran into her hand and she fell down in a swoon  the good old woman not knowing very well what to do in this affair cried out for help people came in from every quarter in great numbers they threw water upon the princesss face unlaced her struck her on the palms of her hands and rubbed her temples with hungarywater but nothing would bring her to herself  and now the king who came up at the noise bethought himself of the prediction of the fairies and judging very well that this must necessarily come to pass since the fairies had said it caused the princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace and to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver  one would have taken her for a little angel she was so very beautiful for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion her cheeks were carnation and her lips were coral indeed her eyes were shut but she was heard to breathe softly which satisfied those about her that she was not dead the king commanded that they should not disturb her but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was come  the good fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of matakin twelve thousand leagues off when this accident befell the princess but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf who had boots of seven leagues that is boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride the fairy came away immediately and she arrived about an hour after in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons  the king handed her out of the chariot and she approved everything he had done but as she had very great foresight she thought when the princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself being all alone in this old palace and this was what she did she touched with her wand everything in the palace except the king and queengovernesses maids of honor ladies of the bedchamber gentlemen officers stewards cooks undercooks scullions guards with their beefeaters pages footmen she likewise touched all the horses which were in the stables pads as well as others the great dogs in the outward court and pretty little mopsey too the princesss little spaniel which lay by her on the bed  immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep that they might not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait upon her when she wanted them the very spits at the fire as full as they could hold of partridges and pheasants did fall asleep also all this was done in a moment fairies are not long in doing their business  and now the king and the queen having kissed their dear child without waking her went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that nobody should dare to come near it  this however was not necessary for in a quarter of an hours time there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees great and small bushes and brambles twining one within another that neither man nor beast could pass through so that nothing could be seen but the very top of the towers of the palace and that too not unless it was a good way off nobody doubted but the fairy gave herein a very extraordinary sample of her art that the princess while she continued sleeping might have nothing to fear from any curious people  when a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the king then reigning and who was of another family from that of the sleeping princess being gone ahunting on that side of the country asked  what those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood  everyone answered according as they had heard some said  that it was a ruinous old castle haunted by spirits  others that all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there their sabbath or nights meeting  the common opinion was that an ogre lived there and that he carried thither all the little children he could catch that he might eat them up at his leisure without anybody being able to follow him as having himself only the power to pass through the wood  the prince was at a stand not knowing what to believe when a very good countryman spake to him thus  may it please your royal highness it is now about fifty years since i heard from my father who heard my grandfather say that there was then in this castle a princess the most beautiful was ever seen that she must sleep there a hundred years and should be waked by a kings son for whom she was reserved  the young prince was all on fire at these words believing without weighing the matter that he could put an end to this rare adventure and pushed on by love and honor resolved that moment to look into it  scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees the bushes and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through he walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which he went into and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of his people could follow him because the trees closed again as soon as he had passed through them however he did not cease from continuing his way a young and amorous prince is always valiant  he came into a spacious outward court where everything he saw might have frozen the most fearless person with horror there reigned all over a most frightful silence the image of death everywhere showed itself and there was nothing to be seen but stretchedout bodies of men and animals all seeming to be dead he however very well knew by the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters that they were only asleep and their goblets wherein still remained some drops of wine showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups  he then crossed a court paved with marble went up the stairs and came into the guard chamber where guards were standing in their ranks with their muskets upon their shoulders and snoring as loud as they could after that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies all asleep some standing others sitting at last he came into a chamber all gilded with gold where he saw upon a bed the curtains of which were all open the finest sight was ever behelda princess who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age and whose bright and in a manner resplendent beauty had somewhat in it divine he approached with trembling and admiration and fell down before her upon his knees  and now as the enchantment was at an end the princess awaked and looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to admit of  is it you my prince said she to him you have waited a long while  the prince charmed with these words and much more with the manner in which they were spoken knew not how to show his joy and gratitude he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself their discourse was not well connected they did weep more than talklittle eloquence a great deal of love he was more at a loss than she and we need not wonder at it she had time to think on what to say to him for it is very probable though history mentions nothing of it that the good fairy during so long a sleep had given her very agreeable dreams in short they talked four hours together and yet they said not half what they had to say  in the meanwhile all the palace awaked everyone thought upon their particular business and as all of them were not in love they were ready to die for hunger the chief lady of honor being as sharp set as other folks grew very impatient and told the princess aloud that supper was served up the prince helped the princess to rise she was entirely dressed and very magnificently but his royal highness took care not to tell her that she was dressed like his greatgrandmother and had a point band peeping over a high collar she looked not a bit less charming and beautiful for all that  they went into the great hall of lookingglasses where they supped and were served by the princesss officers the violins and hautboys played old tunes but very excellent though it was now above a hundred years since they had played and after supper without losing any time the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains they had but very little sleepthe princess had no occasion and the prince left her next morning to return to the city where his father must needs have been in pain for him the prince told him  that he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting and that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoalburner who gave him cheese and brown bread  the king his father who was a good man believed him but his mother could not be persuaded it was true and seeing that he went almost every day ahunting and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing though he had lain out three or four nights together she began to suspect that he was married for he lived with the princess above two whole years and had by her two children the eldest of which who was a daughter was named morning and the youngest who was a son they called day because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than his sister  the queen spoke several times to her son to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her but he never dared to trust her with his secret he feared her though he loved her for she was of the race of the ogres and the king would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches it was even whispered about the court that she had ogreish inclinations and that whenever she saw little children passing by she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them and so the prince would never tell her one word  but when the king was dead which happened about two years afterward and he saw himself lord and master he openly declared his marriage and he went in great ceremony to conduct his queen to the palace they made a magnificent entry into the capital city she riding between her two children  soon after the king went to make war with the emperor contalabutte his neighbor he left the government of the kingdom to the queen his mother and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and children he was obliged to continue his expedition all the summer and as soon as he departed the queenmother sent her daughterinlaw to a country house among the woods that she might with the more ease gratify her horrible longing  some few days afterward she went thither herself and said to her clerk of the kitchen  i have a mind to eat little morning for my dinner tomorrow  ah madam cried the clerk of the kitchen  i will have it so replied the queen and this she spoke in the tone of an ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat and will eat her with a sauce robert  the poor man knowing very well that he must not play tricks with ogresses took his great knife and went up into little mornings chamber she was then four years old and came up to him jumping and laughing to take him about the neck and ask him for some sugarcandy upon which he began to weep the great knife fell out of his hand and he went into the back yard and killed a little lamb and dressed it with such good sauce that his mistress assured him that she had never eaten anything so good in her life he had at the same time taken up little morning and carried her to his wife to conceal her in the lodging he had at the bottom of the courtyard  about eight days afterward the wicked queen said to the clerk of the kitchen i will sup on little day  he answered not a word being resolved to cheat her as he had done before he went to find out little day and saw him with a little foil in his hand with which he was fencing with a great monkey the child being then only three years of age he took him up in his arms and carried him to his wife that she might conceal him in her chamber along with his sister and in the room of little day cooked up a young kid very tender which the ogress found to be wonderfully good  this was hitherto all mighty well but one evening this wicked queen said to her clerk of the kitchen  i will eat the queen with the same sauce i had with her children  it was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able to deceive her the young queen was turned of twenty not reckoning the hundred years she had been asleep and how to find in the yard a beast so firm was what puzzled him he took then a resolution that he might save his own life to cut the queens throat and going up into her chamber with intent to do it at once he put himself into as great fury as he could possibly and came into the young queens room with his dagger in his hand he would not however surprise her but told her with a great deal of respect the orders he had received from the queenmother  do it do it said she stretching out her neck execute your orders and then i shall go and see my children my poor children whom i so much and so tenderly loved  for she thought them dead ever since they had been taken away without her knowledge  no no madam cried the poor clerk of the kitchen all in tears you shall not die and yet you shall see your children again but then you must go home with me to my lodgings where i have concealed them and i shall deceive the queen once more by giving her in your stead a young hind  upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber where leaving her to embrace her children and cry along with them he went and dressed a young hind which the queen had for her supper and devoured it with the same appetite as if it had been the young queen exceedingly was she delighted with her cruelty and she had invented a story to tell the king at his return how the mad wolves had eaten up the queen his wife and her two children  one evening as she was according to her custom rambling round about the courts and yards of the palace to see if she could smell any fresh meat she heard in a ground room little day crying for his mamma was going to whip him because he had been naughty and she heard at the same time little morning begging pardon for her brother  the ogress presently knew the voice of the queen and her children and being quite mad that she had been thus deceived she commanded next morning by break of day with a most horrible voice which made everybody tremble that they should bring into the middle of the great court a large tub which she caused to be filled with toads vipers snakes and all sorts of serpents in order to have thrown into it the queen and her children the clerk of the kitchen his wife and maid all whom she had given orders should be brought thither with their hands tied behind them  they were brought out accordingly and the executioners were just going to throw them into the tub when the king who was not so soon expected entered the court on horseback for he came post and asked with the utmost astonishment what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle  no one dared to tell him when the ogress all enraged to see what had happened threw herself head foremost into the tub and was instantly devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it for others the king could not but be very sorry for she was his mother but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his pretty children     cinderella or the little glass slipper   once there was a gentleman who married for his second wife the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen she had by a former husband two daughters of her own humor who were indeed exactly like her in all things he had likewise by another wife a young daughter but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper which she took from her mother who was the best creature in the world  no sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the motherinlaw began to show herself in her true colors she could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious she employed her in the meanest work of the house she scoured the dishes tables etc and scrubbed madams chamber and those of misses her daughters she lay up in a sorry garret upon a wretched straw bed while her sisters lay in fine rooms with floors all inlaid upon beds of the very newest fashion and where they had lookingglasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot  the poor girl bore all patiently and dared not tell her father who would have rattled her off for his wife governed him entirely when she had done her work she used to go into the chimneycorner and sit down among cinders and ashes which made her commonly be called cinderwench but the youngest who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest called her cinderella however cinderella notwithstanding her mean apparel was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters though they were always dressed very richly  it happened that the kings son gave a ball and invited all persons of fashion to it our young misses were also invited for they cut a very grand figure among the quality they were mightily delighted at this invitation and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns petticoats and headclothes as might become them this was a new trouble to cinderella for it was she who ironed her sisters linen and plaited their ruffles they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed  for my part said the eldest i will wear my red velvet suit with french trimming  and i said the youngest shall have my usual petticoat but then to make amends for that i will put on my goldflowered manteau and my diamond stomacher which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world  they sent for the best tirewoman they could get to make up their headdresses and adjust their double pinners and they had their red brushes and patches from mademoiselle de la poche  cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters for she had excellent notions and advised them always for the best nay and offered her services to dress their heads which they were very willing she should do as she was doing this they said to her  cinderella would you not be glad to go to the ball  alas said she you only jeer me it is not for such as i am to go thither  thou art in the right of it replied they it would make the people laugh to see a cinderwench at a ball  anyone but cinderella would have dressed their heads awry but she was very good and dressed them perfectly well they were almost two days without eating so much were they transported with joy they broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close that they might have a fine slender shape and they were continually at their lookingglass at last the happy day came they went to court and cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could and when she had lost sight of them she fell acrying  her godmother who saw her all in tears asked her what was the matter  i wish i couldi wish i could she was not able to speak the rest being interrupted by her tears and sobbing  this godmother of hers who was a fairy said to her thou wishest thou couldst go to the ball is it not so  yes cried cinderella with a great sigh  well said her godmother be but a good girl and i will contrive that thou shalt go then she took her into her chamber and said to her run into the garden and bring me a pumpkin  cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get and brought it to her godmother not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball her godmother scooped out all the inside of it having left nothing but the rind which done she struck it with her wand and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach gilded all over with gold  she then went to look into her mousetrap where she found six mice all alive and ordered cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor when giving each mouse as it went out a little tap with her wand the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mousecolored dapplegray being at a loss for a coachman  i will go and see says cinderella if there is never a rat in the rattrapwe may make a coachman of him  thou art in the right replied her godmother go and look  cinderella brought the trap to her and in it there were three huge rats the fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard and having touched him with her wand he was turned into a fat jolly coachman who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld after that she said to her  go again into the garden and you will find six lizards behind the wateringpot bring them to me  she had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen who skipped up immediately behind the coach with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives the fairy then said to cinderella  well you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with are you not pleased with it  oh yes cried she but must i go thither as i am in these nasty rags  her godmother only just touched her with her wand and at the same instant her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver all beset with jewels this done she gave her a pair of glass slippers the prettiest in the whole world being thus decked out she got up into her coach but her godmother above all things commanded her not to stay till after midnight telling her at the same time that if she stayed one moment longer the coach would be a pumpkin again her horses mice her coachman a rat her footmen lizards and her clothes become just as they were before  she promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight and then away she drives scarce able to contain herself for joy the kings son who was told that a great princess whom nobody knew was come ran out to receive her he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach and led her into the ball among all the company there was immediately a profound silence they left off dancing and the violins ceased to play so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown newcomer nothing was then heard but a confused noise of  ha how handsome she is ha how handsome she is  the king himself old as he was could not help watching her and telling the queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature  all the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress that they might have some made next day after the same pattern provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them  the kings son conducted her to the most honorable seat and afterward took her out to dance with him she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her a fine collation was served up whereof the young prince ate not a morsel so intently was he busied in gazing on her  she went and sat down by her sisters showing them a thousand civilities giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the prince had presented her with which very much surprised them for they did not know her while cinderella was thus amusing her sisters she heard the clock strike eleven and threequarters whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could  when she got home she ran to seek out her godmother and after having thanked her she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball because the kings son had desired her  as she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball her two sisters knocked at the door which cinderella ran and opened  how long you have stayed cried she gaping rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep she had not however any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home  if thou hadst been at the ball said one of her sisters thou wouldst not have been tired with it there came thither the finest princess the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes she showed us a thousand civilities and gave us oranges and citrons  cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter indeed she asked them the name of that princess but they told her they did not know it and that the kings son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was at this cinderella smiling replied  she must then be very beautiful indeed how happy you have been could not i see her ah dear miss charlotte do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day  ay to be sure cried miss charlotte lend my clothes to such a dirty cinderwench as thou art i should be a fool  cinderella indeed expected well such answer and was very glad of the refusal for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly  the next day the two sisters were at the ball and so was cinderella but dressed more magnificently than before the kings son was always by her and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her so that she at last counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven she then rose up and fled as nimble as a deer the prince followed but could not overtake her she left behind one of her glass slippers which the prince took up most carefully she got home but quite out of breath and in her nasty old clothes having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers fellow to that she dropped the guards at the palace gate were asked  if they had not seen a princess go out  who said they had seen nobody go out but a young girl very meanly dressed and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman  when the two sisters returned from the ball cinderella asked them if they had been well diverted and if the fine lady had been there  they told her yes but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers the prettiest in the world which the kings son had taken up that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper  what they said was very true for a few days after the kings son caused it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit they whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses then the duchesses and all the court but in vain it was brought to the two sisters who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper but they could not effect it cinderella who saw all this and knew her slipper said to them laughing  let me see if it will not fit me  her sisters burst out alaughing and began to banter her the gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at cinderella and finding her very handsome said  it was but just that she should try and that he had orders to let everyone make trial  he obliged cinderella to sit down and putting the slipper to her foot he found it went on very easily and fitted her as if it had been made of wax the astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great but still abundantly greater when cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper and put it on her foot thereupon in came her godmother who having touched with her wand cinderellas clothes made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before  and now her two sisters found her to be that fine beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball they threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the illtreatment they had made her undergo cinderella took them up and as she embraced them cried  that she forgave them with all her heart and desired them always to love her  she was conducted to the young prince dressed as she was he thought her more charming than ever and a few days after married her cinderella who was no less good than beautiful gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the court1   1 charles perrault     aladdin and the wonderful lamp   there once lived a poor tailor who had a son called aladdin a careless idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself this so grieved the father that he died yet in spite of his mothers tears and prayers aladdin did not mend his ways one day when he was playing in the streets as usual a stranger asked him his age and if he was not the son of mustapha the tailor i am sir replied aladdin but he died a long while ago on this the stranger who was a famous african magician fell on his neck and kissed him saying i am your uncle and knew you from your likeness to my brother go to your mother and tell her i am coming aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle indeed child she said your father had a brother but i always thought he was dead however she prepared supper and bade aladdin seek his uncle who came laden with wine and fruit he presently fell down and kissed the place where mustapha used to sit bidding aladdins mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before as he had been forty years out of the country he then turned to aladdin and asked him his trade at which the boy hung his head while his mother burst into tears on learning that aladdin was idle and would learn no trade he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise next day he bought aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took him all over the city showing him the sights and brought him home at nightfall to his mother who was overjoyed to see her son so fine  the next day the magician led aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates they sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle which he divided between them they then journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories and led him on in spite of himself at last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley we will go no farther said the false uncle i will show you something wonderful only do you gather up sticks while i kindle a fire when it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him at the same time saying some magical words the earth trembled a little and opened in front of them disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by aladdin tried to run away but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down what have i done uncle he said piteously whereupon the magician said more kindly fear nothing but obey me beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours and no one else may touch it so you must do exactly as i tell you at the word treasure aladdin forgot his fears and grasped the ring as he was told saying the names of his father and grandfather the stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared go down said the magician at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything or you will die instantly these halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees walk on until you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me he drew a ring from his finger and gave it to aladdin bidding him prosper  aladdin found everything as the magician had said gathered some fruit off the trees and having got the lamp arrived at the mouth of the cave the magician cried out in a great hurry make haste and give me the lamp this aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave the magician flew into a terrible passion and throwing some more powder on to the fire he said something and the stone rolled back into its place  the magician left persia for ever which plainly showed that he was no uncle of aladdins but a cunning magician who had read in his magic books of a wonderful lamp which would make him the most powerful man in the world though he alone knew where to find it he could only receive it from the hand of another he had picked out the foolish aladdin for this purpose intending to get the lamp and kill him afterward  for two days aladdin remained in the dark crying and lamenting at last he clasped his hands in prayer and in so doing rubbed the ring which the magician had forgotten to take from him immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth saying what wouldst thou with me i am the slave of the ring and will obey thee in all things aladdin fearlessly replied deliver me from this place whereupon the earth opened and he found himself outside as soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home but fainted on the threshold when he came to himself he told his mother what had passed and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden which were in reality precious stones he then asked for some food alas child she said i have nothing in the house but i have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it aladdin bade her keep her cotton for he would sell the lamp instead as it was very dirty she began to rub it that it might fetch a higher price instantly a hideous genie appeared and asked what she would have she fainted away but aladdin snatching the lamp said boldly fetch me something to eat the genie returned with a silver bowl twelve silver plates containing rich meats two silver cups and two bottles of wine aladdins mother when she came to herself said whence comes this splendid feast ask not but eat replied aladdin so they sat at breakfast till it was dinnertime and aladdin told his mother about the lamp she begged him to sell it and have nothing to do with devils no said aladdin since chance hath made us aware of its virtues we will use it and the ring likewise which i shall always wear on my finger when they had eaten all the genie had brought aladdin sold one of the silver plates and so on until none were left he then had recourse to the genie who gave him another set of plates and thus they lived for many years  one day aladdin heard an order from the sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess his daughter went to and from the bath aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face which was very difficult as she always went veiled he hid himself behind the door of the bath and peeped through a chink the princess lifted her veil as she went in and looked so beautiful that aladdin fell in love with her at first sight he went home so changed that his mother was frightened he told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her and meant to ask her in marriage of her father his mother on hearing this burst out laughing but aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the sultan and carry his request she fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels she took these with her to please the sultan and set out trusting in the lamp the grand vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the sultan he however took no notice of her she went every day for a week and stood in the same place when the council broke up on the sixth day the sultan said to his vizier i see a certain woman in the audiencechamber every day carrying something in a napkin call her next time that i may find out what she wants next day at a sign from the vizier she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till the sultan said to her rise good woman and tell me what you want she hesitated so the sultan sent away all but the vizier and bade her speak frankly promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say she then told him of her sons violent love for the princess i prayed him to forget her she said but in vain he threatened to do some desperate deed if i refused to go and ask your majesty for the hand of the princess now i pray you to forgive not me alone but my son aladdin the sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them he was thunderstruck and turning to the vizier said what sayest thou ought i not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such a price the vizier who wanted her for his own son begged the sultan to withhold her for three months in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present the sultan granted this and told aladdins mother that though he consented to the marriage she must not appear before him again for three months  aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months but after two had elapsed his mother going into the city to buy oil found every one rejoicing and asked what was going on do you not know was the answer that the son of the grand vizier is to marry the sultans daughter tonight breathless she ran and told aladdin who was overwhelmed at first but presently bethought him of the lamp he rubbed it and the genie appeared saying what is thy will aladdin replied the sultan as thou knowest has broken his promise to me and the viziers son is to have the princess my command is that tonight you bring hither the bride and bridegroom master i obey said the genie aladdin then went to his chamber where sure enough at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the viziers son and the princess take this newmarried man he said and put him outside in the cold and return at daybreak whereupon the genie took the viziers son out of bed leaving aladdin with the princess fear nothing aladdin said to her you are my wife promised to me by your unjust father and no harm shall come to you the princess was too frightened to speak and passed the most miserable night of her life while aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly at the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom laid him in his place and transported the bed back to the palace  presently the sultan came to wish his daughter goodmorning the unhappy viziers son jumped up and hid himself while the princess would not say a word and was very sorrowful the sultan sent her mother to her who said how comes it child that you will not speak to your father what has happened the princess sighed deeply and at last told her mother how during the night the bed had been carried into some strange house and what had passed there her mother did not believe her in the least but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream  the following night exactly the same thing happened and next morning on the princesss refusal to speak the sultan threatened to cut off her head she then confessed all bidding him to ask the viziers son if it were not so the sultan told the vizier to ask his son who owned the truth adding that dearly as he loved the princess he had rather die than go through another such fearful night and wished to be separated from her his wish was granted and there was an end to feasting and rejoicing  when the three months were over aladdin sent his mother to remind the sultan of his promise she stood in the same place as before and the sultan who had forgotten aladdin at once remembered him and sent for her on seeing her poverty the sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word and asked his viziers advice who counselled him to set so high a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it the sultan then turned to aladdins mother saying good woman a sultan must remember his promises and i will remember mine but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels carried by forty black slaves led by as many white ones splendidly dressed tell him that i await his answer the mother of aladdin bowed low and went home thinking all was lost she gave aladdin the message adding he may wait long enough for your answer not so long mother as you think her son replied i would do a great deal more than that for the princess he summoned the genie and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived and filled up the small house and garden aladdin made them set out to the palace two and two followed by his mother they were so richly dressed with such splendid jewels in their girdles that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads they entered the palace and after kneeling before the sultan stood in a halfcircle round the throne with their arms crossed while aladdins mother presented them to the sultan he hesitated no longer but said good woman return and tell your son that i wait for him with open arms she lost no time in telling aladdin bidding him make haste but aladdin first called the genie i want a scented bath he said a richly embroidered habit a horse surpassing the sultans and twenty slaves to attend me besides this six slaves beautifully dressed to wait on my mother and lastly ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses no sooner said than done aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets the slaves strewing gold as they went those who had played with him in his childhood knew him not he had grown so handsome when the sultan saw him he came down from his throne embraced him and led him into a hall where a feast was spread intending to marry him to the princess that very day but aladdin refused saying i must build a palace fit for her and took his leave once home he said to the genie build me a palace of the finest marble set with jasper agate and other precious stones in the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome its four walls of massy gold and silver each having six windows whose lattices all except one which is to be left unfinished must be set with diamonds and rubies there must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves go and see about it  the palace was finished by the next day and the genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out even to the laying of a velvet carpet from aladdins palace to the sultans aladdins mother then dressed herself carefully and walked to the palace with her slaves while he followed her on horseback the sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them so that the air resounded with music and cheers she was taken to the princess who saluted her and treated her with great honor at night the princess said goodby to her father and set out on the carpet for aladdins palace with his mother at her side and followed by the hundred slaves she was charmed at the sight of aladdin who ran to receive her princess he said blame your beauty for my boldness if i have displeased you she told him that having seen him she willingly obeyed her father in this matter after the wedding had taken place aladdin led her into the hall where a feast was spread and she supped with him after which they danced till midnight next day aladdin invited the sultan to see the palace on entering the hall with the fourandtwenty windows with their rubies diamonds and emeralds he cried it is a worlds wonder there is only one thing that surprises me was it by accident that one window was left unfinished no sir by design returned aladdin i wished your majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace the sultan was pleased and sent for the best jewelers in the city he showed them the unfinished window and bade them fit it up like the others sir replied their spokesman we cannot find jewels enough the sultan had his own fetched which they soon used but to no purpose for in a months time the work was not half done aladdin knowing that their task was vain bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back and the genie finished the window at his command the sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited aladdin who showed him the window finished the sultan embraced him the envious vizier meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment  aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing he was made captain of the sultans armies and won several battles for him but remained modest and courteous as before and lived thus in peace and content for several years  but far away in africa the magician remembered aladdin and by his magic arts discovered that aladdin instead of perishing miserably in the cave had escaped and had married a princess with whom he was living in great honor and wealth he knew that the poor tailors son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp and traveled night and day until he reached the capital of china bent on aladdins ruin as he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace forgive my ignorance he asked what is this palace you speak of have you not heard of prince aladdins palace was the reply the greatest wonder of the world i will direct you if you have a mind to see it the magician thanked him who spoke and having seen the palace knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp and became half mad with rage he determined to get hold of the lamp and again plunge aladdin into the deepest poverty  unluckily aladdin had gone ahunting for eight days which gave the magician plenty of time he bought a dozen copper lamps put them into a basket and went to the palace crying new lamps for old followed by a jeering crowd the princess sitting in the hall of fourandtwenty windows sent a slave to find out what the noise was about who came back laughing so that the princess scolded her madam replied the slave who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones another slave hearing this said there is an old one on the cornice there which he can have now this was the magic lamp which aladdin had left there as he could not take it out hunting with him the princess not knowing its value laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange she went and said to the magician give me a new lamp for this he snatched it and bade the slave take her choice amid the jeers of the crowd little he cared but left off crying his lamps and went out of the city gates to a lonely place where he remained till nightfall when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it the genie appeared and at the magicians command carried him together with the palace and the princess in it to a lonely place in africa  next morning the sultan looked out of the window toward aladdins palace and rubbed his eyes for it was gone he sent for the vizier and asked what had become of the palace the vizier looked out too and was lost in astonishment he again put it down to enchantment and this time the sultan believed him and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch aladdin in chains they met him riding home bound him and forced him to go with them on foot the people however who loved him followed armed to see that he came to no harm he was carried before the sultan who ordered the executioner to cut off his head the executioner made aladdin kneel down bandaged his eyes and raised his scimitar to strike at that instant the vizier who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue aladdin called to the executioner to stay his hand the people indeed looked so threatening that the sultan gave way and ordered aladdin to be unbound and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd aladdin now begged to know what he had done false wretch said the sultan come thither and showed him from the window the place where his palace had stood aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word where is my palace and my daughter demanded the sultan for the first i am not so deeply concerned but my daughter i must have and you must find her or lose your head aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her promising if he failed to return and suffer death at the sultans pleasure his prayer was granted and he went forth sadly from the sultans presence for three days he wandered about like a madman asking everyone what had become of his palace but they only laughed and pitied him he came to the banks of a river and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in in so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore the genie he had seen in the cave appeared and asked his will save my life genie said aladdin bring my palace back that is not in my power said the genie i am only the slave of the ring you must ask him of the lamp even so said aladdin but thou canst take me to the palace and set me down under my dear wifes window he at once found himself in africa under the window of the princess and fell asleep out of sheer weariness  he was awakened by the singing of the birds and his heart was lighter he saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it  that morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into africa by the magician whose company she was forced to endure once a day she however treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether as she was dressing one of her women looked out and saw aladdin the princess ran and opened the window and at the noise she made aladdin looked up she called to him to come to her and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again after he had kissed her aladdin said i beg of you princess in gods name before we speak of anything else for your own sake and mine tell me that has become of an old lamp i left on the cornice in the hall of fourandtwenty windows when i went ahunting alas she said i am the innocent cause of our sorrows and told him of the exchange of the lamp now i know cried aladdin that we have to thank the african magician for this where is the lamp he carries it about with him said the princess i know for he pulled it out of his breast to show me he wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him saying that you were beheaded by my fathers command he is for ever speaking ill of you but i only reply by my tears if i persist i doubt not but he will use violence aladdin comforted her and left her for a while he changed clothes with the first person he met in the town and having bought a certain powder returned to the princess who let him in by a little side door put on your most beautiful dress he said to her and receive the magician with smiles leading him to believe that you have forgotten me invite him to sup with you and say you wish to taste the wine of his country he will go for some and while he is gone i will tell you what to do she listened carefully to aladdin and when he left she arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left china she put on a girdle and headdress of diamonds and seeing in a glass that she was more beautiful than ever received the magician saying to his great amazement i have made up my mind that aladdin is dead and that all my tears will not bring him back to me so i am resolved to mourn no more and have therefore invited you to sup with me but i am tired of the wines of china and would fain taste those of africa the magician flew to his cellar and the princess put the powder aladdin had given her in her cup when he returned she asked him to drink her health in the wine of africa handing him her cup in exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty but the princess cut him short saying let us drink first and you shall say what you will afterward she set her cup to her lips and kept it there while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless the princess then opened the door to aladdin and flung her arms round his neck but aladdin put her away bidding her leave him as he had more to do he then went to the dead magician took the lamp out of his vest and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to china this was done and the princess in her chamber only felt two little shocks and little thought she was at home again  the sultan who was sitting in his closet mourning for his lost daughter happened to look up and rubbed his eyes for there stood the palace as before he hastened thither and aladdin received him in the hall of the fourandtwenty windows with the princess at his side aladdin told him what had happened and showed him the dead body of the magician that he might believe a ten days feast was proclaimed and it seemed as if aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace but it was not to be  the african magician had a younger brother who was if possible more wicked and more cunning than himself he traveled to china to avenge his brothers death and went to visit a pious woman called fatima thinking she might be of use to him he entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death he changed clothes with her colored his face like hers put on her veil and murdered her that she might tell no tales then he went toward the palace of aladdin and all the people thinking he was the holy woman gathered round him kissing his hands and begging his blessing when he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter the slave said it was the holy woman curing people by her touch of their ailments whereupon the princess who had long desired to see fatima sent for her on coming to the princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity when he had done the princess made him sit by her and begged him to stay with her always the false fatima who wished for nothing better consented but kept his veil down for fear of discovery the princess showed him the hall and asked him what he thought of it it is truly beautiful said the false fatima in my mind it wants but one thing and what is that said the princess if only a rocs egg replied he were hung up from the middle of this dome it would be the wonder of the world  after this the princess could think of nothing but the rocs egg and when aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor he begged to know what was amiss and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoiled for the want of a rocs egg hanging from the dome if that is all replied aladdin you shall soon be happy he left her and rubbed the lamp and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a rocs egg the genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook wretch he cried is it not enough that i have done everything for you but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome you and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes but that this request does not come from you but from the brother of the african magician whom you destroyed he is now in your palace disguised as the holy womanwhom he murdered he it was who put that wish into your wifes head take care of yourself for he means to kill you so saying the genie disappeared  aladdin went back to the princess saying his head ached and requesting that the holy fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it but when the magician came near aladdin seizing his dagger pierced him to the heart what have you done cried the princess you have killed the holy woman not so replied aladdin but a wicked magician and told her of how she had been deceived  after this aladdin and his wife lived in peace he succeeded the sultan when he died and reigned for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings1   1 arabian nights     the tale of a youth who set out to learn what fear was   a father had two sons of whom the eldest was clever and bright and always knew what he was about but the youngest was stupid and couldnt learn or understand anything so much so that those who saw him exclaimed what a burden hell be to his father now when there was anything to be done the eldest had always to do it but if something was required later or in the nighttime and the way led through the churchyard or some such ghostly place he always replied oh no father nothing will induce me to go there it makes me shudder for he was afraid or when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made ones flesh creep the listeners sometimes said oh it makes one shudder the youngest sat in a corner heard the exclamation and could not understand what it meant they are always saying it makes one shudder it makes one shudder nothing makes me shudder its probably an art quite beyond me  now it happened that his father said to him one day hearken you there in the corner you are growing big and strong and you must learn to earn your own bread look at your brother what pains he takes but all the money ive spent on your education is thrown away my dear father he replied i will gladly learnin fact if it were possible i should like to learn to shudder i dont understand that a bit yet the eldest laughed when he heard this and thought to himself good heavens what a ninny my brother is hell never come to any good as the twig is bent so is the tree inclined the father sighed and answered him youll soon learn to shudder but that wont help you to make a living  shortly after this when the sexton came to pay them a visit the father broke out to him and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at everything he knew nothing and learned nothing only think when i asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood he actually asked to be taught to shudder if thats all he wants said the sexton i can teach him that just you send him to me ill soon polish him up the father was quite pleased with the proposal because he thought it will be a good discipline for the youth and so the sexton took him into his house and his duty was to toll the bell after a few days he woke him at midnight and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll now my friend ill teach you to shudder thought he he stole forth secretly in front and when the youth was up above and had turned round to grasp the bellrope he saw standing opposite the hole of the belfry a white figure whos there he called out but the figure gave no answer and neither stirred nor moved answer cried the youth or begone you have no business here at this hour of the night but the sexton remained motionless so that the youth might think that it was a ghost the youth called out the second time what do you want here speak if you are an honest fellow or ill knock you down the stairs the sexton thought he cant mean that in earnest so gave forth no sound and stood as though he were made of stone then the youth shouted out to him the third time and as that too had no effect he made a dash at the spectre and knocked it down the stairs so that it fell about ten steps and remained lying in a corner thereupon he tolled the bell went home to bed without saying a word and fell asleep the sextons wife waited a long time for her husband but he never appeared at last she became anxious and woke the youth and asked dont you know where my husband is he went up to the tower in front of you no answered the youth but someone stood on the stairs up there just opposite the trapdoor in the belfry and because he wouldnt answer me or go away i took him for a rogue and knocked him down youd better go and see if it was he i should be much distressed if it were the wife ran and found her husband who was lying groaning in a corner with his leg broken  she carried him down and then hurried with loud protestations to the youths father your son has been the cause of a pretty misfortune she cried he threw my husband downstairs so that he broke his leg take the goodfornothing wretch out of our house the father was horrified hurried to the youth and gave him a scolding  what unholy pranks are these the evil one must have put them into your head father he replied only listen to me i am quite guiltless he stood there in the night like one who meant harm i didnt know who it was and warned him three times to speak or begone oh groaned the father youll bring me nothing but misfortune get out of my sight i wont have anything more to do with you yes father willingly only wait till daylight then ill set out and learn to shudder and in that way i shall be master of an art which will gain me a living learn what you will said the father its all one to me here are fifty dollars for you set forth into the wide world with them but see you tell no one where you come from or who your father is for i am ashamed of you yes father whatever you wish and if thats all you ask i can easily keep it in mind  when day broke the youth put the fifty dollars into his pocket set out on the hard high road and kept muttering to himself if i could only shudder if i could only shudder just at this moment a man came by who heard the youth speaking to himself and when they had gone on a bit and were in sight of the gallows the man said to him look there is the tree where seven people have been hanged and are now learning to fly sit down under it and wait till nightfall and then youll pretty soon learn to shudder if thats all i have to do answered the youth its easily done but if i learn to shudder so quickly then you shall have my fifty dollars just come back to me tomorrow morning early then the youth went to the gallowstree and sat down underneath it and waited for the evening and because he felt cold he lit himself a fire but at midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldnt keep warm and as the wind blew the corpses one against the other tossing them to and fro he thought to himself if you are perishing down here by the fire how those poor things up there must be shaking and shivering and because he had a tender heart he put up a ladder which he climbed unhooked one body after the other and took down all the seven then he stirred the fire blew it up and placed them all round in a circle that they might warm themselves but they sat there and did not move and the fire caught their clothes then he spoke take care or ill hang you up again but the dead men did not hear and let their rags go on burning then he got angry and said if you arent careful yourselves then i cant help you and i dont mean to burn with you and he hung them up again in a row then he sat down at his fire and fell asleep on the following morning the man came to him and wishing to get his fifty dollars said now you know what it is to shudder no he answered how should i those fellows up there never opened their mouths and were so stupid that they let those few old tatters they have on their bodies burn then the man saw he wouldnt get his fifty dollars that day and went off saying well im blessed if i ever met such a person in my life before  the youth went too on his way and began to murmur to himself oh if i could only shudder if i could only shudder a carrier who was walking behind him heard these words and asked him who are you i dont know said the youth where do you hail from i dont know whos your father i maynt say what are you constantly muttering to yourself oh said the youth i would give worlds to shudder but no one can teach me stuff and nonsense spoke the carrier come along with me and ill soon put that right the youth went with the carrier and in the evening they reached an inn where they were to spend the night then just as he was entering the room he said again quite aloud oh if i could only shudder if i could only shudder the landlord who heard this laughed and said if thats what youre sighing for you shall be given every opportunity here oh hold your tongue said the landlords wife so many people have paid for their curiosity with their lives it were a thousand pities if those beautiful eyes were never again to behold daylight but the youth said no matter how difficult i insist on learning it why thats what ive set out to do he left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the neighborhood stood a haunted castle where one could easily learn to shudder if one only kept watch in it for three nights the king had promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife and she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun there was also much treasure hid in the castle guarded by evil spirits which would then be free and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich many had already gone in but so far none had ever come out again so the youth went to the king and spoke if i were allowed i should much like to watch for three nights in the castle the king looked at him and because he pleased him he said you can ask for three things none of them living and those you may take with you into the castle then he answered well i shall beg for a fire a turning lathe and a carving bench with the knife attached  on the following day the king had everything put into the castle and when night drew on the youth took up his position there lit a bright fire in one of the rooms placed the carving bench with the knife close to it and sat himself down on the turning lathe oh if i could only shudder he said but i shant learn it here either toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard a shriek from a corner ou miou how cold we are you fools he cried why do you scream if you are cold come and sit at the fire and warm yourselves and as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down one on each side of him and gazed wildly at him with their fiery eyes after a time when they had warmed themselves they said friend shall we play a little game of cards why not he replied but first let me see your paws then they stretched out their claws ha said he what long nails youve got wait a minute i must first cut them off thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks lifted them on to the carving bench and screwed down their paws firmly after watching you narrowly said he i no longer feel any desire to play cards with you and with these words he struck them dead and threw them out into the water but when he had thus sent the two of them to their final rest and was again about to sit down at the fire out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he couldnt possibly get away from them they yelled in the most ghastly manner jumped upon his fire scattered it all and tried to put it out he looked on quietly for a time but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carvingknife and called out be off you rabble rout and let fly at them some of them fled away and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below when he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more and warmed himself and as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer and a desire to sleep stole over him then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed the very thing he said and laid himself down in it but when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself and ran all round the castle capital he said only a little quicker then the bed sped on as if drawn by six horses over thresholds and stairs up this way and down that all of a suddencrash crash with a bound it turned over upside down and lay like a mountain on the top of him but he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air emerged from underneath and said now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive lay down at his fire and slept till daylight in the morning the king came and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him and that he was dead then he said what a pity and such a fine fellow he was the youth heard this got up and said its not come to that yet then the king was astonished but very glad and asked how it had fared with him firstrate he answered and now ive survived the one night i shall get through the other two also the landlord when he went to him opened his eyes wide and said well i never thought to see you alive again have you learned now what shuddering is no he replied its quite hopeless if someone could only tell me how to  the second night he went up again to the old castle sat down at the fire and began his old refrain if i could only shudder as midnight approached a noise and din broke out at first gentle but gradually increasing then all was quiet for a minute and at length with a loud scream half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him hi up there shouted he theres another half wanted down here thats not enough then the din commenced once more there was a shrieking and a yelling and then the other half fell down wait a bit he said ill stir up the fire for you when he had done this and again looked around the two pieces had united and a horriblelooking man sat on his seat come said the youth i didnt bargain for that the seat is mine the man tried to shove him away but the youth wouldnt allow it for a moment and pushing him off by force sat down in his place again then more men dropped down one after the other who fetching nine skeleton legs and two skulls put them up and played ninepins with them the youth thought he would like to play too and said look here do you mind my joining the game no not if you have money ive money enough he replied but your balls arent round enough then he took the skulls placed them on his lathe and turned them till they were round now theyll roll along better said he and houpla now the fun begins he played with them and lost some of his money but when twelve struck everything vanished before his eyes he lay down and slept peacefully the next morning the king came anxious for news how have you got on this time he asked i played ninepins he answered and lost a few pence didnt you shudder then no such luck said he i made myself merry oh if i only knew what it was to shudder  on the third night he sat down again on his bench and said in the most desponding way if i could only shudder when it got late six big men came in carrying a coffin then he cried ha ha thats most likely my little cousin who only died a few days ago and beckoning with his finger he called out come my small cousin come they placed the coffin on the ground and he approached it and took off the cover in it lay a dead man he felt his face and it was cold as ice wait he said ill heat you up a bit went to the fire warmed his hand and laid it on the mans face but the dead remained cold then he lifted him out sat down at the fire laid him on his knee and rubbed his arms that the blood should circulate again when that too had no effect it occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each other so he put him into the bed covered him up and lay down beside him after a time the corpse became warm and began to move then the youth said now my little cousin what would have happened if i hadnt warmed you but the dead man rose up and cried out now i will strangle you what said he is that all the thanks i get you should be put straight back into your coffin lifted him up threw him in and closed the lid then the six men came and carried him out again i simply cant shudder he said and its clear i shant learn it in a lifetime here  then a man entered of more than ordinary size and of a very fearful appearance but he was old and had a white beard oh you miserable creature now you will soon know what it is to shudder he cried for you must die not so quickly answered the youth if i am to die you must catch me first i shall soon lay hold of you spoke the monster gently gently dont boast too much im as strong as you and stronger too well soon see said the old man if you are stronger than i then ill let you off come lets have a try then he led him through some dark passages to a forge and grasping an axe he drove one of the anvils with a blow into the earth i can do better than that cried the youth and went to the other anvil the old man drew near him in order to watch closely and his white beard hung right down the youth seized the axe cleft the anvil open and jammed in the old mans beard now i have you said the youth this time its your turn to die then he seized an iron rod and belabored the old man till he whimpering begged him to leave off and he would give him great riches the youth drew out the axe and let him go the old man led him back to the castle and showed him in a cellar three chests of gold one of these said he belongs to the poor one to the king and the third is yours at that moment twelve struck and the spirit vanished leaving the youth alone in the dark ill surely be able to find a way out said he and groping about he at length found his way back to the room and fell asleep at his fire the next morning the king came and said well now youve surely learned to shudder no he answered what can it be my dead cousin was here and an old bearded man came who showed me heaps of money down below there but what shuddering is no one has told me then the king spoke you have freed the castle from its curse and you shall marry my daughter thats all charming he said but i still dont know what it is to shudder  then the gold was brought up and the wedding was celebrated but the young king though he loved his wife dearly and though he was very happy still kept on saying if i could only shudder if i could only shudder at last he reduced her to despair then her maid said ill help you well soon make him shudder so she went out to the stream that flowed through the garden and had a pail full of little gudgeons brought to her at night when the young king was asleep his wife had to pull the clothes off him and pour the pail full of little gudgeons over him so that the little fish swam all about him then he awoke and cried out oh how i shudder how i shudder dear wife yes now i know what shuddering is1   1 grimm     rumpelstiltzkin   there was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful daughter now it happened one day that he had an audience with the king and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold now thats a talent worth having said the king to the miller if your daughter is as clever as you say bring her to my palace tomorrow and ill put her to the test when the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw gave her a spinningwheel and spindle and said now set to work and spin all night till early dawn and if by that time you havent spun the straw into gold you shall die then he closed the door behind him and left her alone inside  so the poor millers daughter sat down and didnt know what in the world she was to do she hadnt the least idea of how to spin straw into gold and became at last so miserable that she began to cry suddenly the door opened and in stepped a tiny little man and said goodevening miss millermaid why are you crying so bitterly oh answered the girl i have to spin straw into gold and havent a notion how its done what will you give me if i spin it for you asked the manikin my necklace replied the girl the little man took the necklace sat himself down at the wheel and whir whir whir the wheel went round three times and the bobbin was full then he put on another and whir whir whir the wheel went round three times and the second too was full and so it went on till the morning when all the straw was spun away and all the bobbins were full of gold as soon as the sun rose the king came and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal he had the millers daughter put into another room full of straw much bigger than the first and bade her if she valued her life spin it all into gold before the following morning the girl didnt know what to do and began to cry then the door opened as before and the tiny little man appeared and said whatll you give me if i spin the straw into gold for you the ring from my finger answered the girl the manikin took the ring and whir round went the spinningwheel again and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold the king was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold was still not satisfied and he had the millers daughter brought into a yet bigger room full of straw and said you must spin all this away in the night but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife shes only a millers daughter its true he thought but i couldnt find a richer wife if i were to search the whole world over when the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time and said whatll you give me if i spin the straw for you once again ive nothing more to give answered the girl then promise me when you are queen to give me your first child who knows what may not happen before that thought the millers daughter and besides she saw no other way out of it so she promised the manikin what he demanded and he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold when the king came in the morning and found everything as he had desired he straightway made her his wife and the millers daughter became a queen  when a year had passed a beautiful son was born to her and she thought no more of the little man till all of a sudden one day he stepped into her room and said now give me what you promised the queen was in a great state and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if he would only leave her the child but the manikin said no a living creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world then the queen began to cry and sob so bitterly that the little man was sorry for her and said ill give you three days to guess my name and if you find it out in that time you may keep your child  then the queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever heard and sent a messenger to scour the land and to pick up far and near any names he could come across when the little man arrived on the following day she began with kasper melchior belshazzar and all the other names she knew in a string but at each one the manikin called out thats not my name the next day she sent to inquire the names of all the people in the neighborhood and had a long list of the most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made his appearance is your name perhaps sheepshanks cruickshanks spindleshanks but he always replied thats not my name on the third day the messenger returned and announced i have not been able to find any new names but as i came upon a high hill round the corner of the wood where the foxes and hares bid each other goodnight i saw a little house and in front of the house burned a fire and round the fire sprang the most grotesque little man hopping on one leg and crying    tomorrow i brew today i bake     and then the child away ill take     for little deems my royal dame     that rumpelstiltzkin is my name   you can imagine the queens delight at hearing the name and when the little man stepped in shortly afterward and asked now my lady queen whats my name she asked first is your name conrad no is your name harry no is your name perhaps rumpelstiltzkin some demon has told you that some demon has told you that screamed the little man and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two1   1 grimm     beauty and the beast   once upon a time in a very faroff country there lived a merchant who had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that he was enormously rich as he had however six sons and six daughters he found that his money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied as they were accustomed to do  but one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them their house caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground with all the splendid furniture the books pictures gold silver and precious goods it contained and this was only the beginning of their troubles their father who had until this moment prospered in all ways suddenly lost every ship he had upon the sea either by dint of pirates shipwreck or fire then he heard that his clerks in distant countries whom he trusted entirely had proved unfaithful and at last from great wealth he fell into the direst poverty  all that he had left was a little house in a desolate place at least a hundred leagues from the town in which he had lived and to this he was forced to retreat with his children who were in despair at the idea of leading such a different life indeed the daughters at first hoped that their friends who had been so numerous while they were rich would insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one but they soon found that they were left alone and that their former friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own extravagance and showed no intention of offering them any help so nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage which stood in the midst of a dark forest and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the earth as they were too poor to have any servants the girls had to work hard like peasants and the sons for their part cultivated the fields to earn their living roughly clothed and living in the simplest way the girls regretted unceasingly the luxuries and amusements of their former life only the youngest tried to be brave and cheerful she had been as sad as anyone when misfortune overtook her father but soon recovering her natural gaiety she set to work to make the best of things to amuse her father and brothers as well as she could and to try to persuade her sisters to join her in dancing and singing but they would do nothing of the sort and because she was not as doleful as themselves they declared that this miserable life was all she was fit for but she was really far prettier and cleverer than they were indeed she was so lovely that she was always called beauty after two years when they were all beginning to get used to their new life something happened to disturb their tranquillity their father received the news that one of his ships which he had believed to be lost had come safely into port with a rich cargo all the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty was at an end and wanted to set out directly for the town but their father who was more prudent begged them to wait a little and though it was harvest time and he could ill be spared determined to go himself first to make inquiries only the youngest daughter had any doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before or at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would find amusement and gay companions once more so they all loaded their father with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken a fortune to buy only beauty feeling sure that it was of no use did not ask for anything her father noticing her silence said and what shall i bring for you beauty  the only thing i wish for is to see you come home safely she answered  but this only vexed her sisters who fancied she was blaming them for having asked for such costly things her father however was pleased but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty presents he told her to choose something  well dear father she said as you insist upon it i beg that you will bring me a rose i have not seen one since we came here and i love them so much  so the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible but only to find that his former companions believing him to be dead had divided between them the goods which the ship had brought and after six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as when he started having been able to recover only just enough to pay the cost of his journey to make matters worse he was obliged to leave the town in the most terrible weather so that by the time he was within a few leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest he was so anxious to be at his journeys end that he resolved to go on but night overtook him and the deep snow and bitter frost made it impossible for his horse to carry him any further not a house was to be seen the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great tree and there he crouched all the night which seemed to him the longest he had ever known in spite of his weariness the howling of the wolves kept him awake and even when at last the day broke he was not much better off for the falling snow had covered up every path and he did not know which way to turn  at length he made out some sort of track and though at the beginning it was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once it presently became easier and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a splendid castle it seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow had fallen in the avenue which was entirely composed of orange trees covered with flowers and fruit when he reached the first court of the castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps and went up them and passed through several splendidly furnished rooms the pleasant warmth of the air revived him and he felt very hungry but there seemed to be nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give him something to eat deep silence reigned everywhere and at last tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries he stopped in a room smaller than the rest where a clear fire was burning and a couch was drawn up closely to it thinking that this must be prepared for someone who was expected he sat down to wait till he should come and very soon fell into a sweet sleep  when his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours he was still alone but a little table upon which was a good dinner had been drawn up close to him and as he had eaten nothing for twentyfour hours he lost no time in beginning his meal hoping that he might soon have an opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer whoever it might be but no one appeared and even after another long sleep from which he awoke completely refreshed there was no sign of anybody though a fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table at his elbow being naturally timid the silence began to terrify him and he resolved to search once more through all the rooms but it was of no use not even a servant was to be seen there was no sign of life in the palace he began to wonder what he should do and to amuse himself by pretending that all the treasures he saw were his own and considering how he would divide them among his children then he went down into the garden and though it was winter everywhere else here the sun shone and the birds sang and the flowers bloomed and the air was soft and sweet the merchant in ecstacies with all he saw and heard said to himself  all this must be meant for me i will go this minute and bring my children to share all these delights  in spite of being so cold and weary when he reached the castle he had taken his horse to the stable and fed it now he thought he would saddle it for his homeward journey and he turned down the path which led to the stable this path had a hedge of roses on each side of it and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers they reminded him of his promise to beauty and he stopped and had just gathered one to take to her when he was startled by a strange noise behind him turning round he saw a frightful beast which seemed to be very angry and said in a terrible voice  who told you that you might gather my roses was it not enough that i allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you this is the way you show your gratitude by stealing my flowers but your insolence shall not go unpunished the merchant terrified by these furious words dropped the fatal rose and throwing himself on his knees cried pardon me noble sir i am truly grateful to you for your hospitality which was so magnificent that i could not imagine that you would be offended by my taking such a little thing as a rose but the beasts anger was not lessened by this speech  you are very ready with excuses and flattery he cried but that will not save you from the death you deserve  alas thought the merchant if my daughter could only know what danger her rose has brought me into  and in despair he began to tell the beast all his misfortunes and the reason of his journey not forgetting to mention beautys request  a kings ransom would hardly have procured all that my other daughters asked he said but i thought that i might at least take beauty her rose i beg you to forgive me for you see i meant no harm  the beast considered for a moment and then he said in a less furious tone  i will forgive you on one conditionthat is that you will give me one of your daughters  ah cried the merchant if i were cruel enough to buy my own life at the expense of one of my childrens what excuse could i invent to bring her here  no excuse would be necessary answered the beast if she comes at all she must come willingly on no other condition will i have her see if any one of them is courageous enough and loves you well enough to come and save your life you seem to be an honest man so i will trust you to go home i give you a month to see if either of your daughters will come back with you and stay here to let you go free if neither of them is willing you must come alone after bidding them goodby for ever for then you will belong to me and do not imagine that you can hide from me for if you fail to keep your word i will come and fetch you added the beast grimly  the merchant accepted this proposal though he did not really think any of his daughters could be persuaded to come he promised to return at the time appointed and then anxious to escape from the presence of the beast he asked permission to set off at once but the beast answered that he could not go until next day  then you will find a horse ready for you he said now go and eat your supper and await my orders  the poor merchant more dead than alive went back to his room where the most delicious supper was already served on the little table which was drawn up before a blazing fire but he was too terrified to eat and only tasted a few of the dishes for fear the beast should be angry if he did not obey his orders when he had finished he heard a great noise in the next room which he knew meant that the beast was coming as he could do nothing to escape his visit the only thing that remained was to seem as little afraid as possible so when the beast appeared and asked roughly if he had supped well the merchant answered humbly that he had thanks to his hosts kindness then the beast warned him to remember their agreement and to prepare his daughter exactly for what she had to expect  do not get up tomorrow he added until you see the sun and hear a golden bell ring then you will find your breakfast waiting for you here and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard he will also bring you back again when you come with your daughter a month hence farewell take a rose to beauty and remember your promise  the merchant was only too glad when the beast went away and though he could not sleep for sadness he lay down until the sun rose then after a hasty breakfast he went to gather beautys rose and mounted his horse which carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight of the palace and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped before the door of the cottage  his sons and daughters who had been very uneasy at his long absence rushed to meet him eager to know the result of his journey which seeing him mounted upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a rich mantle they supposed to be favorable he hid the truth from them at first only saying sadly to beauty as he gave her the rose  here is what you asked me to bring you you little know what it has cost  but this excited their curiosity so greatly that presently he told them his adventures from beginning to end and then they were all very unhappy the girls lamented loudly over their lost hopes and the sons declared that their father should not return to this terrible castle and began to make plans for killing the beast if it should come to fetch him but he reminded them that he had promised to go back then the girls were very angry with beauty and said it was all her fault and that if she had asked for something sensible this would never have happened and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for her folly  poor beauty much distressed said to them  i have indeed caused this misfortune but i assure you i did it innocently who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of summer would cause so much misery but as i did the mischief it is only just that i should suffer for it i will therefore go back with my father to keep his promise  at first nobody would hear of this arrangement and her father and brothers who loved her dearly declared that nothing should make them let her go but beauty was firm as the time drew near she divided all her little possessions between her sisters and said goodby to everything she loved and when the fatal day came she encouraged and cheered her father as they mounted together the horse which had brought him back it seemed to fly rather than gallop but so smoothly that beauty was not frightened indeed she would have enjoyed the journey if she had not feared what might happen to her at the end of it her father still tried to persuade her to go back but in vain while they were talking the night fell and then to their great surprise wonderful colored lights began to shine in all directions and splendid fireworks blazed out before them all the forest was illuminated by them and even felt pleasantly warm though it had been bitterly cold before this lasted until they reached the avenue of orange trees where were statues holding flaming torches and when they got nearer to the palace they saw that it was illuminated from the roof to the ground and music sounded softly from the courtyard the beast must be very hungry said beauty trying to laugh if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey  but in spite of her anxiety she could not help admiring all the wonderful things she saw  the horse stopped at the foot of the flight of steps leading to the terrace and when they had dismounted her father led her to the little room he had been in before where they found a splendid fire burning and the table daintily spread with a delicious supper  the merchant knew that this was meant for them and beauty who was rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and seen nothing of the beast was quite willing to begin for her long ride had made her very hungry but they had hardly finished their meal when the noise of the beasts footsteps was heard approaching and beauty clung to her father in terror which became all the greater when she saw how frightened he was but when the beast really appeared though she trembled at the sight of him she made a great effort to hide her terror and saluted him respectfully  this evidently pleased the beast after looking at her he said in a tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart though he did not seem to be angry  goodevening old man goodevening beauty  the merchant was too terrified to reply but beauty answered sweetly goodevening beast  have you come willingly asked the beast will you be content to stay here when your father goes away  beauty answered bravely that she was quite prepared to stay  i am pleased with you said the beast as you have come of your own accord you may stay as for you old man he added turning to the merchant at sunrise tomorrow you will take your departure when the bell rings get up quickly and eat your breakfast and you will find the same horse waiting to take you home but remember that you must never expect to see my palace again  then turning to beauty he said  take your father into the next room and help him to choose everything you think your brothers and sisters would like to have you will find two travelingtrunks there fill them as full as you can it is only just that you should send them something very precious as a remembrance of yourself  then he went away after saying goodby beauty goodby old man and though beauty was beginning to think with great dismay of her fathers departure she was afraid to disobey the beasts orders and they went into the next room which had shelves and cupboards all round it they were greatly surprised at the riches it contained there were splendid dresses fit for a queen with all the ornaments that were to be worn with them and when beauty opened the cupboards she was quite dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf after choosing a vast quantity which she divided between her sistersfor she had made a heap of the wonderful dresses for each of themshe opened the last chest which was full of gold  i think father she said that as the gold will be more useful to you we had better take out the other things again and fill the trunks with it so they did this but the more they put in the more room there seemed to be and at last they put back all the jewels and dresses they had taken out and beauty even added as many more of the jewels as she could carry at once and then the trunks were not too full but they were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them  the beast was mocking us cried the merchant he must have pretended to give us all these things knowing that i could not carry them away  let us wait and see answered beauty i cannot believe that he meant to deceive us all we can do is to fasten them up and leave them ready  so they did this and returned to the little room where to their astonishment they found breakfast ready the merchant ate his with a good appetite as the beasts generosity made him believe that he might perhaps venture to come back soon and see beauty but she felt sure that her father was leaving her for ever so she was very sad when the bell rang sharply for the second time and warned them that the time had come for them to part they went down into the courtyard where two horses were waiting one loaded with the two trunks the other for him to ride they were pawing the ground in their impatience to start and the merchant was forced to bid beauty a hasty farewell and as soon as he was mounted he went off at such a pace that she lost sight of him in an instant then beauty began to cry and wandered sadly back to her own room but she soon found that she was very sleepy and as she had nothing better to do she lay down and instantly fell asleep and then she dreamed that she was walking by a brook bordered with trees and lamenting her sad fate when a young prince handsomer than anyone she had ever seen and with a voice that went straight to her heart came and said to her ah beauty you are not so unfortunate as you suppose here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere your every wish shall be gratified only try to find me out no matter how i may be disguised as i love you dearly and in making me happy you will find your own happiness be as truehearted as you are beautiful and we shall have nothing left to wish for  what can i do prince to make you happy said beauty  only be grateful he answered and do not trust too much to your eyes and above all do not desert me until you have saved me from my cruel misery  after this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and beautiful lady who said to her  dear beauty try not to regret all you have left behind you for you are destined to a better fate only do not let yourself be deceived by appearances  beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to awake but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly twelve times and then she got up and found her dressingtable set out with everything she could possibly want and when her toilet was finished she found dinner was waiting in the room next to hers but dinner does not take very long when you are all by yourself and very soon she sat down cosily in the corner of a sofa and began to think about the charming prince she had seen in her dream  he said i could make him happy said beauty to herself  it seems then that this horrible beast keeps him a prisoner how can i set him free i wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances i dont understand it but after all it was only a dream so why should i trouble myself about it i had better go and find something to do to amuse myself  so she got up and began to explore some of the many rooms of the palace  the first she entered was lined with mirrors and beauty saw herself reflected on every side and thought she had never seen such a charming room then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her eye and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it held a portrait of her unknown admirer just as she had seen him in her dream with great delight she slipped the bracelet on her arm and went on into a gallery of pictures where she soon found a portrait of the same handsome prince as large as life and so well painted that as she studied it he seemed to smile kindly at her tearing herself away from the portrait at last she passed through into a room which contained every musical instrument under the sun and here she amused herself for a long while in trying some of them and singing until she was tired the next room was a library and she saw everything she had ever wanted to read as well as everything she had read and it seemed to her that a whole lifetime would not be enough to even read the names of the books there were so many by this time it was growing dusk and wax candles in diamond and ruby candlesticks were beginning to light themselves in every room  beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have it but she did not see anyone or hear a sound and though her father had warned her that she would be alone she began to find it rather dull  but presently she heard the beast coming and wondered tremblingly if he meant to eat her up now  however as he did not seem at all ferocious and only said gruffly  goodevening beauty she answered cheerfully and managed to conceal her terror then the beast asked her how she had been amusing herself and she told him all the rooms she had seen  then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace and beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very hard to please if she could not be happy and after about an hours talk beauty began to think that the beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first then he got up to leave her and said in his gruff voice  do you love me beauty will you marry me  oh what shall i say cried beauty for she was afraid to make the beast angry by refusing  say yes or no without fear he replied  oh no beast said beauty hastily  since you will not goodnight beauty he said  and she answered goodnight beast very glad to find that her refusal had not provoked him and after he was gone she was very soon in bed and asleep and dreaming of her unknown prince she thought he came and said to her  ah beauty why are you so unkind to me i fear i am fated to be unhappy for many a long day still  and then her dreams changed but the charming prince figured in them all and when morning came her first thought was to look at the portrait and see if it was really like him and she found that it certainly was  this morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden for the sun shone and all the fountains were playing but she was astonished to find that every place was familiar to her and presently she came to the brook where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the prince in her dream and that made her think more than ever that he must be kept a prisoner by the beast when she was tired she went back to the palace and found a new room full of materials for every kind of workribbons to make into bows and silks to work into flowers then there was an aviary full of rare birds which were so tame that they flew to beauty as soon as they saw her and perched upon her shoulders and her head  pretty little creatures she said how i wish that your cage was nearer to my room that i might often hear you sing  so saying she opened a door and found to her delight that it led into her own room though she had thought it was quite the other side of the palace  there were more birds in a room farther on parrots and cockatoos that could talk and they greeted beauty by name indeed she found them so entertaining that she took one or two back to her room and they talked to her while she was at supper after which the beast paid her his usual visit and asked her the same questions as before and then with a gruff goodnight he took his departure and beauty went to bed to dream of her mysterious prince the days passed swiftly in different amusements and after a while beauty found out another strange thing in the palace which often pleased her when she was tired of being alone there was one room which she had not noticed particularly it was empty except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside but the second time she went into the room happening to be tired she sat down in one of the chairs when instantly the curtain was rolled aside and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her there were dances and colored lights and music and pretty dresses and it was all so gay that beauty was in ecstacies after that she tried the other seven windows in turn and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them so that beauty never could feel lonely any more every evening after supper the beast came to see her and always before saying goodnight asked her in his terrible voice  beauty will you marry me  and it seemed to beauty now she understood him better that when she said no beast he went away quite sad but her happy dreams of the handsome young prince soon made her forget the poor beast and the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust appearances to let her heart guide her and not her eyes and many other equally perplexing things which consider as she would she could not understand  so everything went on for a long time until at last happy as she was beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters and one night seeing her look very sad the beast asked her what was the matter beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice so she answered that she was longing to see her home once more upon hearing this the beast seemed sadly distressed and cried miserably  ah beauty have you the heart to desert an unhappy beast like this what more do you want to make you happy is it because you hate me that you want to escape  no dear beast answered beauty softly i do not hate you and i should be very sorry never to see you any more but i long to see my father again only let me go for two months and i promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life  the beast who had been sighing dolefully while she spoke now replied  i cannot refuse you anything you ask even though it should cost me my life take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own and fill them with everything you wish to take with you but remember your promise and come back when the two months are over or you may have cause to repent it for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful beast dead you will not need any chariot to bring you back only say goodby to all your brothers and sisters the night before you come away and when you have gone to bed turn this ring round upon your finger and say firmly i wish to go back to my palace and see my beast again goodnight beauty fear nothing sleep peacefully and before long you shall see your father once more  as soon as beauty was alone she hastened to fill the boxes with all the rare and precious things she saw about her and only when she was tired of heaping things into them did they seem to be full  then she went to bed but could hardly sleep for joy and when at last she did begin to dream of her beloved prince she was grieved to see him stretched upon a grassy bank sad and weary and hardly like himself  what is the matter she cried  he looked at her reproachfully and said  how can you ask me cruel one are you not leaving me to my death perhaps  ah dont be so sorrowful cried beauty i am only going to assure my father that i am safe and happy i have promised the beast faithfully that i will come back and he would die of grief if i did not keep my word  what would that matter to you said the prince surely you would not care  indeed i should be ungrateful if i did not care for such a kind beast cried beauty indignantly i would die to save him from pain i assure you it is not his fault that he is so ugly  just then a strange sound woke hersomeone was speaking not very far away and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had never seen before which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those she was used to in the beasts palace where could she be she got up and dressed hastily and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room while she was wondering by what magic the beast had transported them and herself to this strange place she suddenly heard her fathers voice and rushed out and greeted him joyfully her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance as they had never expected to see her again and there was no end to the questions they asked her she had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away and of her fathers journey home but when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time and then must go back to the beasts palace for ever they lamented loudly then beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams and why the prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances after much consideration he answered you tell me yourself that the beast frightful as he is loves you dearly and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness i think the prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to in spite of his ugliness  beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable still when she thought of her dear prince who was so handsome she did not feel at all inclined to marry the beast at any rate for two months she need not decide but could enjoy herself with her sisters but though they were rich now and lived in town again and had plenty of acquaintances beauty found that nothing amused her very much and she often thought of the palace where she was so happy especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear prince and she felt quite sad without him  then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her and even found her rather in the way so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers who begged her to stay and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say goodby to them every day when she got up she meant to say it at night and when night came she put it off again until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind she thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave and running quickly to see what could be the matter she found the beast stretched out upon his side apparently dying he reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress and at the same moment a stately lady appeared and said very gravely  ah beauty you are only just in time to save his life see what happens when people do not keep their promises if you had delayed one day more you would have found him dead  beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she announced her intention of going back at once and that very night she said goodby to her father and all her brothers and sisters and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger and said firmly i wish to go back to my palace and see my beast again as she had been told to do  then she fell asleep instantly and only woke up to hear the clock saying beauty beauty twelve times in its musical voice which told her at once that she was really in the palace once more everything was just as before and her birds were so glad to see her but beauty thought she had never known such a long day for she was so anxious to see the beast again that she felt as if suppertime would never come  but when it did come and no beast appeared she was really frightened so after listening and waiting for a long time she ran down into the garden to search for him up and down the paths and avenues ran poor beauty calling him in vain for no one answered and not a trace of him could she find until at last quite tired she stopped for a minutes rest and saw that she was standing opposite the shady path she had seen in her dream she rushed down it and sure enough there was the cave and in it lay the beastasleep as beauty thought quite glad to have found him she ran up and stroked his head but to her horror he did not move or open his eyes  oh he is dead and it is all my fault said beauty crying bitterly  but then looking at him again she fancied he still breathed and hastily fetching some water from the nearest fountain she sprinkled it over his face and to her great delight he began to revive  oh beast how you frightened me she cried i never knew how much i loved you until just now when i feared i was too late to save your life  can you really love such an ugly creature as i am said the beast faintly ah beauty you only came just in time i was dying because i thought you had forgotten your promise but go back now and rest i shall see you again by and by  beauty who had half expected that he would be angry with her was reassured by his gentle voice and went back to the palace where supper was awaiting her and afterward the beast came in as usual and talked about the time she had spent with her father asking if she had enjoyed herself and if they had all been very glad to see her  beauty answered politely and quite enjoyed telling him all that had happened to her and when at last the time came for him to go and he asked as he had so often asked before beauty will you marry me  she answered softly yes dear beast  as she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the palace fireworks crackled and guns banged and across the avenue of orange trees in letters all made of fireflies was written long live the prince and his bride  turning to ask the beast what it could all mean beauty found that he had disappeared and in his place stood her longloved prince at the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace and two ladies entered the room one of them beauty recognized as the stately lady she had seen in her dreams the other was also so grand and queenly that beauty hardly knew which to greet first  but the one she already knew said to her companion  well queen this is beauty who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible enchantment they love one another and only your consent to their marriage is wanting to make them perfectly happy  i consent with all my heart cried the queen how can i ever thank you enough charming girl for having restored my dear son to his natural form  and then she tenderly embraced beauty and the prince who had meanwhile been greeting the fairy and receiving her congratulations  now said the fairy to beauty i suppose you would like me to send for all your brothers and sisters to dance at your wedding  and so she did and the marriage was celebrated the very next day with the utmost splendor and beauty and the prince lived happily ever after1   1 la belle et la bete par madame de villeneuve     the mastermaid   once upon a time there was a king who had many sons i do not exactly know how many there were but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck and after a long time the king was forced to give him leave to go when he had traveled about for several days he came to a giants house and hired himself to the giant as a servant in the morning the giant had to go out to pasture his goats and as he was leaving the house he told the kings son that he must clean out the stable and after you have done that he said you need not do any more work today for you have come to a kind master and that you shall find but what i set you to do must be done both well and thoroughly and you must on no account go into any of the rooms which lead out of the room in which you slept last night if you do i will take your life  well to be sure he is an easy master said the prince to himself as he walked up and down the room humming and singing for he thought there would be plenty of time left to clean out the stable but it would be amusing to steal a glance into his other rooms as well thought the prince for there must be something that he is afraid of my seeing as i am not allowed to enter them so he went into the first room a cauldron was hanging from the walls it was boiling but the prince could see no fire under it i wonder what is inside it he thought and dipped a lock of his hair in and the hair became just as if it were all made of copper thats a nice kind of soup if anyone were to taste that his throat would be gilded said the youth and then he went into the next chamber there too a cauldron was hanging from the wall bubbling and boiling but there was no fire under this either i will just try what this is like too said the prince thrusting another lock of his hair into it and it came out silvered over such costly soup is not to be had in my fathers palace said the prince but everything depends on how it tastes and then he went into the third room there too a cauldron was hanging from the wall boiling exactly the same as in the two other rooms and the prince took pleasure in trying this also so he dipped a lock of hair in and it came out so brightly gilded that it shone again some talk about going from bad to worse said the prince but this is better and better if he boils gold here what can he boil in there he was determined to see and went through the door into the fourth room no cauldron was to be seen there but on a bench someone was seated who was like a kings daughter but whosoever she was she was so beautiful that never in the princes life had he seen her equal  oh in heavens name what are you doing here said she who sat upon the bench  i took the place of servant here yesterday said the prince  may you soon have a better place if you have come to serve here said she  oh but i think i have got a kind master said the prince he has not given me hard work to do today when i have cleaned out the stable i shall be done  yes but how will you be able to do that she asked again if you clean it out as other people do ten pitchforksful will come in for every one you throw out but i will teach you how to do it you must turn your pitchfork upside down and work with the handle and then all will fly out of its own accord  yes i will attend to that said the prince and stayed sitting where he was the whole day for it was soon settled between them that they would marry each other he and the kings daughter so the first day of his service with the giant did not seem long to him but when evening was drawing near she said that it would now be better for him to clean out the stable before the giant came home when he got there he had a fancy to try if what she had said were true so he began to work in the same way that he had seen the stableboys doing in his fathers stables but he soon saw that he must give up that for when he had worked a very short time he had scarcely any room left to stand so he did what the princess had taught him turned the pitchfork round and worked with the handle and in the twinkling of an eye the stable was as clean as if it had been scoured when he had done that he went back again into the room in which the giant had given him leave to stay and there he walked backward and forward on the floor and began to hum and sing  then came the giant home with the goats have you cleaned the stable asked the giant  yes now it is clean and sweet master said the kings son  i shall see about that said the giant and went round to the stable but it was just as the prince had said  you have certainly been talking to my mastermaid for you never got that out of your own head said the giant  mastermaid what kind of a thing is that master said the prince making himself look as stupid as an ass i should like to see that  well you will see her quite soon enough said the giant  on the second morning the giant had again to go out with his goats so he told the prince that on that day he was to fetch home his horse which was out on the mountainside and when he had done that he might rest himself for the remainder of the day for you have come to a kind master and that you shall find said the giant once more but do not go into any of the rooms that i spoke of yesterday or i will wring your head off said he and then went away with his flock of goats  yes indeed you are a kind master said the prince but i will go in and talk to the mastermaid again perhaps before long she may like better to be mine than yours  so he went to her then she asked him what he had to do that day  oh not very dangerous work i fancy said the kings son i have only to go up the mountainside after his horse  well how do you mean to set about it asked the mastermaid  oh there is no great art in riding a horse home said the kings son i think i must have ridden friskier horses before now  yes but it is not so easy a thing as you think to ride the horse home said the mastermaid but i will teach you what to do when you go near it fire will burst out of its nostrils like flames from a pine torch but be very careful and take the bridle which is hanging by the door there and fling the bit straight into his jaws and then it will become so tame that you will be able to do what you like with it he said he would bear this in mind and then he again sat in there the whole day by the mastermaid and they chatted and talked of one thing and another but the first thing and the last now was how happy and delightful it would be if they could but marry each other and get safely away from the giant and the prince would have forgotten both the mountainside and the horse if the mastermaid had not reminded him of them as evening drew near and said that now it would be better if he went to fetch the horse before the giant came so he did this and took the bridle which was hanging on a crook and strode up the mountainside and it was not long before he met with the horse and fire and red flames streamed forth out of its nostrils but the youth carefully watched his opportunity and just as it was rushing at him with open jaws he threw the bit straight into its mouth and the horse stood as quiet as a young lamb and there was no difficulty at all in getting it home to the stable then the prince went back into his room again and began to hum and to sing  toward evening the giant came home have you fetched the horse back from the mountainside he asked  that i have master it was an amusing horse to ride but i rode him straight home and put him in the stable too said the prince  i will see about that said the giant and went out to the stable but the horse was standing there just as the prince had said you have certainly been talking with my mastermaid for you never got that out of your own head said the giant again  yesterday master you talked about this mastermaid and today you are talking about her ah heaven bless you master why will you not show me the thing for it would be a real pleasure to me to see it said the prince who again pretended to be silly and stupid  oh you will see her quite soon enough said the giant  on the morning of the third day the giant again had to go into the wood with the goats today you must go underground and fetch my taxes he said to the prince when you have done this you may rest for the remainder of the day for you shall see what an easy master you have come to and then he went away  well however easy a master you may be you set me very hard work to do thought the prince but i will see if i cannot find your mastermaid you say she is yours but for all that she may be able to tell me what to do now and he went back to her so when the mastermaid asked him what the giant had set him to do that day he told her that he was to go underground and get the taxes  and how will you set about that said the mastermaid  oh you must tell me how to do it said the prince for i have never yet been underground and even if i knew the way i do not know how much i am to demand  oh yes i will soon tell you that you must go to the rock there under the mountainridge and take the club that is there and knock on the rocky wall said the mastermaid then someone will come out who will sparkle with fire you shall tell him your errand and when he asks you how much you want to have you are to say as much as i can carry  yes i will keep that in mind said he and then he sat there with the mastermaid the whole day until night drew near and he would gladly have stayed there till now if the mastermaid had not reminded him that it was time to be off to fetch the taxes before the giant came  so he set out on his way and did exactly what the mastermaid had told him he went to the rocky wall and took the club and knocked on it then came one so full of sparks that they flew both out of his eyes and his nose what do you want said he  i was to come here for the giant and demand the tax for him said the kings son  how much are you to have then said the other  i ask for no more than i am able to carry with me said the prince  it is well for you that you have not asked for a horseload said he who had come out of the rock but now come in with me  this the prince did and what a quantity of gold and silver he saw it was lying inside the mountain like heaps of stones in a waste place and he got a load that was as large as he was able to carry and with that he went his way so in the evening when the giant came home with the goats the prince went into the chamber and hummed and sang again as he had done on the other two evenings  have you been for the tax said the giant  yes that i have master said the prince  where have you put it then said the giant again  the bag of gold is standing there on the bench said the prince  i will see about that said the giant and went away to the bench but the bag was standing there and it was so full that gold and silver dropped out when the giant untied the string  you have certainly been talking with my mastermaid said the giant and if you have i will wring your neck  mastermaid said the prince yesterday my master talked about this mastermaid and today he is talking about her again and the first day of all it was talk of the same kind i do wish i could see the thing myself said he  yes yes wait till tomorrow said the giant and then i myself will take you to her  ah master i thank youbut you are only mocking me said the kings son  next day the giant took him to the mastermaid now you shall kill him and boil him in the great big cauldron you know of and when you have got the broth ready give me a call said the giant then he lay down on the bench to sleep and almost immediately began to snore so that it sounded like thunder among the hills  so the mastermaid took a knife and cut the princes little finger and dropped three drops of blood upon a wooden stool then she took all the old rags and shoesoles and all the rubbish she could lay hands on and put them in the cauldron and then she filled a chest with gold dust and a lump of salt and a waterflask which was hanging by the door and she also took with her a golden apple and two gold chickens and then she and the prince went away with all the speed they could and when they had gone a little way they came to the sea and then they sailed but where they got the ship from i have never been able to learn  now when the giant had slept a good long time he began to stretch himself on the bench on which he was lying will it soon boil said he  it is just beginning said the first drop of blood on the stool  so the giant lay down to sleep again and slept for a long long time then he began to move about a little again will it soon be ready now said he but he did not look up this time any more than he had done the first time for he was still half asleep  half done said the second drop of blood and the giant believed it was the mastermaid again and turned himself on the bench and lay down to sleep once more when he had slept again for many hours he began to move and stretch himself is it not done yet said he  it is quite ready said the third drop of blood then the giant began to sit up and rub his eyes but he could not see who it was who had spoken to him so he asked for the mastermaid and called her but there was no one to give him an answer  ah well she has just stolen out for a little thought the giant and he took a spoon and went off to the cauldron to have a taste but there was nothing in it but shoesoles and rags and such trumpery as that and all was boiled up together so that he could not tell whether it was porridge or milk pottage when he saw this he understood what had happened and fell into such a rage that he hardly knew what he was doing away he went after the prince and the mastermaid so fast that the wind whistled behind him and it was not long before he came to the water but he could not get over it well well i will soon find a cure for that i have only to call my riversucker said the giant and he did call him so his riversucker came and lay down and drank one two three draughts and with that the water in the sea fell so low that the giant saw the mastermaid and the prince out on the sea in their ship now you must throw out the lump of salt said the mastermaid and the prince did so and it grew up into such a great high mountain right across the sea that the giant could not come over it and the riversucker could not drink any more water well well i will soon find a cure for that said the giant so he called to his hillborer to come and bore through the mountain so that the riversucker might be able to drink up the water again but just as the hole was made and the riversucker was beginning to drink the mastermaid told the prince to throw one or two drops out of the flask and when he did this the sea instantly became full of water again and before the riversucker could take one drink they reached the land and were in safety so they determined to go home to the princes father but the prince would on no account permit the mastermaid to walk there for he thought that it was unbecoming either for her or for him to go on foot  wait here the least little bit of time while i go home for the seven horses which stand in my fathers stable said he it is not far off and i shall not be long away but i will not let my betrothed bride go on foot to the palace  oh no do not go for if you go home to the kings palace you will forget me i foresee that  how could i forget you we have suffered so much evil together and love each other so much said the prince and he insisted on going home for the coach with the seven horses and she was to wait for him there by the seashore so at last the mastermaid had to yield for he was so absolutely determined to do it but when you get there you must not even give yourself time to greet anyone but go straight into the stable and take the horses and put them in the coach and drive back as quickly as you can for they will all come round about you but you must behave just as if you did not see them and on no account must you taste anything for if you do it will cause great misery both to you and to me said she and this he promised  but when he got home to the kings palace one of his brothers was just going to be married and the bride and all her kith and kin had come to the palace so they all thronged round him and questioned him about this and that and wanted him to go in with them but he behaved as if he did not see them and went straight to the stable and got out the horses and began to harness them when they saw that they could not by any means prevail on him to go in with them they came out to him with meat and drink and the best of everything that they had prepared for the wedding but the prince refused to touch anything and would do nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could at last however the brides sister rolled an apple across the yard to him and said as you wont eat anything else you may like to take a bite of that for you must be both hungry and thirsty after your long journey and he took up the apple and bit a piece out of it but no sooner had he got the piece of apple in his mouth than he forgot the mastermaid and that he was to go back in the coach to fetch her  i think i must be mad what do i want with this coach and horses said he and then he put the horses back into the stable and went into the kings palace and there it was settled that he should marry the brides sister who had rolled the apple to him  the mastermaid sat by the seashore for a long long time waiting for the prince but no prince came so she went away and when she had walked a short distance she came to a little hut which stood all alone in a small wood hard by the kings palace she entered it and asked if she might be allowed to stay there the hut belonged to an old crone who was also an illtempered and malicious troll at first she would not let the mastermaid remain with her but at last after a long time by means of good words and good payment she obtained leave but the hut was as dirty and black inside as a pigsty so the mastermaid said that she would smarten it up a little that it might look a little more like what other peoples houses looked inside the old crone did not like this either she scowled and was very cross but the mastermaid did not trouble herself about that she took out her chest of gold and flung a handful of it or so into the fire and the gold boiled up and poured out over the whole of the hut until every part of it both inside and out was gilded but when the gold began to bubble up the old hag grew so terrified that she fled as if the evil one himself were pursuing her and she did not remember to stoop down as she went through the doorway and so she split her head and died next morning the sheriff came traveling by there he was greatly astonished when he saw the gold hut shining and glittering there in the copse and he was still more astonished when he went in and caught sight of the beautiful young maiden who was sitting there he fell in love with her at once and straightway on the spot he begged her both prettily and kindly to marry him  well but have you a great deal of money said the mastermaid  oh yes so far as that is concerned i am not ill off said the sheriff so now he had to go home to get the money and in the evening he came back bringing with him a bag with two bushels in it which he set down on the bench well as he had such a fine lot of money the mastermaid said she would have him so they sat down to talk  but scarcely had they sat down together before the mastermaid wanted to jump up again i have forgotten to see to the fire she said  why should you jump up to do that said the sheriff i will do that so he jumped up and went to the chimney in one bound  just tell me when you have got hold of the shovel said the mastermaid  well i have hold of it now said the sheriff  then you may hold the shovel and the shovel you and pour redhot coals over you till day dawns said the mastermaid so the sheriff had to stand there the whole night and pour redhot coals over himself and no matter how much he cried and begged and entreated the redhot coals did not grow the colder for that when the day began to dawn and he had power to throw down the shovel he did not stay long where he was but ran away as fast as he possibly could and everyone who met him stared and looked after him for he was flying as if he were mad and he could not have looked worse if he had been both flayed and tanned and everyone wondered where he had been but for very shame he would tell nothing  the next day the attorney came riding by the place where the mastermaid dwelt he saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood and he too went into it to see who lived there and when he entered and saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than the sheriff had done and began to woo her at once so the mastermaid asked him as she had asked the sheriff if he had a great deal of money and the attorney said he was not ill off for that and would at once go home to get it and at night he came with a great big sack of moneythis time it was a fourbushel sackand set it on the bench by the mastermaid so she promised to have him and he sat down on the bench by her to arrange about it but suddenly she said that she had forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night and must do it  why should you do that said the attorney sit still i will do it  so he was on his feet in a moment and out in the porch  tell me when you have got hold of the doorlatch said the mastermaid  i have hold of it now cried the attorney  then you may hold the door and the door you and may you go between wall and wall till day dawns  what a dance the attorney had that night he had never had such a waltz before and he never wished to have such a dance again sometimes he was in front of the door and sometimes the door was in front of him and it went from one side of the porch to the other till the attorney was wellnigh beaten to death at first he began to abuse the mastermaid and then to beg and pray but the door did not care for anything but keeping him where he was till break of day  as soon as the door let go its hold of him off went the attorney he forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered he forgot both his sack of money and his wooing for he was so afraid lest the housedoor should come dancing after him everyone who met him stared and looked after him for he was flying like a madman and he could not have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night long  on the third day the bailiff came by and he too saw the gold house in the little wood and he too felt that he must go and see who lived there and when he caught sight of the mastermaid he became so much in love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her  the mastermaid answered him as she had answered the other two that if he had a great deal of money she would have him so far as that is concerned i am not ill off said the bailiff so he was at once told to go home and fetch it and this he did at night he came back and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought it must have been at least six bushels and he set it down on the bench so it was settled that he was to have the mastermaid but hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf and must go out to put it in the byre  no indeed you shall not do that said the bailiff i am the one to do that and big and fat as he was he went out as briskly as a boy  tell me when you have got hold of the calfs tail said the mastermaid  i have hold of it now cried the bailiff  then may you hold the calfs tail and the calfs tail hold you and may you go round the world together till day dawns said the mastermaid so the bailiff had to bestir himself for the calf went over rough and smooth over hill and dale and the more the bailiff cried and screamed the faster the calf went when daylight began to appear the bailiff was half dead and so glad was he to leave loose of the calfs tail that he forgot the sack of money and all else he walked now slowlymore slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done but the slower he went the more time had everyone to stare and look at him and they used it too and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf  on the following day the wedding was to take place in the kings palace and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister but when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the tracepins broke and though they made one two and three to put in its place that did not help them for each broke in turn no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of this went on for a long time and they could not get away from the palace so they were all in great trouble then the sheriff said for he too had been bidden to the wedding at court yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire i know very well that it will hold fast so they sent off a messenger to the thicket and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovelhandle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused so now they had a tracepin which would not snap in two  but all at once just as they were starting the bottom of the coach fell in pieces they made a new bottom as fast as they could but no matter how they nailed it together or what kind of wood they used no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the tracepin then the attorney said for he too was at the wedding in the palace away there in the thicket dwells a maiden and if you could but get her to lend you onehalf of her porchdoor i am certain that it will hold together so they again sent a messenger to the thicket and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porchdoor of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once they were just setting out again but now the horses were not able to draw the coach they had six horses already and now they put in eight and then ten and then twelve but the more they put in and the more the coachman whipped them the less good it did and the coach never stirred from the spot it was already beginning to be late in the day and to church they must and would go so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress then the bailiff spoke up and said out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl and if you could but get her to lend you her calf i know it could draw the coach even if it were as heavy as a mountain they all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more and beg as prettily as they could on behalf of the king that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about the mastermaid let them have it immediatelythis time also she would not say no  then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move and away it went over rough and smooth over stock and stone so that they could scarcely breathe and sometimes they were on the ground and sometimes up in the air and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinningwheel and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church and when they went back again the coach went quicker still so that most of them did not know how they got back to the palace at all  when they had seated themselves at the table the prince who had been in service with the giant said that he thought they ought to have invited the maiden who had lent them the shovelhandle and the porchdoor and the calf up to the palace for said he if we had not got these three things we should never have got away from the palace  the king also thought that this was both just and proper so he sent five of his best men down to the gilded hut to greet the maiden courteously from the king and to beg her to be so good as to come up to the palace to dinner at midday  greet the king and tell him that if he is too good to come to me i am too good to come to him replied the mastermaid  so the king had to go himself and the mastermaid went with him immediately and as the king believed that she was more than she appeared to be he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest bridegroom when they had sat at the table for a short time the mastermaid took out the cock and the hen and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the giants house and set them on the table in front of her and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple  oh look how those two there are fighting for the golden apple said the kings son  yes and so did we two fight to get out that time when we were in the mountain said the mastermaid  so the prince knew her again and you may imagine how delighted he was he ordered the trollwitch who had rolled the apple to him to be torn in pieces between fourandtwenty horses so that not a bit of her was left and then for the first time they began really to keep the wedding and weary as they were the sheriff the attorney and the bailiff kept it up too1   1 asbjornsen and moe     why the sea is salt   once upon a time long long ago there were two brothers the one rich and the other poor when christmas eve came the poor one had not a bite in the house either of meat or bread so he went to his brother and begged him in gods name to give him something for christmas day it was by no means the first time that the brother had been forced to give something to him and he was not better pleased at being asked now than he generally was  if you will do what i ask you you shall have a whole ham said he the poor one immediately thanked him and promised this  well here is the ham and now you must go straight to dead mans hall said the rich brother throwing the ham to him  well i will do what i have promised said the other and he took the ham and set off he went on and on for the livelong day and at nightfall he came to a place where there was a bright light  i have no doubt this is the place thought the man with the ham  an old man with a long white beard was standing in the outhouse chopping yule logs  goodevening said the man with the ham  goodevening to you where are you going at this late hour said the man  i am going to dead mans hall if only i am on the right track answered the poor man  oh yes you are right enough for it is here said the old man when you get inside they will all want to buy your ham for they dont get much meat to eat there but you must not sell it unless you can get the handmill which stands behind the door for it when you come out again i will teach you how to stop the handmill which is useful for almost everything  so the man with the ham thanked the other for his good advice and rapped at the door  when he got in everything happened just as the old man had said it would all the people great and small came round him like ants on an anthill and each tried to outbid the other for the ham  by rights my old woman and i ought to have it for our christmas dinner but since you have set your hearts upon it i must just give it up to you said the man but if i sell it i will have the handmill which is standing there behind the door  at first they would not hear of this and haggled and bargained with the man but he stuck to what he had said and the people were forced to give him the handmill when the man came out again into the yard he asked the old woodcutter how he was to stop the handmill and when he had learned that he thanked him and set off home with all the speed he could but did not get there until after the clock had struck twelve on christmas eve  where in the world have you been said the old woman here i have sat waiting hour after hour and have not even two sticks to lay across each other under the christmas porridgepot  oh i could not come before i had something of importance to see about and a long way to go too but now you shall just see said the man and then he set the handmill on the table and bade it first grind light then a tablecloth and then meat and beer and everything else that was good for a christmas eves supper and the mill ground all that he ordered bless me said the old woman as one thing after another appeared and she wanted to know where her husband had got the mill from but he would not tell her that  never mind where i got it you can see that it is a good one and the water that turns it will never freeze said the man so he ground meat and drink and all kinds of good things to last all christmastide and on the third day he invited all his friends to come to a feast  now when the rich brother saw all that there was at the banquet and in the house he was both vexed and angry for he grudged everything his brother had on christmas eve he was so poor that he came to me and begged for a trifle for gods sake and now he gives a feast as if he were both a count and a king thought he but for heavens sake tell me where you got your riches from said he to his brother  from behind the door said he who owned the mill for he did not choose to satisfy his brother on that point but later in the evening when he had taken a drop too much he could not refrain from telling how he had come by the handmill there you see what has brought me all my wealth said he and brought out the mill and made it grind first one thing and then another when the brother saw that he insisted on having the mill and after a great deal of persuasion got it but he had to give three hundred dollars for it and the poor brother was to keep it till the haymaking was over for he thought if i keep it as long as that i can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year during that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty and when hayharvest came the rich brother got it but the other had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it it was evening when the rich man got the mill home and in the morning he bade the old woman go out and spread the hay after the mowers and he would attend to the house himself that day he said  so when dinnertime drew near he set the mill on the kitchentable and said grind herrings and milk pottage and do it both quickly and well  so the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage and first all the dishes and tubs were filled and then it came out all over the kitchenfloor the man twisted and turned it and did all he could to make the mill stop but howsoever he turned it and screwed it the mill went on grinding and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned so he threw open the parlor door but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the doorlatch when he got the door open he did not stay long in the room but ran out and the herrings and pottage came after him and it streamed out over both farm and field now the old woman who was out spreading the hay began to think dinner was long in coming and said to the women and the mowers though the master does not call us home we may as well go it may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and i should do well to help him so they began to straggle homeward but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread all pouring forth and winding about one over the other and the man himself in front of the flood would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs take care that you are not drowned in the pottage he cried as he went by them as if mischief were at his heels down to where his brother dwelt then he begged him for gods sake to take the mill back again and that in an instant for said he if it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage but the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars and that he was obliged to do now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again so it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived but the mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold and the farmhouse lay close by the seashore so it shone and glittered far out to sea everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill for the report of it spread far and wide and there was no one who had not heard tell of it  after a long long time came also a skipper who wished to see the mill he asked if it could make salt yes it could make salt said he who owned it and when the skipper heard that he wished with all his might and main to have the mill let it cost what it might for he thought if he had it he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous sea for freights of salt at first the man would not hear of parting with it but the skipper begged and prayed and at last the man sold it to him and got many many thousand dollars for it when the skipper had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long for he was so afraid that the man would change his mind and he had no time to ask how he was to stop it grinding but got on board his ship as fast as he could  when he had gone a little way out to sea he took the mill on deck grind salt and grind both quickly and well said the skipper so the mill began to grind salt till it spouted out like water and when the skipper had got the ship filled he wanted to stop the mill but whichsoever way he turned it and how much soever he tried it went on grinding and the heap of salt grew higher and higher until at last the ship sank there lies the mill at the bottom of the sea and still day by day it grinds on and that is why the sea is salt1   1 asbjornsen and moe     the master cat or puss in boots   there was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than his mill his ass and his cat the partition was soon made neither scrivener nor attorney was sent for they would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony the eldest had the mill the second the ass and the youngest nothing but the cat the poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot  my brothers said he may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together but for my part when i have eaten up my cat and made me a muff of his skin i must die of hunger  the cat who heard all this but made as if he did not said to him with a grave and serious air  do not thus afflict yourself my good master you have nothing else to do but to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me that i may scamper through the dirt and the brambles and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine  the cats master did not build very much upon what he said he had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice as when he used to hang by the heels or hide himself in the meal and make as if he were dead so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition when the cat had what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly and putting his bag about his neck he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits he put bran and sowthistle into his bag and stretching out at length as if he had been dead he waited for some young rabbits not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it  scarce was he lain down but he had what he wanted a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag and monsieur puss immediately drawing close the strings took and killed him without pity proud of his prey he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty he was shown upstairs into the kings apartment and making a low reverence said to him  i have brought you sir a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the marquis of carabas for that was the title which puss was pleased to give his master has commanded me to present to your majesty from him  tell thy master said the king that i thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure  another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn holding still his bag open and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew the strings and so caught them both he went and made a present of these to the king as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren the king in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure and ordered him some money for drink  the cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his majesty from time to time game of his masters taking one day in particular when he knew for certain that he was to take the air along the riverside with his daughter the most beautiful princess in the world he said to his master  if you will follow my advice your fortune is made you have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river in that part i shall show you and leave the rest to me  the marquis of carabas did what the cat advised him to without knowing why or wherefore while he was washing the king passed by and the cat began to cry out  help help my lord marquis of carabas is going to be drowned  at this noise the king put his head out of the coachwindow and finding it was the cat who had so often brought him such good game he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the marquis of carabas while they were drawing the poor marquis out of the river the cat came up to the coach and told the king that while his master was washing there came by some rogues who went off with his clothes though he had cried out thieves thieves several times as loud as he could  this cunning cat had hidden them under a great stone the king immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord marquis of carabas  the king caressed him after a very extraordinary manner and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien for he was well made and very handsome in his person the kings daughter took a secret inclination to him and the marquis of carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction the king would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing the cat quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed marched on before and meeting with some countrymen who were mowing a meadow he said to them  good people you who are mowing if you do not tell the king that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord marquis of carabas you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot  the king did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged  to my lord marquis of carabas answered they altogether for the cats threats had made them terribly afraid  you see sir said the marquis this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year  the master cat who went still on before met with some reapers and said to them  good people you who are reaping if you do not tell the king that all this corn belongs to the marquis of carabas you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot  the king who passed by a moment after would needs know to whom all that corn which he then saw did belong  to my lord marquis of carabas replied the reapers and the king was very well pleased with it as well as the marquis whom he congratulated thereupon the master cat who went always before said the same words to all he met and the king was astonished at the vast estates of my lord marquis of carabas  monsieur puss came at last to a stately castle the master of which was an ogre the richest had ever been known for all the lands which the king had then gone over belonged to this castle the cat who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do asked to speak with him saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him  the ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do and made him sit down  i have been assured said the cat that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to you can for example transform yourself into a lion or elephant and the like  that is true answered the ogre very briskly and to convince you you shall see me now become a lion  puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter not without abundance of trouble and danger because of his boots which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles a little while after when puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form he came down and owned he had been very much frightened  i have been moreover informed said the cat but i know not how to believe it that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals for example to change yourself into a rat or a mouse but i must own to you i take this to be impossible  impossible cried the ogre you shall see that presently  and at the same time he changed himself into a mouse and began to run about the floor puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up  meanwhile the king who saw as he passed this fine castle of the ogres had a mind to go into it puss who heard the noise of his majestys coach running over the drawbridge ran out and said to the king  your majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord marquis of carabas  what my lord marquis cried the king and does this castle also belong to you there can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it let us go into it if you please  the marquis gave his hand to the princess and followed the king who went first they passed into a spacious hall where they found a magnificent collation which the ogre had prepared for his friends who were that very day to visit him but dared not to enter knowing the king was there his majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord marquis of carabas as was his daughter who had fallen violently in love with him and seeing the vast estate he possessed said to him after having drunk five or six glasses  it will be owing to yourself only my lord marquis if you are not my soninlaw  the marquis making several low bows accepted the honor which his majesty conferred upon him and forthwith that very same day married the princess  puss became a great lord and never ran after mice any more but only for his diversion1   1 charles perrault     felicia and the pot of pinks   once upon a time there was a poor laborer who feeling that he had not much longer to live wished to divide his possessions between his son and daughter whom he loved dearly  so he called them to him and said your mother brought me as her dowry two stools and a straw bed i have besides a hen a pot of pinks and a silver ring which were given me by a noble lady who once lodged in my poor cottage when she went away she said to me  be careful of my gifts good man see that you do not lose the ring or forget to water the pinks as for your daughter i promise you that she shall be more beautiful than anyone you ever saw in your life call her felicia and when she grows up give her the ring and the pot of pinks to console her for her poverty take them both then my dear child he added and your brother shall have everything else  the two children seemed quite contented and when their father died they wept for him and divided his possessions as he had told them felicia believed that her brother loved her but when she sat down upon one of the stools he said angrily  keep your pot of pinks and your ring but let my things alone i like order in my house  felicia who was very gentle said nothing but stood up crying quietly while bruno for that was her brothers name sat comfortably by the fire presently when suppertime came bruno had a delicious egg and he threw the shell to felicia saying  there that is all i can give you if you dont like it go out and catch frogs there are plenty of them in the marsh close by felicia did not answer but she cried more bitterly than ever and went away to her own little room she found it filled with the sweet scent of the pinks and going up to them she said sadly  beautiful pinks you are so sweet and so pretty you are the only comfort i have left be very sure that i will take care of you and water you well and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your stems  as she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry so taking her pitcher she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain which was at some distance when she reached it she sat down upon the brink to rest but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming toward her surrounded by numbers of attendants six maids of honor carried her train and she leaned upon the arm of another  when they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her under which was placed a sofa of clothofgold and presently a dainty supper was served upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal while the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the softest music  felicia was hidden in the shade too much astonished by all she saw to venture to move but in a few moments the queen said  i fancy i see a shepherdess near that tree bid her come hither  so felicia came forward and saluted the queen timidly but with so much grace that all were surprised  what are you doing here my pretty child asked the queen are you not afraid of robbers  ah madam said felicia a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose does not fear robbers  you are not very rich then said the queen smiling  i am so poor answered felicia that a pot of pinks and a silver ring are my only possessions in the world  but you have a heart said the queen what should you say if anybody wanted to steal that  i do not know what it is like to lose ones heart madam she replied but i have always heard that without a heart one cannot live and if it is broken one must die and in spite of my poverty i should be sorry not to live  you are quite right to take care of your heart pretty one said the queen but tell me have you supped  no madam answered felicia my brother ate all the supper there was  then the queen ordered that a place should be made for her at the table and herself loaded felicias plate with good things but she was too much astonished to be hungry  i want to know what you were doing at the fountain so late said the queen presently  i came to fetch a pitcher of water for my pinks madam she answered stooping to pick up the pitcher which stood beside her but when she showed it to the queen she was amazed to see that it had turned to gold all sparkling with great diamonds and the water of which it was full was more fragrant than the sweetest roses she was afraid to take it until the queen said  it is yours felicia go and water your pinks with it and let it remind you that the queen of the woods is your friend  the shepherdess threw herself at the queens feet and thanked her humbly for her gracious words  ah madam she cried if i might beg you to stay here a moment i would run and fetch my pot of pinks for youthey could not fall into better hands  go felicia said the queen stroking her cheek softly i will wait here until you come back  so felicia took up her pitcher and ran to her little room but while she had been away bruno had gone in and taken the pot of pinks leaving a great cabbage in its place when she saw the unlucky cabbage felicia was much distressed and did not know what to do but at last she ran back to the fountain and kneeling before the queen said  madam bruno has stolen my pot of pinks so i have nothing but my silver ring but i beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude  but if i take your ring my pretty shepherdess said the queen you will have nothing left and what will you do then  ah madam she answered simply if i have your friendship i shall do very well  so the queen took the ring and put it on her finger and mounted her chariot which was made of coral studded with emeralds and drawn by six milkwhite horses and felicia looked after her until the winding of the forest path hid her from her sight and then she went back to the cottage thinking over all the wonderful things that had happened  the first thing she did when she reached her room was to throw the cabbage out of the window  but she was very much surprised to hear an odd little voice cry out oh i am half killed and could not tell where it came from because cabbages do not generally speak  as soon as it was light felicia who was very unhappy about her pot of pinks went out to look for it and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage she gave it a push with her foot saying what are you doing here and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of pinks  if i hadnt been carried replied the cabbage you may be very sure that i shouldnt have thought of going there  it made her shiver with fright to hear the cabbage talk but he went on  if you will be good enough to plant me by my comrades again i can tell you where your pinks are at this momenthidden in brunos bed  felicia was in despair when she heard this not knowing how she was to get them back but she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place and as she finished doing it she saw brunos hen and said catching hold of it  come here horrid little creature you shall suffer for all the unkind things my brother has done to me  ah shepherdess said the hen dont kill me i am rather a gossip and i can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear dont imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought you up your mother was a queen who had six girls already and the king threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she should have her head cut off  so when the queen had another little daughter she was quite frightened and agreed with her sister who was a fairy to exchange her for the fairys little son now the queen had been shut up in a great tower by the kings orders and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder taking her little baby with her after wandering about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this cottage i was the laborers wife and was a good nurse and the queen gave you into my charge and told me all her misfortunes and then died before she had time to say what was to become of you  as i never in all my life could keep a secret i could not help telling this strange tale to my neighbors and one day a beautiful lady came here and i told it to her also when i had finished she touched me with a wand she held in her hand and instantly i became a hen and there was an end of my talking i was very sad and my husband who was out when it happened never knew what had become of me after seeking me everywhere he believed that i must have been drowned or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest that same lady came here once more and commanded that you should be called felicia and left the ring and the pot of pinks to be given to you and while she was in the house twentyfive of the kings guards came to search for you doubtless meaning to kill you but she muttered a few words and immediately they all turned into cabbages it was one of them whom you threw out of your window yesterday  i dont know how it was that he could speaki have never heard either of them say a word before nor have i been able to do it myself until now  the princess was greatly astonished at the hens story and said kindly i am truly sorry for you my poor nurse and wish it was in my power to restore you to your real form but we must not despair it seems to me after what you have told me that something must be going to happen soon just now however i must go and look for my pinks which i love better than anything in the world  bruno had gone out into the forest never thinking that felicia would search in his room for the pinks and she was delighted by his unexpected absence and thought to get them back without further trouble but as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army of rats who were guarding the straw bed and when she attempted to approach it they sprang at her biting and scratching furiously quite terrified she drew back crying out oh my dear pinks how can you stay here in such bad company  then she suddenly bethought herself of the pitcher of water and hoping that it might have some magic power she ran to fetch it and sprinkled a few drops over the fiercelooking swarm of rats in a moment not a tail or a whisker was to be seen each one had made for his hole as fast as his legs could carry him so that the princess could safely take her pot of pinks she found them nearly dying for want of water and hastily poured all that was left in the pitcher upon them as she bent over them enjoying their delicious scent a soft voice that seemed to rustle among the leaves said  lovely felicia the day has come at last when i may have the happiness of telling you how even the flowers love you and rejoice in your beauty  the princess quite overcome by the strangeness of hearing a cabbage a hen and a pink speak and by the terrible sight of an army of rats suddenly became very pale and fainted away  at this moment in came bruno working hard in the heat had not improved his temper and when he saw that felicia had succeeded in finding her pinks he was so angry that he dragged her out into the garden and shut the door upon her the fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes and there before her stood the queen of the woods looking as charming as ever  you have a bad brother she said i saw he turned you out shall i punish him for it  ah no madam she said i am not angry with him  but supposing he was not your brother after all what would you say then asked the queen  oh but i think he must be said felicia  what said the queen have you not heard that you are a princess  i was told so a little while ago madam but how could i believe it without a single proof  ah dear child said the queen the way you speak assures me that in spite of your humble upbringing you are indeed a real princess and i can save you from being treated in such a way again  she was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man he wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps and had a crown of pinks on his head he knelt upon one knee and kissed the queens hand  ah she cried my pink my dear son what a happiness to see you restored to your natural shape by felicias aid and she embraced him joyfully then turning to felicia she said  charming princess i know all the hen told you but you cannot have heard that the zephyrs to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the queen your mother so anxiously waited for him left him instead in a garden of flowers while they flew off to tell your mother whereupon a fairy with whom i had quarrelled changed him into a pink and i could do nothing to prevent it  you can imagine how angry i was and how i tried to find some means of undoing the mischief she had done but there was no help for it i could only bring prince pink to the place where you were being brought up hoping that when you grew up he might love you and by your care be restored to his natural form and you see everything has come right as i hoped it would your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over and my enemys last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats that she did not succeed in doing so now my dear felicia if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him  madam replied felicia blushing you overwhelm me with your kindness i know that you are my mothers sister and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages and my nurse into a hen and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that i shall marry your son how can i explain to you the cause of my hesitation i feel for the first time in my life how happy it would make me to be beloved can you indeed give me the princes heart  it is yours already lovely princess he cried taking her hand in his but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent i should have told you long ago how dearly i love you  this made the princess very happy and the queen who could not bear to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess touched her with her wand saying  i wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty and immediately the princesss cotton dress became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds from which floated a clear white veil with her bright eyes and the charming color in her cheeks she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the prince could hardly bear it  how pretty you are felicia he cried dont keep me in suspense i entreat you say that you will marry me  ah said the queen smiling i think she will not refuse now  just then bruno who was going back to his work came out of the cottage and thought he must be dreaming when he saw felicia but she called him very kindly and begged the queen to take pity on him  what she said when he was so unkind to you  ah madam said the princess i am so happy that i should like everybody else to be happy too  the queen kissed her and said well to please you let me see what i can do for this cross bruno and with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid palace full of treasures only the two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were to remind him of his former poverty then the queen touched bruno himself and made him gentle and polite and grateful and he thanked her and the princess a thousand times lastly the queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms and left them all very contented the prince and princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor and lived happily ever after1   1 fortunee par madame la comtesse daulnoy     the white cat   once upon a time there was a king who had three sons who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead now the king though he felt that he was growing old did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them  so he sent for them all and after speaking to them kindly he added  you will quite agree with me my dear children that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as i once did i begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects therefore i wish that one of you should succeed to my crown but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me now as i think of retiring into the country it seems to me that a pretty lively faithful little dog would be very good company for me so without any regard for your ages i promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once  the three princes were greatly surprised by their fathers sudden fancy for a little dog but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection they accepted the commission with pleasure they bade farewell to the king who gave them presents of silver and precious stones and appointed to meet them at the same hour in the same place after a year had passed to see the little dogs they had brought for him  then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city accompanied by all their particular friends to whom they gave a grand banquet and the three brothers promised to be friends always to share whatever good fortune befell them and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy and so they set out agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time to present themselves before the king together each one took a different road and the two eldest met with many adventures but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear he was young and gay and handsome and knew everything that a prince ought to know and as for his courage there was simply no end to it  hardly a day passed without his buying several dogsbig and little greyhounds mastiffs spaniels and lapdogs as soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one as being alone he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him he journeyed from day to day not knowing where he was going until at last just at nightfall he reached a great gloomy forest he did not know his way and to make matters worse it began to thunder and the rain poured down he took the first path he could find and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night at length guided by the light he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined this door was of gold covered with carbuncles and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest the walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors and the prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them but as he was terribly wet and the rain still fell in torrents he could not stay to look about any more but came back to the golden door there he saw a deers foot hanging by a chain of diamonds and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle  they must feel very secure against robbers he said to himself what is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles and making himself rich for life  he pulled the deers foot and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open but the prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air each holding a torch he was so much surprised that he stood quite still until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands so that though he was somewhat uneasy he could not help going on with his hand on his sword to be prepared for whatever might happen he entered a hall paved with lapislazuli while two lovely voices sang        the hands you see floating above        will swiftly your bidding obey      if your heart dreads not conquering love        in this place you may fearlessly stay   the prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way so guided by the mysterious hands he went toward a door of coral which opened of its own accord and he found himself in a vast hall of motherofpearl out of which opened a number of other rooms glittering with thousands of lights and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the prince felt quite bewildered after passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped and the prince saw a most comfortablelooking armchair drawn up close to the chimneycorner at the same moment the fire lighted itself and the pretty soft clever hands took off the princes wet muddy clothes and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs all embroidered with gold and emeralds he could not help admiring everything he saw and the deft way in which the hands waited on him though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump  when he was quite readyand i can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary prince who had stood outside in the rain and pulled the deers footthe hands led him to a splendid room upon the walls of which were painted the histories of puss in boots and a number of other famous cats the table was laid for supper with two golden plates and golden spoons and forks and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones the prince was wondering who the second place could be for when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music who took their places at one end of the room and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars making the strangest kind of music that could be heard the prince hastily stopped up his ears but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter  what funny thing shall i see next he said to himself and instantly the door opened and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil it was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords and a large party of cats followed who brought in cages full of rats and mice  the prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine she looked very young and very sad and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the prince  kings son you are welcome the queen of the cats is glad to see you  lady cat replied the prince i thank you for receiving me so kindly but surely you are no ordinary pussycat indeed the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly  kings son said the white cat i beg you to spare me these compliments for i am not used to them but now she added let supper be served and let the musicians be silent as the prince does not understand what they are saying  so the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper and first they put on the table two dishes one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice the sight of the latter made the prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all but the white cat seeing this assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice and the prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the white cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait and he begged to be allowed to look at it to his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait the white cat sighed as he looked at it and seemed sadder than ever and the prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her so he began to talk about other things and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world after supper they went into another room which was fitted up as a theatre and the cats acted and danced for their amusement and then the white cat said goodnight to him and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before hung with tapestry worked with butterflies wings of every color there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons the prince went to bed in silence as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume when he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard some leading greyhounds some blowing horns for the white cat was going out hunting the hands led a wooden horse up to the prince and seemed to expect him to mount it at which he was very indignant but it was no use for him to object for he speedily found himself upon its back and it pranced gaily off with him  the white cat herself was riding a monkey which climbed even up to the eagles nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets never was there a pleasanter hunting party and when they returned to the castle the prince and the white cat supped together as before but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet which must have contained a magic draught for as soon as he had swallowed its contents he forgot everything even the little dog that he was seeking for the king and only thought how happy he was to be with the white cat and so the days passed in every kind of amusement until the year was nearly gone the prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers he did not even know what country he belonged to but the white cat knew when he ought to go back and one day she said to him  do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father and your brothers have found lovely ones  then the prince suddenly recovered his memory and cried  what can have made me forget such an important thing my whole fortune depends upon it and even if i could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom where should i find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days and he began to be very vexed but the white cat said to him kings son do not trouble yourself i am your friend and will make everything easy for you you can still stay here for a day as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours  i thank you beautiful cat said the prince but what good will it do me to get back if i have not a dog to take to my father  see here answered the white cat holding up an acorn there is a prettier one in this than in the dogstar  oh white cat dear said the prince how unkind you are to laugh at me now  only listen she said holding the acorn to his ear  and inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say bowwow  the prince was delighted for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must be very small indeed he wanted to take it out and look at it but the white cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the king in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey he thanked her a thousand times and said goodby quite sadly when the time came for him to set out  the days have passed so quickly with you he said i only wish i could take you with me now  but the white cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer  after all the prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers but they came soon after and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter  the prince met them joyfully and they began to tell him all their adventures but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the king fond as they all were of one another the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance the next morning they started in the same chariot the elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them as for the turnspit he ran after the chariot and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all when they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the kings great hall and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier they were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally when the youngest stepped forward drawing from his pocket the acorn the white cat had given him he opened it quickly and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring the prince laid it upon the ground and it got up at once and began to dance the king did not know what to say for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature nevertheless as he was in no hurry to part with his crown he told his sons that as they had been so successful the first time he would ask them to go once again and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle the brothers were not very willing to set out again but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance and they started as before the youngest again mounted the wooden horse and rode back at full speed to his beloved white cat every door of the castle stood wide open and every window and turret was illuminated so it looked more wonderful than before the hands hastened to meet him and led the wooden horse off to the stable while he hurried in to find the white cat she was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion but she very soon started up when she heard the prince and was overjoyed at seeing him once more  how could i hope that you would come back to me kings son she said and then he stroked and petted her and told her of his successful journey and how he had come back to ask her help as he believed that it was impossible to find what the king demanded the white cat looked serious and said she must think what was to be done but that luckily there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well and if anybody could manage it they could and she would set them the task herself  and then the hands appeared carrying torches and conducted the prince and the white cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts after which they had supper which the prince liked even better than the fireworks for it was very late and he was hungry after his long ride and so the days passed quickly as before it was impossible to feel dull with the white cat and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusementsindeed she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be but when the prince asked her how it was that she was so wise she only said  kings son do not ask me guess what you please i may not tell you anything  the prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time but presently the white cat told him that the year was gone and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin as they had made it very well  this time she added i can give you a suitable escort and on looking out into the courtyard the prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices it was drawn by twelve snowwhite horses harnessed four abreast their trappings were flamecolored velvet embroidered with diamonds a hundred chariots followed each drawn by eight horses and filled with officers in splendid uniforms and a thousand guards surrounded the procession go said the white cat and when you appear before the king in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve take this walnut but do not open it until you are before him then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for  lovely blanchette said the prince how can i thank you properly for all your kindness to me only tell me that you wish it and i will give up for ever all thought of being king and will stay here with you always  kings son she replied it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat who is good for nothing but to catch mice but you must not stay  so the prince kissed her little paw and set out you can imagine how fast he traveled when i tell you that they reached the kings palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there this time the prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle so they thought he could not be coming and were rather glad of it and displayed their pieces of muslin to the king proudly feeling sure of success and indeed the stuff was very fine and would go through the eye of a very large needle but the king who was only too glad to make a difficulty sent for a particular needle which was kept among the crown jewels and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it the princes were angry and were beginning to complain that it was a trick when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest prince came in his father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it fully expecting to find the piece of muslin but instead there was only a hazelnut he cracked it and there lay a cherrystone everybody was looking on and the king was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding the piece of muslin in a nutshell  however the prince cracked the cherrystone but everyone laughed when he saw it contained only its own kernel he opened that and found a grain of wheat and in that was a millet seed then he himself began to wonder and muttered softly  white cat white cat are you making fun of me  in an instant he felt a cats claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease the king turned pale and the other princes stood silent and sorrowful for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world  presently the king turned to his sons and said with a deep sigh  nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your willingness to gratify my wishes go then once more and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her and shall without further delay receive the crown for my successor must certainly be married the prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot and surrounded by his escort returned to the white cat faster than he had come this time she was expecting him the path was strewn with flowers and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival the white cat waited for him well kings son she said here you are once more without a crown madam said he thanks to your generosity i have earned one twice over but the fact is that my father is so loth to part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it  never mind she answered its just as well to try and deserve it as you must take back a lovely princess with you next time i will be on the lookout for one for you in the meantime let us enjoy ourselves tonight i have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on purpose to amuse you so this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones sometimes the prince could not help asking the white cat how it was she could talk  perhaps you are a fairy he said or has some enchanter changed you into a cat  but she only gave him answers that told him nothing days go by so quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the prince would never have thought of its being time to go back when one evening as they sat together the white cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she told him  take this sword she said and cut off my head  i cried the prince i cut off your head blanchette darling how could i do it  i entreat you to do as i tell you kings son she replied  the tears came into the princes eyes as he begged her to ask him anything but thatto set him any task she pleased as a proof of his devotion but to spare him the grief of killing his dear pussy but nothing he could say altered her determination and at last he drew his sword and desperately with a trembling hand cut off the little white head but imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him and while he was still speechless with amazement the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered each carrying a cats skin they hastened with every sign of joy to the princess kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape she received them graciously but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the prince to whom she said  you see prince that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat my father reigned over six kingdoms the queen my mother whom he loved dearly had a passion for traveling and exploring and when i was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales and set out taking with her a number of her attendants on the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies nobody had ever been into it but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else she began to wish to try them for herself and turned her steps in the direction of the garden on arriving at the door which blazed with gold and jewels she ordered her servants to knock loudly but it was useless it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit the more the queen was determined that have it she would so she ordered that they should bring ladders and get over the wall into the garden but though the wall did not look very high and they tied the ladders together to make them very long it was quite impossible to get to the top  the queen was in despair but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were and went to bed herself feeling quite ill she was so disappointed in the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened and saw to her surprise a tiny ugly old woman seated by her bedside who said to her  i must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit but to save you annoyance my sisters and i will consent to give you as much as you can carry away on one conditionthat is that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own  ah my dear madam cried the queen is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit i will give you my kingdoms willingly  no replied the old fairy we will have nothing but your little daughter she shall be as happy as the day is long and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairyland but you must not see her again until she is married  though it is a hard condition said the queen i consent for i shall certainly die if i do not taste the fruit and so i should lose my little daughter either way  so the old fairy led her into the castle and though it was still the middle of the night the queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told which you can easily believe prince said the white cat when i tell you that it was this castle that we are now in will you gather the fruit yourself queen said the old fairy or shall i call it to come to you  i beg you to let me see it come when it is called cried the queen that will be something quite new the old fairy whistled twice then she cried  apricots peaches nectarines cherries plums pears melons grapes apples oranges lemons gooseberries strawberries raspberries come  and in an instant they came tumbling in one over another and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt and the queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them you see they grew upon fairy trees  the old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry then she reminded the queen of her agreement and led her back to the camp and next morning she went back to her kingdom but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain and when the king came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened and asked what was the matter at first the queen was afraid to tell him but when as soon as they reached the palace five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me she was obliged to confess what she had promised the king was very angry and had the queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country and at last after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster the king to save his subjects was obliged to consent that i should be given up to the fairies this time they came themselves to fetch me in a chariot of pearl drawn by seahorses followed by the dragon who was led with chains of diamonds my cradle was placed between the old fairies who loaded me with caresses and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me there i grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog who could both talk and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies who came mounted upon the dragon one day however as i sat at my window i saw a handsome young prince who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison and who was standing and looking up at me when he saw that i observed him he saluted me with great deference you can imagine that i was delighted to have some one new to talk to and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell but after that he came again many times and at last i consented to marry him but the question was how was i to escape from my tower the fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning and by great diligence i made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower but alas just as my prince was helping me to descend it the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon as for me the fairies furious at having their plans defeated for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs and i utterly refused changed me into a white cat when they brought me here i found all the lords and ladies of my fathers court awaiting me under the same enchantment while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible all but their hands  as they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history for until then i had quite believed that i was their child and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover  and you have won it lovely princess interrupted the prince  you are indeed wonderfully like him resumed the princessin voice in features and everything and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end  and mine too cried the prince throwing himself at her feet if you will consent to marry me  i love you already better than anyone in the world she said but now it is time to go back to your father and we shall hear what he says about it  so the prince gave her his hand and led her out and they mounted the chariot together it was even more splendid than before and so was the whole company even the horses shoes were of rubies with diamond nails and i suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen  as the princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful you may imagine what a delightful journey the prince found it for everything the princess said seemed to him quite charming  when they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet the princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards it was hewn out of one splendid crystal and had silken curtains which she drew round her that she might not be seen  the prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace each with a lovely princess and they came to meet him asking if he had also found a wife he said that he had found something much rarera white cat at which they laughed very much and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace and then they set out together for the town each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage the horses were decked with plumes of feathers and glittered with gold after them came the youngest prince and last of all the crystal chair at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity when the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the king  are the ladies beautiful he asked anxiously  and when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed  however he received them graciously but found it impossible to choose between them  then turning to his youngest son he said  have you come back alone after all  your majesty replied the prince will find in that crystal chair a little white cat which has such soft paws and mews so prettily that i am sure you will be charmed with it  the king smiled and went to draw back the curtains himself but at a touch from the princess the crystal shivered into a thousand splinters and there she stood in all her beauty her fair hair floated over her shoulders and was crowned with flowers and her softly falling robe was of the purest white she saluted the king gracefully while a murmur of admiration rose from all around  sire she said i am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill so worthily i have already six kingdoms permit me to bestow one upon you and upon each of your sons i ask nothing but your friendship and your consent to my marriage with your youngest son we shall still have three kingdoms left for ourselves  the king and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and astonishment and the marriage of the three princes was celebrated at once the festivities lasted several months and then each king and queen departed to their own kingdom and lived happily ever after1   1 la chatte blanche par madame la comtesse daulnoy     the waterlily the goldspinners   once upon a time in a large forest there lived an old woman and three maidens they were all three beautiful but the youngest was the fairest their hut was quite hidden by trees and none saw their beauty but the sun by day and the moon by night and the eyes of the stars the old woman kept the girls hard at work from morning till night spinning gold flax into yarn and when one distaff was empty another was given them so they had no rest the thread had to be fine and even and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman who twice or thrice every summer went a journey before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence and always returned in the night so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came nor what it was to be used for  now when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys she gave each maiden work for six days with the usual warning children dont let your eyes wander and on no account speak to a man for if you do your thread will lose its brightness and misfortunes of all kinds will follow they laughed at this oftrepeated caution saying to each other how can our gold thread lose its brightness and have we any chance of speaking to a man  on the third day after the old womans departure a young prince hunting in the forest got separated from his companions and completely lost weary of seeking his way he flung himself down under a tree leaving his horse to browse at will and fell asleep  the sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest at last he perceived a narrow footpath which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut the maidens who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness saw him approaching and the two elder were much alarmed for they remembered the old womans warning but the youngest said never before have i seen anyone like him let me have one look they entreated her to come in but seeing that she would not left her and the prince coming up courteously greeted the maiden and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary she set food before him and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old womans caution and lingered for hours in the meantime the princes companions sought him far and wide but to no purpose so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the king who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him  after three days search they found the hut the prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maidens company that the time had seemed like a single hour before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his fathers court where he would make her his bride when he had gone she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly for she remembered the old womans warning and knew not what misfortune might now befall her  the old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence she was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the prince the maiden could not rest for thinking of this at last she could bear it no longer and resolved to seek help from the prince  as a child she had learned to understand the speech of birds and this was now of great use to her for seeing a raven pluming itself on a pine bough she cried softly to it dear bird cleverest of all birds as well as swiftest on wing wilt thou help me how can i help thee asked the raven she answered fly away until thou comest to a splendid town where stands a kings palace seek out the kings son and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness how terribly angry the old woman was and how she feared some great disaster the raven promised faithfully to do her bidding and spreading its wings flew away the maiden now went home and worked hard all day at winding up the yarn her elder sisters had spun for the old woman would let her spin no longer toward evening she heard the ravens craa craa from the pine tree and eagerly hastened thither to hear the answer  by great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizards son in the palace garden who understood the speech of birds and to him he had entrusted the message when the prince heard it he was very sorrowful and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden then he said to the wind wizards son beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night for then will i come and fetch her away the wind wizards son did this and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening the maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home telling no one what she had heard  as the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all on this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses and soon the armed troop appeared led by the prince who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand in order to know the way when he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse lifted her into the saddle and then mounting behind rode homeward the moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees  by and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds and had the prince only known what they were saying or the maiden been listening they might have been spared much sorrow but they were thinking only of each other and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens  next morning when the youngest girl did not come to her work the old woman asked where she was the sisters pretended not to know but the old woman easily guessed what had happened and as she was in reality a wicked witch determined to punish the fugitives accordingly she collected nine different kinds of enchanters nightshade added some salt which she first bewitched and doing all up in a cloth into the shape of a fluffy ball sent it after them on the wings of the wind saying    whirlwindmother of the wind   lend thy aid gainst her who sinned   carry with thee this magic ball   cast her from his arms for ever   bury her in the rippling river   at midday the prince and his men came to a deep river spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time the horse on which the prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by the horse in its fright suddenly reared and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below the prince tried to jump in after her but his men held him back and in spite of his struggles led him home where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber and would neither eat nor drink so great was his grief at last he became so ill his life was despaired of and in great alarm the king caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned but none could cure him at last the wind wizards son said to the king send for the old wizard from finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together a messenger was at once sent to finland and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings of the wind honored king said the wizard the wind has blown this illness upon your son and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved this it is which makes him grieve so constantly let the wind blow upon him that it may blow away his sorrow then the king made his son go out into the wind and he gradually recovered and told his father all forget the maiden said the king and take another bride but the prince said he could never love another  a year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met her death as he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly and would have given all he possessed to have her once more alive in the midst of his grief he thought he heard a voice singing and looked round but could see no one then he heard the voice again and it said  alas bewitched and all forsaken  tis i must lie for ever here my beloved no thought has taken  to free his bride that was so dear  he was greatly astonished sprang from his horse and looked everywhere to see if no one were hidden under the bridge but no one was there then he noticed a yellow waterlily floating on the surface of the water half hidden by its broad leaves but flowers do not sing and in great surprise he waited hoping to hear more then again the voice sang       alas bewitched and all forsaken        tis i must lie for ever here      my beloved no thought has taken        to free his bride that was so dear  the prince suddenly remembered the goldspinners and said to himself if i ride thither who knows but that they could explain this to me he at once rode to the hut and found the two maidens at the fountain he told them what had befallen their sister the year before and how he had twice heard a strange song but yet could see no singer they said that the yellow waterlily could be none other than their sister who was not dead but transformed by the magic ball before he went to bed the eldest made a cake of magic herbs which she gave him to eat in the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other next morning he told this to the maidens and they said that the charmed cake had caused it and advised him to listen well to the birds and see what they could tell him and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage  having promised this he joyfully returned home and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said he heard a thrush say to a magpie how stupid men are they cannot understand the simplest thing it is now quite a year since the maiden was transformed into a waterlily and though she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge must hear her yet no one comes to her aid her former bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her singing but was no wiser than the rest  and he is to blame for all her misfortunes added the magpie if he heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever she were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of finland  after hearing this the prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to finland he heard one swallow say to another come let us fly to finland we can build better nests there  stop kind friends cried the prince will you do something for me the birds consented and he said take a thousand greetings from me to the wizard of finland and ask him how i may restore a maiden transformed into a flower to her own form  the swallows flew away and the prince rode on to the bridge there he waited hoping to hear the song but he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind and disappointed rode home  shortly after he was sitting in the garden thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message when he saw an eagle flying above him the bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the prince and said the wizard of finland greets thee and bids me say that thou mayest free the maiden thus go to the river and smear thyself all over with mud then say from a man into a crab and thou wilt become a crab plunge boldly into the water swim as close as thou canst to the waterlilys roots and loosen them from the mud and reeds this done fasten thy claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface let the water flow all over the flower and drift with the current until thou comest to a mountain ash tree on the left bank there is near it a large stone stop there and say from a crab into a man from a waterlily into a maiden and ye both will be restored to your own forms  full of doubt and fear the prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden then a crow said to him why dost thou hesitate the old wizard has not told thee wrong neither have the birds deceived thee hasten and dry the maidens tears  nothing worse than death can befall me thought the prince and death is better than endless sorrow so he mounted his horse and went to the bridge again he heard the waterlilys lament and hesitating no longer smeared himself all over with mud and saying from a man into a crab plunged into the river for one moment the water hissed in his ears and then all was silent he swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time he then grasped them and rose to the surface letting the water flow over the flower the current carried them down the stream but nowhere could he see the mountain ash at last he saw it and close by the large stone here he stopped and said from a crab into a man from a waterlily into a maiden and to his delight found himself once more a prince and the maiden was by his side she was ten times more beautiful than before and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe sparkling with jewels she thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witchs power and willingly consented to marry him  but when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen for though the prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days while they were wondering how they should reach his fathers court they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank in this they drove to the palace the king and queen were at church weeping for their son whom they had long mourned for dead great was their delight and astonishment when the prince entered leading the beautiful maiden by the hand the wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merrymaking throughout the kingdom for six weeks  some time afterward the prince and his bride were sitting in the garden when a crow said to them ungrateful creatures have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress must they spin gold flax for ever have no pity on the old witch the three maidens are princesses whom she stole away when they were children together with all the silver utensils which she turned into gold flax poison were her fittest punishment  the prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at once and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was away the maidens had dreamed that he was coming and were ready to go with him but first they made a cake in which they put poison and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned she did see it and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died  in the secret chamber were found fifty wagonloads of gold flax and as much more was discovered buried the hut was razed to the ground and the prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after     the terrible head   once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl now the king had been very anxious to have a son or at least a grandson to come after him but he was told by a prophet whom he consulted that his own daughters son should kill him this news terrified him so much that he determined never to let his daughter be married for he thought it was better to have no grandson at all than to be killed by his grandson he therefore called his workmen together and bade them dig a deep round hole in the earth and then he had a prison of brass built in the hole and then when it was finished he locked up his daughter no man ever saw her and she never saw even the fields and the sea but only the sky and the sun for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house of brass so the princess would sit looking up at the sky and watching the clouds float across and wondering whether she should ever get out of her prison now one day it seemed to her that the sky opened above her and a great shower of shining gold fell through the window in the roof and lay glittering in her room not very long after the princess had a baby a little boy but when the king her father heard of it he was very angry and afraid for now the child was born that should be his death yet cowardly as he was he had not quite the heart to kill the princess and her baby outright but he had them put in a huge brassbound chest and thrust out to sea that they might either be drowned or starved or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way  so the princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea all day and night but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the wind for he did not know that they could hurt him and he slept quite soundly and the princess sang a song over him and this was her song    child my child how sound you sleep   though your mothers care is deep   you can lie with heart at rest   in the narrow brassbound chest   in the starless night and drear   you can sleep and never hear   billows breaking and the cry   of the nightwind wandering by   in soft purple mantle sleeping   with your little face on mine   hearing not your mother weeping   and the breaking of the brine   well the daylight came at last and the great chest was driven by the waves against the shore of an island there the brassbound chest lay with the princess and her baby in it till a man of that country came past and saw it and dragged it on to the beach and when he had broken it open behold there was a beautiful lady and a little boy so he took them home and was very kind to them and brought up the boy till he was a young man now when the boy had come to his full strength the king of that country fell in love with his mother and wanted to marry her but he knew that she would never part from her boy so he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy and this was his plan a great queen of a country not far off was going to be married and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her and he made a feast to which he invited them all and they all brought their presents some brought gold cups and some brought necklaces of gold and amber and some brought beautiful horses but the boy had nothing though he was the son of a princess for his mother had nothing to give him then the rest of the company began to laugh at him and the king said if you have nothing else to give at least you might go and fetch the terrible head  the boy was proud and spoke without thinking  then i swear that i will bring the terrible head if it may be brought by a living man but of what head you speak i know not  then they told him that somewhere a long way off there dwelt three dreadful sisters monstrous ogrish women with golden wings and claws of brass and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone and two of them could not be put to death but the youngest whose face was very beautiful could be killed and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring you may imagine it was no easy adventure  when he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the terrible head but he was determined to keep his oath so he went out from the feast where they all sat drinking and making merry and he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening at the place where the great chest with himself and his mother in it had been cast ashore  there he went and sat down on a rock looking toward the sea and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder and he turned and saw a young man like a kings son having with him a tall and beautiful lady whose blue eyes shone like stars they were taller than mortal men and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it and two golden serpents twisted round it and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes he spoke to the boy and asked him why he was so unhappy and the boy told him how he had sworn to bring the terrible head and knew not how to begin to set about the adventure  then the beautiful lady also spoke and said that it was a foolish oath and a hasty but it might be kept if a brave man had sworn it then the boy answered that he was not afraid if only he knew the way  then the lady said that to kill the dreadful woman with the golden wings and the brass claws and to cut off her head he needed three things first a cap of darkness which would make him invisible when he wore it next a sword of sharpness which would cleave iron at one blow and last the shoes of swiftness with which he might fly in the air  the boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured and that wanting them he could only try and fail then the young man taking off his own shoes said first you shall use these shoes till you have taken the terrible head and then you must give them back to me and with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird or a thought over the land or over the waves of the sea wherever the shoes know the way but there are ways which they do not know roads beyond the borders of the world and these roads have you to travel now first you must go to the three gray sisters who live far off in the north and are so very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three you must creep up close to them and as one of them passes the eye to the other you must seize it and refuse to give it up till they have told you the way to the three fairies of the garden and they will give you the cap of darkness and the sword of sharpness and show you how to wing beyond this world to the land of the terrible head  then the beautiful lady said go forth at once and do not return to say goodby to your mother for these things must be done quickly and the shoes of swiftness themselves will carry you to the land of the three gray sistersfor they know the measure of that way  so the boy thanked her and he fastened on the shoes of swiftness and turned to say goodby to the young man and the lady but behold they had vanished he knew not how or where then he leaped in the air to try the shoes of swiftness and they carried him more swiftly than the wind over the warm blue sea over the happy lands of the south over the northern peoples who drank mares milk and lived in great wagons wandering after their flocks across the wide rivers where the wild fowl rose and fled before him and over the plains and the cold north sea he went over the fields of snow and the hills of ice to a place where the world ends and all water is frozen and there are no men nor beasts nor any green grass there in a blue cave of the ice he found the three gray sisters the oldest of living things their hair was as white as the snow and their flesh of an icy blue and they mumbled and nodded in a kind of dream and their frozen breath hung round them like a cloud now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the gray sisters but floating on the shoes of swiftness the boy just managed to steal in and waited till one of the sisters said to another who had their one eye  sister what do you see do you see old times coming back  no sister  then give me the eye for perhaps i can see farther than you  then the first sister passed the eye to the second but as the second groped for it the boy caught it cleverly out of her hand  where is the eye sister said the second gray woman  you have taken it yourself sister said the first gray woman  have you lost the eye sister have you lost the eye said the third gray woman shall we never find it again and see old times coming back  then the boy slipped from behind them out of the cold cave into the air and he laughed aloud  when the gray women heard that laugh they began to weep for now they knew that a stranger had robbed them and that they could not help themselves and their tears froze as they fell from the hollows where no eyes were and rattled on the icy ground of the cave then they began to implore the boy to give them their eye back again and he could not help being sorry for them they were so pitiful but he said he would never give them the eye till they told him the way to the fairies of the garden  then they wrung their hands miserably for they guessed why he had come and how he was going to try to win the terrible head now the dreadful women were akin to the three gray sisters and it was hard for them to tell the boy the way but at last they told him to keep always south and with the land on his left and the sea on his right till he reached the island of the fairies of the garden then he gave them back the eye and they began to look out once more for the old times coming back again but the boy flew south between sea and land keeping the land always on his left hand till he saw a beautiful island crowned with flowering trees there he alighted and there he found the three fairies of the garden they were like three very beautiful young women dressed one in green one in white and one in red and they were dancing and singing round an apple tree with apples of gold and this was their song         the song of the western fairies       round and round the apples of gold        round and round dance we      thus do we dance from the days of old        about the enchanted tree      round and round and round we go      while the spring is green or the stream shall flow        or the wind shall stir the sea       there is none may taste of the golden fruit        till the golden new time come      many a tree shall spring from shoot      many a blossom be withered at root        many a song be dumb      broken and still shall be many a lute        or ever the new times come       round and round the tree of gold        round and round dance we      so doth the great world spin from of old      summer and winter and fire and cold      song that is sung and tale that is told      even as we dance that fold and unfold        round the stem of the fairy tree   these grave dancing fairies were very unlike the grey women and they were glad to see the boy and treated him kindly then they asked him why he had come and he told them how he was sent to find the sword of sharpness and the cap of darkness and the fairies gave him these and a wallet and a shield and belted the sword which had a diamond blade round his waist and the cap they set on his head and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies then he took it off and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree for it is their business to guard it till the new times come or till the worlds ending so the boy put the cap on his head and hung the wallet round his waist and the shining shield on his shoulders and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world and by the banks of that river there he found the three terrible women all asleep beneath a poplar tree and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold but the youngest slept between her two sisters and she lay on her back with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky and though she slept her eyes were wide open if the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it she was so awful but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face as soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders and held it up like a mirror so that he saw the dreadful women reflected in it and did not see the terrible head itself then he came nearer and nearer till he reckoned that he was within a swords stroke of the youngest and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him then he drew the sword of sharpness and struck once and the terrible head was cut from the shoulders of the creature and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow but he thrust the terrible head into his wallet and flew away without looking behind then the two dreadful sisters who were left wakened and rose in the air like great birds and though they could not see him because of his cap of darkness they flew after him up the wind following by the scent through the clouds like hounds hunting in a wood they came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings and their shrieks to each other here here no there this way he went as they chased him but the shoes of swiftness flew too fast for them and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world  now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance and the boy found himself on the right side of the river he flew straight eastward trying to seek his own country but as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sighta beautiful girl chained to a stake at the highwater mark of the sea the girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist and there she hung as if she were dead the boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her when he spoke she raised her head and looked round but his voice only seemed to frighten her then he remembered that he was wearing the cap of darkness and that she could only hear him not see him so he took it off and there he stood before her the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life with short curly yellow hair and blue eyes and a laughing face and he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world so first with one blow of the sword of sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her and then he asked her what she did there and why men treated her so cruelly and she told him that she was the daughter of the king of that country and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea for the beast came and devoured a girl every day now the lot had fallen on her and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl but the beast had been too greedy and too hurried so he missed his aim the first time before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the terrible head out of his wallet and held it up and when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head and instantly it was turned into a stone and the stone beast is there on the seacoast to this day  then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the king her father where everyone was weeping for her death and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well and the king and queen made much of the boy and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter so the two were married with the most splendid rejoicings and when they had passed some time at court they went home in a ship to the boys own country for he could not carry his bride through the air so he took the shoes of swiftness and the cap of darkness and the sword of sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills there he left them and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea and had helped him to start on his journey  when this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home and landed at the harbor of his native land but whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother flying for her life from the wicked king who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him for if she had liked the king ill before she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly she did not know of course where the boy had gone but thought the king had slain him secretly so now she was running for her very life and the wicked king was following her with a sword in his hand then behold she ran into her sons very arms but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her when the king struck at him with his sword the boy caught the blow on his shield and cried to the king  i swore to bring you the terrible head and see how i keep my oath  then he drew forth the head from his wallet and when the kings eyes fell on it instantly he was turned into stone just as he stood there with his sword lifted  now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer and they asked the boy to be their king but he said no he must take his mother home to her fathers house so the people chose for king the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the island in the great chest  presently the boy and his mother and his wife set sail for his mothers own country from which she had been driven so unkindly but on the way they stayed at the court of a king and it happened that he was holding games and giving prizes to the best runners boxers and quoitthrowers then the boy would try his strength with the rest but he threw the quoit so far that it went beyond what had ever been thrown before and fell in the crowd striking a man so that he died now this man was no other than the father of the boys mother who had fled away from his own kingdom for fear his grandson should find him and kill him after all thus he was destroyed by his own cowardice and by chance and thus the prophecy was fulfilled but the boy and his wife and his mother went back to the kingdom that was theirs and lived long and happily after all their troubles     the story of pretty goldilocks   once upon a time there was a princess who was the prettiest creature in the world and because she was so beautiful and because her hair was like the finest gold and waved and rippled nearly to the ground she was called pretty goldilocks she always wore a crown of flowers and her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls and everybody who saw her fell in love with her  now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married he was very rich and handsome and when he heard all that was said about pretty goldilocks though he had never seen her he fell so deeply in love with her that he could neither eat nor drink so he resolved to send an ambassador to ask her in marriage he had a splendid carriage made for his ambassador and gave him more than a hundred horses and a hundred servants and told him to be sure and bring the princess back with him after he had started nothing else was talked of at court and the king felt so sure that the princess would consent that he set his people to work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture that they might be ready by the time she came meanwhile the ambassador arrived at the princesss palace and delivered his little message but whether she happened to be cross that day or whether the compliment did not please her is not known she only answered that she was very much obliged to the king but she had no wish to be married the ambassador set off sadly on his homeward way bringing all the kings presents back with him for the princess was too well brought up to accept the pearls and diamonds when she would not accept the king so she had only kept twentyfive english pins that he might not be vexed  when the ambassador reached the city where the king was waiting impatiently everybody was very much annoyed with him for not bringing the princess and the king cried like a baby and nobody could console him now there was at the court a young man who was more clever and handsome than anyone else he was called charming and everyone loved him excepting a few envious people who were angry at his being the kings favorite and knowing all the state secrets he happened to one day be with some people who were speaking of the ambassadors return and saying that his going to the princess had not done much good when charming said rashly  if the king had sent me to the princess goldilocks i am sure she would have come back with me  his enemies at once went to the king and said  you will hardly believe sire what charming has the audacity to saythat if he had been sent to the princess goldilocks she would certainly have come back with him he seems to think that he is so much handsomer than you that the princess would have fallen in love with him and followed him willingly the king was very angry when he heard this  ha ha said he does he laugh at my unhappiness and think himself more fascinating than i am go and let him be shut up in my great tower to die of hunger  so the kings guards went to fetch charming who had thought no more of his rash speech and carried him off to prison with great cruelty the poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed and but for a little stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst  one day when he was in despair he said to himself  how can i have offended the king i am his most faithful subject and have done nothing against him  the king chanced to be passing the tower and recognized the voice of his former favorite he stopped to listen in spite of charmings enemies who tried to persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor but the king said  be quiet i wish to hear what he says  and then he opened the tower door and called to charming who came very sadly and kissed the kings hand saying  what have i done sire to deserve this cruel treatment  you mocked me and my ambassador said the king and you said that if i had sent you for the princess goldilocks you would certainly have brought her back  it is quite true sire replied charming i should have drawn such a picture of you and represented your good qualities in such a way that i am certain the princess would have found you irresistible but i cannot see what there is in that to make you angry  the king could not see any cause for anger either when the matter was presented to him in this light and he began to frown very fiercely at the courtiers who had so misrepresented his favorite  so he took charming back to the palace with him and after seeing that he had a very good supper he said to him  you know that i love pretty goldilocks as much as ever her refusal has not made any difference to me but i dont know how to make her change her mind i really should like to send you to see if you can persuade her to marry me  charming replied that he was perfectly willing to go and would set out the very next day  but you must wait till i can get a grand escort for you said the king but charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride and the king who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly gave him letters to the princess and bade him good speed it was on a monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the princess goldilocks to marry the king he had a writingbook in his pocket and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the princess before he forgot it  one day when he had started at the very earliest dawn and was riding over a great meadow he suddenly had a capital idea and springing from his horse he sat down under a willow tree which grew by a little river when he had written it down he was looking round him pleased to find himself in such a pretty place when all at once he saw a great golden carp lying gasping and exhausted upon the grass in leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank where she had lain till she was nearly dead charming had pity upon her and though he couldnt help thinking that she would have been very nice for dinner he picked her up gently and put her back into the water as soon as dame carp felt the refreshing coolness of the water she sank down joyfully to the bottom of the river then swimming up to the bank quite boldly she said  i thank you charming for the kindness you have done me you have saved my life one day i will repay you so saying she sank down into the water again leaving charming greatly astonished at her politeness  another day as he journeyed on he saw a raven in great distress the poor bird was closely pursued by an eagle which would soon have eaten it up had not charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the eagle dead the raven perched upon a tree very joyfully  charming said he it was very generous of you to rescue a poor raven i am not ungrateful some day i will repay you  charming thought it was very nice of the raven to say so and went on his way  before the sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see his path and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair  hark said he that must be an owl in great trouble i am sure it has gone into a snare and he began to hunt about and presently found a great net which some birdcatchers had spread the night before  what a pity it is that men do nothing but torment and persecute poor creatures which never do them any harm said he and he took out his knife and cut the cords of the net and the owl flitted away into the darkness but then turning with one flicker of her wings she came back to charming and said  it does not need many words to tell you how great a service you have done me i was caught in a few minutes the fowlers would have been herewithout your help i should have been killed i am grateful and one day i will repay you  these three adventures were the only ones of any consequence that befell charming upon his journey and he made all the haste he could to reach the palace of the princess goldilocks  when he arrived he thought everything he saw delightful and magnificent diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles and the gold and silver the beautiful dresses the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him he thought to himself if the princess consents to leave all this and come with me to marry the king he may think himself lucky  then he dressed himself carefully in rich brocade with scarlet and white plumes and threw a splendid embroidered scarf over his shoulder and looking as gay and as graceful as possible he presented himself at the door of the palace carrying in his arm a tiny pretty dog which he had bought on the way the guards saluted him respectfully and a messenger was sent to the princess to announce the arrival of charming as ambassador of her neighbor the king  charming said the princess the name promises well i have no doubt that he is good looking and fascinates everybody  indeed he does madam said all her maids of honor in one breath we saw him from the window of the garret where we were spinning flax and we could do nothing but look at him as long as he was in sight  well to be sure said the princess thats how you amuse yourselves is it looking at strangers out of the window be quick and give me my blue satin embroidered dress and comb out my golden hair let somebody make me fresh garlands of flowers and give me my highheeled shoes and my fan and tell them to sweep my great hall and my throne for i want everyone to say i am really pretty goldilocks  you can imagine how all her maids scurried this way and that to make the princess ready and how in their haste they knocked their heads together and hindered each other till she thought they would never have done however at last they led her into the gallery of mirrors that she might assure herself that nothing was lacking in her appearance and then she mounted her throne of gold ebony and ivory while her ladies took their guitars and began to sing softly then charming was led in and was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at first not a word could he say but presently he took courage and delivered his harangue bravely ending by begging the princess to spare him the disappointment of going back without her  sir charming answered she all the reasons you have given me are very good ones and i assure you that i should have more pleasure in obliging you than anyone else but you must know that a month ago as i was walking by the river with my ladies i took off my glove and as i did so a ring that i was wearing slipped off my finger and rolled into the water as i valued it more than my kingdom you may imagine how vexed i was at losing it and i vowed to never listen to any proposal of marriage unless the ambassador first brought me back my ring so now you know what is expected of you for if you talked for fifteen days and fifteen nights you could not make me change my mind  charming was very much surprised by this answer but he bowed low to the princess and begged her to accept the embroidered scarf and the tiny dog he had brought with him but she answered that she did not want any presents and that he was to remember what she had just told him when he got back to his lodging he went to bed without eating any supper and his little dog who was called frisk couldnt eat any either but came and lay down close to him all night charming sighed and lamented  how am i to find a ring that fell into the river a month ago said he it is useless to try the princess must have told me to do it on purpose knowing it was impossible and then he sighed again  frisk heard him and said  my dear master dont despair the luck may change you are too good not to be happy let us go down to the river as soon as it is light  but charming only gave him two little pats and said nothing and very soon he fell asleep  at the first glimmer of dawn frisk began to jump about and when he had waked charming they went out together first into the garden and then down to the rivers brink where they wandered up and down charming was thinking sadly of having to go back unsuccessful when he heard someone calling charming charming he looked all about him and thought he must be dreaming as he could not see anybody then he walked on and the voice called again charming charming  who calls me said he frisk who was very small and could look closely into the water cried out i see a golden carp coming and sure enough there was the great carp who said to charming  you saved my life in the meadow by the willow tree and i promised that i would repay you take this it is princess goldilocks ring charming took the ring out of dame carps mouth thanking her a thousand times and he and tiny frisk went straight to the palace where someone told the princess that he was asking to see her  ah poor fellow said she he must have come to say goodby finding it impossible to do as i asked  so in came charming who presented her with the ring and said  madam i have done your bidding will it please you to marry my master when the princess saw her ring brought back to her unhurt she was so astonished that she thought she must be dreaming  truly charming said she you must be the favorite of some fairy or you could never have found it  madam answered he i was helped by nothing but my desire to obey your wishes  since you are so kind said she perhaps you will do me another service for till it is done i will never be married there is a prince not far from here whose name is galifron who once wanted to marry me but when i refused he uttered the most terrible threats against me and vowed that he would lay waste my country but what could i do i could not marry a frightful giant as tall as a tower who eats up people as a monkey eats chestnuts and who talks so loud that anybody who has to listen to him becomes quite deaf nevertheless he does not cease to persecute me and to kill my subjects so before i can listen to your proposal you must kill him and bring me his head  charming was rather dismayed at this command but he answered  very well princess i will fight this galifron i believe that he will kill me but at any rate i shall die in your defense  then the princess was frightened and said everything she could think of to prevent charming from fighting the giant but it was of no use and he went out to arm himself suitably and then taking little frisk with him he mounted his horse and set out for galifrons country everyone he met told him what a terrible giant galifron was and that nobody dared go near him and the more he heard the more frightened he grew frisk tried to encourage him by saying while you are fighting the giant dear master i will go and bite his heels and when he stoops down to look at me you can kill him  charming praised his little dogs plan but knew that this help would not do much good  at last he drew near the giants castle and saw to his horror that every path that led to it was strewn with bones before long he saw galifron coming his head was higher than the tallest trees and he sang in a terrible voice    bring out your little boys and girls   pray do not stay to do their curls   for i shall eat so very many   i shall not know if they have any   thereupon charming sang out as loud as he could to the same tune    come out and meet the valiant charming   who finds you not at all alarming   although he is not very tall   hes big enough to make you fall   the rhymes were not very correct but you see he had made them up so quickly that it is a miracle that they were not worse especially as he was horribly frightened all the time when galifron heard these words he looked all about him and saw charming standing sword in hand this put the giant into a terrible rage and he aimed a blow at charming with his huge iron club which would certainly have killed him if it had reached him but at that instant a raven perched upon the giants head and pecking with its strong beak and beating with its great wings so confused and blinded him that all his blows fell harmlessly upon the air and charming rushing in gave him several strokes with his sharp sword so that he fell to the ground whereupon charming cut off his head before he knew anything about it and the raven from a tree close by croaked out  you see i have not forgotten the good turn you did me in killing the eagle today i think i have fulfilled my promise of repaying you  indeed i owe you more gratitude than you ever owed me replied charming  and then he mounted his horse and rode off with galifrons head  when he reached the city the people ran after him in crowds crying  behold the brave charming who has killed the giant and their shouts reached the princesss ear but she dared not ask what was happening for fear she should hear that charming had been killed but very soon he arrived at the palace with the giants head of which she was still terrified though it could no longer do her any harm  princess said charming i have killed your enemy i hope you will now consent to marry the king my master  oh dear no said the princess not until you have brought me some water from the gloomy cavern  not far from here there is a deep cave the entrance to which is guarded by two dragons with fiery eyes who will not allow anyone to pass them when you get into the cavern you will find an immense hole which you must go down and it is full of toads and snakes at the bottom of this hole there is another little cave in which rises the fountain of health and beauty it is some of this water that i really must have everything it touches becomes wonderful the beautiful things will always remain beautiful and the ugly things become lovely if one is young one never grows old and if one is old one becomes young you see charming i could not leave my kingdom without taking some of it with me  princess said he you at least can never need this water but i am an unhappy ambassador whose death you desire where you send me i will go though i know i shall never return  and as the princess goldilocks showed no sign of relenting he started with his little dog for the gloomy cavern everyone he met on the way said  what a pity that a handsome young man should throw away his life so carelessly he is going to the cavern alone though if he had a hundred men with him he could not succeed why does the princess ask impossibilities charming said nothing but he was very sad when he was near the top of a hill he dismounted to let his horse graze while frisk amused himself by chasing flies charming knew he could not be far from the gloomy cavern and on looking about him he saw a black hideous rock from which came a thick smoke followed in a moment by one of the dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes his body was yellow and green and his claws scarlet and his tail was so long that it lay in a hundred coils frisk was so terrified at the sight of it that he did not know where to hide charming quite determined to get the water or die now drew his sword and taking the crystal flask which pretty goldilocks had given him to fill said to frisk  i feel sure that i shall never come back from this expedition when i am dead go to the princess and tell her that her errand has cost me my life then find the king my master and relate all my adventures to him  as he spoke he heard a voice calling charming charming  who calls me said he then he saw an owl sitting in a hollow tree who said to him  you saved my life when i was caught in the net now i can repay you trust me with the flask for i know all the ways of the gloomy cavern and can fill it from the fountain of beauty charming was only too glad to give her the flask and she flitted into the cavern quite unnoticed by the dragon and after some time returned with the flask filled to the very brim with sparkling water charming thanked her with all his heart and joyfully hastened back to the town  he went straight to the palace and gave the flask to the princess who had no further objection to make so she thanked charming and ordered that preparations should be made for her departure and they soon set out together the princess found charming such an agreeable companion that she sometimes said to him why didnt we stay where we were i could have made you king and we should have been so happy  but charming only answered  i could not have done anything that would have vexed my master so much even for a kingdom or to please you though i think you are as beautiful as the sun  at last they reached the kings great city and he came out to meet the princess bringing magnificent presents and the marriage was celebrated with great rejoicings but goldilocks was so fond of charming that she could not be happy unless he was near her and she was always singing his praises  if it hadnt been for charming she said to the king i should never have come here you ought to be very much obliged to him for he did the most impossible things and got me water from the fountain of beauty so i can never grow old and shall get prettier every year  then charmings enemies said to the king  it is a wonder that you are not jealous the queen thinks there is nobody in the world like charming as if anybody you had sent could not have done just as much  it is quite true now i come to think of it said the king let him be chained hand and foot and thrown into the tower  so they took charming and as a reward for having served the king so faithfully he was shut up in the tower where he only saw the jailer who brought him a piece of black bread and a pitcher of water every day  however little frisk came to console him and told him all the news  when pretty goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the kings feet and begged him to set charming free but the more she cried the more angry he was and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more but it made her very sad then the king took it into his head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the princess goldilocks and he thought he would bathe his face with the water from the fountain of beauty which was in the flask on a shelf in the princesss room where she had placed it that she might see it often now it happened that one of the princesss ladies in chasing a spider had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it and every drop of the water had been spilt not knowing what to do she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal and then remembered that in the kings room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape also filled with sparkling water so without saying a word she fetched it and stood it upon the queens shelf  now the water in this flask was what was used in the kingdom for getting rid of troublesome people instead of having their heads cut off in the usual way their faces were bathed with the water and they instantly fell asleep and never woke up any more so when the king thinking to improve his beauty took the flask and sprinkled the water upon his face he fell asleep and nobody could wake him  little frisk was the first to hear the news and he ran to tell charming who sent him to beg the princess not to forget the poor prisoner all the palace was in confusion on account of the kings death but tiny frisk made his way through the crowd to the princesss side and said  madam do not forget poor charming  then she remembered all he had done for her and without saying a word to anyone went straight to the tower and with her own hands took off charmings chains then putting a golden crown upon his head and the royal mantle upon his shoulders she said  come faithful charming i make you king and will take you for my husband  charming once more free and happy fell at her feet and thanked her for her gracious words  everybody was delighted that he should be king and the wedding which took place at once was the prettiest that can be imagined and prince charming and princess goldilocks lived happily ever after1   1 madame daulnoy     the history of whittington   dick whittington was a very little boy when his father and mother died so little indeed that he never knew them nor the place where he was born he strolled about the country as ragged as a colt till he met with a wagoner who was going to london and who gave him leave to walk all the way by the side of his wagon without paying anything for his passage this pleased little whittington very much as he wanted to see london sadly for he had heard that the streets were paved with gold and he was willing to get a bushel of it but how great was his disappointment poor boy when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold and found himself in a strange place without a friend without food and without money  though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side of the wagon for nothing he took care not to know him when he came to town and the poor boy was in a little time so cold and hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country  in his distress he asked charity of several people and one of them bid him go to work for an idle rogue that i will said whittington with all my heart i will work for you if you will let me  the man who thought this savored of wit and impertinence though the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down in this situation and fainting for want of food he laid himself down at the door of one mr fitzwarren a merchant where the cook saw him and being an illnatured hussy ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him at this time mr fitzwarren came from the exchange and began also to scold at the poor boy bidding him to go to work  whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat for he had had nothing for three days and he was a poor country boy and knew nobody and nobody would employ him  he then endeavored to get up but he was so very weak that he fell down again which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about people are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do or considering whether they are able to do it which is not charity  but we return to whittington who could have lived happy in this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook who must be always roasting and basting or when the spit was idle employed her hands upon poor whittington at last miss alice his masters daughter was informed of it and then she took compassion on the poor boy and made the servants treat him kindly  besides the crossness of the cook whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy he had by order of his master a flockbed placed for him in a garret where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boys nose and disturbed him in his sleep after some time however a gentleman who came to his masters house gave whittington a penny for brushing his shoes this he put into his pocket being determined to lay it out to the best advantage and the next day seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm he ran up to know the price of it the woman as the cat was a good mouser asked a deal of money for it but on whittingtons telling her he had but a penny in the world and that he wanted a cat sadly she let him have it  this cat whittington concealed in the garret for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top  soon after this the merchant who had a ship ready to sail called for his servants as his custom was in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom for he thought justly that god almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune  all the servants appeared but poor whittington who having neither money nor goods could not think of sending anything to try his luck but his good friend miss alice thinking his poverty kept him away ordered him to be called  she then offered to lay down something for him but the merchant told his daughter that would not do it must be something of his own upon which poor whittington said he had nothing but a cat which he bought for a penny that was given him fetch thy cat boy said the merchant and send her whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain with tears in his eyes for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and mice as much as ever all the company laughed at the adventure but miss alice who pitied the poor boy and gave him something to buy another cat  while puss was beating the billows at sea poor whittington was severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook who used him so cruelly and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place and having packed up the few things he had he set out very early in the morning on allhallows day he traveled as far as holloway and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he should take but while he was thus ruminating bow bells of which there were only six began to ring and he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner    turn again whittington   thrice lord mayor of london   lord mayor of london said he to himself what would not one endure to be lord mayor of london and ride in such a fine coach well ill go back again and bear all the pummelling and illusage of cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being lord mayor so home he went and happily got into the house and about his business before mrs cicely made her appearance  we must now follow miss puss to the coast of africa how perilous are voyages at sea how uncertain the winds and the waves and how many accidents attend a naval life  the ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea and at last by contrary winds driven on a part of the coast of barbary which was inhabited by moors unknown to the english these people received our countrymen with civility and therefore the captain in order to trade with them showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board and sent some of them to the king of the country who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace which was about a mile from the sea here they were placed according to the custom of the country on rich carpets flowered with gold and silver and the king and queen being seated at the upper end of the room dinner was brought in which consisted of many dishes but no sooner were the dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant  the factor in surprise turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive oh yes said they very offensive and the king would give half his treasure to be freed of them for they not only destroy his dinner as you see but they assault him in his chamber and even in bed so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping for fear of them  the factor jumped for joy he remembered poor whittington and his cat and told the king he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch all these vermin immediately the kings heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his head bring this creature to me said he vermin are dreadful in a court and if she will perform what you say i will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for her the factor who knew his business took this opportunity to set forth the merits of miss puss he told his majesty that it would be inconvenient to part with her as when she was gone the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the shipbut to oblige his majesty he would fetch her run run said the queen i am impatient to see the dear creature  away flew the factor while another dinner was providing and returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also he immediately put down miss puss who killed a great number of them  the king rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a creature and the queen was highly pleased and desired the cat might be brought near that she might look at her upon which the factor called pussy pussy pussy and she came to him he then presented her to the queen who started back and was afraid to touch a creature who had made such havoc among the rats and mice however when the factor stroked the cat and called pussy pussy the queen also touched her and cried putty putty for she had not learned english  he then put her down on the queens lap where she purring played with her majestys hand and then sang herself to sleep  the king having seen the exploits of miss puss and being informed that her kittens would stock the whole country bargained with the captain and factor for the whole ships cargo and then gave them ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted to on which taking leave of their majesties and other great personages at court they sailed with a fair wind for england whither we must now attend them  the morn had scarcely dawned when mr fitzwarren arose to count over the cash and settle the business for that day he had just entered the countinghouse and seated himself at the desk when somebody came tap tap at the door whos there said mr fitzwarren a friend answered the other what friend can come at this unseasonable time a real friend is never unseasonable answered the other i come to bring you good news of your ship unicorn the merchant bustled up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout instantly opened the door and who should be seen waiting but the captain and factor with a cabinet of jewels and a bill of lading for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage then they told him the adventures of the cat and showed him the cabinet of jewels which they had brought for mr whittington upon which he cried out with great earnestness but not in the most poetical manner    go send him in and tell him of his fame   and call him mr whittington by name   it is not our business to animadvert upon these lines we are not critics but historians it is sufficient for us that they are the words of mr fitzwarren and though it is beside our purpose and perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet we shall soon convince the reader that he was a good man which was a much better character for when some who were present told him that this treasure was too much for such a poor boy as whittington he said god forbid that i should deprive him of a penny it is his own and he shall have it to a farthing he then ordered mr whittington in who was at this time cleaning the kitchen and would have excused himself from going into the countinghouse saying the room was swept and his shoes were dirty and full of hobnails the merchant however made him come in and ordered a chair to be set for him upon which thinking they intended to make sport of him as had been too often the case in the kitchen he besought his master not to mock a poor simple fellow who intended them no harm but let him go about his business the merchant taking him by the hand said indeed mr whittington i am in earnest with you and sent for you to congratulate you on your great success your cat has procured you more money than i am worth in the world and may you long enjoy it and be happy  at length being shown the treasure and convinced by them that all of it belonged to him he fell upon his knees and thanked the almighty for his providential care of such a poor and miserable creature he then laid all the treasure at his masters feet who refused to take any part of it but told him he heartily rejoiced at his prosperity and hoped the wealth he had acquired would be a comfort to him and would make him happy he then applied to his mistress and to his good friend miss alice who refused to take any part of the money but told him she heartily rejoiced at his good success and wished him all imaginable felicity he then gratified the captain factor and the ships crew for the care they had taken of his cargo he likewise distributed presents to all the servants in the house not forgetting even his old enemy the cook though she little deserved it  after this mr fitzwarren advised mr whittington to send for the necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman and made him the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself with a better  now it came to pass when mr whittingtons face was washed his hair curled and he dressed in a rich suit of clothes that he turned out a genteel young fellow and as wealth contributes much to give a man confidence he in a little time dropped that sheepish behavior which was principally occasioned by a depression of spirits and soon grew a sprightly and good companion insomuch that miss alice who had formerly pitied him now fell in love with him  when her father perceived they had this good liking for each other he proposed a match between them to which both parties cheerfully consented and the lord mayor court of aldermen sheriffs the company of stationers the royal academy of arts and a number of eminent merchants attended the ceremony and were elegantly treated at an entertainment made for that purpose  history further relates that they lived very happy had several children and died at a good old age mr whittington served as sheriff of london and was three times lord mayor in the last year of his mayoralty he entertained king henry v and his queen after his conquest of france upon which occasion the king in consideration of whittingtons merit said never had prince such a subject which being told to whittington at the table he replied never had subject such a king his majesty out of respect to his good character conferred the honor of knighthood on him soon after  sir richard many years before his death constantly fed a great number of poor citizens built a church and a college to it with a yearly allowance for poor scholars and near it erected a hospital  he also built newgate for criminals and gave liberally to st bartholomews hospital and other public charities     the wonderful sheep   once upon a timein the days when the fairies livedthere was a king who had three daughters who were all young and clever and beautiful but the youngest of the three who was called miranda was the prettiest and the most beloved  the king her father gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than he gave the others in a year but she was so generous that she shared everything with her sisters and they were all as happy and as fond of one another as they could be  now the king had some quarrelsome neighbors who tired of leaving him in peace began to make war upon him so fiercely that he feared he would be altogether beaten if he did not make an effort to defend himself so he collected a great army and set off to fight them leaving the princesses with their governess in a castle where news of the war was brought every daysometimes that the king had taken a town or won a battle and at last that he had altogether overcome his enemies and chased them out of his kingdom and was coming back to the castle as quickly as possible to see his dear little miranda whom he loved so much  the three princesses put on dresses of satin which they had had made on purpose for this great occasion one green one blue and the third white their jewels were the same colors the eldest wore emeralds the second turquoises and the youngest diamonds and thus adorned they went to meet the king singing verses which they had composed about his victories  when he saw them all so beautiful and so gay he embraced them tenderly but gave miranda more kisses than either of the others  presently a splendid banquet was served and the king and his daughters sat down to it and as he always thought that there was some special meaning in everything he said to the eldest  tell me why you have chosen a green dress  sire she answered having heard of your victories i thought that green would signify my joy and the hope of your speedy return  that is a very good answer said the king and you my daughter he continued why did you take a blue dress  sire said the princess to show that we constantly hoped for your success and that the sight of you is as welcome to me as the sky with its most beautiful stars  why said the king your wise answers astonish me and you miranda what made you dress yourself all in white  because sire she answered white suits me better than anything else  what said the king angrily was that all you thought of vain child  i thought you would be pleased with me said the princess that was all  the king who loved her was satisfied with this and even pretended to be pleased that she had not told him all her reasons at first  and now said he as i have supped well and it is not time yet to go to bed tell me what you dreamed last night  the eldest said she had dreamed that he brought her a dress and the precious stones and gold embroidery on it were brighter than the sun  the dream of the second was that the king had brought her a spinning wheel and a distaff that she might spin him some shirts  but the youngest said i dreamed that my second sister was to be married and on her weddingday you father held a golden ewer and said come miranda and i will hold the water that you may dip your hands in it  the king was very angry indeed when he heard this dream and frowned horribly indeed he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry he was and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry but he could not forget his daughters dream  does the proud girl wish to make me her slave he said to himself i am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without a thought of me she does not think me worthy of her consideration but i will soon put an end to her pretensions  he rose in a fury and although it was not yet daylight he sent for the captain of his bodyguard and said to him  you have heard the princess mirandas dream i consider that it means strange things against me therefore i order you to take her away into the forest and kill her and that i may be sure it is done you must bring me her heart and her tongue if you attempt to deceive me you shall be put to death  the captain of the guard was very much astonished when he heard this barbarous order but he did not dare to contradict the king for fear of making him still more angry or causing him to send someone else so he answered that he would fetch the princess and do as the king had said when he went to her room they would hardly let him in it was so early but he said that the king had sent for miranda and she got up quickly and came out a little black girl called patypata held up her train and her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her the monkey was called grabugeon and the little dog tintin  the captain of the guard begged miranda to come down into the garden where the king was enjoying the fresh air and when they got there he pretended to search for him but as he was not to be found he said  no doubt his majesty has strolled into the forest and he opened the little door that led to it and they went through  by this time the daylight had begun to appear and the princess looking at her conductor saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad to speak  what is the matter she said in the kindest way you seem very sorrowful  alas princess he answered who would not be sorrowful who was ordered to do such a terrible thing as i am the king has commanded me to kill you here and carry your heart and your tongue to him and if i disobey i shall lose my life  the poor princess was terrified she grew very pale and began to cry softly  looking up at the captain of the guard with her beautiful eyes she said gently  will you really have the heart to kill me i have never done you any harm and have always spoken well of you to the king if i had deserved my fathers anger i would suffer without a murmur but alas he is unjust to complain of me when i have always treated him with love and respect  fear nothing princess said the captain of the guard i would far rather die myself than hurt you but even if i am killed you will not be safe we must find some way of making the king believe that you are dead  what can we do said miranda unless you take him my heart and my tongue he will never believe you  the princess and the captain of the guard were talking so earnestly that they did not think of patypata but she had overheard all they said and now came and threw herself at mirandas feet  madam she said i offer you my life let me be killed i shall be only too happy to die for such a kind mistress  why patypata cried the princess kissing her that would never do your life is as precious to me as my own especially after such a proof of your affection as you have just given me  you are right princess said grabugeon coming forward to love such a faithful slave as patypata she is of more use to you than i am i offer you my tongue and my heart most willingly especially as i wish to make a great name for myself in goblin land  no no my little grabugeon replied miranda i cannot bear the thought of taking your life  such a good little dog as i am cried tintin could not think of letting either of you die for his mistress if anyone is to die for her it must be me  and then began a great dispute between patypata grabugeon and tintin and they came to high words until at last grabugeon who was quicker than the others ran up to the very top of the nearest tree and let herself fall head first to the ground and there she layquite dead  the princess was very sorry but as grabugeon was really dead she allowed the captain of the guard to take her tongue but alas it was such a little onenot bigger than the princesss thumbthat they decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all the king would not have been taken in by it for a moment  alas my little monkey cried the princess i have lost you and yet i am no better off than i was before  the honor of saving your life is to be mine interrupted patypata and before they could prevent her she had picked up a knife and cut her head off in an instant  but when the captain of the guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black so that would not have deceived the king either  am i not unlucky cried the poor princess i lose everything i love and am none the better for it  if you had accepted my offer said tintin you would only have had me to regret and i should have had all your gratitude  miranda kissed her little dog crying so bitterly that at last she could bear it no longer and turned away into the forest when she looked back the captain of the guard was gone and she was alone except for patypata grabugeon and tintin who lay upon the ground she could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree and how they had all died to save her life and then she began to think where she could go for safetyfor this forest was so close to her fathers castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first passerby and besides that it was full of lions and wolves who would have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken so she began to walk as fast as she could but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the king running after her to kill her you may imagine how miserable she was and how she cried as she went on not knowing which path to follow and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces  at last she heard the bleating of a sheep and said to herself  no doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks they will show me the way to some village where i can live disguised as a peasant girl alas it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world who could have believed that i should ever be obliged to run away and hide because the king for no reason at all wishes to kill me  so saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating but what was her surprise when in a lovely little glade quite surrounded by trees she saw a large sheep its wool was as white as snow and its horns shone like gold it had a garland of flowers round its neck and strings of great pearls about its legs and a collar of diamonds it lay upon a bank of orangeflowers under a canopy of cloth of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about not eating the grass but some drinking coffee lemonade or sherbet others eating ices strawberries and cream or sweetmeats while others again were playing games many of them wore golden collars with jewels flowers and ribbons  miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight and was looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her  approach lovely princess he cried have no fear of such gentle and peaceable animals as we are  what a marvel cried the princess starting back a little here is a sheep that can talk  your monkey and your dog could talk madam said he are you more astonished at us than at them  a fairy gave them the power to speak replied miranda so i was used to them  perhaps the same thing has happened to us he said smiling sheepishly but princess what can have led you here  a thousand misfortunes sir sheep she answered  i am the unhappiest princess in the world and i am seeking a shelter against my fathers anger  come with me madam said the sheep i offer you a hidingplace which you only will know of and where you will be mistress of everything you see  i really cannot follow you said miranda for i am too tired to walk another step  the sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched and a moment after appeared six goats harnessed to a pumpkin which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down the princess stepped into it much amused at such a new kind of carriage the king of the sheep took his place beside her and the goats ran away with them at full speed and only stopped when they reached a cavern the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone this the king touched with his foot and immediately it fell down and he invited the princess to enter without fear now if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment so without hesitation she followed the sheep who went before her down down down until she thought they must come out at the other side of the worldindeed she was not sure that he wasnt leading her into fairyland at last she saw before her a great plain quite covered with all sorts of flowers the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before a broad river of orangeflower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks the plain was covered with the strangest trees there were whole avenues where partridges ready roasted hung from every branch or if you preferred pheasants quails turkeys or rabbits you had only to turn to the right hand or to the left and you were sure to find them in places the air was darkened by showers of lobsterpatties white puddings sausages tarts and all sorts of sweetmeats or with pieces of gold and silver diamonds and pearls this unusual kind of rain and the pleasantness of the whole place would no doubt have attracted numbers of people to it if the king of the sheep had been of a more sociable disposition but from all accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge  as it was quite the nicest time of the year when miranda arrived in this delightful land the only palace she saw was a long row of orange trees jasmines honeysuckles and muskroses and their interlacing branches made the prettiest rooms possible which were hung with gold and silver gauze and had great mirrors and candlesticks and most beautiful pictures the wonderful sheep begged that the princess would consider herself queen over all that she saw and assured her that though for some years he had been very sad and in great trouble she had it in her power to make him forget all his grief  you are so kind and generous noble sheep said the princess that i cannot thank you enough but i must confess that all i see here seems to me so extraordinary that i dont know what to think of it  as she spoke a band of lovely fairies came up and offered her amber baskets full of fruit but when she held out her hands to them they glided away and she could feel nothing when she tried to touch them  oh she cried what can they be whom am i with and she began to cry  at this instant the king of the sheep came back to her and was so distracted to find her in tears that he could have torn his wool  what is the matter lovely princess he cried has anyone failed to treat you with due respect  oh no said miranda only i am not used to living with sprites and with sheep that talk and everything here frightens me it was very kind of you to bring me to this place but i shall be even more grateful to you if you will take me up into the world again  do not be afraid said the wonderful sheep i entreat you to have patience and listen to the story of my misfortunes i was once a king and my kingdom was the most splendid in the world my subjects loved me my neighbors envied and feared me i was respected by everyone and it was said that no king ever deserved it more  i was very fond of hunting and one day while chasing a stag i left my attendants far behind suddenly i saw the animal leap into a pool of water and i rashly urged my horse to follow it but before we had gone many steps i felt an extraordinary heat instead of the coolness of the water the pond dried up a great gulf opened before me out of which flames of fire shot up and i fell helplessly to the bottom of a precipice  i gave myself up for lost but presently a voice said ungrateful prince even this fire is hardly enough to warm your cold heart  who complains of my coldness in this dismal place i cried  an unhappy being who loves you hopelessly replied the voice and at the same moment the flames began to flicker and cease to burn and i saw a fairy whom i had known as long as i could remember and whose ugliness had always horrified me she was leaning upon the arm of a most beautiful young girl who wore chains of gold on her wrists and was evidently her slave  why ragotte i said for that was the fairys name what is the meaning of all this is it by your orders that i am here  and whose fault is it she answered that you have never understood me until now must a powerful fairy like myself condescend to explain her doings to you who are no better than an ant by comparison though you think yourself a great king  call me what you like i said impatiently but what is it that you wantmy crown or my cities or my treasures  treasures said the fairy disdainfully if i chose i could make any one of my scullions richer and more powerful than you i do not want your treasures but she added softly if you will give me your heartif you will marry mei will add twenty kingdoms to the one you have already you shall have a hundred castles full of gold and five hundred full of silver and in short anything you like to ask me for  madam ragotte said i when one is at the bottom of a pit where one has fully expected to be roasted alive it is impossible to think of asking such a charming person as you are to marry one i beg that you will set me at liberty and then i shall hope to answer you fittingly  ah said she if you really loved me you would not care where you werea cave a wood a foxhole a desert would please you equally well do not think that you can deceive me you fancy you are going to escape but i assure you that you are going to stay here and the first thing i shall give you to do will be to keep my sheepthey are very good company and speak quite as well as you do  as she spoke she advanced and led me to this plain where we now stand and showed me her flock but i paid little attention to it or to her  to tell the truth i was so lost in admiration of her beautiful slave that i forgot everything else and the cruel ragotte perceiving this turned upon her so furious and terrible a look that she fell lifeless to the ground  at this dreadful sight i drew my sword and rushed at ragotte and should certainly have cut off her head had she not by her magic arts chained me to the spot on which i stood all my efforts to move were useless and at last when i threw myself down on the ground in despair she said to me with a scornful smile  i intend to make you feel my power it seems that you are a lion at present i mean you to be a sheep  so saying she touched me with her wand and i became what you see i did not lose the power of speech or of feeling the misery of my present state  for five years she said you shall be a sheep and lord of this pleasant land while i no longer able to see your face which i loved so much shall be better able to hate you as you deserve to be hated  she disappeared as she finished speaking and if i had not been too unhappy to care about anything i should have been glad that she was gone  the talking sheep received me as their king and told me that they too were unfortunate princes who had in different ways offended the revengeful fairy and had been added to her flock for a certain number of years some more some less from time to time indeed one regains his own proper form and goes back again to his place in the upper world but the other beings whom you saw are the rivals or the enemies of ragotte whom she has imprisoned for a hundred years or so though even they will go back at last the young slave of whom i told you about is one of these i have seen her often and it has been a great pleasure to me she never speaks to me and if i were nearer to her i know i should find her only a shadow which would be very annoying however i noticed that one of my companions in misfortune was also very attentive to this little sprite and i found out that he had been her lover whom the cruel ragotte had taken away from her long before since then i have cared for and thought of nothing but how i might regain my freedom i have often been in the forest that is where i have seen you lovely princess sometimes driving your chariot which you did with all the grace and skill in the world sometimes riding to the chase on so spirited a horse that it seemed as if no one but yourself could have managed it and sometimes running races on the plain with the princesses of your courtrunning so lightly that it was you always who won the prize oh princess i have loved you so long and yet how dare i tell you of my love what hope can there be for an unhappy sheep like myself  miranda was so surprised and confused by all that she had heard that she hardly knew what answer to give to the king of the sheep but she managed to make some kind of little speech which certainly did not forbid him to hope and said that she should not be afraid of the shadows now she knew that they would some day come to life again alas she continued if my poor patypata my dear grabugeon and pretty little tintin who all died for my sake were equally well off i should have nothing left to wish for here  prisoner though he was the king of the sheep had still some powers and privileges  go said he to his master of the horse go and seek the shadows of the little black girl the monkey and the dog they will amuse our princess  and an instant afterward miranda saw them coming toward her and their presence gave her the greatest pleasure though they did not come near enough for her to touch them  the king of the sheep was so kind and amusing and loved miranda so dearly that at last she began to love him too such a handsome sheep who was so polite and considerate could hardly fail to please especially if one knew that he was really a king and that his strange imprisonment would soon come to an end so the princesss days passed very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come the king of the sheep with the help of all the flock got up balls concerts and hunting parties and even the shadows joined in all the fun and came making believe to be their own real selves  one evening when the couriers arrived for the king sent most carefully for newsand they always brought the very best kinds it was announced that the sister of the princess miranda was going to be married to a great prince and that nothing could be more splendid than all the preparations for the wedding  ah cried the young princess how unlucky i am to miss the sight of so many pretty things here am i imprisoned under the earth with no company but sheep and shadows while my sister is to be adorned like a queen and surrounded by all who love and admire her and everyone but myself can go to wish her joy  why do you complain princess said the king of the sheep did i say that you were not to go to the wedding set out as soon as you please only promise me that you will come back for i love you too much to be able to live without you  miranda was very grateful to him and promised faithfully that nothing in the world should keep her from coming back the king caused an escort suitable to her rank to be got ready for her and she dressed herself splendidly not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful her chariot was of motherofpearl drawn by six duncolored griffins just brought from the other side of the world and she was attended by a number of guards in splendid uniforms who were all at least eight feet high and had come from far and near to ride in the princesss train  miranda reached her fathers palace just as the wedding ceremony began and everyone as soon as she came in was struck with surprise at her beauty and the splendor of her jewels she heard exclamations of admiration on all sides and the king her father looked at her so attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her but he was so sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him  however the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over she went out hastily leaving behind her a little coral casket set with emeralds on it was written in diamond letters jewels for the bride and when they opened it which they did as soon as it was found there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained the king who had hoped to join the unknown princess and find out who she was was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly and gave orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she might not get away so easily short as mirandas absence had been it had seemed like a hundred years to the king of the sheep he was waiting for her by a fountain in the thickest part of the forest and the ground was strewn with splendid presents which he had prepared for her to show his joy and gratitude at her coming back  as soon as she was in sight he rushed to meet her leaping and bounding like a real sheep he caressed her tenderly throwing himself at her feet and kissing her hands and told her how uneasy he had been in her absence and how impatient for her return with an eloquence which charmed her  after some time came the news that the kings second daughter was going to be married when miranda heard it she begged the king of the sheep to allow her to go and see the wedding as before this request made him feel very sad as if some misfortune must surely come of it but his love for the princess being stronger than anything else he did not like to refuse her  you wish to leave me princess said he it is my unhappy fateyou are not to blame i consent to your going but believe me i can give you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing  the princess assured him that she would only stay a very short time as she had done before and begged him not to be uneasy as she would be quite as much grieved if anything detained her as he could possibly be  so with the same escort she set out and reached the palace as the marriage ceremony began everybody was delighted to see her she was so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess and the princes who were there could not take their eyes off her  the king was more glad than anyone else that she had come again and gave orders that the doors should all be shut and bolted that very minute when the wedding was all but over the princess got up quickly hoping to slip away unnoticed among the crowd but to her great dismay she found every door fastened  she felt more at ease when the king came up to her and with the greatest respect begged her not to run away so soon but at least to honor him by staying for the splendid feast which was prepared for the princes and princesses he led her into a magnificent hall where all the court was assembled and himself taking up the golden bowl full of water he offered it to her that she might dip her pretty fingers into it  at this the princess could no longer contain herself throwing herself at the kings feet she cried out  my dream has come true after allyou have offered me water to wash my hands on my sisters wedding day and it has not vexed you to do it  the king recognized her at onceindeed he had already thought several times how much like his poor little miranda she was  oh my dear daughter he cried kissing her can you ever forget my cruelty i ordered you to be put to death because i thought your dream portended the loss of my crown and so it did he added for now your sisters are both married and have kingdoms of their ownand mine shall be for you so saying he put his crown on the princesss head and cried  long live queen miranda  all the court cried long live queen miranda after him and the young queens two sisters came running up and threw their arms round her neck and kissed her a thousand times and then there was such a laughing and crying talking and kissing all at once and miranda thanked her father and began to ask after everyoneparticularly the captain of the guard to whom she owed so much but to her great sorrow she heard that he was dead presently they sat down to the banquet and the king asked miranda to tell them all that had happened to her since the terrible morning when he had sent the captain of the guard to fetch her this she did with so much spirit that all the guests listened with breathless interest but while she was thus enjoying herself with the king and her sisters the king of the sheep was waiting impatiently for the time of her return and when it came and went and no princess appeared his anxiety became so great that he could bear it no longer  she is not coming back any more he cried my miserable sheeps face displeases her and without miranda what is left to me wretched creature that i am oh cruel ragotte my punishment is complete  for a long time he bewailed his sad fate like this and then seeing that it was growing dark and that still there was no sign of the princess he set out as fast as he could in the direction of the town when he reached the palace he asked for miranda but by this time everyone had heard the story of her adventures and did not want her to go back again to the king of the sheep so they refused sternly to let him see her in vain he begged and prayed them to let him in though his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the guards of the palace and at last quite brokenhearted he fell dead at their feet  in the meantime the king who had not the least idea of the sad thing that was happening outside the gate of his palace proposed to miranda that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches placed in windows and balconies and in all the grand squares but what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace there lay her dear kind sheep silent and motionless upon the pavement  she threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him crying bitterly for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life and for a long long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have died too  so you see that even a princess is not always happyespecially if she forgets to keep her word and the greatest misfortunes often happen to people just as they think they have obtained their hearts desires1   1 madame daulnoy     little thumb   there was once upon a time a man and his wife fagotmakers by trade who had several children all boys the eldest was but ten years old and the youngest only seven  they were very poor and their seven children incommoded them greatly because not one of them was able to earn his bread that which gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny constitution and scarce ever spoke a word which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense he was very little and when born no bigger than ones thumb which made him be called little thumb  the poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house and guilty or not was always in the wrong he was notwithstanding more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together and if he spake little he heard and thought the more  there happened now to come a very bad year and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children one evening when they were all in bed and the fagotmaker was sitting with his wife at the fire he said to her with his heart ready to burst with grief  thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children and i cannot see them starve to death before my face i am resolved to lose them in the wood tomorrow which may very easily be done for while they are busy in tying up fagots we may run away and leave them without their taking any notice  ah cried his wife and canst thou thyself have the heart to take thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them  in vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty she would not consent to it she was indeed poor but she was their mother however having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger she at last consented and went to bed all in tears  little thumb heard every word that had been spoken for observing as he lay in his bed that they were talking very busily he got up softly and hid himself under his fathers stool that he might hear what they said without being seen he went to bed again but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night thinking on what he had to do he got up early in the morning and went to the riverside where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles and then returned home  they all went abroad but little thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew they went into a very thick forest where they could not see one another at ten paces distance the fagotmaker began to cut wood and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots their father and mother seeing them busy at their work got away from them insensibly and ran away from them all at once along a byway through the winding bushes  when the children saw they were left alone they began to cry as loud as they could little thumb let them cry on knowing very well how to get home again for as he came he took care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets then he said to them  be not afraid brothers father and mother have left us here but i will lead you home again only follow me  they did so and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest they dared not go in but sat themselves down at the door listening to what their father and mother were saying  the very moment the fagotmaker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns which he had owed them a long while and which they never expected this gave them new life for the poor people were almost famished the fagotmaker sent his wife immediately to the butchers as it was a long while since they had eaten a bit she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people when they had eaten the woman said  alas where are now our poor children they would make a good feast of what we have left here but it was you william who had a mind to lose them i told you we should repent of it what are they now doing in the forest alas dear god the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children  the fagotmaker grew at last quite out of patience for she repeated it above twenty times that they should repent of it and that she was in the right of it for so saying he threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue it was not that the fagotmaker was not perhaps more vexed than his wife but that she teased him and that he was of the humor of a great many others who love wives to speak well but think those very importunate who are continually doing so she was halfdrowned in tears crying out  alas where are now my children my poor children  she spoke this so very loud that the children who were at the gate began to cry out all together  here we are here we are  she ran immediately to open the door and said hugging them  i am glad to see you my dear children you are very hungry and weary and my poor peter thou art horribly bemired come in and let me clean thee  now you must know that peter was her eldest son whom she loved above all the rest because he was somewhat carroty as she herself was they sat down to supper and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest speaking almost always all together the good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted but when the money was all gone they fell again into their former uneasiness and resolved to lose them again and that they might be the surer of doing it to carry them to a much greater distance than before  they could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by little thumb who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former but though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles he was disappointed for he found the housedoor doublelocked and was at a stand what to do when their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast little thumb fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass and so he put the bread in his pocket  their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest when stealing away into a bypath they there left them little thumb was not very uneasy at it for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread which he had scattered all along as he came but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb the birds had come and had eaten it up every bit they were now in great affliction for the farther they went the more they were out of their way and were more and more bewildered in the forest  night now came on and there arose a terribly high wind which made them dreadfully afraid they fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up they scarce dared to speak or turn their heads after this it rained very hard which wetted them to the skin their feet slipped at every step they took and they fell into the mire whence they got up in a very dirty pickle their hands were quite benumbed  little thumb climbed up to the top of a tree to see if he could discover anything and having turned his head about on every side he saw at last a glimmering light like that of a candle but a long way from the forest he came down and when upon the ground he could see it no more which grieved him sadly however having walked for some time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light he perceived it again as he came out of the wood  they came at last to the house where this candle was not without an abundance of fear for very often they lost sight of it which happened every time they came into a bottom they knocked at the door and a good woman came and opened it she asked them what they would have  little thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest and desired to lodge there for gods sake  the woman seeing them so very pretty began to weep and said to them  alas poor babies whither are ye come do ye know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children  ah dear madam answered little thumb who trembled every joint of him as well as his brothers what shall we do to be sure the wolves of the forest will devour us tonight if you refuse us to lie here and so we would rather the gentleman should eat us and perhaps he may take pity upon us especially if you please to beg it of him  the ogres wife who believed she could conceal them from her husband till morning let them come in and brought them to warm themselves at a very good fire for there was a whole sheep upon the spit roasting for the ogres supper  as they began to be a little warm they heard three or four great raps at the door this was the ogre who had come home upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door the ogre presently asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn and then sat himself down to table the sheep was as yet all raw and bloody but he liked it the better for that he sniffed about to the right and left saying  i smell fresh meat  what you smell so said his wife must be the calf which i have just now killed and flayed  i smell fresh meat i tell thee once more replied the ogre looking crossly at his wife and there is something here which i do not understand  as he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed  ah ah said he i see then how thou wouldst cheat me thou cursed woman i know not why i do not eat thee up too but it is well for thee that thou art a tough old carrion here is good game which comes very quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two  with that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one the poor children fell upon their knees and begged his pardon but they had to do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world who far from having any pity on them had already devoured them with his eyes and told his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good savory sauce he then took a great knife and coming up to these poor children whetted it upon a great whetstone which he held in his left hand he had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him  why need you do it now is it not time enough tomorrow  hold your prating said the ogre they will eat the tenderer  but you have so much meat already replied his wife you have no occasion here are a calf two sheep and half a hog  that is true said the ogre give them their belly full that they may not fall away and put them to bed  the good woman was overjoyed at this and gave them a good supper but they were so much afraid they could not eat a bit as for the ogre he sat down again to drink being highly pleased that he had got wherewithal to treat his friends he drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed  the ogre had seven daughters all little children and these young ogresses had all of them very fine complexions because they used to eat fresh meat like their father but they had little gray eyes quite round hooked noses and very long sharp teeth standing at a good distance from each other they were not as yet over and above mischievous but they promised very fair for it for they had already bitten little children that they might suck their blood  they had been put to bed early with every one a crown of gold upon her head there was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness and it was into this bed the ogres wife put the seven little boys after which she went to bed to her husband  little thumb who had observed that the ogres daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads and was afraid lest the ogre should repent his not killing them got up about midnight and taking his brothers bonnets and his own went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little ogresses after having taken off their crowns of gold which he put upon his own head and his brothers that the ogre might take them for his daughters and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill  all this succeeded according to his desire for the ogre waking about midnight and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done overnight threw himself hastily out of bed and taking his great knife  let us see said he how our little rogues do and not make two jobs of the matter  he then went up groping all the way into his daughters chamber and coming to the bed where the little boys lay and who were every soul of them fast asleep except little thumb who was terribly afraid when he found the ogre fumbling about his head as he had done about his brothers the ogre feeling the golden crowns said  i should have made a fine piece of work of it truly i find i drank too much last night  then he went to the bed where the girls lay and having found the boys little bonnets  ah said he my merry lads are you there let us work as we ought  and saying these words without more ado he cut the throats of all his seven daughters  well pleased with what he had done he went to bed again to his wife so soon as little thumb heard the ogre snore he waked his brothers and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him they stole down softly into the garden and got over the wall they kept running about all night and trembled all the while without knowing which way they went  the ogre when he awoke said to his wife go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night  the wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband not dreaming after what manner she should dress them but thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes she went up and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed and weltering in their blood  she fainted away for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases the ogre fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered went up himself to help her he was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle  ah what have i done cried he the wretches shall pay for it and that instantly  he threw a pitcher of water upon his wifes face and having brought her to herself said  give me quickly my boots of seven leagues that i may go and catch them  he went out and having run over a vast deal of ground both on this side and that he came at last into the very road where the poor children were and not above a hundred paces from their fathers house they espied the ogre who went at one step from mountain to mountain and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels little thumb seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were made his brothers hide themselves in it and crowded into it himself minding always what would become of the ogre  the ogre who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless journey for these boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer had a great mind to rest himself and by chance went to sit down upon the rock where the little boys had hid themselves as it was impossible he could be more weary than he was he fell asleep and after reposing himself some time began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to cut their throats little thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the ogre was asleep so soundly and that they should not be in any pain about him they took his advice and got home presently little thumb came up to the ogre pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs the boots were very long and large but as they were fairies they had the gift of becoming big and little according to the legs of those who wore them so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him he went immediately to the ogres house where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the ogres murdered daughters  your husband said little thumb is in very great danger being taken by a gang of thieves who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver the very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in and that you should give me whatsoever he has of value without retaining any one thing for otherwise they will kill him without mercy and as his case is very pressing he desired me to make use you see i have them on of his boots that i might make the more haste and to show you that i do not impose upon you  the good woman being sadly frightened gave him all she had for this ogre was a very good husband though he used to eat up little children little thumb having thus got all the ogres money came home to his fathers house where he was received with abundance of joy  there are many people who do not agree in this circumstance and pretend that little thumb never robbed the ogre at all and that he only thought he might very justly and with a safe conscience take off his boots of seven leagues because he made no other use of them but to run after little children these folks affirm that they are very well assured of this and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagotmakers house they aver that when little thumb had taken off the ogres boots he went to court where he was informed that they were very much in pain about a certain army which was two hundred leagues off and the success of a battle he went say they to the king and told him that if he desired it he would bring him news from the army before night  the king promised him a great sum of money upon that condition little thumb was as good as his word and returned that very same night with the news and this first expedition causing him to be known he got whatever he pleased for the king paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army after having for some time carried on the business of a messenger and gained thereby great wealth he went home to his father where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return he made the whole family very easy bought places for his father and brothers and by that means settled them very handsomely in the world and in the meantime made his court to perfection1   1 charles perrault     the forty thieves   in a town in persia there dwelt two brothers one named cassim the other ali baba cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty while ali baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring forest and selling it in the town one day when ali baba was in the forest he saw a troop of men on horseback coming toward him in a cloud of dust he was afraid they were robbers and climbed into a tree for safety when they came up to him and dismounted he counted forty of them they unbridled their horses and tied them to trees the finest man among them whom ali baba took to be their captain went a little way among some bushes and said open sesame1 so plainly that ali baba heard him a door opened in the rocks and having made the troop go in he followed them and the door shut again of itself they stayed some time inside and ali baba fearing they might come out and catch him was forced to sit patiently in the tree at last the door opened again and the forty thieves came out as the captain went in last he came out first and made them all pass by him he then closed the door saying shut sesame every man bridled his horse and mounted the captain put himself at their head and they returned as they came   1 sesame is a kind of grain   then ali baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes and said open sesame and it flew open ali baba who expected a dull dismal place was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault which received the light from an opening in the ceiling he saw rich bales of merchandisesilk stuffbrocades all piled together and gold and silver in heaps and money in leather purses he went in and the door shut behind him he did not look at the silver but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses which were browsing outside could carry loaded them with the bags and hid it all with fagots using the words shut sesame he closed the door and went home  then he drove his asses into the yard shut the gates carried the moneybags to his wife and emptied them out before her he bade her keep the secret and he would go and bury the gold let me first measure it said his wife i will go borrow a measure of someone while you dig the hole so she ran to the wife of cassim and borrowed a measure knowing ali babas poverty the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure ali babas wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold and filled it and emptied it often to her great content she then carried it back to her sister without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it which cassims wife perceived directly her back was turned she grew very curious and said to cassim when he came home cassim your brother is richer than you he does not count his money he measures it he begged her to explain this riddle which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it then cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise ali baba he said showing him the gold piece you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold by this ali baba perceived that through his wifes folly cassim and his wife knew their secret so he confessed all and offered cassim a share that i expect said cassim but i must know where to find the treasure otherwise i will discover all and you will lose all ali baba more out of kindness than fear told him of the cave and the very words to use cassim left ali baba meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself he rose early next morning and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests he soon found the place and the door in the rock he said open sesame and the door opened and shut behind him he could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches instead of sesame he said open barley and the door remained fast he named several different sorts of grain all but the right one and the door still stuck fast he was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it  about noon the robbers returned to their cave and saw cassims mules roving about with great chests on their backs this gave them the alarm they drew their sabres and went to the door which opened on their captains saying open sesame cassim who had heard the trampling of their horses feet resolved to sell his life dearly so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the captain down in vain however for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him on entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret they cut cassims body into four quarters and nailed them up inside the cave in order to frighten anyone who should venture in and went away in search of more treasure  as night drew on cassims wife grew very uneasy and ran to her brotherinlaw and told him where her husband had gone ali baba did his best to comfort her and set out to the forest in search of cassim the first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother full of horror he put the body on one of his asses and bags of gold on the other two and covering all with some fagots returned home he drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard and led the other to cassims house the door was opened by the slave morgiana whom he knew to be both brave and cunning unloading the ass he said to her this is the body of your master who has been murdered but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed i will speak with you again but now tell your mistress i am come the wife of cassim on learning the fate of her husband broke out into cries and tears but ali baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to morgiana whereupon she agreed and dried her eyes  morgiana meanwhile sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges my poor master she said can neither eat nor speak and no one knows what his distemper is she carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die thus in the evening no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of cassims wife and morgiana telling everyone that cassim was dead the day after morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early put a piece of gold in his hand and bade him follow her with his needle and thread having bound his eyes with a handkerchief she took him to the room where the body lay pulled off the bandage and bade him sew the quarters together after which she covered his eyes again and led him home then they buried cassim and morgiana his slave followed him to the grave weeping and tearing her hair while cassims wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries next day she went to live with ali baba who gave cassims shop to his eldest son  the forty thieves on their return to the cave were much astonished to find cassims body gone and some of their moneybags we are certainly discovered said the captain and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it is that knows our secret two men must have known it we have killed one we must now find the other to this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler and discover whom we have killed and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death if the messenger fails he must lose his life lest we be betrayed one of the thieves started up and offered to do this and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself and happened to enter the town at daybreak just by baba mustaphas stall the thief bade him goodday saying honest man how can you possibly see to stitch at your age old as i am replied the cobbler i have very good eyes and will you believe me when i tell you that i sewed a dead body together in a place where i had less light than i have now the robber was overjoyed at his good fortune and giving him a piece of gold desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body at first mustapha refused saying that he had been blindfolded but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before this means succeeded the robber partly led him and was partly guided by him right in front of cassims house the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk then well pleased he bade farewell to baba mustapha and returned to the forest by and by morgiana going out saw the mark the robber had made quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side without saying anything to her master or mistress  the thief meantime told his comrades of his discovery the captain thanked him and bade him show him the house he had marked but when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner the guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed another robber was dispatched and having won over baba mustapha marked the house in red chalk but morgiana being again too clever for them the second messenger was put to death also the captain now resolved to go himself but wiser than the others he did not mark the house but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it he returned and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules and thirtyeight leather jars all empty except one which was full of oil the captain put one of his men fully armed into each rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirtyseven robbers in jars and the jar of oil and reached the town by dusk the captain stopped his mules in front of ali babas house and said to ali baba who was sitting outside for coolness i have brought some oil from a distance to sell at tomorrows market but it is now so late that i know not where to pass the night unless you will do me the favor to take me in though ali baba had seen the captain of the robbers in the forest he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant he bade him welcome opened his gates for the mules to enter and went to morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest he brought the stranger into his hall and after they had supped went again to speak to morgiana in the kitchen while the captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules but really to tell his men what to do beginning at the first jar and ending at the last he said to each man as soon as i throw some stones from the window of the chamber where i lie cut the jars open with your knives and come out and i will be with you in a trice he returned to the house and morgiana led him to his chamber she then told abdallah her fellowslave to set on the pot to make some broth for her master who had gone to bed meanwhile her lamp went out and she had no more oil in the house do not be uneasy said abdallah go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars morgiana thanked him for his advice took the oil pot and went into the yard when she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly is it time  any other slave but morgiana on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted would have screamed and made a noise but she knowing the danger her master was in bethought herself of a plan and answered quietly not yet but presently she went to all the jars giving the same answer till she came to the jar of oil she now saw that her master thinking to entertain an oil merchant had let thirtyeight robbers into his house she filled her oil pot went back to the kitchen and having lit her lamp went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil when it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside when this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen put out the fire and the lamp and waited to see what would happen  in a quarter of an hour the captain of the robbers awoke got up and opened the window as all seemed quiet he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars he listened and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy and went down into the yard on going to the first jar and saying are you asleep he smelt the hot boiled oil and knew at once that his plot to murder ali baba and his household had been discovered he found all the gang was dead and missing the oil out of the last jar became aware of the manner of their death he then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden and climbing over several walls made his escape morgiana heard and saw all this and rejoicing at her success went to bed and fell asleep  at daybreak ali baba arose and seeing the oil jars still there asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil seeing a man he started back in terror have no fear said morgiana the man cannot harm you he is dead ali baba when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment asked what had become of the merchant merchant said she he is no more a merchant than i am and she told him the whole story assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest of whom only three were left and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it ali baba at once gave morgiana her freedom saying that he owed her his life they then buried the bodies in ali babas garden while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves  the captain returned to his lonely cave which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing ali baba he dressed himself carefully and went into the town where he took lodgings in an inn in the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen and set up a shop opposite that of ali babas son he called himself cogia hassan and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with ali babas son and through him with ali baba whom he was continually asking to sup with him ali baba wishing to return his kindness invited him into his house and received him smiling thanking him for his kindness to his son when the merchant was about to take his leave ali baba stopped him saying where are you going sir in such haste will you not stay and sup with me the merchant refused saying that he had a reason and on ali babas asking him what that was he replied it is sir that i can eat no victuals that have any salt in them if that is all said ali baba let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat tonight he went to give this order to morgiana who was much surprised who is this man she said who eats no salt with his meat he is an honest man morgiana returned her master therefore do as i bid you but she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man so she helped abdallah to carry up the dishes and saw in a moment that cogia hassan was the robber captain and carried a dagger under his garment i am not surprised she said to herself that this wicked man who intends to kill my master will eat no salt with him but i will hinder his plans  she sent up the supper by abdallah while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on when the dessert had been served cogia hassan was left alone with ali baba and his son whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them morgiana meanwhile put on a headdress like a dancinggirls and clasped a girdle round her waist from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt and said to abdallah take your tabor and let us go and divert our master and his guest abdallah took his tabor and played before morgiana until they came to the door where abdallah stopped playing and morgiana made a low courtesy come in morgiana said ali baba and let cogia hassan see what you can do and turning to cogia hassan he said shes my slave and my housekeeper cogia hassan was by no means pleased for he feared that his chance of killing ali baba was gone for the present but he pretended great eagerness to see morgiana and abdallah began to play and morgiana to dance after she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it sometimes pointing it at her own breast sometimes at her masters as if it were part of the dance suddenly out of breath she snatched the tabor from abdallah with her left hand and holding the dagger in her right hand held out the tabor to her master ali baba and his son put a piece of gold into it and cogia hassan seeing that she was coming to him pulled out his purse to make her a present but while he was putting his hand into it morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart  unhappy girl cried ali baba and his son what have you done to ruin us  it was to preserve you master not to ruin you answered morgiana see here opening the false merchants garment and showing the dagger see what an enemy you have entertained remember he would eat no salt with you and what more would you have look at him he is both the false oil merchant and the captain of the forty thieves  ali baba was so grateful to morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage who readily consented and a few days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor  at the end of a year ali baba hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers judged they were dead and set out to the cave the door opened on his saying open sesame he went in and saw that nobody had been there since the captain left it he brought away as much gold as he could carry and returned to town he told his son the secret of the cave which his son handed down in his turn so the children and grandchildren of ali baba were rich to the end of their lives1   1 arabian nights     hansel and grettel   once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children the boy was called hansel and the girl grettel he had always little enough to live on and once when there was a great famine in the land he couldnt even provide them with daily bread one night as he was tossing about in bed full of cares and worry he sighed and said to his wife whats to become of us how are we to support our poor children now that we have nothing more for ourselves ill tell you what husband answered the woman early tomorrow morning well take the children out into the thickest part of the wood there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread then well go on to our work and leave them alone they wont be able to find their way home and we shall thus be rid of them no wife said her husband that i wont do how could i find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood the wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces oh you fool said she then we must all four die of hunger and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins and she left him no peace till he consented but i cant help feeling sorry for the poor children added the husband  the children too had not been able to sleep for hunger and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father grettel wept bitterly and spoke to hansel now its all up with us no no grettel said hansel dont fret yourself ill be able to find a way to escape no fear and when the old people had fallen asleep he got up slipped on his little coat opened the back door and stole out the moon was shining clearly and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in then he went back and said to grettel be comforted my dear little sister and go to sleep god will not desert us and he lay down in bed again  at daybreak even before the sun was up the woman came and woke the two children get up you lieabeds were all going to the forest to fetch wood she gave them each a bit of bread and said theres something for your luncheon but dont you eat it up before for its all youll get grettel took the bread under her apron as hansel had the stones in his pocket then they all set out together on the way to the forest after they had walked for a little hansel stood still and looked back at the house and this maneuver he repeated again and again his father observed him and said hansel what are you gazing at there and why do you always remain behind take care and dont lose your footing oh father said hansel i am looking back at my white kitten which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell the woman exclaimed what a donkey you are that isnt your kitten thats the morning sun shining on the chimney but hansel had not looked back at his kitten but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path  when they had reached the middle of the forest the father said now children go and fetch a lot of wood and ill light a fire that you may not feel cold hansel and grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill the brushwood was set fire to and when the flames leaped high the woman said now lie down at the fire children and rest yourselves we are going into the forest to cut down wood when weve finished well come back and fetch you hansel and grettel sat down beside the fire and at midday ate their little bits of bread they heard the strokes of the axe so they thought their father was quite near but it was no axe they heard but a bough he had tied on a dead tree and that was blown about by the wind and when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue and they fell fast asleep when they awoke at last it was pitch dark grettel began to cry and said how are we ever to get out of the wood but hansel comforted her wait a bit he said till the moon is up and then well find our way sure enough and when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles which shone like new threepenny bits and showed them the path they walked on through the night and at daybreak reached their fathers house again they knocked at the door and when the woman opened it she exclaimed you naughty children what a time youve slept in the wood we thought you were never going to come back but the father rejoiced for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves  not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night everything is eaten up once more we have only half a loaf in the house and when thats done its all up with us the children must be got rid of well lead them deeper into the wood this time so that they wont be able to find their way out again there is no other way of saving ourselves the mans heart smote him heavily and he thought surely it would be better to share the last bite with ones children but his wife wouldnt listen to his arguments and did nothing but scold and reproach him if a man yields once hes done for and so because he had given in the first time he was forced to do so the second  but the children were awake and had heard the conversation when the old people were asleep hansel got up and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again as he had done the first time but the woman had barred the door and hansel couldnt get out but he consoled his little sister and said dont cry grettel and sleep peacefully for god is sure to help us  at early dawn the woman came and made the children get up they received their bit of bread but it was even smaller than the time before on the way to the wood hansel crumbled it in his pocket and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground hansel what are you stopping and looking about you for said the father im looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell answered hansel fool said the wife that isnt your pigeon its the morning sun glittering on the chimney but hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path the woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before then a big fire was lit again and the mother said just sit down there children and if youre tired you can sleep a bit were going into the forest to cut down wood and in the evening when were finished well come back to fetch you at midday grettel divided her bread with hansel for he had strewn his all along their path then they fell asleep and evening passed away but nobody came to the poor children they didnt awake till it was pitch dark and hansel comforted his sister saying only wait grettel till the moon rises then we shall see the breadcrumbs i scattered along the path they will show us the way back to the house when the moon appeared they got up but they found no crumbs for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up never mind said hansel to grettel youll see well find a way out but all the same they did not they wandered about the whole night and the next day from morning till evening but they could not find a path out of the wood they were very hungry too for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground and at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep  on the third morning after they had left their fathers house they set about their wandering again but only got deeper and deeper into the wood and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish at midday they saw a beautiful little snowwhite bird sitting on a branch which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it and when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them they followed it and came to a little house on the roof of which it perched and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes while the window was made of transparent sugar now well set to said hansel and have a regular blowout1 ill eat a bit of the roof and you grettel can eat some of the window which youll find a sweet morsel hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like and grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside    nibble nibble little mouse   whos nibbling my house  the children answered    tis heavens own child   the tempest wild  and went on eating without putting themselves about hansel who thoroughly appreciated the roof tore down a big bit of it while grettel pushed out a whole round windowpane and sat down the better to enjoy it suddenly the door opened and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out hansel and grettel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall but the old woman shook her head and said oh ho you dear children who led you here just come in and stay with me no ill shall befall you she took them both by the hand and let them into the house and laid a most sumptuous dinner before themmilk and sugared pancakes with apples and nuts after they had finished two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them and when hansel and grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got into heaven   1 he was a vulgar boy   the old woman had appeared to be most friendly but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in when anyone came into her power she killed cooked and ate him and held a regular feastday for the occasion now witches have red eyes and cannot see far but like beasts they have a keen sense of smell and know when human beings pass by when hansel and grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously and said jeeringly ive got them now they shant escape me early in the morning before the children were awake she rose up and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully with their round rosy cheeks she muttered to herself thatll be a dainty bite then she seized hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable and barred the door on him he might scream as much as he liked it did him no good then she went to grettel shook her till she awoke and cried get up you lazybones fetch water and cook something for your brother when hes fat ill eat him up grettel began to cry bitterly but it was of no use she had to do what the wicked witch bade her  so the best food was cooked for poor hansel but grettel got nothing but crabshells every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and cried hansel put out your finger that i may feel if you are getting fat but hansel always stretched out a bone and the old dame whose eyes were dim couldnt see it and thinking always it was hansels finger wondered why he fattened so slowly when four weeks had passed and hansel still remained thin she lost patience and determined to wait no longer hi grettel she called to the girl be quick and get some water hansel may be fat or thin im going to kill him tomorrow and cook him oh how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water and how the tears rolled down her cheeks kind heaven help us now she cried if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us then at least we should have died together just hold your peace said the old hag it wont help you  early in the morning grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water and light the fire first well bake said the old dame ive heated the oven already and kneaded the dough she pushed grettel out to the oven from which fiery flames were already issuing creep in said the witch and see if its properly heated so that we can shove in the bread for when she had got grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake that she might eat her up too but grettel perceived her intention and said i dont know how im to do it how do i get in you silly goose said the hag the opening is big enough see i could get in myself and she crawled toward it and poked her head into the oven then grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in shut the iron door and drew the bolt gracious how she yelled it was quite horrible but grettel fled and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably  grettel flew straight to hansel opened the little stabledoor and cried hansel we are free the old witch is dead then hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened how they rejoiced and fell on each others necks and jumped for joy and kissed one another and as they had no longer any cause for fear they went in the old hags house and here they found in every corner of the room boxes with pearls and precious stones these are even better than pebbles said hansel and crammed his pockets full of them and grettel said i too will bring something home and she filled her apron full but now said hansel lets go and get well away from the witchs wood when they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake we cant get over said hansel i see no bridge of any sort or kind yes and theres no ferryboat either answered grettel but look there swims a white duck if i ask her shell help us over and she called out    here are two children mournful very   seeing neither bridge nor ferry   take us upon your white back   and row us over quack quack   the duck swam toward them and hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him no answered grettel we should be too heavy a load for the duck she shall carry us across separately the good bird did this and when they were landed safely on the other side and had gone for a while the wood became more and more familiar to them and at length they saw their fathers house in the distance then they set off to run and bounding into the room fell on their fathers neck the man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood but the woman had died grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room and hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket thus all their troubles were ended and they lived happily ever afterward  my story is done see there runs a little mouse anyone who catches it may make himself a large fur cap out of it1   1 grimm     snowwhite and rosered   a poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it in which grew two rose trees one bearing white roses and the other red she had two children who were just like the two rose trees one was called snowwhite and the other rosered and they were the sweetest and best children in the world always diligent and always cheerful but snowwhite was quieter and more gentle than rosered rosered loved to run about the fields and meadows and to pick flowers and catch butterflies but snowwhite sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household or read aloud to her when there was no work to do the two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together and when snowwhite said we will never desert each other rosered answered no not as long as we live and the mother added whatever one gets she shall share with the other they often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them on the contrary they came up to them in the most confiding manner the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands the deer grazed beside them the stag would bound past them merrily and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might  no evil ever befell them if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning and their mother knew they were quite safe and never felt anxious about them once when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their restingplace the figure got up looked at them kindly but said nothing and vanished into the wood and when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness and when they told their mother of their adventure she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children  snowwhite and rosered kept their mothers cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it in summer rosered looked after the house and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed from each tree a rose in winter snowwhite lit the fire and put on the kettle which was made of brass but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold in the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said snowwhite go and close the shutters and they drew round the fire while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span beside them on the ground lay a little lamb and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings  one evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance the mother said rosered open the door quickly it must be some traveler seeking shelter rosered hastened to unbar the door and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside but it was no such thing only a bear who poked his thick black head through the door rosered screamed aloud and sprang back in terror the lamb began to bleat the dove flapped its wings and snowwhite ran and hid behind her mothers bed but the bear began to speak and said dont be afraid i wont hurt you i am half frozen and only wish to warm myself a little my poor bear said the mother lie down by the fire only take care you dont burn your fur then she called out snowwhite and rosered come out the bear will do you no harm he is a good honest creature so they both came out of their hidingplaces and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too and they all forgot their fear the bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire and growled quite happily and comfortably the children soon grew quite at their ease with him and led their helpless guest a fearful life they tugged his fur with their hands put their small feet on his back and rolled him about here and there or took a hazel wand and beat him with it and if he growled they only laughed the bear submitted to everything with the best possible goodnature only when they went too far he cried oh children spare my life    snowwhite and rosered   dont beat your lover dead  when it was time to retire for the night and the others went to bed the mother said to the bear you can lie there on the hearth in heavens name it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet as soon as day dawned the children led him out and he trotted over the snow into the wood from this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance  when spring came and all outside was green the bear said one morning to snowwhite now i must go away and not return again the whole summer where are you going to dear bear asked snowwhite i must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs in winter when the earth is frozen hard they are obliged to remain underground for they cant work their way through but now when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light snowwhite was quite sad over their friends departure and when she unbarred the door for him the bear stepping out caught a piece of his fur in the doorknocker and snowwhite thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it but she couldnt be certain of it and the bear ran hastily away and soon disappeared behind the trees  a short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots they came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down but what it was they couldnt distinguish when they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long the end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain and didnt seem to know what he was to do he glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and screamed out what are you standing there for cant you come and help me what were you doing little man asked rosered you stupid inquisitive goose replied the dwarf i wanted to split the tree in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need i had successfully driven in the wedge and all was going well but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out and the tree closed up so rapidly that i had no time to take my beautiful white beard out so here i am stuck fast and i cant get away and you silly smoothfaced milkandwater girls just stand and laugh ugh what wretches you are  the children did all in their power but they couldnt get the beard out it was wedged in far too firmly i will run and fetch somebody said rosered crazy blockheads snapped the dwarf whats the good of calling anyone else youre already two too many for me does nothing better occur to you than that dont be so impatient said snowwhite ill see you get help and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard as soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree lifted it up and muttered aloud curse these rude wretches cutting off a piece of my splendid beard with these words he swung the bag over his back and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again  shortly after this snowwhite and rosered went out to get a dish of fish as they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in they ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf where are you going to asked rosered youre surely not going to jump into the water im not such a fool screamed the dwarf dont you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in the little man had been sitting on the bank fishing when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line and when immediately afterward a big fish bit the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out the fish had the upper fin and dragged the dwarf toward him he clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass but it didnt help him much he had to follow every movement of the fish and was in great danger of being drawn into the water the girls came up just at the right moment held him firm and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line but in vain beard and line were in a hopeless muddle nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard by which a small part of it was sacrificed  when the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them do you call that manners you toadstools to disfigure a fellows face it wasnt enough that you shortened my beard before but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it i cant appear like this before my own people i wish youd been in jericho first then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone  it happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles thread laces and ribbons their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there while trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air circling slowly above them but always descending lower till at last it settled on a rock not far from them immediately afterward they heard a sharp piercing cry they ran forward and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf and was about to carry him off the tenderhearted children seized hold of the little man and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey when the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice couldnt you have treated me more carefully you have torn my thin little coat all to shreds useless awkward hussies that you are then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave the girls were accustomed to his ingratitude and went on their way and did their business in town on their way home as they were again passing the heath they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour the evening sun shone on the glittering stones and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them what are you standing there gaping for screamed the dwarf and his ashengray face became scarlet with rage he was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard and a black bear trotted out of the wood the dwarf jumped up in great fright but he hadnt time to reach his place of retreat for the bear was already close to him then he cried in terror dear mr bear spare me ill give you all my treasure look at those beautiful precious stones lying there spare my life what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me you wont feel me between your teeth there lay hold of these two wicked girls they will be a tender morsel for you as fat as young quails eat them up for heavens sake but the bear paying no attention to his words gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw and he never moved again  the girls had run away but the bear called after them snowwhite and rosered dont be afraid wait and ill come with you then they recognized his voice and stood still and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off and a beautiful man stood beside them all dressed in gold i am a kings son he said and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf who had stolen my treasure to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free now he has got his wellmerited punishment  snowwhite married him and rosered his brother and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them the old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children and she carried the two rose trees with her and they stood in front of her window and every year they bore the finest red and white roses1   1 grimm     the goosegirl   once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead for many years had a beautiful daughter when she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off now when the time drew near for her to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom her old mother gave her much costly baggage and many ornaments gold and silver trinkets and knicknacks and in fact everything that belonged to a royal trousseau for she loved her daughter very dearly she gave her a waitingmaid also who was to ride with her and hand her over to the bridegroom and she provided each of them with a horse for the journey now the princesss horse was called falada and could speak  when the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled then she held a white rag under them and letting three drops of blood fall into it she gave it to her daughter and said dear child take great care of this rag it may be of use to you on the journey  so they took a sad farewell of each other and the princess stuck the rag in front of her dress mounted her horse and set forth on the journey to her bridegrooms kingdom after they had ridden for about an hour the princess began to feel very thirsty and said to her waitingmaid pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream i would like a drink if youre thirsty said the maid dismount yourself and lie down by the water and drink i dont mean to be your servant any longer the princess was so thirsty that she got down bent over the stream and drank for she wasnt allowed to drink out of the golden goblet as she drank she murmured oh heaven what am i to do and the three drops of blood replied    if your mother only knew   her heart would surely break in two  but the princess was meek and said nothing about her maids rude behavior and quietly mounted her horse again they rode on their way for several miles but the day was hot and the suns rays smote fiercely on them so that the princess was soon overcome by thirst again and as they passed a brook she called once more to her waitingmaid pray get down and give me a drink from my golden cup for she had long ago forgotten her maids rude words but the waitingmaid replied more haughtily even than before if you want a drink you can dismount and get it i dont mean to be your servant then the princess was compelled by her thirst to get down and bending over the flowing water she cried and said oh heaven what am i to do and the three drops of blood replied    if your mother only knew   her heart would surely break in two  and as she drank thus and leaned right over the water the rag containing the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated down the stream and she in her anxiety never even noticed her loss but the waitingmaid had observed it with delight as she knew it gave her power over the bride for in losing the drops of blood the princess had become weak and powerless when she wished to get on her horse falada again the waitingmaid called out i mean to ride falada you must mount my beast and this too she had to submit to then the waitingmaid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes and to put on her common ones and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word about the matter when they reached the palace and if she hadnt taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot but falada observed everything and laid it all to heart  the waitingmaid now mounted falada and the real bride the worse horse and so they continued their journey till at length they arrived at the palace yard there was great rejoicing over the arrival and the prince sprang forward to meet them and taking the waitingmaid for his bride he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal chamber in the meantime the real princess was left standing below in the courtyard the old king who was looking out of his window beheld her in this plight and it struck him how sweet and gentle even beautiful she looked he went at once to the royal chamber and asked the bride who it was she had brought with her and had left thus standing in the court below oh replied the bride i brought her with me to keep me company on the journey give the girl something to do that she may not be idle but the old king had no work for her and couldnt think of anything so he said ive a small boy who looks after the geese shed better help him the youths name was curdken and the real bride was made to assist him in herding geese  soon after this the false bride said to the prince dearest husband i pray you grant me a favor he answered that i will then let the slaughterer cut off the head of the horse i rode here upon because it behaved very badly on the journey but the truth was she was afraid lest the horse should speak and tell how she had treated the princess she carried her point and the faithful falada was doomed to die when the news came to the ears of the real princess she went to the slaughterer and secretly promised him a piece of gold if he would do something for her there was in the town a large dark gate through which she had to pass night and morning with the geese would he kindly hang up faladas head there that she might see it once again the slaughterer said he would do as she desired chopped off the head and nailed it firmly over the gateway  early next morning as she and curdken were driving their flock through the gate she said as she passed under     oh falada tis you hang there  and the head replied    tis you pass under princess fair   if your mother only knew   her heart would surely break in two  then she left the tower and drove the geese into a field and when they had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed her hair which was of pure gold curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun and wanted much to pull some hair out then she spoke    wind wind gently sway   blow curdkens hat away   let him chase oer field and wold   till my locks of ruddy gold   now astray and hanging down   be combed and plaited in a crown   then a gust of wind blew curdkens hat away and he had to chase it over hill and dale when he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling and his chance of getting any hair was gone curdken was very angry and wouldnt speak to her so they herded the geese till evening and then went home  the next morning as they passed under the gate the girl said    oh falada tis you hang there  and the head replied    tis you pass under princess fair   if your mother only knew   her heart would surely break in two  then she went on her way till she came to the common where she sat down and began to comb out her hair then curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head but she called out hastily    wind wind gently sway   blow curdkens hat away   let him chase oer field and wold   till my locks of ruddy gold   now astray and hanging down   be combed and plaited in a crown   then a puff of wind came and blew curdkens hat far away so that he had to run after it and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks and he couldnt get any hair so they watched the geese till it was dark  but that evening when they got home curdken went to the old king and said i refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl for what reason asked the old king because she does nothing but annoy me all day long replied curdken and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities and said every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horses head that hangs on the wall       oh falada tis you hang there  and the head replies       tis you pass under princess fair      if your mother only knew      her heart would surely break in two   and curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed and how he had always to chase his hat  the old king bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate and heard how the goosegirl greeted falada then he followed her through the field and hid himself behind a bush on the common he soon saw with his own eyes how the gooseboy and the goosegirl looked after the geese and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair that glittered like gold and repeated    wind wind gently sway   blow curdkens hat away   let him chase oer field and wold   till my locks of ruddy gold   now astray and hanging down   be combed and plaited in a crown  then a gust of wind came and blew curdkens hat away so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair all this the old king observed and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him in the evening when the goosegirl came home he called her aside and asked her why she behaved as she did i may not tell you why how dare i confide my woes to anyone for i swore not to by heaven otherwise i should have lost my life the old king begged her to tell him all and left her no peace but he could get nothing out of her at last he said well if you wont tell me confide your trouble to the iron stove there and he went away then she crept to the stove and began to sob and cry and to pour out her poor little heart and said here i sit deserted by all the world i who am a kings daughter and a false waitingmaid has forced me to take off my own clothes and has taken my place with my bridegroom while i have to fulfill the lowly office of goosegirl    if my mother only knew   her heart would surely break in two   but the old king stood outside at the stove chimney and listened to her words then he entered the room again and bidding her leave the stove he ordered royal apparel to be put on her in which she looked amazingly lovely then he summoned his son and revealed to him that he had got the false bride who was nothing but a waitingmaid while the real one in the guise of the exgoosegirl was standing at his side the young king rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was and a great banquet was prepared to which everyone was bidden the bridegroom sat at the head of the table the princess on one side of him and the waitingmaid on the other but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the princess in her glittering garments now when they had eaten and drunk and were merry the old king asked the waitingmaid to solve a knotty point for him what said he should be done to a certain person who has deceived everyone and he proceeded to relate the whole story ending up with now what sentence should be passed then the false bride answered she deserves to be put stark naked into a barrel lined with sharp nails which should be dragged by two white horses up and down the street till she is dead  you are the person said the king and you have passed sentence on yourself and even so it shall be done to you and when the sentence had been carried out the young king was married to his real bride and both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness1   1 grimm     toads and diamonds   there was once upon a time a widow who had two daughters the eldest was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother they were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them  the youngest who was the very picture of her father for courtesy and sweetness of temper was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen as people naturally love their own likeness this mother even doted on her eldest daughter and at the same time had a horrible aversion for the youngestshe made her eat in the kitchen and work continually  among other things this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and ahalf off the house and bring home a pitcher full of it one day as she was at this fountain there came to her a poor woman who begged of her to let her drink  oh ay with all my heart goody said this pretty little girl and rinsing immediately the pitcher she took up some water from the clearest place of the fountain and gave it to her holding up the pitcher all the while that she might drink the easier  the good woman having drunk said to her  you are so very pretty my dear so good and so mannerly that i cannot help giving you a gift for this was a fairy who had taken the form of a poor country woman to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go i will give you for a gift continued the fairy that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel  when this pretty girl came home her mother scolded her for staying so long at the fountain  i beg your pardon mamma said the poor girl for not making more haste  and in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses two pearls and two diamonds  what is it i see there said the mother quite astonished i think i see pearls and diamonds come out of the girls mouth how happens this child  this was the first time she had ever called her child  the poor creature told her frankly all the matter not without dropping out infinite numbers of diamonds  in good faith cried the mother i must send my child thither come hither fanny look what comes out of thy sisters mouth when she speaks wouldst not thou be glad my dear to have the same gift given thee thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink to give it to her very civilly  it would be a very fine sight indeed said this illbred minx to see me go draw water  you shall go hussy said the mother and this minute  so away she went but grumbling all the way taking with her the best silver tankard in the house  she was no sooner at the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood a lady most gloriously dressed who came up to her and asked to drink this was you must know the very fairy who appeared to her sister but now had taken the air and dress of a princess to see how far this girls rudeness would go  am i come hither said the proud saucy one to serve you with water pray i suppose the silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship was it however you may drink out of it if you have a fancy  you are not over and above mannerly answered the fairy without putting herself in a passion well then since you have so little breeding and are so disobliging i give you for a gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad  so soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out  well daughter  well mother answered the pert hussy throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads  oh mercy cried the mother what is it i see oh it is that wretch her sister who has occasioned all this but she shall pay for it and immediately she ran to beat her the poor child fled away from her and went to hide herself in the forest not far from thence  the kings son then on his return from hunting met her and seeing her so very pretty asked her what she did there alone and why she cried  alas sir my mamma has turned me out of doors  the kings son who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth desired her to tell him how that happened she thereupon told him the whole story and so the kings son fell in love with her and considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion conducted her to the palace of the king his father and there married her  as for the sister she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off and the miserable wretch having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in went to a corner of the wood and there died1   1 charles perrault     prince darling   once upon a time there lived a king who was so just and kind that his subjects called him the good king it happened one day when he was out hunting that a little white rabbit which his dogs were chasing sprang into his arms for shelter the king stroked it gently and said to it  well bunny as you have come to me for protection i will see that nobody hurts you  and he took it home to his palace and had it put in a pretty little house with all sorts of nice things to eat  that night when he was alone in his room a beautiful lady suddenly appeared before him her long dress was as white as snow and she had a crown of white roses upon her head the good king was very much surprised to see her for he knew his door had been tightly shut and he could not think how she had got in but she said to him  i am the fairy truth i was passing through the wood when you were out hunting and i wished to find out if you were really good as everybody said you were so i took the shape of a little rabbit and came to your arms for shelter for i know that those who are merciful to animals will be still kinder to their fellowmen if you had refused to help me i should have been certain that you were wicked i thank you for the kindness you have shown me which has made me your friend for ever you have only to ask me for anything you want and i promise that i will give it to you  madam said the good king since you are a fairy you no doubt know all my wishes i have but one son whom i love very dearly that is why he is called prince darling if you are really good enough to wish to do me a favor i beg that you will become his friend  with all my heart answered the fairy i can make your son the handsomest prince in the world or the richest or the most powerful choose whichever you like for him  i do not ask either of these things for my son replied the good king but if you will make him the best of princes i shall indeed be grateful to you what good would it do him to be rich or handsome or to possess all the kingdoms of the world if he were wicked you know well he would still be unhappy only a good man can be really contented  you are quite right answered the fairy but it is not in my power to make prince darling a good man unless he will help me he must himself try hard to become good i can only promise to give him good advice to scold him for his faults and to punish him if he will not correct and punish himself  the good king was quite satisfied with this promise and very soon afterward he died  prince darling was very sorry for he loved his father with all his heart and he would willingly have given all his kingdoms and all his treasures of gold and silver if they could have kept the good king with him  two days afterward when the prince had gone to bed the fairy suddenly appeared to him and said  i promised your father that i would be your friend and to keep my word i have come to bring you a present at the same time she put a little gold ring upon his finger  take great care of this ring she said it is more precious than diamonds every time you do a bad deed it will prick your finger but if in spite of its pricking you go on in your own evil way you will lose my friendship and i shall become your enemy  so saying the fairy disappeared leaving prince darling very much astonished  for some time he behaved so well that the ring never pricked him and that made him so contented that his subjects called him prince darling the happy  one day however he went out hunting but could get no sport which put him in a very bad temper it seemed to him as he rode along that his ring was pressing into his finger but as it did not prick him he did not heed it when he got home and went to his own room his little dog bibi ran to meet him jumping round him with pleasure get away said the prince quite gruffly i dont want you you are in the way  the poor little dog who didnt understand this at all pulled at his coat to make him at least look at her and this made prince darling so cross that he gave her quite a hard kick  instantly his ring pricked him sharply as if it had been a pin he was very much surprised and sat down in a corner of his room feeling quite ashamed of himself  i believe the fairy is laughing at me he thought surely i can have done no great wrong in just kicking a tiresome animal what is the good of my being ruler of a great kingdom if i am not even allowed to beat my own dog  i am not making fun of you said a voice answering prince darlings thoughts you have committed three faults first of all you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted and you thought all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure then you were really angry which is very naughty indeed and lastly you were cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be illtreated  i know you are far above a little dog but if it were right and allowable that great people should illtreat all who are beneath them i might at this moment beat you or kill you for a fairy is greater than a man the advantage of possessing a great empire is not to be able to do the evil that one desires but to do all the good that one possibly can  the prince saw how naughty he had been and promised to try and do better in future but he did not keep his word the fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse who had spoiled him when he was little if he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet and she would give him whatever he asked for which had made him selfwilled also she had told him from morning to night that he would one day be a king and that kings were very happy because everyone was bound to obey and respect them and no one could prevent them from doing just as they liked  when the prince grew old enough to understand he soon learned that there could be nothing worse than to be proud obstinate and conceited and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects but by that time all his faults had become habits and a bad habit is very hard to get rid of not that he was naturally of a bad disposition he was truly sorry when he had been naughty and said  i am very unhappy to have to struggle against my anger and pride every day if i had been punished for them when i was little they would not be such a trouble to me now  his ring pricked him very often and sometimes he left off what he was doing at once but at other times he would not attend to it strangely enough it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed at last he got tired of being constantly reminded and wanted to be able to do as he liked so he threw his ring aside and thought himself the happiest of men to have got rid of its teasing pricks he gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer  one day when the prince was walking about he saw a young girl who was so very pretty that he made up his mind at once that he would marry her her name was celia and she was as good as she was beautiful  prince darling fancied that celia would think herself only too happy if he offered to make her a great queen but she said fearlessly  sire i am only a shepherdess and a poor girl but nevertheless i will not marry you  do you dislike me asked the prince who was very much vexed at this answer  no my prince replied celia i cannot help thinking you very handsome but what good would riches be to me and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me if the bad deeds which i should see you do every day made me hate and despise you  the prince was very angry at this speech and commanded his officers to make celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace all day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him but as he loved her he could not make up his mind to have her punished  one of the princes favorite companions was his fosterbrother whom he trusted entirely but he was not at all a good man and gave prince darling very bad advice and encouraged him in all his evil ways when he saw the prince so downcast he asked what was the matter and when he explained that he could not bear celias bad opinion of him and was resolved to be a better man in order to please her this evil adviser said to him  you are very kind to trouble yourself about this little girl if i were you i would soon make her obey me remember that you are a king and that it would be laughable to see you trying to please a shepherdess who ought to be only too glad to be one of your slaves keep her in prison and feed her on bread and water for a little while and then if she still says she will not marry you have her head cut off to teach other people that you mean to be obeyed why if you cannot make a girl like that do as you wish your subjects will soon forget that they are only put into this world for our pleasure  but said prince darling would it not be a shame if i had an innocent girl put to death for celia has done nothing to deserve punishment  if people will not do as you tell them they ought to suffer for it answered his fosterbrother but even if it were unjust you had better be accused of that by your subjects than that they should find out that they may insult and thwart you as often as they please  in saying this he was touching a weak point in his brothers character for the princes fear of losing any of his power made him at once abandon his first idea of trying to be good and resolve to try and frighten the shepherdess into consenting to marry him  his fosterbrother who wanted him to keep this resolution invited three young courtiers as wicked as himself to sup with the prince and they persuaded him to drink a great deal of wine and continued to excite his anger against celia by telling him that she had laughed at his love for her until at last in quite a furious rage he rushed off to find her declaring that if she still refused to marry him she should be sold as a slave the very next day  but when he reached the room in which celia had been locked up he was greatly surprised to find that she was not in it though he had the key in his own pocket all the time his anger was terrible and he vowed vengeance against whoever had helped her to escape his bad friends when they heard him resolved to turn his wrath upon an old nobleman who had formerly been his tutor and who still dared sometimes to tell the prince of his faults for he loved him as if he had been his own son at first prince darling had thanked him but after a time he grew impatient and thought it must be just mere love of faultfinding that made his old tutor blame him when everyone else was praising and flattering him so he ordered him to retire from his court though he still from time to time spoke of him as a worthy man whom he respected even if he no longer loved him his unworthy friends feared that he might some day take it into his head to recall his old tutor so they thought they now had a good opportunity of getting him banished for ever  they reported to the prince that suliman for that was the tutors name had boasted of having helped celia to escape and they bribed three men to say that suliman himself had told them about it the prince in great anger sent his fosterbrother with a number of soldiers to bring his tutor before him in chains like a criminal after giving this order he went to his own room but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake and the fairy truth appeared suddenly before him  i promised your father said she sternly to give you good advice and to punish you if you refused to follow it you have despised my counsel and have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a man really you are a monsterthe horror of everyone who knows you it is time that i should fulfil my promise and begin your punishment i condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated you have made yourself like the lion by your anger and like the wolf by your greediness like a snake you have ungratefully turned upon one who was a second father to you your churlishness has made you like a bull therefore in your new form take the appearance of all these animals  the fairy had scarcely finished speaking when prince darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled he had a lions head a bulls horns a wolfs feet and a snakes body at the same instant he found himself in a great forest beside a clear lake in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become and a voice said to him  look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you believe me your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body  prince darling recognized the voice of the fairy truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could but he saw no one and the same voice went on  i laugh at your powerlessness and anger and i intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects  the prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness so he ran toward the wood but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears and the hunters who were hiding in a tree leaped down and secured him with several chains and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom  on the way instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him he accused the fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes and bit and tore at his chains furiously  as they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being held and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that the prince whose only pleasure it was to torment his people had been found in his room killed by a thunderbolt for that was what was supposed to have become of him four of his courtiers those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them but the people who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the prince had cut off their heads and had offered the crown to suliman whom the prince had left in prison this noble lord had just been crowned and the deliverance of the kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing for they said he is a good and just man and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity  prince darling roared with anger when he heard this but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace he saw suliman seated upon a magnificent throne and all the people crowded round wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor  presently suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent and said i have accepted the crown you have offered me but only that i may keep it for prince darling who is not dead as you suppose the fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne alas he continued he was led away by flatterers i knew his heart and am certain that if it had not been for the bad influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and a father to his people we may hate his faults but let us pity him and hope for his restoration as for me i would die gladly if that could bring back our prince to reign justly and worthily once more  these words went to prince darlings heart he realized the true affection and faithfulness of his old tutor and for the first time reproached himself for all his evil deeds at the same instant he felt all his anger melting away and he began quickly to think over his past life and to admit that his punishment was not more than he had deserved he left off tearing at the iron bars of the cage in which he was shut up and became as gentle as a lamb  the hunters who had caught him took him to a great menagerie where he was chained up among all the other wild beasts and he determined to show his sorrow for his past bad behavior by being gentle and obedient to the man who had to take care of him unfortunately this man was very rough and unkind and though the poor monster was quite quiet he often beat him without rhyme or reason when he happened to be in a bad temper one day when this keeper was asleep a tiger broke its chain and flew at him to eat him up prince darling who saw what was going on at first felt quite pleased to think that he should be delivered from his persecutor but soon thought better of it and wished that he were free  i would return good for evil he said to himself and save the unhappy mans life he had hardly wished this when his iron cage flew open and he rushed to the side of the keeper who was awake and was defending himself against the tiger when he saw the monster had got out he gave himself up for lost but his fear was soon changed into joy for the kind monster threw itself upon the tiger and very soon killed it and then came and crouched at the feet of the man it had saved  overcome with gratitude the keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service but suddenly a voice said in his ear  a good action should never go unrewarded and at the same instant the monster disappeared and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog  prince darling delighted by the change frisked about the keeper showing his joy in every way he could and the man taking him up in his arms carried him to the king to whom he told the whole story  the queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog and the prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he was a man and a king the queen petted and took care of him but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she consulted the court physician who said that he was to be fed only upon bread and was not to have much even of that so poor prince darling was terribly hungry all day long but he was very patient about it  one day when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace but he was surprised to find that the brook was gone and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones numbers of people splendidly dressed were going into it and sounds of music and dancing and feasting could be heard from the windows  but what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the house were pale and thin and their clothes were torn and hanging in rags about them some fell down dead as they came out before they had time to get away others crawled farther with great difficulty while others again lay on the ground fainting with hunger and begged a morsel of bread from those who were going into the house but they would not so much as look at the poor creatures  prince darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass she was so hungry touched with compassion he said to himself  i am very hungry but i shall not die of starvation before i get my dinner if i give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps i may save her life  so he laid his piece of bread in the girls hand and saw her eat it up eagerly  she soon seemed to be quite well again and the prince delighted to have been able to help her was thinking of going home to the palace when he heard a great outcry and turning round saw celia who was being carried against her will into the great house  for the first time the prince regretted that he was no longer the monster then he would have been able to rescue celia now he could only bark feebly at the people who were carrying her off and try to follow them but they chased and kicked him away  he determined not to quit the place till he knew what had become of celia and blamed himself for what had befallen her  alas he said to himself i am furious with the people who are carrying celia off but isnt that exactly what i did myself and if i had not been prevented did i not intend to be still more cruel to her  here he was interrupted by a noise above his headsomeone was opening a window and he saw with delight that it was celia herself who came forward and threw out a plate of most deliciouslooking food then the window was shut again and prince darling who had not had anything to eat all day thought he might as well take the opportunity of getting something he ran forward to begin but the young girl to whom he had given his bread gave a cry of terror and took him up in her arms saying  dont touch it my poor little dogthat house is the palace of pleasure and everything that comes out of it is poisoned  at the same moment a voice said  you see a good action always brings its reward and the prince found himself changed into a beautiful white dove he remembered that white was the favorite color of the fairy truth and began to hope that he might at last win back her favor but just now his first care was for celia and rising into the air he flew round and round the house until he saw an open window but he searched through every room in vain no trace of celia was to be seen and the prince in despair determined to search through the world till he found her he flew on and on for several days till he came to a great desert where he saw a cavern and to his delight there sat celia sharing the simple breakfast of an old hermit  overjoyed to have found her prince darling perched upon her shoulder trying to express by his caresses how glad he was to see her again and celia surprised and delighted by the tameness of this pretty white dove stroked it softly and said though she never thought of its understanding her  i accept the gift that you make me of yourself and i will love you always  take care what you are saying celia said the old hermit are you prepared to keep that promise  indeed i hope so my sweet shepherdess cried the prince who was at that moment restored to his natural shape you promised to love me always tell me that you really mean what you said or i shall have to ask the fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so much  you need not be afraid that she will change her mind said the fairy throwing off the hermits robe in which she had been disguised and appearing before them  celia has loved you ever since she first saw you only she would not tell you while you were so obstinate and naughty now you have repented and mean to be good you deserve to be happy and so she may love you as much as she likes  celia and prince darling threw themselves at the fairys feet and the prince was never tired of thanking her for her kindness celia was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and misdeeds and promised to love him as long as she lived  rise my children said the fairy and i will transport you to the palace and prince darling shall have back again the crown he forfeited by his bad behavior  while she was speaking they found themselves in sulimans hall and his delight was great at seeing his dear master once more he gave up the throne joyfully to the prince and remained always the most faithful of his subjects  celia and prince darling reigned for many years but he was so determined to govern worthily and to do his duty that his ring which he took to wearing again never once pricked him severely1   1 cabinet des fees     blue beard   there was a man who had fine houses both in town and country a deal of silver and gold plate embroidered furniture and coaches gilded all over with gold but this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him  one of his neighbors a lady of quality had two daughters who were perfect beauties he desired of her one of them in marriage leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him they would neither of them have him and sent him backward and forward from one another not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives and nobody ever knew what became of them  blue beard to engage their affection took them with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance with other young people of the neighborhood to one of his country seats where they stayed a whole week  there was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure hunting fishing dancing mirth and feasting nobody went to bed but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other in short everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue and that he was a mighty civil gentleman  as soon as they returned home the marriage was concluded about a month afterward blue beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least about affairs of very great consequence desiring her to divert herself in his absence to send for her friends and acquaintances to carry them into the country if she pleased and to make good cheer wherever she was  here said he are the keys of the two great wardrobes wherein i have my best furniture these are of my silver and gold plate which is not every day in use these open my strong boxes which hold my money both gold and silver these my caskets of jewels and this is the masterkey to all my apartments but for this little one here it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor open them all go into all and every one of them except that little closet which i forbid you and forbid it in such a manner that if you happen to open it theres nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment  she promised to observe very exactly whatever he had ordered when he after having embraced her got into his coach and proceeded on his journey  her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house not daring to come while her husband was there because of his blue beard which frightened them they ran through all the rooms closets and wardrobes which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another  after that they went up into the two great rooms where was the best and richest furniture they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry beds couches cabinets stands tables and lookingglasses in which you might see yourself from head to foot some of them were framed with glass others with silver plain and gilded the finest and most magnificent ever were seen  they ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor she was so much pressed by her curiosity that without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company she went down a little back staircase and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck  coming to the closetdoor she made a stop for some time thinking upon her husbands orders and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it she then took the little key and opened it trembling but could not at first see anything plainly because the windows were shut after some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood on which lay the bodies of several dead women ranged against the walls these were all the wives whom blue beard had married and murdered one after another she thought she should have died for fear and the key which she pulled out of the lock fell out of her hand  after having somewhat recovered her surprise she took up the key locked the door and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself but she could not she was so much frightened having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood she tried two or three times to wipe it off but the blood would not come out in vain did she wash it and even rub it with soap and sand the blood still remained for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean when the blood was gone off from one side it came again on the other  blue beard returned from his journey the same evening and said he had received letters upon the road informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage his wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return  next morning he asked her for the keys which she gave him but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened  what said he is not the key of my closet among the rest  i must certainly have left it above upon the table said she  fail not to bring it to me presently said blue beard  after several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key blue beard having very attentively considered it said to his wife  how comes this blood upon the key  i do not know cried the poor woman paler than death  you do not know replied blue beard i very well know you were resolved to go into the closet were you not mighty well madam you shall go in and take your place among the ladies you saw there  upon this she threw herself at her husbands feet and begged his pardon with all the signs of true repentance vowing that she would never more be disobedient she would have melted a rock so beautiful and sorrowful was she but blue beard had a heart harder than any rock  you must die madam said he and that presently  since i must die answered she looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears give me some little time to say my prayers  i give you replied blue beard half a quarter of an hour but not one moment more  when she was alone she called out to her sister and said to her  sister anne for that was her name go up i beg you upon the top of the tower and look if my brothers are not coming over they promised me that they would come today and if you see them give them a sign to make haste  her sister anne went up upon the top of the tower and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time  anne sister anne do you see anyone coming  and sister anne said  i see nothing but the sun which makes a dust and the grass which looks green  in the meanwhile blue beard holding a great sabre in his hand cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife  come down instantly or i shall come up to you  one moment longer if you please said his wife and then she cried out very softly anne sister anne dost thou see anybody coming  and sister anne answered  i see nothing but the sun which makes a dust and the grass which is green  come down quickly cried blue beard or i will come up to you  i am coming answered his wife and then she cried anne sister anne dost thou not see anyone coming  i see replied sister anne a great dust which comes on this side here  are they my brothers  alas no my dear sister i see a flock of sheep  will you not come down cried blue beard  one moment longer said his wife and then she cried out anne sister anne dost thou see nobody coming  i see said she two horsemen but they are yet a great way off  god be praised replied the poor wife joyfully they are my brothers i will make them a sign as well as i can for them to make haste  then blue beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble the distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet all in tears with her hair about her shoulders  this signifies nothing says blue beard you must die then taking hold of her hair with one hand and lifting up the sword with the other he was going to take off her head the poor lady turning about to him and looking at him with dying eyes desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself  no no said he recommend thyself to god and was just ready to strike  at this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that blue beard made a sudden stop the gate was opened and presently entered two horsemen who drawing their swords ran directly to blue beard he knew them to be his wifes brothers one a dragoon the other a musketeer so that he ran away immediately to save himself but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead the poor wife was almost as dead as her husband and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers  blue beard had no heirs and so his wife became mistress of all his estate she made use of one part of it to marry her sister anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while another part to buy captains commissions for her brothers and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman who made her forget the ill time she had passed with blue beard1   1 charles perrault     trusty john   once upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to himself i am most likely on my deathbed then he said send trusty john to me now trusty john was his favorite servant and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully when he approached the bed the king spake to him most trusty john i feel my end is drawing near and i could face it without a care were it not for my son he is still too young to decide everything for himself and unless you promise me to instruct him in all he should know and to be to him as a father i shall not close my eyes in peace then trusty john answered i will never desert him and will serve him faithfully even though it should cost me my life then the old king said now i die comforted and in peace and then he went on after my death you must show him the whole castle all the rooms and apartments and vaults and all the treasures that lie in them but you must not show him the last room in the long passage where the picture of the princess of the golden roof is hidden when he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love with it and go off into a dead faint and for her sake he will encounter many dangers you must guard him from this and when trusty john had again given the king his hand upon it the old man became silent laid his head on the pillow and died  when the old king had been carried to his grave trusty john told the young king what he had promised his father on his deathbed and added and i shall assuredly keep my word and shall be faithful to you as i have been to him even though it should cost me my life  now when the time of mourning was over trusty john said to him it is time you should see your inheritance i will show you your ancestral castle so he took him over everything and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments only the one room where the picture was he did not open but the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world but the young king noticed that trusty john always missed one door and said why do you never open this one for me there is something inside that would appall you he answered but the king replied i have seen the whole castle and shall find out what is in there and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open but trusty john held him back and said i promised your father before his death that you shouldnt see what that room contains it might bring both you and me to great grief ah no answered the young king if i dont get in it will be my certain destruction i should have no peace night or day till i had seen what was in the room with my own eyes now i dont budge from the spot till you have opened the door  then trusty john saw there was no way out of it so with a heavy heart and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch when he had opened the door he stepped in first and thought to cover the likeness so that the king might not perceive it but it was hopeless the king stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder and when he saw the picture of the maid so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones he fell swooning to the ground trusty john lifted him up carried him to bed and thought sorrowfully the curse has come upon us gracious heaven what will be the end of it all then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again the first words he spoke were oh who is the original of the beautiful picture she is the princess of the golden roof answered trusty john then the king continued my love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it my very life depends on my winning her you are my most trusty john you must stand by me  the faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the princess at length he hit upon a plan and spoke to the king all the things she has about hertables chairs dishes goblets bowls and all her household furnitureare made of gold you have in your treasure five tons of gold let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts that will please her we shall go to her with them and try our luck the king summoned all his goldsmiths and they had to work hard day and night till at length the most magnificent things were completed when a ship had been laden with them the faithful john disguised himself as a merchant and the king had to do the same so that they should be quite unrecognizable and so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the princess of the golden roof dwelt  trusty john made the king remain behind on the ship and await his return perhaps he said i may bring the princess back with me so see that everything is in order let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated then he took a few of the gold things in his apron went ashore and proceeded straight to the palace when he came to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well drawing water with two golden pails and as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger and asked him who he was then he replied i am a merchant and opening his apron he let her peep in oh my she cried what beautiful gold wares she set down her pails and examined one thing after the other then she said the princess must see this she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have she took him by the hand and let him into the palace for she was the ladys maid  when the princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted and said they are all so beautifully made that i shall buy everything you have but trusty john said i am only the servant of a rich merchant what i have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before she desired to have everything brought up to her but he said there is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house thus her desire and curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said take me to your ship i shall go there myself and view your masters treasures  then trusty john was quite delighted and brought her to the ship and the king when he beheld her saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture and thought every moment that his heart would burst she stepped on to the ship and the king led her inside but trusty john remained behind with the steersman and ordered the ship to push off spread all sail that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air meanwhile the king showed the princess inside all his gold wares every single bit of itdishes goblets bowls the birds and game and all the wonderful beasts many hours passed thus and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away after she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home but when she came to the ships side she saw that they were on the high seas far from land and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas oh she cried in terror i am deceived carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant i would rather have died but the king seized her hand and spake i am no merchant but a king of as high birth as yourself and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem the first time i saw your likeness i fell to the ground in a swoon when the princess of the golden roof heard this she was comforted and her heart went out to him so that she willingly consented to become his wife  now it happened one day while they were sailing on the high seas that trusty john sitting on the forepart of the ship fiddling away to himself observed three ravens in the air flying toward him he ceased playing and listened to what they were saying for he understood their language the one croaked ah ha so hes bringing the princess of the golden roof home yes answered the second but hes not got her yet yes he has spake the third for shes sitting beside him on the ship then number one began again and cried thatll not help him when they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them the king will wish to mount it and if he does it will gallop away with him and disappear into the air and he will never see his bride again is there no escape for him asked number two oh yes if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster then the young king is saved but whos to do that and anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees then spake number two i know more than that even if the horse is slain the young king will still not keep his bride when they enter the palace together they will find a readymade wedding shirt in a cupboard which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar when the king puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones number three asked is there no way of escape then oh yes answered number two if someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire and lets it burn then the young king is saved but whats the good anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone from his knees to his heart then number three spake i know yet more though the bridal shirt too be burnt the king hasnt even then secured his bride when the dance is held after the wedding and the young queen is dancing she will suddenly grow deadly white and drop down like one dead and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side and spits them out again she will die but if anyone who knows this betrays it he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet when the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward but trusty john had taken it all in and was sad and depressed from that time forward for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard he would involve him in misfortune but if he took him into his confidence then he himself would forfeit his life at last he said i will stand by my master though it should be my ruin  now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward capital said the king this animal shall carry me to my palace and was about to mount but trusty john was too sharp for him and springing up quickly seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead then the other servants of the king who at no time looked favorably on trusty john cried out what a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the king to his palace but the king spake silence let him alone he is ever my most trusty john who knows for what good end he may have done this thing so they went on their way and entered the palace and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the readymade bridal shirt looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver the young king went toward it and was about to take hold of it but trusty john pushing him aside seized it with his gloved hands threw it hastily into the fire and let it burn the other servants commenced grumbling again and said see hes actually burning the kings bridal shirt but the young king spoke who knows for what good purpose he does it let him alone he is my most trusty john then the wedding was celebrated the dance began and the bride joined in but trusty john watched her countenance carefully of a sudden she grew deadly white and fell to the ground as if she were dead he at once sprang hastily toward her lifted her up and bore her to a room where he laid her down and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side and spat them out she soon breathed again and came to herself but the young king had watched the proceeding and not knowing why trusty john had acted as he did he flew into a passion and cried throw him into prison on the following morning sentence was passed on trusty john and he was condemned to be hanged as he stood on the gallows he said every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies and i too have that privilege yes said the king it shall be granted to you so trusty john spoke i am unjustly condemned for i have always been faithful to you and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens conversation on the sea and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master then the king cried oh my most trusty john pardon pardon take him down but as he uttered the last word trusty john had fallen lifeless to the ground and was a stone  the king and queen were in despair and the king spake ah how ill have i rewarded such great fidelity and made them lift up the stone image and place it in his bedroom near his bed as often as he looked at it he wept and said oh if i could only restore you to life my most trusty john after a time the queen gave birth to twins two small sons who throve and grew and were a constant joy to her one day when the queen was at church and the two children sat and played with their father he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue and sighing wailed oh if i could only restore you to life my most trusty john suddenly the stone began to speak and said yes you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear and the king cried out all i have in the world will i give up for your sake the stone continued if you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children and smear me with their blood i shall come back to life the king was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put his children to death but when he thought of trusty johns fidelity and how he had even died for him he drew his sword and with his own hand cut the heads off his children and when he had smeared the stone with their blood life came back and trusty john stood once more safe and sound before him he spake to the king your loyalty shall be rewarded and taking up the heads of the children he placed them on their bodies smeared the wounds with their blood and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened then the king was full of joy and when he saw the queen coming he hid trusty john and the two children in a big cupboard as she entered he said to her did you pray in church yes she answered but my thoughts dwelt constantly on trusty john and of what he has suffered for us then he spake dear wife we can restore him to life but the price asked is our two little sons we must sacrifice them the queen grew white and her heart sank but she replied we owe it to him on account of his great fidelity then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been and going forward he opened the cupboard and fetched the two children and trusty john out saying god be praised trusty john is free once more and we have our two small sons again then he related to her all that had passed and they lived together happily ever afterward1   1 grimm     the brave little tailor   one summers day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits and sewed for dear life as he was sitting thus a peasant woman came down the street calling out good jam to sell good jam to sell this sounded sweetly in the tailors ears he put his frail little head out of the window and shouted up here my good woman and youll find a willing customer the woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailors room and he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him he examined them all lifted them up and smelled them and said at last this jam seems good weigh me four ounces of it my good woman and even if its a quarter of a pound i wont stick at it the woman who had hoped to find a good market gave him what he wanted but went away grumbling wrathfully now heaven shall bless this jam for my use cried the little tailor and it shall sustain and strengthen me he fetched some bread out of a cupboard cut a round off the loaf and spread the jam on it that wont taste amiss he said but ill finish that waistcoat first before i take a bite he placed the bread beside him went on sewing and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger in the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to the ceiling where heaps of flies were sitting and attracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses ha who invited you said the tailor and chased the unwelcome guests away but the flies who didnt understand english refused to let themselves be warned off and returned again in even greater numbers at last the little tailor losing all patience reached out of his chimney corner for a duster and exclaiming wait and ill give it to you he beat them mercilessly with it when he left off he counted the slain and no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs what a desperate fellow i am said he and was filled with admiration at his own courage the whole town must know about this and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle hemmed it and embroidered on it in big letters seven at a blow what did i say the town no the whole world shall hear of it he said and his heart beat for joy as a lamb wags his tail  the tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide world for he considered his workroom too small a field for his prowess before he set forth he looked round about him to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey but he found nothing except an old cheese which he took possession of in front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in some bushes and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese then he went on his way merrily and being light and agile he never felt tired his way led up a hill on the top of which sat a powerful giant who was calmly surveying the landscape the little tailor went up to him and greeting him cheerfully said goodday friend there you sit at your ease viewing the whole wide world im just on my way there what do you say to accompanying me the giant looked contemptuously at the tailor and said what a poor wretched little creature you are thats a good joke answered the little tailor and unbuttoning his coat he showed the giant the girdle there now you can read what sort of a fellow i am the giant read seven at a blow and thinking they were human beings the tailor had slain he conceived a certain respect for the little man but first he thought hed test him so taking up a stone in his hand he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out now you do the same said the giant if you really wish to be thought strong is that all said the little tailor thats childs play to me so he dived into his wallet brought out the cheese and pressed it till the whey ran out my squeeze was in sooth better than yours said he the giant didnt know what to say for he couldnt have believed it of the little fellow to prove him again the giant lifted a stone and threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it now my little pigmy let me see you do that well thrown said the tailor but after all your stone fell to the ground ill throw one that wont come down at all he dived into his wallet again and grasping the bird in his hand he threw it up into the air the bird enchanted to be free soared up into the sky and flew away never to return well what do you think of that little piece of business friend asked the tailor you can certainly throw said the giant but now lets see if you can carry a proper weight with these words he led the tailor to a huge oak tree which had been felled to the ground and said if you are strong enough help me to carry the tree out of the wood most certainly said the little tailor just you take the trunk on your shoulder ill bear the top and branches which is certainly the heaviest part the giant laid the trunk on his shoulder but the tailor sat at his ease among the branches and the giant who couldnt see what was going on behind him had to carry the whole tree and the little tailor into the bargain there he sat behind in the best of spirits lustily whistling a tune as if carrying the tree were mere sport the giant after dragging the heavy weight for some time could get on no further and shouted out hi i must let the tree fall the tailor sprang nimbly down seized the tree with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way and said to the giant fancy a big lout like you not being able to carry a tree  they continued to go on their way together and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it where the ripest fruit hung gave the branches into the tailors hand and bade him eat but the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air bearing the little tailor with it when he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself the giant said what do you mean to tell me you havent the strength to hold down a feeble twig it wasnt strength that was wanting replied the tailor do you think that would have been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow i jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us do you do the like if you dare the giant made an attempt but couldnt get over the tree and stuck fast in the branches so that here too the little tailor had the better of him  well youre a fine fellow after all said the giant come and spend the night with us in our cave the little tailor willingly consented to do this and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave where several other giants were sitting round a fire each holding a roast sheep in his hand of which he was eating the little tailor looked about him and thought yes theres certainly more room to turn round in here than in my workshop the giant showed him a bed and bade him lie down and have a good sleep but the bed was too big for the little tailor so he didnt get into it but crept away into the corner at midnight when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep he rose up and taking his big iron walkingstick he broke the bed in two with a blow and thought he had made an end of the little grasshopper at early dawn the giants went off to the wood and quite forgot about the little tailor till all of a sudden they met him trudging along in the most cheerful manner the giants were terrified at the apparition and fearful lest he should slay them they all took to their heels as fast as they could  the little tailor continued to follow his nose and after he had wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal palace and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep while he lay there the people came and looking him all over read on his girdle seven at a blow oh they said what can this great hero of a hundred fights want in our peaceful land he must indeed be a mighty man of valor they went and told the king about him and said what a weighty and useful man hed be in time of war and that it would be well to secure him at any price this counsel pleased the king and he sent one of his courtiers down to the little tailor to offer him when he awoke a commission in their army the messenger remained standing by the sleeper and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes when he tendered his proposal thats the very thing i came here for he answered i am quite ready to enter the kings service so he was received with all honor and given a special house of his own to live in  but the other officers resented the success of the little tailor and wished him a thousand miles away whats to come of it all they asked each other if we quarrel with him hell let out at us and at every blow seven will fall therell soon be an end of us so they resolved to go in a body to the king and all to send in their papers we are not made they said to hold out against a man who kills seven at a blow the king was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful servants for the sake of one man and he wished heartily that he had never set eyes on him or that he could get rid of him but he didnt dare to send him away for he feared he might kill him along with his people and place himself on the throne he pondered long and deeply over the matter and finally came to a conclusion he sent to the tailor and told him that seeing what a great and warlike hero he was he was about to make him an offer in a certain wood of his kingdom there dwelled two giants who did much harm by the way they robbed murdered burned and plundered everything about them no one could approach them without endangering his life but if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife and half his kingdom into the bargain he might have a hundred horsemen too to back him up thats the very thing for a man like me thought the little tailor one doesnt get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day done with you he answered ill soon put an end to the giants but i havent the smallest need of your hundred horsemen a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two  the little tailor set out and the hundred horsemen followed him when he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers you wait here ill manage the giants by myself and he went on into the wood casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him after a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree and snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze the little tailor lost no time in filling his wallet with stones and then climbed up the tree under which they lay when he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant the giant felt nothing for a long time but at last he woke up and pinching his companion said what did you strike me for i didnt strike you said the other you must be dreaming they both lay down to sleep again and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant who sprang up and cried whats that for why did you throw something at me i didnt throw anything growled the first one they wrangled on for a time till as both were tired they made up the matter and fell asleep again the little tailor began his game once more and flung the largest stone he could find in his wallet with all his force and hit the first giant on the chest this is too much of a good thing he yelled and springing up like a madman he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled he gave however as good as he got and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them till they both fell dead at once on the ground then the little tailor jumped down its a mercy he said that they didnt root up the tree on which i was perched or i should have had to jump like a squirrel on to another which nimble though i am would have been no easy job he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast and then went to the horsemen and said the deed is done ive put an end to the two of them but i assure you it has been no easy matter for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves but all thats of no use against one who slays seven men at a blow werent you wounded asked the horsemen  no fear answered the tailor they havent touched a hair of my head but the horsemen wouldnt believe him till they rode into the wood and found the giants weltering in their blood and the trees lying around torn up by the roots  the little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the king but he repented his promise and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom he said to him you must do another deed of valor a unicorn is running about loose in the wood and doing much mischief you must first catch it im even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants seven at a blow thats my motto he took a piece of cord and an axe with him went out to the wood and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside he hadnt to search long for the unicorn soon passed by and on perceiving the tailor dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot gently gently said he not so fast my friend and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near when he sprang lightly behind a tree the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again and was thus successfully captured now ive caught my bird said the tailor and he came out from behind the tree placed the cord round its neck first then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe and when everything was in order led the beast before the king  still the king didnt want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand the tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood and he might have the huntsmen to help him willingly said the tailor thats mere childs play but he didnt take the huntsmen into the wood with him and they were well enough pleased to remain behind for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance as soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth and tried to knock him down but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near and got out of the window again with a jump the boar pursued him into the church but the tailor skipped round to the door and closed it securely so the raging beast was caught for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window the little tailor summoned the huntsmen together that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes then the hero betook himself to the king who was obliged now whether he liked it or not to keep his promise and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom had he known that no herowarrior but only a little tailor stood before him it would have gone even more to his heart so the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy and the tailor became a king  after a time the queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep my lad make that waistcoat and patch these trousers or ill box your ears thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born and next day she poured forth her woes to her father and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor the king comforted her and said leave your bedroom door open tonight my servants shall stand outside and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter bind him fast and carry him on to a ship which shall sail away out into the wide ocean the queen was well satisfied with the idea but the armorbearer who had overheard everything being much attached to his young master went straight to him and revealed the whole plot ill soon put a stop to the business said the tailor that night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up opened the door and then lay down again the little tailor who had only pretended to be asleep began to call out in a clear voice my lad make that waistcoat and patch those trousers or ill box your ears i have killed seven at a blow slain two giants led a unicorn captive and caught a wild boar then why should i be afraid of those men standing outside my door the men when they heard the tailor saying these words were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army and didnt dare go near him again so the little tailor was and remained a king all the days of his life     a voyage to lilliput   chapter i   my father had a small estate in nottinghamshire and i was the third of four sons he sent me to cambridge at fourteen years old and after studying there three years i was bound apprentice to mr bates a famous surgeon in london there as my father now and then sent me small sums of money i spent them in learning navigation and other arts useful to those who travel as i always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do  three years after my leaving him my good master mr bates recommended me as ships surgeon to the swallow on which i voyaged three years when i came back i settled in london and having taken part of a small house i married miss mary burton daughter of mr edmund burton hosier  but my good master bates died two years after and as i had few friends my business began to fail and i determined to go again to sea after several voyages i accepted an offer from captain w pritchard master of the antelope who was making a voyage to the south sea we set sail from bristol may 4 1699 and our voyage at first was very prosperous  but in our passage to the east indies we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of van diemens land twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food and the rest were in a very weak condition on the 5th of november the weather being very hazy the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it and immediately split six of the crew of whom i was one letting down the boat got clear of the ship and we rowed about three leagues till we could work no longer we therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall what became of my companions in the boat or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel i cannot tell but i conclude they were all lost for my part i swam as fortune directed me and was pushed forward by wind and tide but when i was able to struggle no longer i found myself within my depth by this time the storm was much abated i reached the shore at last about eight oclock in the evening and advanced nearly half a mile inland but could not discover any sign of inhabitants i was extremely tired and with the heat of the weather i found myself much inclined to sleep i lay down on the grass which was very short and soft and slept sounder than ever i did in my life for about nine hours when i woke it was just daylight i attempted to rise but could not for as i happened to be lying on my back i found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground and my hair which was long and thick tied down in the same manner i could only look upward the sun began to grow hot and the light hurt my eyes i heard a confused noise about me but could see nothing except the sky in a little time i felt something alive and moving on my left leg which advancing gently over my breast came almost up to my chin when bending my eyes downward i perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands and a quiver at his back in the meantime i felt at least forty more following the first i was in the utmost astonishment and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground however they soon returned and one of them who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face lifted up his hands in admiration i lay all this while in great uneasiness but at length struggling to get loose i succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground and at the same time with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain i a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair so that i was just able to turn my head about two inches but the creatures ran off a second time before i could seize them whereupon there was a great shout and in an instant i felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand which pricked me like so many needles moreover they shot another flight into the air of which some fell on my face which i immediately covered with my left hand when this shower of arrows was over i groaned with grief and pain and then striving again to get loose they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first and some of them tried to stab me with their spears but by good luck i had on a leather jacket which they could not pierce by this time i thought it most prudent to lie still till night when my left hand being already loose i could easily free myself and as for the inhabitants i thought i might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him i saw when the people observed that i was quiet they discharged no more arrows but by the noise i heard i knew that their number was increased and about four yards from me for more than an hour there was a knocking like people at work then turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me i saw a stage set up about a foot and a half from the ground with two or three ladders to mount it from this one of them who seemed to be a person of quality made me a long speech of which i could not understand a word though i could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness i answered in few words but in the most submissive manner and being almost famished with hunger i could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth to signify that i wanted food he understood me very well and descending from the stage commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food which had been sent by the kings orders when he first received tidings of me there were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark i ate them two or three at a mouthful and took three loaves at a time they supplied me as fast as they could with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite i then made a sign that i wanted something to drink they guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me and being a most ingenious people they slung up one of their largest hogsheads then rolled it toward my hand and beat out the top i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold half a pint they brought me a second hogshead which i drank and made signs for more but they had none to give me however i could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals who ventured to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands was free without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as i must have seemed to them after some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty his excellency having mounted my right leg advanced to my face with about a dozen of his retinue and spoke about ten minutes often pointing forward which as i afterward found was toward the capital city about half a mile distant whither it was commanded by his majesty that i should be conveyed i made a sign with my hand that was loose putting it to the other but over his excellencys head for fear of hurting him or his train to show that i desired my liberty he seemed to understand me well enough for he shook his head though he made other signs to let me know that i should have meat and drink enough and very good treatment then i once more thought of attempting to escape but when i felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased i gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased then they daubed my face and hands with a sweetsmelling ointment which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows the relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy and presently i fell asleep i slept about eight hours as i was told afterward and it was no wonder for the physicians by the emperors orders had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine  it seems that when i was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing the emperor had early notice of it and determined that i should be tied in the manner i have related which was done in the night while i slept that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine it was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground about seven feet long and four wide moving upon twentytwo wheels but the difficulty was to place me on it eighty poles were erected for this purpose and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen had tied round my neck hands body and legs nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles and in less than three hours i was raised and slung into the engine and there tied fast fifteen hundred of the emperors largest horses each about four inches and a half high were then employed to draw me toward the capital but while all this was done i still lay in a deep sleep and i did not wake till four hours after we began our journey  the emperor and all his court came out to meet us when we reached the capital but his great officials would not suffer his majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom and here it was determined that i should lodge near the great gate through which i could easily creep they fixed ninetyone chains like those which hang to a ladys watch which were locked to my left leg with thirtysix padlocks and when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut all the strings that bound me then i rose up feeling as melancholy as ever i did in my life but the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible the chains that held my left leg were about two yards long and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple the emperor advancing toward me from among his courtiers all most magnificently clad surveyed me with great admiration but kept beyond the length of my chain he was taller by about the breadth of my nail than any of his court which alone was enough to strike awe into the beholders and graceful and majestic the better to behold him i lay down on my side so that my face was level with his and he stood three yards off however i have had him since many times in my hand and therefore cannot be deceived his dress was very simple but he wore a light helmet of gold adorned with jewels and a plume he held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself if i should break loose it was almost three inches long and the hilt was of gold enriched with diamonds his voice was shrill but very clear his imperial majesty spoke often to me and i answered but neither of us could understand a word   chapter ii   after about two hours the court retired and i was left with a strong guard to keep away the crowd some of whom had had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as i sat by the door of my house but the colonel ordered six of them to be seized and delivered bound into my hands i put five of them into my coat pocket and as to the sixth i made a face as if i would eat him alive the poor man screamed terribly and the colonel and his officers were much distressed especially when they saw me take out my penknife but i soon set them at ease for cutting the strings he was bound with i put him gently on the ground and away he ran i treated the rest in the same manner taking them one by one out of my pocket and i saw that both the soldiers and people were delighted at this mark of my kindness  toward night i got with some difficulty into my house where i lay on the ground as i had to do for a fortnight till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure  six hundred servants were appointed me and three hundred tailors made me a suit of clothes moreover six of his majestys greatest scholars were employed to teach me their language so that soon i was able to converse after a fashion with the emperor who often honored me with his visits the first words i learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty which i every day repeated on my knees but he answered that this must be a work of time and that first i must swear a peace with him and his kingdom he told me also that by the laws of the nation i must be searched by two of his officers and that as this could not be done without my help he trusted them in my hands and whatever they took from me should be returned when i left the country i took up the two officers and put them into my coat pockets these gentlemen having pen ink and paper about them made an exact list of everything they saw which i afterward translated into english and which ran as follows  in the right coat pocket of the great manmountain we found only one great piece of coarse cloth large enough to cover the carpet of your majestys chief room of state in the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a silver cover which we could not lift we desired that it should be opened and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the midleg in a sort of dust some of which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing in his right waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances folded one over another about the size of three men tied with a strong cable and marked with black figures which we humbly conceive to be writings in the left there was a sort of engine from the back of which extended twenty long poles with which we conjecture the manmountain combs his head in the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal of different sizes some of the white which appeared to be silver were so large and heavy that my comrade and i could hardly lift them from another pocket hung a huge silver chain with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shining substance this engine made an incessant noise like a watermill and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal or the god he worships but probably the latter for he told us that he seldom did anything without consulting it  this is a list of what we found about the body of the manmountain who treated us with great civility  i had one private pocket which escaped their search containing a pair of spectacles and a small spyglass which being of no consequence to the emperor i did not think myself bound in honor to discover   chapter iii   my gentleness and good behavior gained so far on the emperor and his court and indeed on the people in general that i began to have hopes of getting my liberty in a short time the natives came by degrees to be less fearful of danger from me i would sometimes lie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand and at last the boys and girls ventured to come and play at hideandseek in my hair  the horses of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy having been daily led before me and one of the emperors huntsmen on a large courser took my foot shoe and all which was indeed a prodigious leap i amused the emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner i took nine sticks and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square then i took four other sticks and tied them parallel at each corner about two feet from the ground i fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum and i desired the emperor to let a troop of his best horse twentyfour in number come and exercise upon this plain his majesty approved of the proposal and i took them up one by one with the proper officers to exercise them as soon as they got into order they divided into two parties discharged blunt arrows drew their swords fled and pursued and in short showed the best military discipline i ever beheld the parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling off the stage and the emperor was so much delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days and persuaded the empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within two yards of the stage whence she could view the whole performance fortunately no accident happened only once a fiery horse pawing with his hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief and overthrew his rider and himself but i immediately relieved them both and covering the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the other as i had taken them up the horse that fell was strained in the shoulder but the rider was not hurt and i repaired my handkerchief as well as i could however i would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises  i had sent so many petitions for my liberty that his majesty at length mentioned the matter in a full council where it was opposed by none except skyresh bolgolam admiral of the realm who was pleased without any provocation to be my mortal enemy however he agreed at length though he succeeded in himself drawing up the conditions on which i should be set free after they were read i was requested to swear to perform them in the method prescribed by their laws which was to hold my right foot in my left hand and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head and my thumb on the top of my right ear but i have made a translation of the conditions which i here offer to the public  golbaste mamarem evlame gurdile shefin mully ully gue most mighty emperor of lilliput delight and terror of the universe whose dominions extend to the ends of the globe monarch of all monarchs taller than the sons of men whose feet press down to the center and whose head strikes against the sun at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees pleasant as the spring comfortable as the summer fruitful as autumn dreadful as winter his most sublime majesty proposeth to the manmountain lately arrived at our celestial dominions the following articles which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform  first the manmountain shall not depart from our dominions without our license under the great seal  second he shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our express order at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours warning to keep within doors  third the said manmountain shall confine his walks to our principal high roads and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn  fourth as he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects their horses or carriages nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own consent  fifth if an express requires extraordinary speed the manmountain shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six days journey and return the said messenger if so required safe to our imperial presence  sixth he shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of blefuscu and do his utmost to destroy their fleet which is now preparing to invade us  lastly upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles the said manmountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects with free access to our royal person and other marks of our favor given at our palace at belfaburac the twelfth day of the ninetyfirst moon of our reign  i swore to these articles with great cheerfulness whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked and i was at full liberty  one morning about a fortnight after i had obtained my freedom reldresal the emperors secretary for private affairs came to my house attended only by one servant he ordered his coach to wait at a distance and desired that i would give him an hours audience i offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation he began with compliments on my liberty but he added that save for the present state of things at court perhaps i might not have obtained it so soon for he said however flourishing we may seem to foreigners we are in danger of an invasion from the island of blefuscu which is the other great empire of the universe almost as large and as powerful as this of his majesty for as to what we have heard you say that there are other kingdoms in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself our philosophers are very doubtful and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon or one of the stars because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his majestys dominions besides our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two mighty empires of lilliput and blefuscu which as i was going to tell you are engaged in a most obstinate war which began in the following manner it is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs was upon the larger end but his present majestys grandfather while he was a boy going to eat an egg and breaking it according to the ancient practice happened to cut one of his fingers whereupon the emperor his father made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs the people so highly resented this law that there have been six rebellions raised on that account wherein one emperor lost his life and another his crown it is calculated that eleven hundred persons have at different times suffered rather than break their eggs at the smaller end but these rebels the bigendians have found so much encouragement at the emperor of blefuscus court to which they always fled for refuge that a bloody war as i said has been carried on between the two empires for sixandthirty moons and now the blefuscudians have equipped a large fleet and are preparing to descend upon us therefore his imperial majesty placing great confidence in your valor and strength has commanded me to set the case before you  i desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor and to let him know that i was ready at the risk of my life to defend him against all invaders   chapter iv   it was not long before i communicated to his majesty the plan i formed for seizing the enemys whole fleet the empire of blefuscu is an island parted from lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide i consulted the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel and they told me that in the middle at high water it was seventy glumguffs about six feet of european measure i walked toward the coast where lying down behind a hillock i took out my spyglass and viewed the enemys fleet at anchorabout fifty menofwar and other vessels i then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron the cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knittingneedle i trebled the cable to make it stronger and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together bending the ends into a hook having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables i went back to the coast and taking off my coat shoes and stockings walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water i waded with what haste i could swimming in the middle about thirty yards till i felt ground and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour the enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand then fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship i tied all the cords together at the end meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows many of which stuck in my hands and face my greatest fear was for my eyes which i should have lost if i had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the emperors searchers these i took out and fastened upon my nose and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them then taking the knot in my hand i began to pull but not a ship would stir for they were too fast held by their anchors thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained letting go the cord i resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands then i took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied and with great ease drew fifty of the enemys largest menofwar after me  when the blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order and me pulling at the end they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe when i had got out of danger i stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival i then took off my spectacles and after waiting about an hour till the tide was a little fallen i waded on to the royal port of lilliput  the emperor and his whole court stood on the shore awaiting me they saw the ships move forward in a large halfmoon but could not discern me who in the middle of the channel was under water up to my neck the emperor concluded that i was drowned and that the enemys fleet was approaching in a hostile manner but he was soon set at ease for the channel growing shallower every step i made i came in a short time within hearing and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened i cried in a loud voice long live the most puissant emperor of lilliput the prince received me at my landing with all possible joy and made me a nardal on the spot which is the highest title of honor among them  his majesty desired that i would take some opportunity to bring all the rest of his enemys ships into his ports and seemed to think of nothing less than conquering the whole empire of blefuscu and becoming the sole monarch of the world but i plainly protested that i would never be the means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery and though the wisest of the ministers were of my opinion my open refusal was so opposed to his majestys ambition that he could never forgive me and from this time a plot began between himself and those of his ministers who were my enemies that nearly ended in my utter destruction  about three weeks after this exploit there arrived an embassy from blefuscu with humble offers of peace which was soon concluded on terms very advantageous to our emperor there were six ambassadors with a train of about five hundred persons all very magnificent having been privately told that i had befriended them they made me a visit and paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity invited me to their kingdom in the emperor their masters name i asked them to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master whose royal person i resolved to attend before i returned to my own country accordingly the next time i had the honor to see our emperor i desired his general permission to visit the blefuscudian monarch this he granted me but in a very cold manner of which i afterward learned the reason  when i was just preparing to pay my respects to the emperor of blefuscu a distinguished person at court to whom i had once done a great service came to my house very privately at night and without sending his name desired admission i put his lordship into my coat pocket and giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one i fastened the door placed my visitor on the table and sat down by it his lordships face was full of trouble and he asked me to hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life  you are aware he said that skyresh bolgolam has been your mortal enemy ever since your arrival and his hatred is increased since your great success against blefuscu by which his glory as admiral is obscured this lord and others have accused you of treason and several councils have been called in the most private manner on your account out of gratitude for your favors i procured information of the whole proceedings venturing my head for your service and this was the charge against you  first that you having brought the imperial fleet of blefuscu into the royal port were commanded by his majesty to seize all the other ships and put to death all the bigendian exiles and also all the people of the empire who would not immediately consent to break their eggs at the smaller end and that like a false traitor to his most serene majesty you excused yourself from the service on pretence of unwillingness to force the consciences and destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people  again when ambassadors arrived from the court of blefuscu like a false traitor you aided and entertained them though you knew them to be servants of a prince lately in open war against his imperial majesty  moreover you are now preparing contrary to the duty of a faithful subject to voyage to the court of blefuscu  in the debate on this charge my friend continued his majesty often urged the services you had done him while the admiral and treasurer insisted that you should be put to a shameful death but reldresal secretary for private affairs who has always proved himself your friend suggested that if his majesty would please to spare your life and only give orders to put out both your eyes justice might in some measure be satisfied at this bolgolam rose up in fury wondering how the secretary dared desire to preserve the life of a traitor and the treasurer pointing out the expense of keeping you also urged your death but his majesty was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a punishment some other might afterward be inflicted and the secretary humbly desiring to be heard again said that as to expense your allowance might be gradually lessened so that for want of sufficient food you should grow weak and faint and die in a few months when his majestys subjects might cut your flesh from your bones and bury it leaving the skeleton for the admiration of posterity  thus through the great friendship of the secretary the affair was arranged it was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books in three days your friend the secretary will come to your house and read the accusation before you and point out the great mercy of his majesty that only condemns you to the loss of your eyeswhich he does not doubt you will submit to humbly and gratefully twenty of his majestys surgeons will attend to see the operation well performed by discharging very sharppointed arrows into the balls of your eyes as you lie on the ground  i leave you said my friend to consider what measures you will take and to escape suspicion i must immediately return as secretly as i came  his lordship did so and i remained alone in great perplexity at first i was bent on resistance for while i had liberty i could easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces but i soon rejected that idea with horror remembering the oath i had made to the emperor and the favors i had received from him at last having his majestys leave to pay my respects to the emperor of blefuscu i resolved to take this opportunity before the three days had passed i wrote a letter to my friend the secretary telling him of my resolution and without waiting for an answer went to the coast and entering the channel between wading and swimming reached the port of blefuscu where the people who had long expected me led me to the capital  his majesty with the royal family and great officers of the court came out to receive me and they entertained me in a manner suited to the generosity of so great a prince i did not however mention my disgrace with the emperor of lilliput since i did not suppose that prince would disclose the secret while i was out of his power but in this it soon appeared i was deceived   chapter v   three days after my arrival walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the island i observed at some distance in the sea something that looked like a boat overturned i pulled off my shoes and stockings and wading two or three hundred yards i plainly saw it to be a real boat which i supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship i returned immediately to the city for help and after a huge amount of labor i managed to get my boat to the royal port of blefuscu where a great crowd of people appeared full of wonder at sight of so prodigious a vessel i told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence i might return to my native country and begged his orders for materials to fit it up and leave to departwhich after many kindly speeches he was pleased to grant  meanwhile the emperor of lilliput uneasy at my long absence but never imagining that i had the least notice of his designs sent a person of rank to inform the emperor of blefuscu of my disgrace this messenger had orders to represent the great mercy of his master who was content to punish me with the loss of my eyes and who expected that his brother of blefuscu would have me sent back to lilliput bound hand and foot to be punished as a traitor the emperor of blefuscu answered with many civil excuses he said that as for sending me bound his brother knew it was impossible moreover though i had taken away his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices i had done him in making the peace but that both their majesties would soon be made easy for i had found a prodigious vessel on the shore able to carry me on the sea which he had given orders to fit up and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be free from me  with this answer the messenger returned to lilliput and i though the monarch of blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if i would continue in his service hastened my departure resolving never more to put confidence in princes  in about a month i was ready to take leave the emperor of blefuscu with the empress and the royal family came out of the palace and i lay down on my face to kiss their hands which they graciously gave me his majesty presented me with fifty purses of sprugs their greatest gold coin and his picture at full length which i put immediately into one of my gloves to keep it from being hurt many other ceremonies took place at my departure  i stored the boat with meat and drink and took six cows and two bulls alive with as many ewes and rams intending to carry them into my own country and to feed them on board i had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn i would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives but this was a thing the emperor would by no means permit and besides a diligent search into my pockets his majesty pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects though with their own consent and desire  having thus prepared all things as well as i was able i set sail when i had made twentyfour leagues by my reckoning from the island of blefuscu i saw a sail steering to the northeast i hailed her but could get no answer yet i found i gained upon her for the wind slackened and in half an hour she spied me and discharged a gun i came up with her between five and six in the evening sept 26 1701 but my heart leaped within me to see her english colors i put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets and got on board with all my little cargo the captain received me with kindness and asked me to tell him what place i came from last but at my answer he thought i was raving however i took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket which after great astonishment clearly convinced him  we arrived in england on the 13th of april 1702 i stayed two months with my wife and family but my eager desire to see foreign countries would suffer me to remain no longer however while in england i made great profit by showing my cattle to persons of quality and others and before i began my second voyage i sold them for 600l i left 1500l with my wife and fixed her in a good house then taking leave of her and my boy and girl with tears on both sides i sailed on board the adventure1   1 swift     the princess on the glass hill   once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side of a mountain and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay but there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years for every st johns eve when the grass was in the height of its vigor it was all eaten clean up just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night this happened once and it happened twice but then the man got tired of losing his crop and said to his sonshe had three of them and the third was called cinderladthat one of them must go and sleep in the barn on st johns night for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again blade and stalk as it had been the last two years and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp lookout the man said  the eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow he would watch the grass he said and he would do it so well that neither man nor beast nor even the devil himself should have any of it so when evening came he went to the barn and lay down to sleep but when night was drawing near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and roof shook again and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as he could and never even looked back and the barn remained empty that year just as it had been for the last two  next st johns eve the man again said that he could not go on in this way losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year and that one of his sons must just go there and watch it and watch well too so the next oldest son was willing to show what he could do he went to the barn and lay down to sleep as his brother had done but when night was drawing near there was a great rumbling and then an earthquake which was even worse than that on the former st johns night and when the youth heard it he was terrified and went off running as if for a wager  the year after it was cinderlads turn but when he made ready to go the others laughed at him and mocked him well you are just the right one to watch the hay you who have never learned anything but how to sit among the ashes and bake yourself said they cinderlad however did not trouble himself about what they said but when evening drew near rambled away to the outlying field when he got there he went into the barn and lay down but in about an hours time the rumbling and creaking began and it was frightful to hear it well if it gets no worse than that i can manage to stand it thought cinderlad in a little time the creaking began again and the earth quaked so that all the hay flew about the boy oh if it gets no worse than that i can manage to stand it thought cinderlad but then came a third rumbling and a third earthquake so violent that the boy thought the walls and roof had fallen down but when that was over everything suddenly grew as still as death around him i am pretty sure that it will come again thought cinderlad but no it did not everything was quiet and everything stayed quiet and when he had lain still a short time he heard something that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn door he stole away to the door which was ajar to see what was there and a horse was standing eating it was so big and fat and fine a horse that cinderlad had never seen one like it before and a saddle and bridle lay upon it and a complete suit of armor for a knight and everything was of copper and so bright that it shone again ha ha it is thou who eatest up our hay then thought the boy but i will stop that so he made haste and took out his steel for striking fire and threw it over the horse and then it had no power to stir from the spot and became so tame that the boy could do what he liked with it so he mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself and there he tied it up when he went home again his brothers laughed and asked how he had got on  you didnt lie long in the barn if even you have been so far as the field said they  i lay in the barn till the sun rose but i saw nothing and heard nothing not i said the boy god knows what there was to make you two so frightened  well we shall soon see whether you have watched the meadow or not answered the brothers but when they got there the grass was all standing just as long and as thick as it had been the night before  the next st johns eve it was the same thing once again neither of the two brothers dared to go to the outlying field to watch the crop but cinderlad went and everything happened exactly the same as on the previous st johns eve first there was a rumbling and an earthquake and then there was another and then a third but all three earthquakes were much very much more violent than they had been the year before then everything became still as death again and the boy heard something chewing outside the barn door so he stole as softly as he could to the door which was slightly ajar and again there was a horse standing close by the wall of the house eating and chewing and it was far larger and fatter than the first horse and it had a saddle on its back and a bridle was on it too and a full suit of armor for a knight all of bright silver and as beautiful as anyone could wish to see ho ho thought the boy is it thou who eatest up our hay in the night but i will put a stop to that so he took out his steel for striking fire and threw it over the horses mane and the beast stood there as quiet as a lamb then the boy rode this horse too away to the place where he kept the other and then went home again  i suppose you will tell us that you have watched well again this time said the brothers  well so i have said cinderlad so they went there again and there the grass was standing as high and as thick as it had been before but that did not make them any kinder to cinderlad  when the third st johns night came neither of the two elder brothers dared to lie in the outlying barn to watch the grass for they had been so heartily frightened the night that they had slept there that they could not get over it but cinderlad dared to go and everything happened just the same as on the two former nights there were three earthquakes each worse than the other and the last flung the boy from one wall of the barn to the other but then everything suddenly became still as death when he had lain quietly a short time he heard something chewing outside the barn door then he once more stole to the door which was slightly ajar and behold a horse was standing just outside it which was much larger and fatter than the two others he had caught ho ho it is thou then who art eating up our hay this time thought the boy but i will put a stop to that so he pulled out his steel for striking fire and threw it over the horse and it stood as still as if it had been nailed to the field and the boy could do just what he liked with it then he mounted it and rode away to the place where he had the two others and then he went home again then the two brothers mocked him just as they had done before and told him that they could see that he must have watched the grass very carefully that night for he looked just as if he were walking in his sleep but cinderlad did not trouble himself about that but just bade them go to the field and see they did go and this time too the grass was standing looking as fine and as thick as ever  the king of the country in which cinderlads father dwelt had a daughter whom he would give to no one who could not ride up to the top of the glass hill for there was a high high hill of glass slippery as ice and it was close to the kings palace upon the very top of this the kings daughter was to sit with three gold apples in her lap and the man who could ride up and take the three golden apples should marry her and have half the kingdom the king had this proclaimed in every church in the whole kingdom and in many other kingdoms too the princess was very beautiful and all who saw her fell violently in love with her even in spite of themselves so it is needless to say that all the princes and knights were eager to win her and half the kingdom besides and that for this cause they came riding thither from the very end of the world dressed so splendidly that their raiments gleamed in the sunshine and riding on horses which seemed to dance as they went and there was not one of these princes who did not think that he was sure to win the princess  when the day appointed by the king had come there was such a host of knights and princes under the glass hill that they seemed to swarm and everyone who could walk or even creep was there too to see who won the kings daughter cinderlads two brothers were there too but they would not hear of letting him go with them for he was so dirty and black with sleeping and grubbing among the ashes that they said everyone would laugh at them if they were seen in the company of such an oaf  well then i will go all alone by myself said cinderlad  when the two brothers got to the glass hill all the princes and knights were trying to ride up it and their horses were in a foam but it was all in vain for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than down they slipped and there was not one which could get even so much as a couple of yards up nor was that strange for the hill was as smooth as a glass windowpane and as steep as the side of a house but they were all eager to win the kings daughter and half the kingdom so they rode and they slipped and thus it went on at length all the horses were so tired that they could do no more and so hot that the foam dropped from them and the riders were forced to give up the attempt the king was just thinking that he would cause it to be proclaimed that the riding should begin afresh on the following day when perhaps it might go better when suddenly a knight came riding up on so fine a horse that no one had ever seen the like of it before and the knight had armor of copper and his bridle was of copper too and all his accoutrements were so bright that they shone again the other knights all called out to him that he might just as well spare himself the trouble of trying to ride up the glass hill for it was of no use to try but he did not heed them and rode straight off to it and went up as if it were nothing at all thus he rode for a long wayit may have been a third part of the way upbut when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode down again but the princess thought that she had never yet seen so handsome a knight and while he was riding up she was sitting thinking oh how i hope he may be able to come up to the top and when she saw that he was turning his horse back she threw one of the golden apples down after him and it rolled into his shoe but when he had come down from off the hill he rode away and that so fast that no one knew what had become of him  so all the princes and knights were bidden to present themselves before the king that night so that he who had ridden so far up the glass hill might show the golden apple which the kings daughter had thrown down but no one had anything to show one knight presented himself after the other and none could show the apple  at night too cinderlads brothers came home again and had a long story to tell about riding up the glass hill at first they said there was not one who was able to get even so much as one step up but then came a knight who had armor of copper and a bridle of copper and his armor and trappings were so bright that they shone to a great distance and it was something like a sight to see him riding he rode onethird of the way up the glass hill and he could easily have ridden the whole of it if he had liked but he had turned back for he had made up his mind that that was enough for once oh i should have liked to see him too that i should said cinderlad who was as usual sitting by the chimney among the cinders you indeed said the brothers you look as if you were fit to be among such great lords nasty beast that you are to sit there  next day the brothers were for setting out again and this time too cinderlad begged them to let him go with them and see who rode but no they said he was not fit to do that for he was much too ugly and dirty well well then i will go all alone by myself said cinderlad so the brothers went to the glass hill and all the princes and knights began to ride again and this time they had taken care to roughen the shoes of their horses but that did not help them they rode and they slipped as they had done the day before and not one of them could get even so far as a yard up the hill when they had tired out their horses so that they could do no more they again had to stop altogether but just as the king was thinking that it would be well to proclaim that the riding should take place next day for the last time so that they might have one more chance he suddenly bethought himself that it would be well to wait a little longer to see if the knight in copper armor would come on this day too but nothing was to be seen of him just as they were still looking for him however came a knight riding on a steed that was much much finer than that which the knight in copper armor had ridden and this knight had silver armor and a silver saddle and bridle and all were so bright that they shone and glistened when he was a long way off again the other knights called to him and said that he might just as well give up the attempt to ride up the glass hill for it was useless to try but the knight paid no heed to that but rode straight away to the glass hill and went still farther up than the knight in copper armor had gone but when he had ridden twothirds of the way up he turned his horse around and rode down again the princess liked this knight still better than she had liked the other and sat longing that he might be able to get up above and when she saw him turning back she threw the second apple after him and it rolled into his shoe and as soon as he had got down the glass hill he rode away so fast that no one could see what had become of him  in the evening when everyone was to appear before the king and princess in order that he who had the golden apple might show it one knight went in after the other but none of them had a golden apple to show  at night the two brothers went home as they had done the night before and told how things had gone and how everyone had ridden but no one had been able to get up the hill but last of all they said came one in silver armor and he had a silver bridle on his horse and a silver saddle and oh but he could ride he took his horse twothirds of the way up the hill but then he turned back he was a fine fellow said the brothers and the princess threw the second golden apple to him  oh how i should have liked to see him too said cinderlad  oh indeed he was a little brighter than the ashes that you sit grubbing among you dirty black creature said the brothers  on the third day everything went just as on the former days cinderlad wanted to go with them to look at the riding but the two brothers would not have him in their company and when they got to the glass hill there was no one who could ride even so far as a yard up it and everyone waited for the knight in silver armor but he was neither to be seen nor heard of at last after a long time came a knight riding upon a horse that was such a fine one its equal had never yet been seen the knight had golden armor and the horse a golden saddle and bridle and these were all so bright that they shone and dazzled everyone even while the knight was still at a great distance the other princes and knights were not able even to call to tell him how useless it was to try to ascend the hill so amazed were they at sight of his magnificence he rode straight away to the glass hill and galloped up it as if it were no hill at all so that the princess had not even time to wish that he might get up the whole way as soon as he had ridden to the top he took the third golden apple from the lap of the princess and then turned his horse about and rode down again and vanished from their sight before anyone was able to say a word to him  when the two brothers came home again at night they had much to tell of how the riding had gone off that day and at last they told about the knight in the golden armor too he was a fine fellow that was such another splendid knight is not to be found on earth said the brothers  oh how i should have liked to see him too said cinderlad  well he shone nearly as brightly as the coalheaps that thou art always lying raking among dirty black creature that thou art said the brothers  next day all the knights and princes were to appear before the king and princessit had been too late for them to do it the night beforein order that he who had the golden apple might produce it they all went in turn first princes and then knights but none of them had a golden apple  but somebody must have it said the king for with our own eyes we all saw a man ride up and take it so he commanded that everyone in the kingdom should come to the palace and see if he could show the apple and one after the other they all came but no one had the golden apple and after a long long time cinderlads two brothers came likewise they were the last of all so the king inquired of them if there was no one else in the kingdom left to come  oh yes we have a brother said the two but he never got the golden apple he never left the cinderheap on any of the three days  never mind that said the king as everyone else has come to the palace let him come too  so cinderlad was forced to go to the kings palace  hast thou the golden apple asked the king  yes here is the first and here is the second and here is the third too said cinderlad and he took all three apples out of his pocket and with that drew off his sooty rags and appeared there before them in his bright golden armor which gleamed as he stood  thou shalt have my daughter and the half of my kingdom and thou hast well earned both said the king so there was a wedding and cinderlad got the kings daughter and everyone made merry at the wedding for all of them could make merry though they could not ride up the glass hill and if they have not left off their merrymaking they must be at it still1   1 asbjornsen and moe     the story of prince ahmed and the fairy paribanou   there was a sultan who had three sons and a niece the eldest of the princes was called houssain the second ali the youngest ahmed and the princess his niece nouronnihar  the princess nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the sultan who died and left the princess very young the sultan took upon himself the care of his daughters education and brought her up in his palace with the three princes proposing to marry her when she arrived at a proper age and to contract an alliance with some neighboring prince by that means but when he perceived that the three princes his sons loved her passionately he thought more seriously on that affair he was very much concerned the difficulty he foresaw was to make them agree and that the two youngest should consent to yield her up to their elder brother as he found them positively obstinate he sent for them all together and said to them children since for your good and quiet i have not been able to persuade you no longer to aspire to the princess your cousin i think it would not be amiss if every one traveled separately into different countries so that you might not meet each other and as you know i am very curious and delight in everything thats singular i promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most extraordinary rarity and for the purchase of the rarity you shall go in search after and the expense of traveling i will give you every one a sum of money  as the three princes were always submissive and obedient to the sultans will and each flattered himself fortune might prove favorable to him they all consented to it the sultan paid them the money he promised them and that very day they gave orders for the preparations for their travels and took their leave of the sultan that they might be the more ready to go the next morning accordingly they all set out at the same gate of the city each dressed like a merchant attended by an officer of confidence dressed like a slave and all well mounted and equipped they went the first days journey together and lay all at an inn where the road was divided into three different tracts at night when they were at supper together they all agreed to travel for a year and to meet at that inn and that the first that came should wait for the rest that as they had all three taken their leave together of the sultan they might all return together the next morning by break of day after they had embraced and wished each other good success they mounted their horses and took each a different road  prince houssain the eldest brother arrived at bisnagar the capital of the kingdom of that name and the residence of its king he went and lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants and having learned that there were four principal divisions where merchants of all sorts sold their commodities and kept shops and in the midst of which stood the castle or rather the kings palace he went to one of these divisions the next day  prince houssain could not view this division without admiration it was large and divided into several streets all vaulted and shaded from the sun and yet very light too the shops were all of a size and all that dealt in the same sort of goods lived in one street as also the handicraftsmen who kept their shops in the smaller streets  the multitude of shops stocked with all sorts of merchandise as the finest linens from several parts of india some painted in the most lively colors and representing beasts trees and flowers silks and brocades from persia china and other places porcelain both from japan and china and tapestries surprised him so much that he knew not how to believe his own eyes but when he came to the goldsmiths and jewelers he was in a kind of ecstacy to behold such prodigious quantities of wrought gold and silver and was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls diamonds rubies emeralds and other jewels exposed to sale  another thing prince houssain particularly admired was the great number of rosesellers who crowded the streets for the indians are so great lovers of that flower that no one will stir without a nosegay in his hand or a garland on his head and the merchants keep them in pots in their shops that the air is perfectly perfumed  after prince houssain had run through that division street by street his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen he was very much tired which a merchant perceiving civilly invited him to sit down in his shop and he accepted but had not been sat down long before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of tapestry on his arm about six feet square and cried at thirty purses the prince called to the crier and asked to see the tapestry which seemed to him to be valued at an exorbitant price not only for the size of it but the meanness of the stuff when he had examined it well he told the crier that he could not comprehend how so small a piece of tapestry and of so indifferent appearance could be set at so high a price  the crier who took him for a merchant replied if this price seems so extravagant to you your amazement will be greater when i tell you i have orders to raise it to forty purses and not to part with it under certainly answered prince houssain it must have something very extraordinary in it which i know nothing of you have guessed it sir replied the crier and will own it when you come to know that whoever sits on this piece of tapestry may be transported in an instant wherever he desires to be without being stopped by any obstacle  at this discourse of the crier the prince of the indies considering that the principal motive of his travel was to carry the sultan his father home some singular rarity thought that he could not meet with any which could give him more satisfaction if the tapestry said he to the crier has the virtue you assign it i shall not think forty purses too much but shall make you a present besides sir replied the crier i have told you the truth and it is an easy matter to convince you of it as soon as you have made the bargain for forty purses on condition i show you the experiment but as i suppose you have not so much about you and to receive them i must go with you to your khan where you lodge with the leave of the master of the shop we will go into the back shop and i will spread the tapestry and when we have both sat down and you have formed the wish to be transported into your apartment of the khan if we are not transported thither it shall be no bargain and you shall be at your liberty as to your present though i am paid for my trouble by the seller i shall receive it as a favor and be very much obliged to you and thankful  on the credit of the crier the prince accepted the conditions and concluded the bargain and having got the masters leave they went into his back shop they both sat down on it and as soon as the prince formed his wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan he presently found himself and the crier there and as he wanted not a more sufficient proof of the virtue of the tapestry he counted the crier out forty pieces of gold and gave him twenty pieces for himself  in this manner prince houssain became the possessor of the tapestry and was overjoyed that at his arrival at bisnagar he had found so rare a piece which he never disputed would gain him the hand of nouronnihar in short he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the princes his younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it it was in his power by sitting on his tapestry to be at the place of meeting that very day but as he was obliged to stay there for his brothers as they had agreed and as he was curious to see the king of bisnagar and his court and to inform himself of the strength laws customs and religion of the kingdom he chose to make a longer abode there and to spend some months in satisfying his curiosity  prince houssain might have made a longer abode in the kingdom and court of bisnagar but he was so eager to be nearer the princess that spreading the tapestry he and the officer he had brought with him sat down and as soon as he had formed his wish were transported to the inn at which he and his brothers were to meet and where he passed for a merchant till they came  prince ali prince houssains second brother who designed to travel into persia took the road having three days after he parted with his brothers joined a caravan and after four days travel arrived at schiraz which was the capital of the kingdom of persia here he passed for a jeweler  the next morning prince ali who traveled only for his pleasure and had brought nothing but just necessaries along with him after he had dressed himself took a walk into that part of the town which they at schiraz called the bezestein  among all the criers who passed backward and forward with several sorts of goods offering to sell them he was not a little surprised to see one who held an ivory telescope in his hand of about a foot in length and the thickness of a mans thumb and cried it at thirty purses at first he thought the crier mad and to inform himself went to a shop and said to the merchant who stood at the door pray sir is not that man pointing to the crier who cried the ivory perspective glass at thirty purses mad if he is not i am very much deceived  indeed sir answered the merchant he was in his right senses yesterday i can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we have and the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be sold and if he cries the ivory perspective glass at thirty purses it must be worth as much or more on some account or other he will come by presently and we will call him and you shall be satisfied in the meantime sit down on my sofa and rest yourself  prince ali accepted the merchants obliging offer and presently afterward the crier passed by the merchant called him by his name and pointing to the prince said to him tell that gentleman who asked me if you were in your right senses what you mean by crying that ivory perspective glass which seems not to be worth much at thirty purses i should be very much amazed myself if i did not know you the crier addressing himself to prince ali said sir you are not the only person that takes me for a madman on account of this perspective glass you shall judge yourself whether i am or no when i have told you its property and i hope you will value it at as high a price as those i have showed it to already who had as bad an opinion of me as you  first sir pursued the crier presenting the ivory pipe to the prince observe that this pipe is furnished with a glass at both ends and consider that by looking through one of them you see whatever object you wish to behold i am said the prince ready to make you all imaginable reparation for the scandal i have thrown on you if you will make the truth of what you advance appear and as he had the ivory pipe in his hand after he had looked at the two glasses he said show me at which of these ends i must look that i may be satisfied the crier presently showed him and he looked through wishing at the same time to see the sultan his father whom he immediately beheld in perfect health set on his throne in the midst of his council afterward as there was nothing in the world so dear to him after the sultan as the princess nouronnihar he wished to see her and saw her at her toilet laughing and in a pleasant humor with her women about her  prince ali wanted no other proof to be persuaded that this perspective glass was the most valuable thing in the world and believed that if he should neglect to purchase it he should never meet again with such another rarity he therefore took the crier with him to the khan where he lodged and counted him out the money and received the perspective glass  prince ali was overjoyed at his bargain and persuaded himself that as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so rare and admirable the princess nouronnihar would be the recompense of his fatigue and trouble that he thought of nothing but visiting the court of persia incognito and seeing whatever was curious in schiraz and thereabouts till the caravan with which he came returned back to the indies as soon as the caravan was ready to set out the prince joined them and arrived happily without any accident or trouble otherwise than the length of the journey and fatigue of traveling at the place of rendezvous where he found prince houssain and both waited for prince ahmed  prince ahmed who took the road of samarcand the next day after his arrival there went as his brothers had done into the bezestein where he had not walked long but heard a crier who had an artificial apple in his hand cry it at five and thirty purses upon which he stopped the crier and said to him let me see that apple and tell me what virtue and extraordinary properties it has to be valued at so high a rate sir said the crier giving it into his hand if you look at the outside of this apple it is very worthless but if you consider its properties virtues and the great use and benefit it is to mankind you will say it is no price for it and that he who possesses it is master of a great treasure in short it cures all sick persons of the most mortal diseases and if the patient is dying it will recover him immediately and restore him to perfect health and this is done after the easiest manner in the world which is by the patients smelling the apple  if i may believe you replied prince ahmed the virtues of this apple are wonderful and it is invaluable but what ground have i for all you tell me to be persuaded of the truth of this matter sir replied the crier the thing is known and averred by the whole city of samarcand but without going any further ask all these merchants you see here and hear what they say you will find several of them will tell you they had not been alive this day if they had not made use of this excellent remedy and that you may better comprehend what it is i must tell you it is the fruit of the study and experiments of a celebrated philosopher of this city who applied himself all his lifetime to the study and knowledge of the virtues of plants and minerals and at last attained to this composition by which he performed such surprising cures in this town as will never be forgot but died suddenly himself before he could apply his sovereign remedy and left his wife and a great many young children behind him in very indifferent circumstances who to support her family and provide for her children is resolved to sell it  while the crier informed prince ahmed of the virtues of the artificial apple a great many persons came about them and confirmed what he said and one among the rest said he had a friend dangerously ill whose life was despaired of and that was a favorable opportunity to show prince ahmed the experiment upon which prince ahmed told the crier he would give him forty purses if he cured the sick person  the crier who had orders to sell it at that price said to prince ahmed come sir let us go and make the experiment and the apple shall be yours and i can assure you that it will always have the desired effect in short the experiment succeeded and the prince after he had counted out to the crier forty purses and he had delivered the apple to him waited patiently for the first caravan that should return to the indies and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the princes houssain and ali waited for him  when the princes met they showed each other their treasures and immediately saw through the glass that the princess was dying they then sat down on the carpet wished themselves with her and were there in a moment  prince ahmed no sooner perceived himself in nouronnihars chamber than he rose off the tapestry as did also the other two princes and went to the bedside and put the apple under her nose some moments after the princess opened her eyes and turned her head from one side to another looking at the persons who stood about her and then rose up in the bed and asked to be dressed just as if she had waked out of a sound sleep her women having presently informed her in a manner that showed their joy that she was obliged to the three princes for the sudden recovery of her health and particularly to prince ahmed she immediately expressed her joy to see them and thanked them all together and afterward prince ahmed in particular  while the princess was dressing the princes went to throw themselves at the sultan their fathers feet and pay their respects to him but when they came before him they found he had been informed of their arrival by the chief of the princesss eunuchs and by what means the princess had been perfectly cured the sultan received and embraced them with the greatest joy both for their return and the recovery of the princess his niece whom he loved as well as if she had been his own daughter and who had been given over by the physicians after the usual ceremonies and compliments the princes presented each his rarity prince houssain his tapestry which he had taken care not to leave behind him in the princesss chamber prince ali his ivory perspective glass and prince ahmed his artificial apple and after each had commended their present when they put it into the sultans hands they begged of him to pronounce their fate and declare to which of them he would give the princess nouronnihar for a wife according to his promise  the sultan of the indies having heard without interrupting them all that the princes could represent further about their rarities and being well informed of what had happened in relation to the princess nouronnihars cure remained some time silent as if he were thinking on what answer he should make at last he broke the silence and said to them i would declare for one of you children with a great deal of pleasure if i could do it with justice but consider whether i can do it or no tis true prince ahmed the princess my niece is obliged to your artificial apple for her cure but i must ask you whether or no you could have been so serviceable to her if you had not known by prince alis perspective glass the danger she was in and if prince houssains tapestry had not brought you so soon your perspective glass prince ali informed you and your brothers that you were like to lose the princess your cousin and there you must own a great obligation  you must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the tapestry and lastly prince houssain the princess would be very ungrateful if she should not show her acknowledgment of the service of your tapestry which was so necessary a means toward her cure but consider it would have been of little use if you had not been acquainted with the princesss illness by prince alis glass and prince ahmed had not applied his artificial apple therefore as neither tapestry ivory perspective glass nor artificial apple have the least preference one before the other but on the contrary theres a perfect equality i cannot grant the princess to any one of you and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is the glory of having equally contributed to restore her health  if all this be true added the sultan you see that i must have recourse to other means to determine certainly in the choice i ought to make among you and that as there is time enough between this and night ill do it today go and get each of you a bow and arrow and repair to the great plain where they exercise horses ill soon come to you and declare i will give the princess nouronnihar to him that shoots the farthest  the three princes had nothing to say against the decision of the sultan when they were out of his presence they each provided themselves with a bow and arrow which they delivered to one of their officers and went to the plain appointed followed by a great concourse of people  the sultan did not make them wait long for him and as soon as he arrived prince houssain as the eldest took his bow and arrow and shot first prince ali shot next and much beyond him and prince ahmed last of all but it so happened that nobody could see where his arrow fell and notwithstanding all the diligence that was used by himself and everybody else it was not to be found far or near and though it was believed that he shot the farthest and that he therefore deserved the princess nouronnihar it was however necessary that his arrow should be found to make the matter more evident and certain and notwithstanding his remonstrance the sultan judged in favor of prince ali and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding which was celebrated a few days after with great magnificence  prince houssain would not honor the feast with his presence in short his grief was so violent and insupportable that he left the court and renounced all right of succession to the crown to turn hermit  prince ahmed too did not come to prince alis and the princess nouronnihars wedding any more than his brother houssain but did not renounce the world as he had done but as he could not imagine what had become of his arrow he stole away from his attendants and resolved to search after it that he might not have anything to reproach himself with with this intent he went to the place where the princes houssains and alis were gathered up and going straight forward from there looking carefully on both sides of him he went so far that at last he began to think his labor was all in vain but yet he could not help going forward till he came to some steep craggy rocks which were bounds to his journey and were situated in a barren country about four leagues distant from where he set out   ii   when prince ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow which he gathered up looked earnestly at it and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away certainly said he to himself neither i nor any man living could shoot an arrow so far and finding it laid flat not sticking into the ground he judged that it rebounded against the rock there must be some mystery in this said he to himself again and it may be advantageous to me perhaps fortune to make me amends for depriving me of what i thought the greatest happiness may have reserved a greater blessing for my comfort  as these rocks were full of caves and some of those caves were deep the prince entered into one and looking about cast his eyes on an iron door which seemed to have no lock but he feared it was fastened however thrusting against it it opened and discovered an easy descent but no steps which he walked down with his arrow in his hand at first he thought he was going into a dark obscure place but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of and entering into a large spacious place at about fifty or sixty paces distant he perceived a magnificent palace which he had not then time enough to look at at the same time a lady of majestic port and air advanced as far as the porch attended by a large troop of ladies so finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress  as soon as prince ahmed perceived the lady he made all imaginable haste to go and pay his respects and the lady on her part seeing him coming prevented him from addressing his discourse to her first but said to him come nearer prince ahmed you are welcome  it was no small surprise to the prince to hear himself named in a place he had never heard of though so nigh to his fathers capital and he could not comprehend how he should be known to a lady who was a stranger to him at last he returned the ladys compliment by throwing himself at her feet and rising up again said to her  madam i return you a thousand thanks for the assurance you give me of a welcome to a place where i believed my imprudent curiosity had made me penetrate too far but madam may i without being guilty of ill manners dare to ask you by what adventure you know me and how you who live in the same neighborhood with me should be so great a stranger to me  prince said the lady let us go into the hall there i will gratify you in your request  after these words the lady led prince ahmed into the hall then she sat down on a sofa and when the prince by her entreaty had done the same she said you are surprised you say that i should know you and not be known by you but you will be no longer surprised when i inform you who i am you are undoubtedly sensible that your religion teaches you to believe that the world is inhabited by genies as well as men i am the daughter of one of the most powerful and distinguished genies and my name is paribanou the only thing that i have to add is that you seemed to me worthy of a more happy fate than that of possessing the princess nouronnihar and that you might attain to it i was present when you drew your arrow and foresaw it would not go beyond prince houssains i took it in the air and gave it the necessary motion to strike against the rocks near which you found it and i tell you that it lies in your power to make use of the favorable opportunity which presents itself to make you happy  as the fairy paribanou pronounced these last words with a different tone and looked at the same time tenderly upon prince ahmed with a modest blush on her cheeks it was no hard matter for the prince to comprehend what happiness she meant he presently considered that the princess nouronnihar could never be his and that the fairy paribanou excelled her infinitely in beauty agreeableness wit and as much as he could conjecture by the magnificence of the palace in immense riches he blessed the moment that he thought of seeking after his arrow a second time and yielding to his love madam replied he should i all my life have the happiness of being your slave and the admirer of the many charms which ravish my soul i should think myself the most blessed of men pardon in me the boldness which inspires me to ask this favor and dont refuse to admit me into your court a prince who is entirely devoted to you  prince answered the fairy will you not pledge your faith to me as well as i give mine to you yes madam replied the prince in an ecstacy of joy what can i do better and with greater pleasure yes my sultaness my queen ill give you my heart without the least reserve then answered the fairy you are my husband and i am your wife but as i suppose pursued she that you have eaten nothing today a slight repast shall be served up for you while preparations are making for our wedding feast at night and then i will show you the apartments of my palace and you shall judge if this hall is not the meanest part of it  some of the fairys women who came into the hall with them and guessed her intentions went immediately out and returned presently with some excellent meats and wines  when prince ahmed had ate and drunk as much as he cared for the fairy paribanou carried him through all the apartments where he saw diamonds rubies emeralds and all sorts of fine jewels intermixed with pearls agate jasper porphyry and all sorts of the most precious marbles but not to mention the richness of the furniture which was inestimable there was such a profuseness throughout that the prince instead of ever having seen anything like it owned that he could not have imagined that there was anything in the world that could come up to it prince said the fairy if you admire my palace so much which indeed is very beautiful what would you say to the palaces of the chief of our genies which are much more beautiful spacious and magnificent i could also charm you with my gardens but we will let that alone till another time night draws near and it will be time to go to supper  the next hall which the fairy led the prince into and where the cloth was laid for the feast was the last apartment the prince had not seen and not in the least inferior to the others at his entrance into it he admired the infinite number of sconces of wax candles perfumed with amber the multitude of which instead of being confused were placed with so just a symmetry as formed an agreeable and pleasant sight a large side table was set out with all sorts of gold plate so finely wrought that the workmanship was much more valuable than the weight of the gold several choruses of beautiful women richly dressed and whose voices were ravishing began a concert accompanied with all sorts of the most harmonious instruments and when they were set down at table the fairy paribanou took care to help prince ahmed to the most delicate meats which she named as she invited him to eat of them and which the prince found to be so exquisitely nice that he commended them with exaggeration and said that the entertainment far surpassed those of man he found also the same excellence in the wines which neither he nor the fairy tasted of till the dessert was served up which consisted of the choicest sweetmeats and fruits  the wedding feast was continued the next day or rather the days following the celebration were a continual feast  at the end of six months prince ahmed who always loved and honored the sultan his father conceived a great desire to know how he was and that desire could not be satisfied without his going to see he told the fairy of it and desired she would give him leave  prince said she go when you please but first dont take it amiss that i give you some advice how you shall behave yourself where you are going first i dont think it proper for you to tell the sultan your father of our marriage nor of my quality nor the place where you have been beg of him to be satisfied in knowing you are happy and desire no more and let him know that the sole end of your visit is to make him easy and inform him of your fate  she appointed twenty gentlemen well mounted and equipped to attend him when all was ready prince ahmed took his leave of the fairy embraced her and renewed his promise to return soon then his horse which was most finely caparisoned and was as beautiful a creature as any in the sultan of indies stables was led to him and he mounted him with an extraordinary grace and after he had bid her a last adieu set forward on his journey  as it was not a great way to his fathers capital prince ahmed soon arrived there the people glad to see him again received him with acclamations of joy and followed him in crowds to the sultans apartment the sultan received and embraced him with great joy complaining at the same time with a fatherly tenderness of the affliction his long absence had been to him which he said was the more grievous for that fortune having decided in favor of prince ali his brother he was afraid he might have committed some rash action  the prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the fairy whom he said that he must not mention and ended the only favor i ask of your majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my respects and to know how you do  son answered the sultan of the indies i cannot refuse you the leave you ask me but i should much rather you would resolve to stay with me at least tell me where i may send to you if you should fail to come or when i may think your presence necessary sir replied prince ahmed what your majesty asks of me is part of the mystery i spoke to your majesty of i beg of you to give me leave to remain silent on this head for i shall come so frequently that i am afraid that i shall sooner be thought troublesome than be accused of negligence in my duty  the sultan of the indies pressed prince ahmed no more but said to him son i penetrate no farther into your secrets but leave you at your liberty but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come and by your presence restore to me the joy i have not felt this long time and that you shall always be welcome when you come without interrupting your business or pleasure  prince ahmed stayed but three days at the sultan his fathers court and the fourth returned to the fairy paribanou who did not expect him so soon  a month after prince ahmeds return from paying a visit to his father as the fairy paribanou had observed that the prince since the time that he gave her an account of his journey his discourse with his father and the leave he asked to go and see him often had never talked of the sultan as if there had been no such person in the world whereas before he was always speaking of him she thought he forebore on her account therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day prince tell me have you forgot the sultan your father dont you remember the promise you made to go and see him often for my part i have not forgot what you told me at your return and so put you in mind of it that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise  so prince ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before but much finer and himself more magnificently mounted equipped and dressed and was received by the sultan with the same joy and satisfaction for several months he constantly paid his visits always in a richer and finer equipage  at last some viziers the sultans favorites who judged of prince ahmeds grandeur and power by the figure he cut made the sultan jealous of his son saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the peoples favor and dethrone him  the sultan of the indies was so far from thinking that prince ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them you are mistaken my son loves me and i am certain of his tenderness and fidelity as i have given him no reason to be disgusted  but the favorites went on abusing prince ahmed till the sultan said be it as it will i dont believe my son ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is how ever i am obliged to you for your good advice and dont dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions  the sultan of the indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have prince ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier so he sent for a female magician who was introduced by a back door into his apartment go immediately he said and follow my son and watch him so well as to find out where he retires and bring me word  the magician left the sultan and knowing the place where prince ahmed found his arrow went immediately thither and hid herself near the rocks so that nobody could see her  the next morning prince ahmed set out by daybreak without taking leave either of the sultan or any of his court according to custom the magician seeing him coming followed him with her eyes till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants  as the rocks were very steep and craggy they were an insurmountable barrier so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it either that the prince retired into some cavern or an abode of genies or fairies thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way which she traced till she came to the farther end looking carefully about on all sides but notwithstanding all her diligence could perceive no opening not so much as the iron gate which prince ahmed discovered which was to be seen and opened to none but men and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the fairy paribanou  the magician who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made and returned to give the sultan an account  the sultan was very well pleased with the magicians conduct and said to her do you as you think fit ill wait patiently the event of your promises and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value  as prince ahmed had obtained the fairy paribanous leave to go to the sultan of the indies court once a month he never failed and the magician knowing the time went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the prince and his attendants and waited there  the next morning prince ahmed went out as usual at the iron gate with the same attendants as before and passed by the magician whom he knew not to be such and seeing her lie with her head against the rock and complaining as if she were in great pain he pitied her turned his horse about went to her and asked her what was the matter with her and what he could do to ease her  the artful sorceress looked at the prince in a pitiful manner without ever lifting up her head and answered in broken words and sighs as if she could hardly fetch her breath that she was going to the capital city but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her and she was forced to lie down where he saw her far from any habitation and without any hopes of assistance  good woman replied prince ahmed you are not so far from help as you imagine i am ready to assist you and convey you where you will meet with a speedy cure only get up and let one of my people take you behind him  at these words the magician who pretended sickness only to know where the prince lived and what he did refused not the charitable offer he made her and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up at the same time two of the princes attendants alighting off their horses helped her up and set her behind another and mounted their horses again and followed the prince who turned back to the iron gate which was opened by one of his retinue who rode before and when he came into the outward court of the fairy without dismounting himself he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her  the fairy paribanou came with all imaginable haste not knowing what made prince ahmed return so soon who not giving her time to ask him the reason said princess i desire you would have compassion on this good woman pointing to the magician who was held up by two of his retinue i found her in the condition you see her in and promised her the assistance she stands in need of and am persuaded that you out of your own goodness as well as upon my entreaty will not abandon her  the fairy paribanou who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick woman all the time that the prince was talking to her ordered two of her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her and carry her into an apartment of the palace and take as much care of her as she would herself  while the two women executed the fairys commands she went up to prince ahmed and whispering in his ear said prince this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be and i am very much mistaken if she is not an impostor who will be the cause of a great trouble to you but dont be concerned let what will be devised against you be persuaded that i will deliver you out of all the snares that shall be laid for you go and pursue your journey  this discourse of the fairys did not in the least frighten prince ahmed my princess said he as i do not remember i ever did or designed anybody an injury i cannot believe anybody can have a thought of doing me one but if they have i shall not nevertheless forbear doing good whenever i have an opportunity then he went back to his fathers palace  in the meantime the two women carried the magician into a very fine apartment richly furnished first they sat her down upon a sofa with her back supported with a cushion of gold brocade while they made a bed on the same sofa before her the quilt of which was finely embroidered with silk the sheets of the finest linen and the coverlet clothofgold when they had put her into bed for the old sorceress pretended that her fever was so violent she could not help herself in the least one of the women went out and returned soon again with a china dish in her hand full of a certain liquor which she presented to the magician while the other helped her to sit up drink this liquor said she it is the water of the fountain of lions and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever you will find the effect of it in less than an hours time  the magician to dissemble the better took it after a great deal of entreaty but at last she took the china dish and holding back her head swallowed down the liquor when she was laid down again the two women covered her up lie quiet said she who brought her the china cup and get a little sleep if you can well leave you and hope to find you perfectly cured when we come again an hour hence  the two women came again at the time they said they should and found the magician up and dressed and sitting upon the sofa oh admirable potion she said it has wrought its cure much sooner than you told me it would and i shall be able to prosecute my journey  the two women who were fairies as well as their mistress after they had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so soon walked before her and conducted her through several apartments all more noble than that wherein she lay into a large hall the most richly and magnificently furnished of all the palace  fairy paribanou sat in this hall on a throne of massive gold enriched with diamonds rubies and pearls of an extraordinary size and attended on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies all richly clothed at the sight of so much majesty the magician was not only dazzled but was so amazed that after she had prostrated herself before the throne she could not open her lips to thank the fairy as she proposed however paribanou saved her the trouble and said to her good woman i am glad i had an opportunity to oblige you and to see you are able to pursue your journey i wont detain you but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace follow my women and they will show it you  then the magician went back and related to the sultan of the indies all that had happened and how very rich prince ahmed was since his marriage with the fairy richer than all the kings in the world and how there was danger that he should come and take the throne from his father  though the sultan of the indies was very well persuaded that prince ahmeds natural disposition was good yet he could not help being concerned at the discourse of the old sorceress to whom when she was taking her leave he said i thank thee for the pains thou hast taken and thy wholesome advice i am so sensible of the great importance it is to me that i shall deliberate upon it in council  now the favorites advised that the prince should be killed but the magician advised differently make him give you all kinds of wonderful things by the fairys help till she tires of him and sends him away as for example every time your majesty goes into the field you are obliged to be at a great expense not only in pavilions and tents for your army but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage now might not you engage him to use his interest with the fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a mans hand and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather  when the magician had finished her speech the sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose and finding them all silent determined to follow the magicians advice as the most reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government  next day the sultan did as the magician had advised him and asked for the pavilion  prince ahmed never expected that the sultan his father would have asked such a thing which at first appeared so difficult not to say impossible though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies and fairies was he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass such a tent as his father desired at last he replied though it is with the greatest reluctance imaginable i will not fail to ask the favor of my wife your majesty desires but will not promise you to obtain it and if i should not have the honor to come again to pay you my respects that shall be the sign that i have not had success but beforehand i desire you to forgive me and consider that you yourself have reduced me to this extremity  son replied the sultan of the indies i should be very sorry if what i ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more i find you dont know the power a husband has over a wife and yours would show that her love to you was very indifferent if she with the power she has of a fairy should refuse you so trifling a request as this i desire you to ask of her for my sake the prince went back and was very sad for fear of offending the fairy she kept pressing him to tell her what was the matter and at last he said madam you may have observed that hitherto i have been content with your love and have never asked you any other favor consider then i conjure you that it is not i but the sultan my father who indiscreetly or at least i think so begs of you a pavilion large enough to shelter him his court and army from the violence of the weather and which a man may carry in his hand but remember it is the sultan my father asks this favor  prince replied the fairy smiling i am sorry that so small a matter should disturb you and make you so uneasy as you appeared to me  then the fairy sent for her treasurer to whom when she came she said nourgihanwhich was her namebring me the largest pavilion in my treasury nourgiham returned presently with the pavilion which she could not only hold in her hand but in the palm of her hand when she shut her fingers and presented it to her mistress who gave it to prince ahmed to look at  when prince ahmed saw the pavilion which the fairy called the largest in her treasury he fancied she had a mind to jest with him and thereupon the marks of his surprise appeared presently in his countenance which paribanou perceiving burst out laughing what prince cried she do you think i jest with you youll see presently that i am in earnest nourgihan said she to her treasurer taking the tent out of prince ahmeds hands go and set it up that the prince may judge whether it may be large enough for the sultan his father  the treasurer went immediately with it out of the palace and carried it a great way off and when she had set it up one end reached to the very palace at which time the prince thinking it small found it large enough to shelter two greater armies than that of the sultan his fathers and then said to paribanou i ask my princess a thousand pardons for my incredulity after what i have seen i believe there is nothing impossible to you you see said the fairy that the pavilion is larger than what your father may have occasion for for you must know that it has one propertythat it is larger or smaller according to the army it is to cover  the treasurer took down the tent again and brought it to the prince who took it and without staying any longer than till the next day mounted his horse and went with the same attendants to the sultan his father  the sultan who was persuaded that there could not be any such thing as such a tent as he asked for was in a great surprise at the princes diligence he took the tent and after he had admired its smallness his amazement was so great that he could not recover himself when the tent was set up in the great plain which we have before mentioned he found it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into the field  but the sultan was not yet satisfied son said he i have already expressed to you how much i am obliged to you for the present of the tent you have procured me that i look upon it as the most valuable thing in all my treasury but you must do one thing more for me which will be every whit as agreeable to me i am informed that the fairy your spouse makes use of a certain water called the water of the fountain of lions which cures all sorts of fevers even the most dangerous and as i am perfectly well persuaded my health is dear to you i dont doubt but you will ask her for a bottle of that water for me and bring it me as a sovereign medicine which i may make use of when i have occasion do me this other important piece of service and thereby complete the duty of a good son toward a tender father  the prince returned and told the fairy what his father had said theres a great deal of wickedness in this demand she answered as you will understand by what i am going to tell you the fountain of lions is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle the entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions two of which sleep alternately while the other two are awake but dont let that frighten you ill give you means to pass by them without any danger  the fairy paribanou was at that time very hard at work and as she had several clews of thread by her she took up one and presenting it to prince ahmed said first take this clew of thread ill tell you presently the use of it in the second place you must have two horses one you must ride yourself and the other you must lead which must be loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters that must be killed today in the third place you must be provided with a bottle which i will give you to bring the water in set out early tomorrow morning and when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle follow it and when it stops as the gates will be open you will see the four lions the two that are awake will by their roaring wake the other two but dont be frightened but throw each of them a quarter of mutton and then clap spurs to your horse and ride to the fountain fill your bottle without alighting and then return with the same expedition the lions will be so busy eating they will let you pass by them  prince ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed by the fairy and followed her directions exactly when he arrived at the gates of the castle he distributed the quarters of mutton among the four lions and passing through the midst of them bravely got to the fountain filled his bottle and returned back as safe and sound as he went when he had gone a little distance from the castle gates he turned him about and perceiving two of the lions coming after him he drew his sabre and prepared himself for defense but as he went forward he saw one of them turned out of the road at some distance and showed by his head and tail that he did not come to do him any harm but only to go before him and that the other stayed behind to follow he put his sword up again in its scabbard guarded in this manner he arrived at the capital of the indies but the lions never left him till they had conducted him to the gates of the sultans palace after which they returned the same way they came though not without frightening all that saw them for all they went in a very gentle manner and showed no fierceness  a great many officers came to attend the prince while he dismounted his horse and afterward conducted him into the sultans apartment who was at that time surrounded with his favorites he approached toward the throne laid the bottle at the sultans feet and kissed the rich tapestry which covered his footstool and then said  i have brought you sir the healthful water which your majesty desired so much to keep among your other rarities in your treasury but at the same time wish you such extraordinary health as never to have occasion to make use of it  after the prince had made an end of his compliment the sultan placed him on his right hand and then said to him son i am very much obliged to you for this valuable present as also for the great danger you have exposed yourself to upon my account which i have been informed of by a magician who knows the fountain of lions but do me the pleasure continued he to inform me by what address or rather by what incredible power you have been secured  sir replied prince ahmed i have no share in the compliment your majesty is pleased to make me all the honor is due to the fairy my spouse whose good advice i followed then he informed the sultan what those directions were and by the relation of this his expedition let him know how well he had behaved himself when he had done the sultan who showed outwardly all the demonstrations of great joy but secretly became more jealous retired into an inward apartment where he sent for the magician  the magician at her arrival saved the sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of prince ahmeds journey which she had heard of before she came and therefore was prepared with an infallible means as she pretended this means she communicated to the sultan who declared it the next day to the prince in the midst of all his courtiers in these words son said he i have one thing more to ask of you after which i shall expect nothing more from your obedience nor your interest with your wife this request is to bring me a man not above a foot and a half high and whose beard is thirty feet long who carries a bar of iron upon his shoulders of five hundredweight which he uses as a quarterstaff  prince ahmed who did not believe that there was such a man in the world as his father described would gladly have excused himself but the sultan persisted in his demand and told him the fairy could do more incredible things  the next day the prince returned to his dear paribanou to whom he told his fathers new demand which he said he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first for added he i cannot imagine there can be such a man in the world without doubt he has a mind to try whether or no i am so silly as to go about it or he has a design on my ruin in short how can he suppose that i should lay hold of a man so well armed though he is but little what arms can i make use of to reduce him to my will if there are any means i beg you will tell them and let me come off with honor this time  dont affright yourself prince replied the fairy you ran a risk in fetching the water of the fountain of lions for your father but theres no danger in finding out this man who is my brother schaibar but is so far from being like me though we both had the same father that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense yet on the other hand is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire he is made exactly as the sultan your father has described him and has no other arms than a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight without which he never stirs and which makes him respected ill send for him and you shall judge of the truth of what i tell you but be sure to prepare yourself against being frightened at his extraordinary figure when you see him what my queen replied prince ahmed do you say schaibar is your brother let him be never so ugly or deformed i shall be so far from being frightened at the sight of him that as our brother i shall honor and love him  the fairy ordered a gold chafingdish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace with a box of the same metal which was a present to her out of which taking a perfume and throwing it into the fire there arose a thick cloud of smoke  some moments after the fairy said to prince ahmed see there comes my brother the prince immediately perceived schaibar coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder his long beard which he held up before him and a pair of thick mustachios which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face his eyes were very small and deepset in his head which was far from being of the smallest size and on his head he wore a grenadiers cap besides all this he was very much humpbacked  if prince ahmed had not known that schaibar was paribanous brother he would not have been able to have looked at him without fear but knowing first who he was he stood by the fairy without the least concern  schaibar as he came forward looked at the prince earnestly enough to have chilled his blood in his veins and asked paribanou when he first accosted her who that man was to which she replied he is my husband brother his name is ahmed he is son to the sultan of the indies the reason why i did not invite you to my wedding was i was unwilling to divert you from an expedition you were engaged in and from which i heard with pleasure you returned victorious and so took the liberty now to call for you  at these words schaibar looking on prince ahmed favorably said is there anything else sister wherein i can serve him it is enough for me that he is your husband to engage me to do for him whatever he desires the sultan his father replied paribanou has a curiosity to see you and i desire he may be your guide to the sultans court he needs but lead me the way ill follow him brother replied paribanou it is too late to go today therefore stay till tomorrow morning and in the meantime ill inform you of all that has passed between the sultan of the indies and prince ahmed since our marriage  the next morning after schaibar had been informed of the affair he and prince ahmed set out for the sultans court when they arrived at the gates of the capital the people no sooner saw schaibar but they ran and hid themselves and some shut up their shops and locked themselves up in their houses while others flying communicated their fear to all they met who stayed not to look behind them but ran too insomuch that schaibar and prince ahmed as they went along found the streets all desolate till they came to the palaces where the porters instead of keeping the gates ran away too so that the prince and schaibar advanced without any obstacle to the councilhall where the sultan was seated on his throne and giving audience here likewise the ushers at the approach of schaibar abandoned their posts and gave them free admittance  schaibar went boldly and fiercely up to the throne without waiting to be presented by prince ahmed and accosted the sultan of the indies in these words thou hast asked for me said he see here i am what wouldst thou have with me  the sultan instead of answering him clapped his hands before his eyes to avoid the sight of so terrible an object at which uncivil and rude reception schaibar was so much provoked after he had given him the trouble to come so far that he instantly lifted up his iron bar and killed him before prince ahmed could intercede in his behalf all that he could do was to prevent his killing the grand vizier who sat not far from him representing to him that he had always given the sultan his father good advice these are they then said schaibar who gave him bad and as he pronounced these words he killed all the other viziers and flattering favorites of the sultan who were prince ahmeds enemies every time he struck he killed some one or other and none escaped but they who were not so frightened as to stand staring and gaping and who saved themselves by flight  when this terrible execution was over schaibar came out of the councilhall into the midst of the courtyard with the iron bar upon his shoulder and looking hard at the grand vizier who owed his life to prince ahmed he said i know here is a certain magician who is a greater enemy of my brotherinlaw than all these base favorites i have chastised let the magician be brought to me presently the grand vizier immediately sent for her and as soon as she was brought schaibar said at the time he fetched a stroke at her with his iron bar take the reward of thy pernicious counsel and learn to feign sickness again  after this he said this is not yet enough i will use the whole town after the same manner if they do not immediately acknowledge prince ahmed my brotherinlaw for their sultan and the sultan of the indies then all that were there present made the air echo again with the repeated acclamations of long life to sultan ahmed and immediately after he was proclaimed through the whole town schaibar made him be clothed in the royal vestments installed him on the throne and after he had caused all to swear homage and fidelity to him went and fetched his sister paribanou whom he brought with all the pomp and grandeur imaginable and made her to be owned sultaness of the indies  as for prince ali and princess nouronnihar as they had no hand in the conspiracy against prince ahmed and knew nothing of any prince ahmed assigned them a considerable province with its capital where they spent the rest of their lives afterwards he sent an officer to prince houssain to acquaint him with the change and make him an offer of which province he liked best but that prince thought himself so happy in his solitude that he bade the officer return the sultan his brother thanks for the kindness he designed him assuring him of his submission and that the only favor he desired of him was to give him leave to live retired in the place he had made choice of for his retreat1   1 arabian nights     the history of jack the giantkiller   in the reign of the famous king arthur there lived in cornwall a lad named jack who was a boy of a bold temper and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers giants and fairies and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of king arthurs round table  in those days there lived on st michaels mount off cornwall a huge giant eighteen feet high and nine feet round his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him  he dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist and march back to his own abode  the giant had done this for many years when jack resolved to destroy him  jack took a horn a shovel a pickaxe his armor and a dark lantern and one winters evening he went to the mount there he dug a pit twentytwo feet deep and twenty broad he covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground he then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out you saucy villain you shall pay for this ill broil you for my breakfast  he had just finished when taking one step further he tumbled headlong into the pit and jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news  another giant called blunderbore vowed to be revenged on jack if ever he should have him in his power this giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood and some time after the death of cormoran jack was passing through a wood and being weary sat down and went to sleep  the giant passing by and seeing jack carried him to his castle where he locked him up in a large room the floor of which was covered with the bodies skulls and bones of men and women  soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant to take a meal off his flesh and jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching  jack perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord took courage and making a slipknot at each end he threw them over their heads and tied it to the windowbars he then pulled till he had choked them when they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart  jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of blunderbore and went into the castle again he made a strict search through all the rooms and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads and almost starved to death they told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands  ladies said jack i have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother and i give you this castle and all the riches it contains to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt he then very politely gave them the keys of the castle and went further on his journey to wales  as jack had but little money he went on as fast as possible at length he came to a handsome house jack knocked at the door when there came forth a welsh giant jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way on which the giant made him welcome and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in  jack took off his clothes quickly but though he was weary he could not go to sleep soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room and saying to himself    though here you lodge with me this night   you shall not see the morning light   my club shall dash your brains out quite   say you so thought jack are these your tricks upon travelers but i hope to prove as cunning as you are then getting out of bed he groped about the room and at last found a large thick billet of wood he laid it in his own place in the bed and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room  the giant about midnight entered the apartment and with his bludgeon struck many blows on the bed in the very place where jack had laid the log and then he went back to his own room thinking he had broken all jacks bones  early in the morning jack put a bold face upon the matter and walked into the giants room to thank him for his lodging the giant started when he saw him and began to stammer out oh dear me is it you pray how did you sleep last night did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night  nothing to speak of said jack carelessly a rat i believe gave me three or four slaps with its tail and disturbed me a little but i soon went to sleep again  the giant wondered more and more at this yet he did not answer a word but went to bring two great bowls of hastypudding for their breakfast jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat and slip the hastypudding into this bag while he seemed to put it into his mouth  when breakfast was over he said to the giant now i will show you a fine trick i can cure all wounds with a touch i could cut off my head in one minute and the next put it sound again on my shoulders you shall see an example he then took hold of the knife ripped up the leathern bag and all the hastypudding tumbled out upon the floor  ods splutter hur nails cried the welsh giant who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as jack hur can do that hurself so he snatched up the knife plunged it into his own stomach and in a moment dropped down dead  jack having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings resolved not to be idle in future he therefore furnished himself with a horse a cap of knowledge a sword of sharpness shoes of swiftness and an invisible coat the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him  he traveled over high hills and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady jack alighted from his horse and tying him to an oak tree put on his invisible coat under which he carried his sword of sharpness  when he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him but could not reach his body but wounded his thighs in several places and at length putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might he cut off both his legs then jack setting his foot upon his neck plunged his sword into the giants body when the monster gave a groan and expired  the knight and his lady thanked jack for their deliverance and invited him to their house to receive a proper reward for his services no said jack i cannot be easy till i find out this monsters habitation so taking the knights directions he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brothers return  jack alighted from his horse and putting on his invisible coat approached and aimed a blow at the giants head but missing his aim he only cut off his nose on this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully  nay said jack if this be the case id better dispatch you so jumping upon the block he stabbed him in the back when he dropped down dead  jack then proceeded on his journey and traveled over hills and dales till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house when an old man let him in  when jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him my son on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle kept by the giant galligantus and a vile magician i lament the fate of a dukes daughter whom they seized as she was walking in her fathers garden and brought hither transformed into a deer  jack promised that in the morning at the risk of his life he would break the enchantment and after a sound sleep he rose early put on his invisible coat and got ready for the attempt  when he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery griffins but he passed between them without the least fear of danger for they could not see him because of his invisible coat on the castle gate he found a golden trumpet under which were written these lines    whoever can this trumpet blow   shall cause the giants overthrow   as soon as jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble  the giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an end and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear jack with his sword of sharpness soon killed the giant and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes the castle vanished away like smoke and the head of the giant galligantus was then sent to king arthur  the knights and ladies rested that night at the old mans hermitage and next day they set out for the court jack then went up to the king and gave his majesty an account of all his fierce battles  jacks fame had now spread through the whole country and at the kings desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage to the joy of all his kingdom after this the king gave him a large estate on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment1   1 old chapbook     the black bull of norroway        and many a

married and he and she are living happy till this day for aught i ken1   1 chambers popular traditions of scotland     the red etin   there were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o ground which they rented from a farmer ane of them had twa sons and the other had ane and byandby it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send them away to seeke their fortune so she told her eldest son ae day to take a can and bring her water from the well that she might bake a cake for him and however much or however little water he might bring the cake would be great or sma accordingly and that cake was to be a that she could gie him when he went on his travels  the lad gaed away wi the can to the well and filled it wi water and then came away hame again but the can being broken the maist part of the water had run out before he got back so his cake was very sma yet sma as it was his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing telling him that if he chose rather to have the hale he would only get it wi her curse the young man thinking he might hae to travel a far way and not knowing when or how he might get other provisions said he would like to hae the hale cake com of his mothers malison what like so she gave him the hale cake and her malison alang wit then he took his brither aside and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back desiring him to look at it every morning and as lang as it continued to be clear then he might be sure that the owner of it was well but if it grew dim and rusty then for certain some ill had befallen him  so the young man set out to seek his fortune and he gaed a that day and a the next day and on the third day in the afternoon he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock o sheep and he gaed up to the shepherd and asked him wha the sheep belanged to and the man answered        the red etin of ireland        ance lived in bellygan      and stole king malcolms daughter        the king of fair scotland      he beats her he binds her        he lays her on a band      and every day he dings her        with a bright silver wand      like julian the roman      hes one that fears no man      its said theres ane predestinate        to be his mortal foe      but that man is yet unborn        and lang may it be so  the young man then went on his journey and he had not gone far when he espied an old man with white locks herding a flock of swine and he gaed up to him and asked whose swine these were when the man answered       the red etin of ireland             repeat the verses above  then the young man gaed on a bit farther and came to another very old man herding goats and when he asked whose goats they were the answer was       the red etin of ireland             repeat the verses again  this old man also told him to beware of the next beasts that he should meet for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen  so the young man went on and byandby he saw a multitude of very dreadfu beasts ilk ane o them wi twa heads and on every head four horns and he was sore frightened and ran away from them as fast as he could and glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock wi the door standing wide to the wa and he gaed into the castle for shelter and there he saw an auld wife sitting beside the kitchen fire he asked the wife if he might stay there for the night as he was tired wi a lang journey and the wife said he might but it was not a good place for him to be in as it belanged to the red etin who was a very terrible beast wi three heads that spared no living man he could get hold of the young man would have gone away but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle so he beseeched the old woman to conceal him as well as she could and not to tell the etin that he was there he thought if he could put over the night he might get away in the morning without meeting wi the beasts and so escape but he had not been long in his hidyhole before the awful etin came in and nae sooner was he in than he was heard crying    snouk but and snouk ben   i find the smell of an earthly man   be he living or be he dead   his heart this night shall kitchen1 my bread   1 kitchen that is season   the monster soon found the poor young man and pulled him from his hole and when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared the first was whether ireland or scotland was first inhabited the second was whether man was made for woman or woman for man the third was whether men or brutes were made first the lad not being able to answer one of these questions the red etin took a mace and knocked him on the head and turned him into a pillar of stone  on the morning after this happened the younger brither took out the knife to look at it and he was grieved to find it a brown wi rust he told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also so she requested him to take the can to the well for water that she might bake a cake for him the can being broken he brought hame as little water as the other had done and the cake was as little she asked whether he would have the hale cake wi her malison or the half wi her blessing and like his brither he thought it best to have the hale cake come o the malison what might so he gaed away and everything happened to him that had happened to his brother  the other widow and her son heard of a that had happened frae a fairy and the young man determined that he would also go upon his travels and see if he could do anything to relieve his twa friends so his mother gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water that she might bake him a cake for his journey and he gaed and as he was bringing hame the water a raven owre abune his head cried to him to look and he would see that the water was running out and he was a young man of sense and seeing the water running out he took some clay and patched up the holes so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake when his mother put it to him to take the halfcake wi her blessing he took it in preference to having the hale wi her malison and yet the half was bigger than what the other lads had got athegither  so he gaed away on his journey and after he had traveled a far way he met wi an auld woman that asked him if he would give her a bit of his bannock and he said he would gladly do that and so he gave her a piece of the bannock and for that she gied him a magical wand that she said might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly then the auld woman who was a fairy told him a great deal that whould happen to him and what he ought to do in a circumstances and after that she vanished in an instant out o his sight he gaed on a great way farther and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep and when he asked whose sheep these were the answer was        the red etin of ireland         ance lived in bellygan       and stole king malcolms daughter         the king of fair scotland       he beats her he binds her         he lays her on a band       and every day he dings her         with a bright silver wand       like julian the roman       hes one that fears no man       but now i fear his end is near         and destiny at hand       and youre to be i plainly see         the heir of all his land  repeat the same inquiries to the man attending the swine and the man attending the goats with the same answer in each case   when he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing he did not stop nor run away but went boldly through among them one came up roaring with open mouth to devour him when he struck it with his wand and laid it in an instant dead at his feet he soon came to the etins castle where he knocked and was admitted the auld woman that sat by the fire warned him of the terrible etin and what had been the fate of the twa brithers but he was not to be daunted the monster soon came in saying    snouk but and snouk ben   i find the smell of an earthly man   be he living or be he dead   his heart shall be kitchen to my bread  he quickly espied the young man and bade him come forth on the floor and then he put the three questions to him but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy so he was able to answer all the questions when the etin found this he knew that his power was gone the young man then took up the axe and hewed off the monsters three heads he next asked the old woman to show him where the kings daughters lay and the old woman took him upstairs and opened a great many doors and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the etin and ane o the ladies was the kings daughter she also took him down into a low room and there stood two stone pillars that he had only to touch wi his wand when his two friends and neighbors started into life and the hale o the prisoners were overjoyed at their deliverance which they all acknowledged to be owing to the prudent young man next day they a set out for the kings court and a gallant company they made and the king married his daughter to the young man that had delivered her and gave a nobles daughter to ilk ane o the other young men and so they a lived happily a the rest o their days1   1 chambers popular
