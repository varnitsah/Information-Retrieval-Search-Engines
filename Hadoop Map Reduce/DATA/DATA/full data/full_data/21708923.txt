 illustration     the saalfield pub co  1916     the tale  of  peter rabbit   once upon a time there were four little rabbits and their names were flopsy mopsy cottontail and peter  illustration  they lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree  now my dears said old mrs rabbit one morning you may go into the fields or down the lane but dont go into mr mcgregors garden  illustration  illustration  your father had an accident there he was put in a pie by mrs mcgregor  illustration  now run along and dont get into mischief i am going out  then old mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the bakers  illustration  she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns  flopsy mopsy and cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane together  illustration  to gather blackberries  illustration  but peter who was very naughty ran straight away to mr mcgregors garden and  illustration  squeezed under the gate  illustration  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans  illustration  and then  he ate some radishes  illustration  and then feeling rather sick he went to look for some parsley  illustration  illustration  but round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet but mr mcgregor  mr mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out stop thief  illustration  peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate  illustration  he lost one shoe among the cabbages and the other amongst the potatoes  illustration  after losing them he ran on four legs and went faster  illustration  so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net  illustration  and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket  illustration  it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new  illustration  peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears  illustration  but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows  illustration  who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself  mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop on the top of peter but peter wriggled out just in time  illustration  illustration  leaving his jacket behind him  illustration  he rushed into the toolshed and  illustration  jumped into a can  illustration  illustration  it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it mr mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot  illustration  he began to turn them over carefully looking under each  presently peter sneezed kertyschoo  mr mcgregor was after him in no time and tried to put his foot upon peter who  jumped out of a window upsetting three plants  illustration  illustration  peter sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had not the least idea which way to go  also he was very damp with sitting in that can  after a time he began to wander about going lippity lippity not very fast and looking all around  he found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth she could not answer she only shook her head at him  illustration  peter began to cry  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled presently he came to a pond where mr mcgregor filled his watercans a white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very very still but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her  illustration  he had heard about cats from his cousin little benjamin bunny  he went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoescrrritch scratch scratch scritch  peter scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing happened he came out and  illustration  illustration  climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over  the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing onions his back was turned towards peter and beyond him was the gate  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go along a straight walk behind some black currant bushes mr mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but peter did not care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden  mr mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds illustration  illustration  peter never stopped running or looked behind him  illustration  till he got home to the big firtree  illustration  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking she wondered what he had done with his clothes  it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening his mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea and she gave a dose of it to peter one teaspoonful to be taken at bedtime but  illustration  flopsy mopsy and cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper  illustration  illustration  illustration
