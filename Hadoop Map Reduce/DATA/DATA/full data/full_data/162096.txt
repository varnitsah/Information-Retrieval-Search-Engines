at least as england is concerned a man who beats his wife is shocking to us and a colonel who cannot manage his soldiers without having them beaten is nearly equally so we are not very fond of hanging and some of us go so far as to recoil under any circumstances from taking the blood of life we perform our operations under chloroform and it has even been suggested that those schoolmasters who insist on adhering in some sort to the doctrines of solomon should perform their operations in the same guarded manner if the disgrace be absolutely necessary let it be inflicted but not the bodily pain  so far as regards the low externals of humanity this is doubtless a humane age let men women and children have bread let them have if possible no blows or at least as few as may be let them also be decently clothed and let the pestilence be kept out of their way in venturing to call these low i have done so in no contemptuous spirit they are comparatively low if the body be lower than the mind the humanity of the age is doubtless suited to its material wants and such wants are those which demand the promptest remedy but in the inner feelings of men to men and of one mans mind to another mans mind is it not an age of extremest cruelty  there is sympathy for the hungry man but there is no sympathy for the unsuccessful man who is not hungry if a fellow mortal be ragged humanity will subscribe to mend his clothes but humanity will subscribe nothing to mend his ragged hopes so long as his outside coat shall be whole and decent  to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath this is the special text that we delight to follow and success is the god that we delight to worship ah pity me i have struggled and fallenstruggled so manfully yet fallen so utterlyhelp me up this time that i may yet push forward once again who listens to such a plea as this fallen do you want bread not bread but a kind heart and a kind hand my friend i cannot stay by you i myself am in a hurry there is that fiend of a rival there even now gaining a step on me i beg your pardon but i will put my foot on your shoulderonly for one moment occupet extremum scabies  yes let the devil take the hindmost the three or four hindmost if you will nay all but those strongrunning horses who can force themselves into noticeable places under the judges eye this is the noble shibboleth with which the english youth are now spurred on to deeds ofwhat shall we saymoneymaking activity let every place in which a man can hold up his head be the reward of some antagonistic struggle of some grand competitive examination let us get rid of the fault of past ages with us let the race be ever to the swift the victory always to the strong and let us always be racing so that the swift and strong shall ever be known among us but what then for those who are not swift not strong væ victis let them go to the wall they can hew wood probably or at any rate draw water  were we to ask lord derby or lord palmerston or to consult the shade of lord george bentinckor to go to those greater authorities on the subject mr scott for instance and the family of the dayswe should i believe be informed that the racehorse requires a very peculiar condition it is not to be obtained quickly and when obtained will fit the beast for no other than that one purpose of running races crucifix was never good at going in a cab ilione never took her noble owner down to the house of parliament nor has toxopholite been useful in leicestershire  but nevertheless let all our work be done by racehorses all at least that shall be considered honourable let us have strength and speed and how shall we know who are strong and swift if we do not train our horses to run against each other but this early racing will hardly produce that humanity of spirit of which we now deplore the want the devil take the hindmost is the very essence of the young mans book of proverbs the devil assuredly will take all the hindmost none but the very foremost can enter the present heaven of good things therefore oh my brother my friend thou companion of my youth may the devil take thee thee quickly since it needs must be thee or me  væ victisalas for these hindmost ones there are so many of them the skimmilk will always be so much more in quantity than the cream with us at present cream is required for everything nothing can be well done now unless it be done by cream of some sort that milk has been skimmed the cream has been taken away no matter skim it again there shall be something yet which we will call cream competitive examination will produce something that shall look to be strong that shall be swift if it be only for a start of twenty yards  this is the experiment of the present day wise men say that when nothing but cream is accepted all mankind all boykind rather will prepare itself for a skimming of some sort and that the quantity of cream produced will be immense it is only done as an instigation to education much may be said in opposition to this but nothing shall be said here it is merely of the cruelty of spirit that is thus engendered that we now speak success is the only test of merit words have lost their old significance and to deserve only is not meritorious væ victis there are so many of them  thompson says johnson the young poet when he has at last succeeded in getting the bosomest of his friends alone into his chamber with him have you happened to look at my iphigenia yet  thompson cant say that he has he has been busy has had so many waterparties and then somehow he doesnt think that he is very partial to modern poetry on subjects of old mythology of course however he means to read itsome of these days  i wish you would says johnson tendering a copy of the thin volume i really wish you would and let me have your candid opinion the press certainly have not noticed it much and what they have said has been very lukewarm  i am sorry for that says thompson looking grave  and i did my best with it too you would hardly believe how hard i worked at it there is not a line that has not been weighed and written perhaps three times over i do not think i am conceited but i cannot but believe that there is something in it the reviewers are so jealous if a man has not a name they will give him credit for nothing and it is so hard to begin  i am sure it is says thompson  i dont expect fame and as for money of course i dont think of that but i should like to know that it had been read by one or two persons who could understand it i have given to it the best of my time the best of my labour i cannot but think that there is something in it thus pleads the unsuccessful one for mercy  and thus answers to him the successful one with no grain of mercy in his compositionmy dear johnson my maxim is this that in this world every man gets in the long run exactly what he deserves  did milton get what he deserved  these are not the days of milton i dont want to hurt your feelings but old friends as we are i should not forgive myself if i didnt tell you what i really think poetry is all very well but you cant create a taste for it if it doesnt exist nobody that i know of cares a d for iphigenia  you think i should change my subject then  to tell you the truth i think you should change your trade this is the third attempt you know i dare say they are very good in their way but if the world liked them the world would have found it out by this time vox populi vox deithat is my mottoi dont trust my own judgment i trust that of the public if you will take my advice you will give up iphigenia and the rest of them you see you are doing nothing whatever at the bar c c  and thus johnson is left without a scrap of comfort a word of consolation a spark of sympathy and yet he had given to that iphigenia of his the best that was in him to give had his publisher sold ten thousand copies of it how thompson would have admired it how he would have pressed the poet in his arms and have given him champagne up at richmond but who now has sympathy for failure to fail is to be disgraced væ victis  there is something very painful in these races which we english are always running to one who has tenderness enough to think of the nine beaten horses instead of the one who has conquered look at that list which has just come out after our grand national struggle at cambridge how many wranglers are there thirty shall we say and it is always glorious to be a wrangler out of that thirty there is probably but one who has not failed who is not called on to submit to the inward grief of having been beaten the youth who is second who has thus shown himself to be possessed of a mass of erudition sufficient to crush an ordinary mind to the earth is ready to eat his heart with true bitterness of spirit after all his labour his midnight oil his many sleepless nights his deserted pleasures his racking headaches amaryllis abandoned and neæra seen in the arms of another after all this to be beaten by jones had it been green or smith he could have borne it would it not have been better to do as others had done he could have been contented to have gone out in the crowd but there is nothing so base as to be secondand then second to jones  out of the whole lot jones alone is contented and he is told by his physician that he must spend his next two winters at cairo the intensity of his application has put his lungs into very serious jeopardy  it was at oxford in the year 184 that a young man sat in his collegerooms at balliol a wretched victim to unsuccessful competition it had been everything to him to come out as a first in classics and he had dared to dream even of a doublefirst but he had failed in both the lists had just appeared and he was only a secondclass man now a secondclass man is not much thought of at balliol and he had lost his chance of an immediate fellowship  but this was perhaps hardly the worst of it arthur wilkinson for such was this gentlemans name had hitherto run his race in life alongside a friend and rival named george bertram and in almost every phase of life had hitherto been beaten the same moment that had told wilkinson of his failure had told him also that bertram had obtained the place he had so desired bertram was the only doublefirst man of his year  as these two young men will play the foremost parts in the following pages i will endeavour to explain in as few words as possible who each of them was as bertram seems to have been the favourite with fortune i will begin with him  his father at the time alluded to was still alive but his son george had seen but little of him sir lionel bertram had been a soldier of fortune which generally i believe means a soldier without a fortune and in that capacity he was still in some sort fighting his countrys battles at the present moment he held a quasimilitary position in persia where he had been for the last five years and previously to that he had served in canada india the cape of good hope and on some special mission at monte video he had therefore seen a good deal of the world but very little of his only child mrs bertram georges mother had died early in life and mr afterwards sir lionel bertram had roamed the world free from all encumbrances  the rev arthur wilkinson vicar of hurst staple on the borders of hampshire and berkshire had married a firstcousin of mrs bertrams and when young george bertram at the age of nine was tossing about the world rather in want of a fixed home mr wilkinson undertook to give him that home and to educate him with his own eldest child till they should both be sent to some school for three years george bertram lived at hurst staple and was educated accordingly during these years he used to go annually for one month to the house of an uncle who in due time will also be introduced to the reader and therefore not unnaturally this month was regarded by the boy as his holidays  now it may as well be explained in this place that sir lionel bertram though a very gallant man and peculiarly well adapted to do business with outlandish people had never succumbed to a habit of punctuality in pecuniary matters an arrangement had been perhaps rather named than made that one hundred and thirty pounds per annum should be paid for young bertrams needs and as this was to include pocketmoney clothing and washing as well as such trifles as the boys maintenance and education perhaps the bargain was not a very hard one as regarded sir lionel the first seventyfive pounds were paid but after that up to the end of the second year mr wilkinson had received no more as he was a poor man with six children of his own and little besides his living he then thought it better to mention the matter to sir lionels brother in london the balance was instantly paid and mr wilkinson had no further trouble on that head nor had he much trouble on any other head as regarded young bertram the lad was perhaps not fit to be sainted and gave mrs wilkinson the usual amount of trouble as regarded his jackets and pantaloons but on the whole he was a good boy free and generous in his temper quick in his parts affectionate in disposition and full of humour those who examined him most closely among whom perhaps mr wilkinson was not included might have observed that he was hardly as steady as he might have been in his likings and dislikings that he made too little of the tasks which he learnt without trouble and that in fact he was not sufficiently solicitous about anything he was however undoubtedly a lad of great promise and one of whom any father might have been proud  he was not a handsome boy nor did he become a handsome man his face was too solid his cheeks too square and his forehead too heavy but his eyes though small were bright and his mouth was wonderfully marked by intelligence when he grew to be a man he wore no beard not even the slightest apology for a whisker and this perhaps added to the apparent heaviness of his face but he probably best understood his own appearance for in those days no face bore on it more legible marks of an acute mind  at the age of twelve he was sent to winchester and as his holidays were still passed with his uncle he then ceased to regard hurst staple as his home twice a year as he went up to town he stayed there for a couple of days but he was soon looked on as a visitor and the little wilkinsons no longer regarded him as half a brother in reality and quite a brother in love  arthur wilkinson was very nearly of the same age he was just older than young bertramby three months or so just sufficiently to give to wilkinson a feeling of seniority when they first met and a consciousness that as he was the senior in age he should be the senior in scholastic lore but this consciousness wilkinson was not able to attain and during all the early years of his life he was making a vain struggle to be as good a man as his cousin that is as good in scholarship as good in fighting as good in play and as good in spirit  in looks at any rate arthur was superior to george and much consolation did his mother receive from this conviction young wilkinson was a very handsome lad and grew up to be a handsome man but his beauty was of that regular sort which is more pleasing in a boy than in a man he also was an excellent lad and no parent could be so thankless as to be other than proud of him all men said all good things of him so that mr wilkinson could not but be contented nevertheless one would always wish to see ones own son not less bright than ones friends son  arthur wilkinson was also sent to winchester perhaps it would have been better for the cousins that they should have gone to different schools the matter however had been left to mr wilkinson and as he thought winchester good for his own son he naturally thought the same school good for sir lionels son but bertram was entered as a commoner whereas wilkinson was in the college those who know winchester will understand that though as regarded school business and school hours they were at the same establishment they were not together at the much more important hours of eating sleeping and playing they did not cease to be friends but they did cease to live together as friends generally do live when educated at the same school  at winchester they both did fairly well but bertram did much the best he got the prizes whereas his cousin did but nearly get them he went up from class to class above the other and when the last tussle for pride of place came on at the close of their boyish career bertram was the victor he stood forth to spout out latin hexameters and to receive the golden medal while wilkinson had no other privilege but to sit still and listen to them  i believe masters but seldom recognize the agony of spirit with which boys endure being beaten in these contests boys on such subjects are very reticent they hardly understand their own feelings enough to speak of them and are too much accustomed both to ridicule and censure to look anywhere for sympathy a favourite sister may perhaps be told of the hard struggle and the bitter failure but not a word is said to any one else his father so thinks the boy is angry at his failure and even his mothers kisses will hardly be warmed by such a subject we are too apt to think that if our children eat pudding and make a noise they require no sympathy a boy may fail at school and afterwards eat much pudding and make much noise but ah how his young heart may sigh for some one to grieve with him over his failures  wilkinson was unfortunate at school it was a great object with his father that he should get a scholarship at new college to which as all the world knows his path lay through the college of winchester when his time came he was all but successfulbut he was not successful the vacancies in his year were few in number only three and of these two were preoccupied according to the then rule of the place by those heavenborn wykamists called founders kin he was only the second best on the list and lost the prize  bertram having been a commoner had had no right to think of new college but at the time when he was to be removed to oxford his uncle gave him to understand that money was a great object to him his fathers mind was still too fully absorbed in the affairs of his country to enable him to think much of his sons expenditure and his uncle at this period took a fit of disgust on the subject  very well said george i will give up oxford if i cannot do something for myself  he went up however to trinity and became a candidate for a scholarship there this he obtained to the great surprise of all the wilkinsons and of himself in those days a lad of eighteen who could get a scholarship at trinity was considered to be nearly safe in his career i do not know how far this may be altered now the uncle when he heard of his nephews success immediately allowed him what would have been amply sufficient for him had he been in possession of no income from his scholarship bertram therefore had been almost a rich man during his residence at oxford  young wilkinson though he lost new college received a small scholarship from winchester and he also was sent by his father to oxford to enable him to do this mr wilkinson was forced to make a great struggle he had five other childrenfour daughters and one younger son and it was with difficulty that he could make up the necessary allowance to carry arthur through the university but he did do so and the disappointed wykamist went up to balliol with an income amounting to about half that which his cousin enjoyed  we need not follow them very accurately through their college careers they both became prizemenone by force of intellect and the other by force of industry they both went through their little goes and other goes with sufficient zeal up to that important day on which the great go of all was to be undergone they both belonged to the same debating society at oxford and though they thought very differently on most important subjects they remained with some few temporary interruptions fast friends through their four years of oxford residence  there were periods when the balliol man was considered by his friends to run a better chance of academical success than his brighter cousin at trinity wilkinson worked hard during his three first years and bertram did not the style of mind too of the former was the more adapted to win friends at oxford in those days the tracts were new and read by everybody and what has since been called puseyism was in its robust infancy wilkinson proclaimed himself while yet little more than a boy to be an admirer of poor froude and a follower of newman bertram on the other hand was unsparing in his ridicule of the remains set himself in full opposition to the sewells and came out as a poetsuccessfully as far as the newdegate was concernedin direct opposition to keble and faber  for three years wilkinson worked hard and regularly but the éclat attending on his success somewhat injured him in his fourth year or at any rate in the earlier part of it he talked more than he read and gave way too much to the delights of societytoo much at least for one who was so poor and to whom work was so necessary he could not keep his position by dint of genius as bertram might do consequently though he was held to have taken honours in taking his degree he missed the high position at which he had aimed and on the day which enabled him to write himself bachelor of arts he was in debt to the amount of a couple of hundred pounds a sum which it was of course utterly out of his power to pay and nearly as far out of the power of his father  it had always been bertrams delight to study in such a manner that men should think he did not study there was an affectation in this perhaps not uncommon to men of genius but which was deleterious to his characteras all affectations are it was however the fact that during the last year before his examination he did study hard there was a set round him at his college among whom he was esteemed as a great mana little sect of worshippers who looked for their idol to do great things and it was a point of honour with them to assist this pretence of his they gloried in bertrams idleness told stories not quite veracious of his doings at wineparties and proved to the satisfaction of admiring freshmen that he thought of nothing but his horse and his boating he could do without study more than any other man could do with it and as for that plodding balliol hero he might look to be beaten out of the field without an effort  the balliol men had been very confident in their hero up to the last halfyear but then they began to doubt poor wilkinson was beaten by his rival out of the field though probably not without an effort we may say that no man ever gets a doublefirst in anything without an effort but be that as it may wilkinson was sitting alone a very unhappy man in his rooms at balliol while bertram was being fêted to his hearts content at trinity  it is a grievous thing to have to write home to ones father and to say that one has failed when that father has so anxiously longed for success arthur wilkinson would have been a made man for lifemade according to the making which both his father and himself at that time thought the most desirableif his name had but appeared in that firstclass list a doublefirst his father had not hoped for but in resolving not to hope for it he had consoled himself with thinking that the hopes which he did form were the more certain of successand then there would always be that further chance of happiness in store but now arthur wilkinson had to tell his father that he was neither first nor doublefirst his degree was very respectable for a man who had not looked for much for one who had not been talked of in high places but it was not respectable for wilkinson of balliol  væ victis he was indeed unhappy as he sat there alone meditating how he would frame his letter there were no telegraphs or telegrams in those days and it behoved him to write if he did not his father would be at oxford before the next night was over how should he write would it not be better to write to his mother and then what should he do or what should he say about that accursed debt  his pen and ink and paper were on the table and he had got into his chair for the purpose there he had been for some halfhour but still not a word was written and his chair had somehow got itself dragged round to the fire he was thus sitting when he heard a loud knock at his outer door  come open the door said bertrams voice i know you are there  wilkinson still sat silent he had not seen bertram since the lists had come out and he could hardly make up his mind whether he could speak to him or no  i know youre there and ill have the door down if you dont open it theres nobody with me shouted the manly voice of his triumphant friend  slowly wilkinson got up and undid the lock he tried to smile as he opened the door but the attempt was a failure however he could still speak a few words heavy as his heart was  i have to congratulate you said he to bertram and i do it with all my heart  there was very little heart in the tone in which this was spoken but then what could be expected  thankee old fellow im sure you do come wilkinson give us your hand its better to have it all out at once i wish youd had more luck and theres an end of it its all luck you know  no its not said wilkinson barely able to suppress the tears  every bit of it if a chap gets a headache or a fit of the colic its all up with him or if he happens to have been loose as to some pet point of the examiners its all up with him or if he has taken a fad into his head and had a pet point of his own its all up with him then too generally but it will never do wilkinson to boody over these things come let you and i be seen walking together youll get over it best in that way well go over to parkers and ill stand a lunch well find gerard and madden and twisleton there twisletons so disgusted at getting a fourth he says he wont take it and swears hell make them let him go out in the ruck  hes got as much as he thought hed get at any rate and therefore he cant be unhappy  unhappy whos unhappy nonsense my dear fellow shy all that to the dogs come lets go over to parkers we shall find harcourt there you know hes up dont you  no and i had rather not meet him just at present  my dear fellow you must get over that  thats all very well for you who have got nothing to get over  and have i never had anything to get over ill tell you what it is ive come here to prevent you from moping and i dont mean to leave you so you see you may as well come with me at first  with some little hesitation wilkinson made his friend understand that he had not yet written home and that he could not go out till he had done so  then ill give you ten minutes to write your letter it cant possibly take you more not even if you put into it my love to my aunt and cousins  i cannot do it while you are here  nonsense gammon you shall do it while im here ill not allow you to make yourself a miserable ass all for nothing come write if its not written in ten minutes ill write it and so saying he took up a play of aristophanes wherewith to amuse himself by way of light reading after the heavy work of the week  poor wilkinson again drew his chair to the table but his heart was very heavy væ victis     chapter ii  breakfast and lunch   wilkinson took the pen in his hand and bent himself over the paper as though he were going to write but not an inkmark fell upon the paper how should he write it the task might have been comparatively light to him but for that dreadful debt bertram in the meantime tossed over the pages of his book looking every now and then at his watch and then turning sharply round he exclaimed well  i wish youd leave me said wilkinson id rather be alone  may i be doomed to live and die a don if i do which style of life next to that of an english bishop i look on as the most contemptible in the world the queens royal beefeaters come next but that i think i could endure as their state of donothingness is not so absolute a quantity come how far have you got give me the paper and ill write you a letter in no time  thank you id rather write my own letter  thats just what i want you to do but you wont and then again he turned for two minutes to the frogs wellyou see you dont write come well both have a try at it and see wholl have done first i wonder whether my father is expecting a letter from me and so saying he seized hold of pen and paper and began to write      my dearest father     this weary affair is over at last you will be sorry to    hear that the event is not quite as well as it might have    been as far as i am concerned i had intended to be a    first and lo i am only a second if my ambition had    been confined to the second class probably i might have    come out a first i am very sorry for it chiefly for your    sake but in these days no man can count on the highest    honours as a certainty as i shall be home on tuesday i    wont say any more i cant give you any tidings about the    fellowships yet bertram has had his old luck again he    sends his love to mamma and the girls     your very affectionate son     arthur wilkinson   there scribble that off it will do just as well as anything else  poor wilkinson took the paper and having read it to see that it contained no absurdity mechanically copied the writing he merely added one phrase to say that his friends better luck consisted in his being the only doublefirst of his year and one short postscript which he took good care that bertram should not see and then he fastened his letter and sent it to the post  tell mamma not to be very unhappy that was the postscript which he added  that letter was very anxiously expected at the vicarage of hurst staple the father was prepared to be proud of his successful son and the mother who had over and over again cautioned him not to overwork himself was anxious to know that his health was good she had but little fear as to his success her fear was that he should come home thin pale and wan  just at breakfasttime the postman brought the letter and the youngest girl running out on to the gravel brought it up to her expectant father  it is from arthur said she isnt it papa im sure i know his handwriting  the vicar with a little nervousness opened it and in half a minute the mother knew that all was not right  is he ill said she do tell me at once  ill no hes not ill  well what is it he has not lost his degree  he has not been plucked papa has he said sophia  oh no he has got his degreea second in classicsthats all and he threw the letter over to his wife as he went on buttering his toast  hell be home on tuesday said mary the eldest girl looking over her mothers shoulder  and so george is a doublefirst said mrs wilkinson  yes said the vicar with his mouth full of toast not evincing any great satisfaction at the success of his late pupil  when the mother read the short postscript her heart was touched and she put her handkerchief up to her face  poor arthur i am sure it has not been his own fault  mamma has george done better than arthur said one of the younger girls george always does do better i think doesnt he  he has made himself too sure of it said the father in almost an angry tone not that he was angry he was vexed rather as he would be if his wheat crop failed or his potatoes did not come up properly  but he felt no sympathy with his son it never occurred to him to think of the agony with which those few lines had been written of the wretchedness of the young heart which had hoped so much and failed so greatly of the misery which the son felt in disappointing the father he was a good kind parent who spent his long days and longer nights in thinking of his family and their welfare he would too have greatly triumphed in the triumph of his son but it went beyond his power of heart to sympathize with him in his misery  do not seem to be vexed with him when he comes home said the mother  vexed with him you mean angry of course im not angry he has done his best i suppose its unlucky thats all  and then the breakfast was continued in silence  i dont know what hes to do said the father after awhile hell have to take a curacy i suppose  i thought he meant to stop up at oxford and take pupils said mary  i dont know that he can get pupils now besides hell not have a fellowship to help him  wont he get a fellowship at all papa  very probably not i should think and then the family finished their meal in silence  it certainly is not pleasant to have ones hopes disappointed but mr wilkinson was hardly just in allowing himself to be so extremely put about by his sons failure in getting the highest honours did he remember what other fathers feel when their sons are plucked or did he reflect that arthur had at any rate done much better than nineteen out of every twenty young men that go up to oxford but then mr wilkinson had a double cause for grief had george bertram failed also he might perhaps have borne it better  as soon as the letter had been written and made up wilkinson suffered himself to be led out of the room  and now for parkers said bertram you will be glad to see harcourt  indeed i shall not harcourts all very well but just at present i would much rather see nobody  well then hell be glad to see you and that will be quite the same thing come along  mr harcourt was a young barrister but lately called to the bar who had been at oxford spending his last year when bertram and wilkinson were freshmen and having been at bertrams college he had been intimate with both of them he was now beginning to practise and men said that he was to rise in the world in london he was still a very young man but at oxford he was held to be one who from his three years life in town had become well versed in the worlds ways he was much in the habit of coming to oxford and when there usually spent a good deal of his time with george bertram  and so wilkinson walked forth into the street arm and arm with his cousin it was a grievous trial to him but he had a feeling within him that the sooner the sorrow was encountered the sooner it would be over they turned into the high street and as they went they met crowds of men who knew them both of course it was to be expected that bertrams friends should congratulate him but this was not the worst some of them were so ill advised as to condole with wilkinson  get it over at once whispered bertram to him and then it will be over now and for ever  and then they arrived at parkers and there found all those whom bertram had named and many others mr parker was it is believed a pastrycook by trade but he very commonly dabbled in more piquant luxuries than jam tarts or bath buns men who knew what was what and who were willing to payor to promise to payfor their knowledge were in the habit of breakfasting there and lunching now a breakfast or a lunch at parkers generally meant champagne  harcourt was seated on the table when they got into the back room and the other men were standing      sound the timbrels beat the drums     see the conquring hero comes   he sung out as bertram entered the room make way for the doublefirstthe hero of the age gentlemen i am told that they mean to put up an alabaster statue to him in the common room at trinity however i will vote for nothing more expensive than marble  make it in piecrust said bertram and let parker be the artist  yes and well celebrate the installation with champagne and paté de foie gras said twisleton  and afterwards devour the object of our idolatry to show how shortlived is the fame for which we work so hard said madden  i should be delighted at such tokens of your regard gentlemen harcourt you havent seen wilkinson  harcourt turned round and shook hands warmly with his other friend upon my word i did not see you master wilkinson you have such a habit of hiding yourself under a bushel that one always misses you well so the great day is over and the great deed done its a bore out of the way trampled under foot and got rid of thats my idea of a degree  wilkinson merely smiled but harcourt saw at once that he was a deeplydisappointed man the barrister however was too much a man of the world either to congratulate him or condole with him  there are fewer firsts this year than there have been for the last nine years said gerard thinking to soften the asperity of wilkinsons position  that may be because the examiners required more or because the men had less to give said madden forgetting all about wilkinson  why what noodles you are said bertram not to know that its all settled by chance at roulette the night before the lists come down if its not it ought to be the average result would be just as fair come harcourt i know that you with your temple experiences wont drink oxford wine but your good nature will condescend to see the children feeding wilkinson sit opposite there and give twisleton some of that pie that he was talking of and so they sat down to their banquet and harcourt in spite of the refinement which london had doubtless given to his taste seemed perfectly able to appreciate the flavour of the university vintage  gentlemen silence for one moment said harcourt when the graver work of eating began to lull and men torpidly peeled their pears and then cut them up into shapes instead of eating them it is always said at all the breakfasts i go to  this is not a breakfast said bertram its a lunch  well all the lunches then and god bless you its always said at these matutinal mealswhich bytheby would be the nicest things in the world only one doesnt know what on earth to do when theyre over  its time to go to dinner then said twisleton  that may do for the dura ilia of a freshman but now that youre a ba youll find that that power fails you greatly but for heavens sake let me go on with my speech or youll not get away either to dinner or to supper it is commonly declared i say that there should be no speaking at these delicious little morning repasts  do you call that a little repast said madden who was lying back in his chair with a cigar in his mouth of which he hardly had strength enough left to puff out the smoke  i mean no offence to the feed which of its kind has been only too good if im to be allowed to go on ill say that this rule which is always laid down is always broken and therefore i feel no hesitation in breaking it on this occasion a long speech is a long bore and a little speech is a little bore but bores must be endured we cant do very well without them now my bore shall be a very short bore if im allowed to make an end of it without interruption  all right harcourt said bertram go ahead were only too delighted to hear you it isnt every day we have a london barrister here  no and it isnt every day that we have a doublefirst at old trinity gentlemen there are i think five six trinity men here including myself it will be a point of honour with you to drink health and prosperity to our friend bertram with all the honours we have many men of whom we can boast at trinity but if i have any insight into character any power of judging what a man will doit must be remembered that mr harcourt though a very young man in london was by no means a young man at oxfordthere have been very few before him who have achieved a higher place than will fall to his lot or whose name will be more in mens mouths than his there are also here four gentlemen of other colleges they will not i am sure begrudge us our triumph they are his old friends and will be as proud of the oxford man as we are of the trinity man gentlemen here is prosperity to our friend the doublefirst and health to enjoy the fruits of his labour  whereupon the toast was drunk with a great deal of fervour it was astonishing that ten men should make so much uproar even wilkinson whose heart the wine had just touched sufficiently to raise it a little from the depth to which it had falleneven he cheered and madden overcoming by degrees his not unnatural repugnance to rise produced from certain vast depths a doublebass hurrah  bertram said he when the voices and glasses were once more silent youre a credit to your college and ive a regard for you so i dont mind running the risk for once but i must beg that i may not be asked to repeat it  bertram of course returned thanks to his guests with all the mawkish modesty which usually marks such speechesor rather with modesty which would be mawkish were it not so completely a matter of course and then he sat down and then with a face rather heightened in colour he got upon his legs again  in spite of maddens difficulty of utterance said he and his very visible disinclination to move  im not going to do any more shouting said madden even though you propose the health of the chancellor vicechancellor and two members  not even though he throws the proctors into the bargain said twisleton  you may shout or not as you like but at the risk of giving some temporary pain to as good a friend as i have in the world i will ask you to drink the health of one whom on this occasion fortune has not favouredi mean my cousin arthur wilkinson the lists as they come down are i dare say made out with tolerable fairness it is not at any rate for me to grumble at them but of this i am quite sure that did there exist some infallible test for finding out the best man no mans name in this year would have been placed before his he is not so jovial as the rest of us now because he has partly failed but the time will come when he will not fail and then arthur wilkinsons health was toasted with a somewhat bated enthusiasm but still with sufficient éclat to make every glass in mr parkers house ring on its shelf  poor wilkinsons ears tingled when he heard his name pronounced and he would at the moment have given anything to be allowed to be quiet but it may be doubted whether he would not have been more hurt had he been left there without any notice it is very hard to tune oneself aright to a disappointed man ill break the ice for him at any rate said bertram to himself when hes used to talk about it he will suffer less  wilkinson had been accounted a good hand at speaking in the debating society and though rather more prolix than bertram and not quite so vivacious had been considered almost more than a match for his cousin on account of his superior erudition and more practised delivery but now his voluble gift of words deserted him he was much obliged to them he said though perhaps on the whole it was better that men who placed themselves in a mediocre condition should be left to their mediocrity he had no doubt himself of the justness of the lists it would be useless for him to say that he had not aspired all the worldit was all the world to himknew too well that he had aspired but he had received a lesson which might probably be useful to him for the rest of his life as for failing or not failing that depended on the hopes which a man might form for himself he trusted that his would henceforth be so moderate in their nature as to admit of a probability of their being realized having uttered these very lugubrious words and almost succeeded in throwing a wet blanket over the party he sat down  now youre not going to do anybody else are you said madden  only twisleton and gerard and hopgood answered bertram and fortescue looks as if he expected it perhaps however hell let us off till the day after tomorrow  and then with a round of milk punch another cigar apiece and a little more chat the party broke up  bertram and harcourt remained together and bertram endeavoured to induce wilkinson to stay with them he however wished to be alone and got home to his college by himself  you always overrated that man said harcourt  i think not but time will show after all a good degree is not everything in the world who in london cares about senior wranglers and doublefirsts when all is done i dont see the use of it  nobody cares much about wranglers and doublefirsts but these are the men nevertheless who get the best of whats going wood that will swim in one water will swim in all waters  youll find wilkinson will swim yet  that is he wont sink i dont say he will ninetenths of the men in the world neither swim nor sink they just go along with their bows above the wave but dreadfully waterlogged barely able to carry the burdens thrown on them but yet not absolutely sinking fighting a hard fight for little more than mere bread and forgetting all other desires in their great desire to get that when such a man does get bread he cant be said to sink  ah wilkinson will do more than that  something more or something less as the case may be but believe me he is not the man to make other men fall before him industry alone never does that and certainly not that sort of industry which breaks down once in every six months but come mr parkers champagne makes my head buzz let us take a walk up the river twisletons idea of going to dinner requires far too much pluck for me  and so they walked out along the towingpath discussing many things of much importance to them      there is a tide in the affairs of men     which taken at the flood leads on to fortune   in nine cases out of ten this floodtide comes but once in life and then in early years a man may have a second or a third chance for decent maintenance but hardly a second chance for fortunes brighter favours the horse that is to win the race needs not make all his best running at once but he that starts badly will rarely do so when a young man discusses what shall be his future walk in life he is talking of all that concerns his success as far as this world is concerned and it is so hard for a youth to know to make even a fair guess as to what his own capacities are the right man is wanted in the right place but how is a lad of two and twenty to surmise what place will be right for him and yet if he surmises wrong he fails in taking his tide at its single flood how many lawyers are there who should have been soldiers how many clergymen who should have been lawyers how many unsuccessful doctors who might have done well on change or in capel court  bertram had an inkling of this and harcourt had more than an inkling his path in life was chosen and he had much selfconfidence that he had chosen it well he had never doubted much and since he had once determined had never doubted at all he had worked hard and was prepared to work hard not trusting over much in his own talents but trusting greatly in his own industry but bertram with double his friends genius had at any rate as yet but little of his friends stability to him the world was all before him where to choose but he was sadly in want of something that should guide his choice he had a high but at the same time a vague ambition the law the church letters art and politics all enticed him but he could not decide of which mistress the blandishments were the sweetest  well when shall we have you up in london said harcourt  in london i dont know that i shall go to london i shall go down to hadley for a few weeks of coursebertrams uncle lived at the village of that name in the close vicinity of barnetbut what i shall do then i dont in the least know  but i know youll come to london and begin to keep your terms  what at the middle temple  at some temple or some inn of course you wont go where anybody else goes so probably it will be grays inn  no i shall probably do a much more commonplace thing come back here and take orders  take orders you you can no more swallow the thirtynine articles than i can eat twisletons dinner  a man never knows what he can do till he tries a great deal of good may be done by a clergyman if he be in earnest and not too much wedded to the church of england i should have no doubt about it if the voluntary principle were in vogue  a voluntary fiddlestick  well even a voluntary fiddlestickif it be voluntary and well used  of course youll be a barrister it is what you are cut out for and what you always intended  it is the most alluring trade going i ownbut then they are all such rogues of course you will be an exception  i shall do at rome as romans doi hope always my doctrine is that we have no immutable law of right and wrong  a very comfortable code i wish i could share it  well you will some of these days indeed you do now practically but the subject is too long to talk of here but as i know you wont go into the church i expect to see you settled in london before christmas  what am i to live on my dear fellow  like all good nephews live on your uncle besides you will have your fellowship live on that as i do  you have more than your fellowship and as for my uncle to tell you the truth i have no fancy for living on him i am not quite sure that he doesnt mean me to think that its charity however i shall have the matter out with him now  have the matter out with himand charity what an ass you are an uncle is just the same as a father  my uncle is not the same to me as my father  no and by all accounts its lucky for you that he is not stick to your uncle my dear fellow and come up to london the ball will be at your foot  did you ever read marryats novel harcourt  what peter simple  no that other one i think of going out as another japhet in search of a father i have a great anxiety to know what mines like its fourteen years now since i saw him  he is at teheran isnt he  at hong kong i think just at present but i might probably catch him at panama he has something to do with the isthmus there  you wouldnt have half the chance that japhet had and would only lose a great deal of time besides if you talk of means that would want money  they were now walking back towards oxford and had been talking about fifty indifferent subjects when bertram again began  after all theres only one decent career for a man in england  and what is the one decent career  politics and parliament its all very well belonging to a free nation and ruling oneself if one can be one of the rulers otherwise as far as i can see a man will suffer less from the stings of pride under an absolute monarch there only one man has beaten you in life here some seven hundred and fifty do sonot to talk of the peers  yes but then a fellow has some chance of being one of the seven hundred and fifty  i shall go in for that i think only who the deuce will return me how does a man begin shall i send my compliments to the electors of marylebone and tell them that i am a very clever fellow  exactly only do something first to show that you are so i mean also to look to that but i shall be well contented if i find myself in the house in twenty years timeor perhaps in thirty  ah you mean as a lawyer  how else should a man without property get into parliament  thats just what i want to know but i have no idea harcourt of waiting twenty years before i make my start in life a man at any rate may write a book without any electors  yes but not have it read the author who does any good must be elected by suffrages at least as honestly obtained as those of a member of parliament     chapter iii  the new vicar   poor arthur wilkinson was in a very unhappy frame of mind when he left the party at parkers and indeed as he went to bed that night he was in a state not to be envied but nevertheless when the end of the week came he was able to enter the parsonage with a cheerful step and to receive his mothers embrace with a smiling face god is good to us and heals those wounds with a rapidity which seems to us impossible when we look forward but which is regarded with very insufficient wonder when we look backward  before he left oxford he had seen the head of his college and the tutor and had also felt himself bound to visit the tradesmen in whose black books he was written down as a debtor none of these august persons made themselves so dreadful to him as he had expected the master indeed was more than civilwas almost paternally kind and gave him all manner of hope which came as balm poured into his sick heart though he had failed his reputation and known acquirements would undoubtedly get him pupils and then if he resided he might probably even yet have a college fellowship though no doubt not quite immediately the master advised him to take orders and to remain within the college as long as the rules permitted if he should get his fellowship they would all be delighted to have him as one of their body there couldso thought the masterbe no doubt that he might in the meantime maintain himself at the university by his pupils the tutor was perhaps not quite so encouraging he was a working man himself and of a harder temperament than his head he thought that wilkinson should have got a first that he had owed it to his college to do so and that having failed to pay his debt he should not be received with open armsat any rate just at first he was therefore cool but not generous yes i am sorry too it is a pity was all he said when wilkinson expressed his own grief but even this was not so bad as arthur had expected and on the whole he left his college with a lightened heart  nor were his creditors very obdurate they did not smile so sweetly on him as they would have done had his name been bruited down the high street as that of a successful university pet had such been his condition they would have begged him not to distress their ears by anything so unnecessarily mundane as the mention of his very small account all that they would have wanted of him would have been the continuation of his favours as it was they were very civil six months would do very well oh he could not quite undertake to pay it in six months but would certainly do so by instalments in two years two years was a long time certainly would not mr wilkinson senior prefer some quicker arrangement oh mr wilkinson senior could do nothing ah that was unfortunate and so the arrangement for two yearswith interest of coursewas accepted and thus mr wilkinson junior began the swimmingmatch of life as so many others do with a slight millstone round his neck well it may be questioned whether even that is not better than an airpuffed swimmingbelt  when he got home his mother and sisters hung about him as they always had done and protected him in some measure from the cold serenity of the vicar to his father he said little on the subject and his father said as little to him they talked indeed by the hour as to the future and arthur in spite of his having resolved not to do so told the whole story of his debts and of his arrangement for their payment  perhaps i could do something in the spring said mr wilkinson  indeed father you shall do nothing said the son i had enough and should have lived on it as i did not i must live the closer now and so that matter was settled  in a very few days arthur found himself going into society with quite a gay heart his sisters laughed at him because he would not dance but he had now made up his mind for the church and it would he thought be well for him to begin to look to those amusements which would be befitting his future sacerdotal life he practised singing therefore fasted on fridays and learnt to make chessmen with a lathe  but though his sisters laughed at him adela gauntlet the daughter of the neighbouring vicar at west putford did not laugh she so far approved that by degrees she almost gave over dancing herself waltzes and polkas she utterly abandoned and though she did occasionally stand up for a quadrille she did it in a very lackadaisical way as though she would have refused that also had she dared to make herself so peculiar and thus on the whole arthur wilkinson enjoyed himself that winter in spite of his blighted prospects almost as well as he had on any previous winter that he remembered  now and again as he walked along the little river bank that ran with so many turnings from hurst staple down to west putford he would think of his past hopes and lament that he could talk of them to no one his father was very good to him but he was too cold for sympathy his mother was all affection and kindly suggested that perhaps what had happened was for the best she kindly suggested this more than once but her imagination carried her no further had she not four daughters hitherto without husbands and also alas without portions was it not enough for her to sympathize with them as for his sistershis sisters were well enoughexcellent girls but they were so gay so lighthearted so full of fun and laughter that he could not talk to them of his sorrows they were never pensive nor given to that sober sadness which is prone to sympathy if indeed adela gauntlet had been his sister and so he walked along the river to west putford  he had now fully made up his mind to go into the church while yet thinking of high academical honours and the brighter paths of ambition he also had dreamed of the bar all young men i believe do who have high abilities a taste for labour and scanty fortune senior wranglers and doublefirsts when not possessed of means for political life usually find their way to the bar it is on the bench of judges not on the bench of bishops that we must look for them in after life arthur therefore had thought of the joys of a chancery wig and had looked forward eagerly to fourteen hours daily labour in the purlieus of lincolns inn but when like many another he found himself disappointed in his earliest hopes he consoled himself by thinking that after all the church was the safer haven and when he walked down to west putford there was one there who told him that it was so  but we cannot follow him too closely in these early days he did go into the church he did take pupils at oxford and went abroad with two of them in the long vacation after the lapse of the year he did get his fellowship and had by that time with great exertion paid half of that moiety of his debt which he had promised to liquidate this lapse in his purposed performance sat heavy on his clerical conscience but now that he had his fellowship he would do better  and so somewhat more than a year passed away during which he was but little at hurst staple and very little at west putford but still he remembered the sweetlypensive brow that had suited so well with his own feelings and ever and again he heard from one of the girls at home that that little fool adela gauntlet was as bad as a parson herself and that now she had gone so far that nothing would induce her to dance at all  so matters stood when young wilkinson received at oxford a letter desiring his instant presence at home his father had been stricken by paralysis and the house was in despair he rushed off of course and arrived only in time to see his father alive within twentyfour hours after his return he found himself the head of a wailing family of whom it would be difficult to say whether their wants or their griefs were most heartrending mr wilkinsons life had been insured for six hundred pounds and that with one hundred a year which had been settled on the widow was now the sole means left for the maintenance of her and her five childrenthe sole means excepting such aid as arthur might give  let us thank god that i have got the fellowship said he to his mother it is not much but it will keep us from starving  but it was not destined that the wilkinsons should be reduced even to such poverty as this the vicarage of hurst staple was in the gift of the noble family of stapledean the late vicar had been first tutor and then chaplain to the marquis and the vicarage had been conferred on him by his patron in late years none of the wilkinsons had seen anything of the stapledean family the marquis though not an old man was reported to be very eccentric and very cross though he had a beautiful seat in the neighbourhoodnot in the parish of hurst staple but in that of deans staple which adjoins and which was chiefly his propertyhe never came to it but lived at a much less inviting mansion in the north of yorkshire here he was said to reside quite alone having been separated from his wife whereas his children had separated themselves from him his daughters were married and his son lord stanmore might more probably be found under any roof in the country than that of his father  the living had now to be given away by the marquis and the wilkinson family who of late years had had no communication with him did not even think of thinking of it but a fortnight after the funeral arthur received a letter with the postmark of bowes on it which on being opened was found to be from lord stapledean and which very curtly requested his attendance at bowes lodge now bowes lodge was some three hundred miles from hurst staple and a journey thither at the present moment would be both expensive and troublesome but marquises are usually obeyed especially when they have livings to give away and when their orders are given to young clergymen so arthur wilkinson went off to the north of england it was the middle of march and the east wind was blowing bitterly but at twentyfour the east wind does not penetrate deep the trachea is all but invulnerable and the left shoulder knows no twinges  arthur arrived at the cold cheerless village of bowes with a red nose but with eager hopes he found a little inn there but he hardly knew whether to leave his bag or no lord stapledean had said nothing of entertaining him at the lodgehad only begged him if it were not too much trouble to do him the honour of calling on him he living on the northern borders of westmoreland had asked a man in hampshire to call on him as though their houses were in adjacent streets but he had said nothing about a dinner a bed or given any of those comfortable hints which seem to betoken hospitality  it will do no harm if i put my bag into the gig said arthur and so having wisely provided for contingencies he started for bowes lodge  wisely as regarded probabilities but quite uselessly as regarded the event hardy as he was that drive in the gig from bowes did affect him unpleasantly that appleby road has few sheltered spots and when about three miles from bowes he turned off to the right the country did not improve bowes lodge he found to be six miles from the village and when he drove in at the gate he was colder than he had been since he left hurst staple  there was very little that was attractive about the house or grounds they were dark and sombre and dull and dingy the trees were all stunted and the house of which half the windows were closed was green with the effects of damp it was large enough for the residence of a nobleman of moderate pretensions but it had about it none of that spruce clean wellcaredfor appearance which is common to the countryhouses of the wealthy in england  when he descended from the gig he thought that he might as well leave his bag there the sombrelooking servant in black clothes who opened the door made no inquiry on the subject and therefore he merely told his jehu to drive into the yard and wait for further orders  his lordship was at home said the sombre dingy servant and in half a minute arthur found himself in the marquiss study and in the marquiss presence with his nose all red and moist his feet in an agony of cold his fingers benumbed and his teeth chattering he was barely allowed time to take off his greatcoat and as he did so he felt almost disinclined to part with so good a friend  how do you do mr wilkinson said the marquis rising from his chair behind the study table and putting out the ends of his fingers so as to touch the young clergymans hand pray take a seat and arthur seated himselfas indeed he had no alternativeon a straightbacked old horsehairbottomed chair which stood immediately under a tall black bookcase he was miles asunder from the fire and had he been nearer to it it would have availed him but little for the grate was one of those which our grandfathers cleverly invented for transmitting all the heat up the chimney  the marquis was tall thin and grayhaired he was in fact about fifty but he looked to be at least fifteen years older it was evident from his face that he was a discontented moody unhappy man he was one who had not used the world over well but who was quite selfassured that the world had used him shamefully he was not without good instincts and had been just and honest in his dealingsexcept in those with his wife and children but he believed in the justness and honesty of no one else and regarded all men as his enemiesespecially those of his own flesh and blood for the last ten years he had shut himself up and rarely appeared in the world unless to make some statement generally personal to himself in the house of lords or to proffer in a plaintive whine to his brother peers some complaint as to his neighbour magistrates to which no one cared to listen and which in latter years the newspapers had declined to publish  arthur who had always heard of the marquis as his fathers old pupil was astonished to see before him a man so aged his father had been only fiftyfive when he died and had appeared to be a hale strong man the marquis seemed to be worn out with care and years and to be one whose death might be yearly expected his father however was gone but the marquis was destined to undergo yet many more days of misery  i was very sorry to hear of your fathers sudden death said lord stapledean in his cold thin voice  it was very sudden my lord said arthur shuddering  ahyes he was not a prudent manalways too fond of strong wine  he was always a temperate man said the son rather disgusted  that is he never got drunk i dare say not as a parish clergyman it was not likely that he should but he was an imprudent man in his manner of livingvery  arthur remained silent thinking it better to say nothing further on the subject  i suppose he has not left his family well provided for  not very well my lord there is somethingand i have a fellowship  something said the marquis with almost a sneer how much is this something whereupon arthur told his lordship exactly the extent of his mothers means  ah i thought as much that is beggary you know your father was a very imprudent man and you have a fellowship i thought you broke down in your degree whereupon arthur again had to explain the facts of the case  well well well now mr wilkinson you must be aware that your family have not the slightest claim upon me  your lordship is also aware that we have made none  of course you have not it would have been very improper on your part or on your mothers had you done sovery people make claims upon me who have been my enemies through life who have injured me to the utmost of their power who have never ceased striving to make me wretched yes these very people make claims on me herehere is a clergyman asking for this living because he is a friend of lord stanmorebecause he went up the pyramids with him and encouraged him in all manner of stupidity id soonerwell never mind i shant trouble myself to answer this letter now as it happened that lord stanmore was a promising young nobleman already much thought of in parliament and as the clergyman alluded to was known by arthur to be a gentleman very highly reputed he considered it best to hold his tongue  no one has a claim on me i allow no one to have such claims what i want i pay for and am indebted for nothing but i must put some one into this living  yes your lordship must of course nominate some one wilkinson said so much as the marquis had stopped expecting an answer  i can only say this if the clergymen in hampshire do their duty as badly as they do here the parish would be better off without a parson  i think my father did his duty well  perhaps so he had very little to do and as it never suited me to reside there there was never any one to look after him however i make no complaint here they are intolerableintolerable selfsufficient impertinent upstarts full of crotchets of their own and the bishop is a weak timid fool as for me i never go inside a church i cant i should be insulted if i did it has however gone so far now that i shall take permission to bring the matter before the house of lords  what could wilkinson say nothing so he sat still and tried to drive the cold out of his toes by pressing them against the floor  your father certainly ought to have made some better provision continued lord stapledean but he has not done so and it seems to me that unless something is arranged your mother and her children will starve now you are a clergyman  yes i am in orders  and can hold a living you distinctly understand that your mother has no claim on me  surely none has been put forward lord stapledean  i dont say it has but you may perhaps fancy by what i say that i myself admit that there is a claim mind i do no such thing not in the least  i quite understand what you mean  it is well that you should under these circumstances if i had the power i would put in a curate and pay over the extra proceeds of the living for your mothers maintenance but i have no such power  arthur could not but think that it was very well his lordship had no such power if patrons in general were so privileged there would be he thought but little chance for clergymen  as the law stands i cannot do that but as you are luckily in orders i can put you inon this understanding that you shall regard the income as belonging rather to your mother and to your sisters than to yourself  if your lordship shall see fit to present me to the living my mother and sisters will of course want nothing that i can give them  ahhhh my young friend but that will not be sufficient for me i must have a pledge from youyour word as a gentleman and a clergyman that you take the living on an understanding that the income is to go to your fathers widow why should i give you five hundred pounds a year eh tell me that why should i nominate a young man like you to such a living you whom i never saw in my life tell me that  arthur wilkinson was a man sufficiently meek in spirit as ordinary meekness goesthe ordinary meekness that is of a young clergyman of the church of englandbut he was not quite inclined to put up with this  i am obliged my lord to say again that i have not asked for so great a favour from you indeed till i received your letter desiring me to come here i had no other thought of the living than that of vacating the house whenever your nominee should present himself  thats all very well said lord stapledean but you must be a very unnatural son if on that account you refuse to be the means of providing for your unfortunate mother and sisters  i refuse why my lord i regard it as much my duty to keep my mother and sisters from want as my father did whether i am to have this living or no we shall live together and whatever i have will be theirs  thats all very well mr wilkinson but the question i ask you is this if i make you vicar of hurst staple will you after deducting a fair stipend for yourself as curatesay one hundred and fifty pounds a year if you willwill you make over the rest of the income to your mother as long as she lives  this was a question to which wilkinson found it very difficult to give a direct answer he hardly knew whether he would not be guilty of simony in making such a promise and he felt that at any rate the arrangement would be an improper one  if you knew said he at last the terms on which my mother and i live together you would perceive that such a promise is not needed  i shall not the less think it necessary to exact it i am putting great trust in you as it is very great trust more so perhaps than i am justified in doing his lordship here alluded merely to the disposition of the vicarial tithes and not at all to the care of souls which he was going to put into the young mans hands  arthur wilkinson again sat silent for awhile  one would think said his lordship that you would be glad to have the means of securing your mother from beggary i imagined that you would have been in some measure gratified by mymymy good intentions towards your family  so i am my lord so i am but i doubt whether i should be justified in giving such a pledge  justified you will make me almost doubt mr wilkinson whether i shall be justified in putting the living into your hands but at any rate i must have an answer  what time can you allow me to consider my answer  what time it never struck me that you could require time well you can let me have your decision tomorrow morning send it me in writing so that i may have it before ten the post goes out at twelve if i do not hear from you before ten i shall conclude that you have refused my offer and so speaking the marquis got up from his chair  arthur also got up and promised that he would send a letter over from bowes the first thing on the following morning  and tell the messenger to wait for an answer said his lordship and pray express yourself definitely so that there may be no doubt and then muttering something as to his hope that the inn was comfortable and saying that the state of his health prohibited him from entertaining visitors the marquis again put out his fingers and arthur soon found himself in the gig on his journey to bowes  he intended returning to town on the following day by the twelveoclock mail of which lord stapledean had spoken but before that he had a difficult task to perform he had no friend to consult no one of whom he could ask advice nothing to rely on but his own head and his own heart that suggestion as to simony perplexed him had he the right or could he have it to appropriate the income of the living according to terms laid down by the lay impropriator at one time he thought of calling on the old clergyman of the parish and asking him but then he remembered what the marquis had said of the neighbouring parsons and felt that he could not well consult one of them on any matter in which his lordship was concerned  in the evening he considered the matter long and painfully sitting over a cup of some exquisitely detestable concoction called tea by the bowesian landlady if he had only left me to myself thought arthur i should do at least as much as that for them it is for them that i want it as for myself i should be more comfortable at oxford and then he thought of west putford and adela gauntlet this arrangement of lord stapledeans would entirely prevent the possibility of his marrying but then the burden of his mother and sisters would prevent that equally under any circumstances  it would be a great thing for his mother to be left in her old house among her old friends in possession of her old income as regarded money they would all be sufficiently well provided for for himself his fellowship and his prescribed stipend would be more than enough but there was something in the proposition that was very distasteful to him he did not begrudge the money to his mother but he did begrudge her the right of having it from any one but himself  but yet the matter was of such vital moment where else was he to look for a living from his college in the course of years he might get one but he could get none that would be equal in value to this of hurst staple and to his fellowship combined if he should refuse it all those whom he loved would in truth suffer great privation and that privation would not be rendered more endurable by the knowledge that such an offer had been refused  thus turning the matter over painfully in his mind he resolved at last to accept the offer of the marquis the payment after all was to be made to his own mother the funds of the living were not to be alienatedwere not in truth to be appropriated otherwise than they would have been had no such conditions as these been insisted on and how would he be able to endure his mothers poverty if he should throw away on her behalf so comfortable a provision he determined therefore to accept the goods the gods had provided him clogged though they were with alloy like so many other gifts of fortune and accordingly he wrote a letter to lord stapledean in which he stated that he would accept the living subject to the stipulations namednamely the payment to his mother during her life of three hundred and fifty pounds per annum out of the tithes to this he received an answer from the marquis very short and very cold but nevertheless satisfactory  the presentation to the living was in fact made in his favour and he returned home to his family laden with good news the dear old vicarage would still be their own the trees which they had planted the flowerbeds which they had shaped the hives which they had put up would not go into the hands of strangers and more than this want no longer stared them in the face arthur was welcomed back with a thousand fond caresses as one is welcomed who bringeth glad tidings but yet his heart was sad what should he now say to adela gauntlet     chapter iv  our prima donna   when arthur first explained to his mother the terms on which the living had been given to him she refused to receive the income no such promise with reference to money matters between mother and son could be binding were they not moreover one and the same household would it not be in the end the same if arthur should keep the money himself if it were paid to her she should only pay it back again and so on but the vicar declared that he would adhere strictly to his promised engagement and the mother soon fell into the way of thinking the arrangement not altogether a bad one she had received intimation through the lords man of business of the exact steps which had been taken for the relief of her great pecuniary distressso the letter was wordedand it was not long before she regarded the income as fairly her own  we are so apt to be generous in the hot moments of impulse but so equally apt to be only coldly just even if coldly just in the long years of our ordinary existence  and so the family again settled down the commenced packings were again unpacked the preliminary arrangements for living on a very small income were thrown to the winds the pony that was to have been sold and which with that object was being fattened up on boiled barley was put on his accustomed rations the old housekeepers warning was revoked as was also that of the old gardener it was astonishing how soon the new vicar seemed to fill the old vicars shoes in the eyes and minds of the people of hurst staple had mr wilkinson come up from his grave at the end of three months he would hardly have found that he was missed a very elegant little tablet had been placed to his memory and there apparently was an end of him the widows cap did make some change in the appearance of the family circle but it is astonishing how soon we get used even to a widows cap  there had of course been visits of condolence between west putford and hurst staple and the hurst staple girls and adela had been as much or perhaps more together than usual but arthurs walks along the river had not been frequent this however was not thought of by any one he had had new duties to assume and old duties to put off he had been a fortnight up at oxford and when at home had been calling on all his parishioners he had been attending to the dilapidations of the vicarage and rearranging the books in the bookroom the dingy volumes of thirty years since had been made to give way to the new and brighter bindings which he had brought from college  and therefore no one had remarked that he had but once been at west putford but he thought of it himself he often longed to go thither and as often feared to do so when he next went it must be to tell adela not that he loved her but that such love was forbidden to him  the family at west putford consisted only of the vicar and his daughter mrs gauntlet had been long dead and there had been no other child a maiden sister of mr gauntlets occasionally visited them and had indeed lived there altogether while adelas education had required it but this lady preferred her own lodgings at littlebath and adela therefore was in general the sole mistress of the parsonage  i beg my reader not to imagine that there had been lovepassages between arthur wilkinson and adela gauntlet nothing of the sort had occurred they had known and loved each other as children together and now that they were no longer children they still knew and loved each otherthat was all it is true that arthur when he had wished to talk of his own disappointments had found a better listener at west putford than any that he could find at hurst staple it is true that adela had always been glad to listen to him that she had had pleasure in cheering his fainting heart and telling him that the work of a soldier of christ was worthier of a man than the bickerings of a statesman or the quibbles of a lawyer that she had gravely yet withal so sweetly spoken to him of the comforts of a rural life and made him almost in love with his own failure such passages there had been between them but arthur had never taken her hand and sworn that it must be his own nor had adela ever blushed while half refusing to give him all he asked  why then need he trouble himself about west putford why not let matters rest as they were miss gauntlet would still be his friend though seeing that she could never be more it might not be well for him to walk so often along that river as there had been no lovepassages one would say that nothing else was necessary  but he could not content himself that this should be so adela would think him strange if he should say nothing to her of his future prospects true he had spoken no word of love but had he not looked at her as though it was in his mind to speak such was it not incumbent on him to make her understand why he threw from him such golden hopes and then as to her he did not flatter himself that she loved himat least not much but yet it might be well to let her know that she was now at liberty to love any other swain so at last he once more went his way to west putford  adela gauntlet was no for once i will venture to have a heroine without describing her let each reader make what he will of her fancy her of any outward shape and colour that he please and endow her with any amount of divine beauty but for her inner character let him take that from me as i go on if so be that i can succeed in making clear to others that which is clear enough to my own minds eye i have called her a heroine it is the novelists customary name for his prima donna and so i use it but many opera companies have more than one prima donna there is the donna prima and if one may so say the donna primissima now adela guantlet is no more than my donna prima my donna primissima will be another guess sort of lady altogether  arthur as he walked along communed with himself as to what he was going to say at any rate she shall know it all we shall be more comfortable when we meet afterwards not that it will make any difference to her and then he sighed deeply and cut at the river rushes with his walkingstick  he found her as usual alone in the drawingroom and as usual she smiled sweetly when she saw him since the day on which he had first gone up to oxford she had always called him mr wilkinsonso instructed by aunt penelope but in other respects her manner to him was almost that of a sister only that it was softer and more gracious  i declare i thought we were never to see you again mr wilkinson ah adela whom did the we mean but is it possible that any girl should live fairly before the world without some little insincerities  i have been so occupied adela there is so much to do in taking up a parish even though i know all the people so well there has been so much to do  yes yes i am sure of it but now that you are settled i do so hope that you will be comfortable i saw mary the other day and she told me that your mother was quite well again  yes she is pretty well we are all very well now i think  i do so love that old lord for giving you the living though they say he is such a turk it was such a good thing in him to do so considerate to everybody  yes it has made my mother and the girls comfortable that of course is what i had first to think of  as for yourself i have no doubt you would have done better at oxford but you could have got no home for them like their old home could you  no of course not said arthur answering almost at random and thinking how best he might explain the sacrifice which he had made without taking too much credit to himself  and then if you had remained up there you would only have become a musty old don i dont think you would have been happy not so happy as in a parish and when a man is a clergymanthis she said in a lower and somewhat a solemn voicesurely he cannot be so well placed as in charge of a parish dont you think so mr wilkinson  certainly it is the life for which he is intended for which he should have intended himself  and i am sure it is a happy life look at papa i do not know any happier manonly that poor mamma died  and upon this hint he spake yes your father i am sure has been a happy man and he is an excellent clergyman  is he not even still so active and he is so glad now to have you near him  i wish i had received my living as he did his not that it would make any real difference  he got his you know from the bishop but do you dislike being lord stapledeans nominee  it would be ungrateful to say that but i certainly do not like lord stapledean however i have taken his living and should not complain  i did not know that there was anything disagreeable  there is this adela i had rather tell you and i came over today in part to do so but you will see that the matter is one that should not be talked about and he looked down on the floor poking about on the carpet pattern with his stick being unable any longer to meet the clear gaze of her soft eye  oh i am sorry if there is anything to distress you  not exactly to distress me perhaps but i will tell you when the marquis offered me the living he did it on the stipulation that i should pay over to my mother three hundred and fifty pounds a year during her life i doubt whether it was right to accept it on these conditions but i did so the living therefore is rather hers than mine  oh arthur how good of you in spite of all aunt penelopes lessons old habits would sometimes get the better of her  i dont know i am afraid that it was not good  why i cant understand surely it must be good to give up your time your labour your hopesadela did not say his heartfor your mother and sisters good why how can it be else than good i think it good and shall think so  at any rate adela i could not withstand the offer when it was made to me  i am sure you could not  so i am little more than a curate in the parish as far as the income is concerned with this difference that i cant change my curacy for a living should a chance offer  adela had never before known him to be solicitous about money for himself and now she felt that she did not understand him but you have got your fellowship said she  yes i have got my fellowship oh as far as that is concerned i am better off than i could ever have expected to be but nevertheless one feelsfeels crippled by such an arrangement it is quite impossible you know for instance thatthatthat i should do a great many things his courage failed him as he was about to make the fatal announcement  what things said adela with all the boldness of innocence  it was necessary that he should say it why for instance he continued it is quite impossible though perhaps that does not make much matter but it is quite impossiblethat i should ever marry and still looking down upon the ground he poked sedulously among the patterns with his stick  oh said adela with a tremour in her voice and her eye was no longer able to rest upon his face  there was a pause during which neither of them said a word or saw each other as far as adela was concerned immediate speech was impossible she neither cried nor sighed nor sobbed nor became hysterical she was simply dumb she could not answer this little announcement of her neighbours heretofore when he had come to her with his sorrows she had sympathized with him and poured balm into his wounds but she had no balm for him nowand no sympathy there they sat mute he poking the while at the carpet while she did not even move a limb  and then it gradually came home to both of them that this utter silence this prostration of all power of selfmanagement told to each the secret of the other each felt that every moment of prolonged silence committed both of them the deeper why should not adela be able to speak when thus informed of her neighbours intended celibacy why should he sit like a fool before her merely because he had told her that on which he had long decided  but it was clearly wilkinsons duty to have disembarrassed the lady as soon as possible it was almost unmanly in him to be put thus beyond the power of speech or action but still he poked the carpet and said nothing it was adela who first broke that telltale silence and grievous was the effort which it cost her to do so  but you will have your mother and sisters with you mr wilkinson and so perhaps you wont mind that  yes i shall have them said he and then there was another silence which seemed about to be equally dangerous and equally difficult but adela who was fully aware of the error which she had already committed strove hard to save herself from repeating it  you will have a family round you and if as you saybut the ground that she approached was so hot that she could not walk on it she could not get further in that direction and therefore merely added i am sure i hope you will always be happy  at length arthur shook himself positively shook himself as though that were the only mode by which he could collect his faculties and then getting up from his chair and standing with his back against the wall he spoke out as follows  perhaps adela there was no necessity for me to have mentioned this subject at least i am sure there was no necessity but you have ever been such a friend to me have so understood my feelings when no one else seemed to do so that i could not but tell you this as i have told you everything else i hope i have not annoyed you by doing so  oh no not at all  it does make me a little sad to think that i shall never be my own master  never mr wilkinson had arthur but known it there was balm there was sympathy in this word had his intellect been as sharp as his feelings he would have known it but it passed him unperceived as it had fallen from her unawares and she said no other word that could encourage him if he was cold she at least would be equally so  certainly not during my mothers life and you know how good ground we have for hoping that her life will be long and then there are my sisters my duty to them will be the same as to my mother even though as regards them i may not be tied down as i am with regard to her  we cannot have everything here said adela trying to smile but i am sure i need not teach you that  no we cannot have everything and arthur thought that in spite of the clerical austerity which he was about to assume he should very much like to have adela gauntlet  it will make you happy to know that you are making your mother happy and the dear girlsandand i have no doubt you will very soon get used to it many clergymen you know think that they ought not to marry  yes but i never made up my mind to that  no perhaps not but now perhaps you will think of it more seriously  indeed i used to have an idea that a parish clergyman should be a married man there are so many things which he can do better when he has a woman to assist him who thinks exactly as he thinks  you will have your sisters you know both mary and sophia were always active in the parish and jane and fanny have their school  yes and he uttered a gentle sigh as he paused before he answered her but it is not quite the same thing adela i love my sisters dearly but one always longs to have one heart that shall be entirely ones own  and had he come over to tell her this in the same breath with which he informed her that marriage was a privilege quite beyond his reach what did he think of her or of what did he imagine that she was made there was cruelty in it of which adela became immediately conscious and which she could hardly help wishing to resent he had performed the object of his visit why did he not leave her he had made himself thoroughly understood why did he not go his former many sweet visits had created hopes which were all but certain he had said nothing of love but coming there as he had come and gazing at her as he had gazed adela could not doubt but that she was loved that was all now set at rest but why should he remain there breaking her heart with allusions to his own past tenderness  you must put up with the world as you find it mr wilkinson  oh yes of course but when one has had such happy dreams the waking reality you know does make one sad  you are too happy in your friends and your position to be an object of pity how many clergymen are there of your age who would look upon your lot as almost beyond their ambition how many men are there with mothers and sisters for whom they cannot provide how many who have made rash marriages which have led to no happiness surely mr wilkinson with you there is more cause for thankfulness than for complaint and thus as it was necessary that she should say something she moralized to himvery wisely  it is all true said he and perhaps it is for the best i might probably have been made more wretched in another way  yes very likely oh adela adela  i begin to know that a man should not be sanguine i have always hoped for more than i have had a right to expect and therefore i have always been disappointed it was so at school and at oxford and it is so now it shows how true it is that a man should not look for his happiness here well goodbye adela i see that you think i am wrong to have any regrets  useless regrets are always foolish we laugh at children who cry for what is quite out of their reach  yes and you laugh at me i dare say you are right  no do not say that mr wilkinson i have never laughed at you but she did not wish to be actually unkind to him though he had been so cruel to her  at last he went they shook hands with each other in their accustomed manner but wilkinson felt that he missed something from her touch some warmth from the soft pressure some scintillation of sympathy which such last moments of his visits had usually communicated to him yes there was much to miss  as he went back along the river his heart was sad within him he had made up his mind to give up adela gauntlet but he had not made up his mind to discover that she did not care for himthat she was indifferent to his happiness and unable to sympathize with his feelings the fact was that though he had resolved that duty and his circumstances required him to remain single nevertheless he had at the bottom of his heart a sort of wish that adela should be in love with him he had his wish but he was not sharp enough to discover that he had it i never thought her unfeeling before said he to himself but all the world is alike well as it is it does not signify but it might have been that i should have half broken my heart to find her so unfeelingmore cause for thankfulness than complaint yes that is true of us all but it was unfriendly nay unfeminine in her to say so when she must have known how much i was giving up and so he walked on complaining understanding perhaps accurately the wants of his own heart but being quite in the dark as to the wants of that other heart  but his grief his discontent was mild in comparison with hers she shook hands with him when he went and endeavoured to say her last word of farewell in her usual tone nay for a few minutes after his departure she retained her seat calmly fearing that he possibly might return but then when the door had closed on him and she had seen him from her window passing across the lawn then her spirits gave way and bitterly she made her moan  what was this that he had said to her he would not marry because he had his mother and sisters to support would not she have helped to support them would not she have thrown in her lot with his for better or for worse let that lot have been ever so poor and could it be possible that he had not known thishad not read her heart as she had read his could it be that he had come there day after day looking to her for love and sympathy and kindnessthat sort of kindness which a man demands from no one but her he loves and which no one can give him unless she loves him could it be that he had done this and then thought that it all meant nothing that the interchange of such feelings had no further signification  money had she asked about his money in those days when his father still lived when there was no question of this living belonging to him she would have waited for him for years had years been necessary even though they should be counted by tens and tens nay she would have been contented to wait even though that waiting should never have been rewarded had he given her the privilege of regarding herself as his money she would have been contented to live on potatoparings could he have been contented to live with her on potatoes  she had over and over again questioned herself as to her love and reminded herself that as yet he had said nothing to her to justify it but as often she had answered herself that with him she could have no doubt it was impossible that he should so look into her eyes and so speak to her if he did not love her and so she had resolved to risk all her happiness upon her conviction of his faithfulness she had so risked it all and now he came to her telling her coldly that he could not afford to marry  he to tell her of his happy dreams and his waking reality he who had not the courage to realize the bliss of his dreams when that bliss was within his reach he to talk of sympathy of a woman thinking with him exactly as he thought he who was so timid of the world that he feared to love less perchance his supplies of bread and meat should fail him what could heart wounds signify to him or hurt feelings had he not his arms sound and his head clear if having them he would not venture for his loves sake to meet the world and its burdens he could hardly have heart enough to know what love really meant  flinging herself on her sofa with outstretched arms thus adela made her moan not in these words for she spake none but such were the thoughts which ran through her mind as she bewailed all that she had risked and all that she had lost  what would i not have done for him she suddenly exclaimed aloud as rising from the sofa she stood erect upon the ground pressing her hand upon her heart fool that i have beenfool fool fool  and then with her hand still close to her side she walked up and down the room with quick step  and she had been a fool according to the worlds wisdom of what use had been aunt penelopes teaching strictly enacting as it did all the nice proprieties of younglady life seeing that it had not sufficed to guard her heart against the first comer unasked she had given it all away had poured it out to the last drop of its warm flood and now she was told that it was not wanted that the article was one not exactly in the gentlemans walk of life she might well call herself a foolbut what was she to call him  it is quite impossible you know that i should ever marry why had he not asked her whether or no it were possible if not now then in ten years timeif not in ten years then in twenty had he not been as faithless to her was he not as much mansworn as though a thousand oaths had passed between them oaths between lovers are but cupids phrases made to enable them to talk of love they are the playthings of love as kisses are when lovers trust each other they are sweet bonds but they will never bind those who do not trust when he had told her that she and she only understood his feelings that she and she only knew his moods and when she had answered him by the encouragement of her soft smile could it be that more was necessary between them ah yes adela much more never know a gentlemans moods never understand his feelings till in the plain language of his mothertongue he has asked you to be mistress of them  when her father came in before dinner she was still pacing up and down the room but she had not spent the two hours since arthur had left her in vain sorrow or in vainer anger she had felt that it behoved her to resolve how she would act and what she would do and in those two hours she had resolved a great misfortune a stunning blow had fallen on her but the fault had been with her rather than with him she would school herself to bear the punishment to see him occasionally and bear with him as she would have done had he never taken those walks along the river she would still love his sisters still go when needs was to the hurst staple parsonage as for him she would wish him no evil rather every good as for herself she would check her rebel heart if she could but at any rate she would learn to check the rising blood which would otherwise tell her tale  arthur wilkinson has been here today papa she was able to say with composed voice they are quite settled again at the parsonage  ah he is a lucky fellow said the old vicar hell be wanting a wife now before the years out     chapter v  the choice of a profession   we must now go back to our other hero or rather to another of our heroes arthur wilkinson is our melancholy lovelorn tenor george bertram our eager excitable barytone and mr harcourthenry harcourtour bass wide awake to the worlds good things impervious to sentimentality and not overscrupulousas is always the case with your true deepmouthed opera bass  our present business is with the excitable barytone whom we left some year and a half ago in not a very clear state of mind as to the walk in life which would be best suited for his peculiar legs harcourt who was himself a lawyer recommended the law selfish as was the general tone of harcourts heart still he had within him a high if not a generous feeling which made him wish to have near him in his coming life a friend of such promise as george bertram bertram might beat him in his career nay probably would do so but nevertheless harcourt wished to see him keeping his terms in london he was convinced that he should gain more than he should lose by such a friend  but bertrams own mind was not so easily made up his personal possessions in life may be thus catalogued he had come of a good family he had received the best education which england could give him he was quick in speech and ready in thought he had a doublefirst degree and would at once have a fellowship he had also an uncle who was very rich and occasionally very disagreeable and a father who was very poor and of whom he heard all men say that he was one of the most agreeable fellows that ever lived such being his stock in trade how was he to take it to the best market and what market would be the best  in thinking over his markets it must not be supposed that his only object or his chief object was the making of money that was a rock rather of which it behoved him to be very careful the moneymaking part of every profession was according to his present views a necessary incidental evil to enable a poor man like him to carry on his work some money must be made for some sorts of work perhaps for that very sort which he would most willingly choose much money must be made but the making of it should never be his triumph it could be but a disagreeable means to a desirable end at the age of twentytwo so thought our excitable barytone hero on that point  two ends appeared to him to be desirable but which of the two was the most desirablethat to him was the difficult question to do good to others and to have his own name in mens mouthsthese were the fitting objects of a mans life but whether he would attempt the former in order to achieve the latter or obtain if he did obtain the latter by seeking success in the former on this point his character was not sufficiently fixed nor his principles sufficiently high to enable him fitly to resolve  but the necessity of seeing his uncle before he took any actual steps secured him from the necessity of coming to any absolutely immediate decision he and harcourt were together for three or four days and he listened not unmoved to his friends eloquence in favour of public life in london not unmoved indeed but always with a spirit of antagonism when harcourt told of forensic triumphs bertram spoke of the joy of some rustic soul saved to heaven in the quiet nook of a distant parish when his friend promised to him parliament and the later glories of the ermine he sighed after literary fame to be enjoyed among the beauties of nature but harcourt understood all this he did not wish to convince his friend but only to lead him  mr george bertram senior was a notable man in the city of london i am not prepared to say what was his trade or even whether he had one properly so called but there was no doubt about his being a moneyed man and one well thought of on change at the time of which i write he was a director of the bank of england chairman of a large insurance company was deep in water far gone in gas and an illustrious potentate in railway interests i imagine that he had neither countinghouse shop nor warerooms but he was not on that account at a loss whither to direct his steps and those who knew city ways knew very well where to meet mr george bertram senior between the hours of eleven and five  he was ten years older than his brother sir lionel and at the time of which i write might be about seventy he was still unmarried and in this respect had always been regarded by sir lionel as a fountain from whence his own son might fairly expect such waters as were necessary for his present maintenance and future wellbeing but mr george bertram senior had regarded the matter in a different light he had paid no shilling on account of his nephew or on other accounts appertaining to his brother which he had not scored down as so much debt against sir lionel duly debiting the amount with current interest and statements of this account were periodically sent to sir lionel by mr bertrams man of businessand periodically thrown aside by sir lionel as being of no moment whatsoever  when mr bertram had paid the bill due by his brother to mr wilkinson there was outstanding some family unsettled claim from which the two brothers might or might not obtain some small sums of money sir lionel when much pressed by the city croesus had begged him to look to this claim and pay himself from the funds which would be therefrom accruing the city croesus had done so a trifle of two or three hundred pounds had fallen to sir lionels lot and had of course been duly credited to his account but it went a very little way towards squaring matters and the old man of business went on sending his halfyearly statements which became anything but small by degrees  mr bertram had never absolutely told george of this debt or complained of his not being repaid the advances which he had made but little hints dropped from him which were sometimes understood for more than they were worth and which made the young oxonian feel that he would rather not be quite so much in his uncles hands the old man gave him to understand that he must not look on himself as an heir to wealth or imagine that another lot was his than that ordinary to mortalsthe necessity namely of eating his bread in the sweat of his brow  old mr bertram ordinarily lived at hadley a village about a mile beyond barnet just on the border of what used to be called enfield chase here he had an establishment very fit for a quiet old gentleman but perhaps not quite adequate to his reputed wealth by my use of the word reputed the reader must not be led to think that mr bertrams moneybags were unreal they were solid and true as the coffers of the bank of england he was no colonel waugh rich only by means of his rich impudence it is not destined that he shall fall brilliantly bringing down with him a world of ruins he will not levant to spain or elsewhere his wealth is of the oldfashioned sort and will abide at any rate such touch of time as it may encounter in our pages but none of the hadleyites or indeed any other itesnot even probably the bankofenglandites or the cityoflondonwidowsfunditesknew very well what his means were and when therefore people at hadley spoke of his modest household they were apt to speak of it as being very insufficient for such a millionaire  hitherto george had always passed some part of his vacations at hadley the amusements there were not of a very exciting nature but london was close and even at hadley there were pretty girls with whom he could walk and flirt and the means of keeping a horse and a couple of pointers even if the hunting and shooting were not conveniently to be had  a few days after the glories of his degree when his name was still great on the high street of oxford and had even been touched by true fame in a very flattering manner in the columns of the daily jupiter he came home to hadley his uncle never encouraged visits from him in the city and they met therefore for the first time in the old mans drawingroom just before dinner  how are you george said the uncle putting out his hand to his nephew and then instantly turning round and poking the fire what sort of a journey have you had from oxford yes these railways make it all easy which line do you use didcot eh thats wrong youll have a smash some of these days with one of those great western express trainsmr bertram held shares in the opposition line by which oxford may be reached and never omitted an opportunity of doing a little business im ready for dinner i dont know whether you are you eat lunch i suppose john its two minutes past the halfhour why dont we have dinner  not a word was said about the degreeat least not then indeed mr bertram did not think very much about degrees he had taken no degree himself except a high degree in wealth and could not understand that he ought to congratulate a young man of twentytwo as to a successful termination of his schoollessons he himself at that age had been if not on change at any rate seated on the steps of change he had been then doing a mans work beginning to harden together the nucleus of that snowball of money which he had since rolled onwards till it had become so huge a lumpdestined probably to be thawed and to run away into muddy water in some much shorter space of time he could not blame his nephew he could not call him idle as he would have delighted to do had occasion permitted but he would not condescend to congratulate him on being great in greek or mighty in abstract mathematics  well george said he pushing him the bottle as soon as the cloth was gone i suppose you have done with oxford now  not quite sir i have my fellowship to receive  some beggarly two hundred pounds a year i suppose not that i mean to say you should not be glad to have it he added thus correcting the impression which his words might otherwise have made as you have been so long getting it it will be better to have that than nothing but your fellowship wont make it necessary for you to live at oxford will it  oh no but then i may perhaps go into the church  oh the church eh well it is a respectable profession only men have to work for nothing in it  i wish they did sir if we had the voluntary system  you can have that if you like i know that the independent ministers  i should not think of leaving the church of england on any account  you have decided then to be a clergyman  oh no not decided indeed i really think that if a man will work he may do better at the bar  very well indeedif he have the peculiar kind of talent necessary  but then i doubt whether a practising barrister can ever really be an honest man  what  they have such dirty work to do they spend their days in making out that black is white or worse still that white is black  pshaw have a little more charity master george and do not be so overrighteous some of the greatest men of your country have been lawyers  but their being great men wont alter the fact nor will my being charitable when two clearheaded men take money to advocate the different sides of a case each cannot think that his side is true  fiddlestick but mind i do not want you to be a lawyer you must choose for yourself if you dont like that way of earning your bread there are others  a man may be a doctor to be sure but i have no taste that way  and is that the end of the list  there is literature but literature though the grandest occupation in the world for a mans leisure is i take it a slavish profession  grub street eh yes i should think so you never heard of commerce i suppose  commerce yes i have heard of it but i doubt whether i have the necessary genius  the old man looked at him as though he doubted whether or no he were being laughed at  the necessary kind of genius i mean continued george  very likely not your genius is adapted to dispersing perhaps rather than collecting  i dare say it is sir  and i suppose you never heard of a man with awhat is it you call your degree a doublefirstgoing behind a counter what sort of men are the doublelasts i wonder  it is they i rather think who go behind the counters said george who had no idea of allowing his uncle to have all the raillery on his side  is it sir but i rather think they dont come out last when the pudding is to be proved by the eating success in life is not to be won by writing greek verses not though you write ever so many a shipload of them would not fetch you the value of this glass of wine at any market in the world  commerce is a grand thing said george with an air of conviction  it is the proper work for men said his uncle proudly  but i have always heard replied the nephew that a man in this country has no right to look to commerce as a profession unless he possesses capital mr bertram feeling that the tables had been turned against him finished his glass of wine and poked the fire  a few days afterwards the same subject was again raised between them you must choose for yourself george said the old man and you should choose quickly  if i could choose for myselfwhich i am aware that i cannot do for circumstances after all will have the decisionbut if i could choose i would go into parliament  go where said mr bertram who would have thought it as reasonable if his nephew had proposed to take a house in belgrave square with the view of earning a livelihood  into parliament sir  is parliament a profession i never knew it before  perhaps not ordinarily a moneymaking profession nor would i wish to make it so  and what county or what borough do you intend to honour by representing it perhaps the university will return you  perhaps it may some of these days  and in the meantime you mean to live on your fellowship i suppose  on that and anything else that i can get  mr bertram sat quiet for some time without speaking and george also seemed inclined to muse awhile upon the subject george said the uncle at last i think it will be better that we should thoroughly understand each other you are a good fellow in your way and i like you well enough but you must not get into your head any idea that you are to be my heir  no sir i wont  because it would only ruin you my idea is that a man should make his own way in the world as i made mine if you were my son it may be presumed that i should do as other men do and give you my money and most probably you would make no better use of it than the sons of other men who like me have made money but you are not my son  quite true sir and therefore i shall be saved the danger at any rate i shall not be the victim of disappointment  i am very glad to hear it said mr bertram who however did not give any proof of his gladness seeing that he evinced some little addition of acerbity in his temper and asperity in his manner it was hard to have to deal with a nephew with whom he could find so little ground for complaint  but i have thought it right to warn you he continued you are aware that up to the present moment the expense of your education has been borne by me  no sir not my education  not your education how then has it been borne  i speak of my residence at oxford i have had a great many indulgences there and you have paid for them the expenses of my education i could have paid myself this was fair on georges part he had not asked his uncle for a liberal allowance and was hardly open to blame for having taken it  i only know i have paid regularly one hundred and fifty pounds a year to your order and i find from pritchettpritchett was his man of businessthat i am paying it still  he sent me the last quarter the other day but i have not touched it  never mind let that pass i dont know what your fathers views are about you and never could find out  ill ask him i mean to go and see him  go and see him why hes at bagdad  yes if i start at once i shall just catch him there or perhaps meet him at damascus  then youll be a great fool for your painsa greater fool almost than i take you to be what do you expect your father can do for you my belief is that if four hundred pounds would take him to heaven he couldnt make up the money i dont think he could raise it either in europe or asia im sure of this i wouldnt lend it him  in such a case as that sir his personal security would go for so little  his personal security has always gone for little but as i was saying i have consented ever since you went to wilkinsons to allow your father to throw the burthen of your expenses on my shoulders i thought it a pity that you should not have the chance of a decent education mind i claim no gratitude as i shall expect your father to pay me what i have advanced  how on earth can he do that sir but perhaps i can  can you very well then you can settle it with him but listen to me  listen to me for a moment uncle george i think you are hard on my father and certainly hard on me when i went to wilkinsons what did i know of who paid the bill  who says you knew anything sir  and counting on from that time at what period ought i to have begun to know it when should i have first learnt to feel that i was a burden to any one  who has talked about a burden  you say i am not to be your heir  certainly not  i never thought of being your heir i dont care a straw about being anybodys heir what you have given freely i have taken freely as for my father if you felt so harshly towards him why did you let him incur this debt  i was to see you kicked out of wilkinsons house and starve in the ditch i suppose but now if you can control your fine feelings for one moment will you listen to me i have never blamed you in the matter at all and dont blame you nowat least not yet  i hope you never willthat is about money matters  now do listen to me it seems to me that you are quite astray about a profession you dont like commerce and what you said the other day about capital is quite true i count a man a knave who goes into trade without capital in a small way we might perhaps have managed it but in a very small way you would not have liked it  neither small nor great sir  very well you need not be afraid that anything very great will be thrust upon you but it seems to me that what you are most fitted for is a lawyer  young bertram paused a moment uncle i really hardly know sometimes i have a strange desire to go into orders  very strange indeed but now if you will listen to mei have been speaking to mr dry messrs dry and stickatit have done business for me for the last forty years now george i will advance you three thousand pounds at four per cent  what should i want with three thousand pounds  you dont suppose you can get into a house like that without money do you  and be an attorney said george with a look of horror which almost penetrated the thick skin of the old mans feelings what had he taken a doublefirst been the leading man of his year spouted at the debating club and driven himself nearly dizzy with aristotle for thisfor a desk in the office of messrs dry and stickatit attorneys of old bucklersbury no not for all the uncles not for any uncle  they net four thousand pounds a year said mr bertram and in process of time you would be the working partner and have at any rate a full half of the business  but no george was not to be talked into such a scheme as that by the offer of any loan by the mention of any number of thousands he positively refused to consider the proposition and his uncle with equal positiveness refused to hold any further converse with him on the subject of a profession pritchett will pay you your present allowance said he for two years longerthat is if i live  i can do without it sir said george  pritchett will pay that amount for two years said the uncle with great positiveness after that it will be discontinued and for the next three months i shall be happy to see you here as my guest  it will be readily believed that george bertram did not overstay the three months     chapter vi  jerusalem   but there was no quarrel between george bertram uncle and george bertram nephew though in such conversations as they had about business they were not over civil to each other still they went on together as good friends at any rate as they ever had been indeed after the last scene which has been reported the old man became more courteous to his nephew and before the three months were over was almost cordial  there was that about george the younger which made the old uncle respect him despite himself the london merchant had a thorough contempt for his brother the soldier of fortune he had acted as he had done on behalf of that brothers son almost more with the view of showing his contempt and getting thereby an opportunity for expressing it than with any fixed idea of doing a kindness he had counted also on despising the son as he had despised the father but here he found himself foiled george had taken all that he had given as any youth would take what an uncle gave but he had never asked for more he had done as well as it was possible for him to do in that line of education which had been tendered to him and now though he would not become an attorney or a merchant was prepared to earn his own bread and professed that he was able to support himself without further assistance from any one  before the three months were over his uncle had more than once asked him to prolong his visit but george had made up his mind to leave hadley his purpose was to spend three or four months in going out to his father and then to settle in london in the meantime he employed himself with studying the law of nations and amused his leisure hours with coke and blackstone  youll never find your father said mr bertram  at any rate ill try and if i miss him i shall see something of the world  youll see more in london in three months than you will there in twelve and moreover you would not lose your time  but george was inexorable and before the three months were over he had started on his trip  i beg your pardon mr george said mr pritchett to him the day before he went his uncle had requested him to call on pritchett in the cityi beg your pardon mr george but if i may be allowed to speak a word or so i do hope youll write a line now and then to the old gentleman while you are away  now george had never written a line to his uncle in his life all his communications as to his journeys and proposed arrivals had by his uncles special direction been made to the housekeeper and he had no present intention of commencing a correspondence  write to him mr pritchett no i dont suppose i shall i take it my uncle does not much care for such letters as i should write  ah but he would mr george you shouldnt be too quick to take persons by their appearances its half a million of money you know mr george halfamillionofmoney and mr pritchett put great stress on the numeration of his patrons presumed wealth  half a million is it well thats a great deal no doubt and i fully see the force of your excellent argument but i fear there is nothing to be done in that line im not born to be the heir to half a million of money you might see that in my face  mr pritchett stared at him very hard well i cant say that i do mr george but take my word for it the old gentleman is very fond of you  very fond thats a little too strong isnt it  that is if hes very fond of anything now he said to me yesterday pritchett says he that boys going to bagdad what mr george says i yes says he and to hong kong too i suppose before he comes back hes going after his father and then he gave one of those bitter looks you know thats a pity says i for you know one must humour him he is a fool says your uncle and always will be  im sure mr pritchett im very much obliged for the trouble you are at in telling me  oh i think nothing of the trouble and he knows no more about money says your uncle than an ostrich he cant go to bagdad out of his allowance of course he cant said i you had better put three hundred pounds to his credit said the old gentleman and so mr george i have  i could have done very well without it mr pritchett  perhaps so but three hundred pounds never hurt anybodynever mr george and i can tell you this if you play your cards well you may be the old gentlemans heir in spite of all he says to the contrary  at any rate mr pritchett im very much obliged to you and so they parted  hell throw that three hundred pounds in my teeth the next time i see him said george to himself  good as mr pritchetts advice undoubtedly was bertram did not take it and his uncle received no line from him during the whole period of his absence our heros search after his father was not quite of so intricate a nature as was supposed by his uncle nor so difficult as that made by japhet under similar circumstances his route was to be by paris marseilles malta alexandria jaffa jerusalem and damascus and he had written to sir lionel requesting him to write to either or all of those addresses neither in france nor malta nor egypt did he receive any letters but in the little town of jaffa where he first put his foot on asiatic soil a despatch from his father was awaiting him sir lionel was about to leave persia and was proceeding to constantinople on public service but he would go out of his course to meet his son at jerusalem  the tone of sir lionels letter was very unlike that of mr bertrams conversation he heartily congratulated his son on the splendid success of his degree predicted for him a future career both brilliant and rich declared that it was the dearest wish of his heart to embrace his son and spoke of their spending a few weeks together at jerusalem almost with rapture  this letter very much delighted george he had a natural anxiety to think well of his father and had not altogether believed the evil that had been rather hinted than spoken of him by mr bertram the colonel had certainly not hitherto paid him very much parental attention and had generally omitted to answer the few letters which george had written to him but a son is not ill inclined to accept acts of new grace from a father and there was something so delightful in the tone and manner of sir lionels letter it was so friendly as well as affectionate so perfectly devoid of the dull monotonous lecturegiving asperity with which ordinary fathers too often season their ordinary epistles that he was in raptures with his newlyfound correspondent  i would not miss seeing you for worlds wrote sir lionel and although i have been ordered to constantinople with all the immediate haste which your civilservice grandees always use in addressing us military slaves it shall go hard with me but i will steal a fortnight from them in order to pass it with you at jerusalem i suppose i shall scarce know you or you me but when you see an old gentleman in a military frock with a bald head a hook nose and a rather short allowance of teeth you may then be sure that you look upon your father however i will be at zs hoteli believe they honour the caravansary with that nameas soon as possible after the 14th  his uncle had at any rate been quite wrong in predicting that his father would keep out of his way so far was this from being the case that sir lionel was going to put himself to considerable inconvenience to meet him it might be and no doubt was the case that mr bertram the merchant had put together a great deal more money than colonel bertram the soldier but the putting together of money was no virtue in georges eyes and if sir lionel had not remitted a portion of his pay as regularly as he perhaps should have done that should not now be counted as a vice it may perhaps be surmised that had george bertram suffered much in consequence of his fathers negligence in remitting he might have been disposed to look at the matter in a different light  he had brought but one servant with him a dragoman whom he had picked up at malta and with him he started on his ride from the city of oranges oranges grow plentifully enough in spain in malta in egypt in jamaica and other places but within five miles of jaffa nothing else is grownif we except the hedges of prickly pear which divide the gardens orange garden succeeds to orange garden till one finds oneself on the broad open desert that leads away to jerusalem  there is something enticing to an englishman in the idea of riding off through the desert with a pistol girt about his waist a portmanteau strapped on one horse before him and an only attendant seated on another behind him there is a soupçon of danger in the journey just sufficient to give it excitement and then it is so unenglish oriental and inconvenient so opposed to the accustomed haste and comfort of a railway so out of his hitherto beaten way of life that he is delighted to get into the saddle but it may be a question whether he is not generally more delighted to get out of it particularly if that saddle be a turkish one  george had heard of arab horses and the clouds of dust which rise from their winged feet when first he got beyond the hedges of the orange gardens he expected to gallop forth till he found himself beneath the walls of jerusalem but he had before him many an hour of tedious labour ere those walls were seen his pace was about four miles an hour during the early day he strove frequently to mend it but as the sun became hot in the heavens his efforts after speed were gradually reduced and long before evening he had begun to think that jerusalem was a myth his dragoman an impostor and his arab steed the sorriest of jades  it is the longest journey i ever took in my life said george  longest yes a top of two mountain more and two godown and then there yes said the dragoman among whose various accomplishments that of speaking english could hardly be reckoned as the most prominent  at last the two mountains more and the two godowns were performed and george was informed that the wall he saw rising sharp from the rocky ground was jerusalem there is something very peculiar in the first appearance of a walled city that has no suburbs or extramural adjuncts it is like that of a fortress of cards built craftily on a table with us in england it is always difficult to say where the country ends and where the town begins and even with the walled towns of the continent one rarely comes upon them so as to see the sharp angles of a gray stone wall shining in the sun as they do in the old pictures of the cities in pilgrims progress  but so it is with jerusalem one rides up to the gate feeling that one is still in the desert and yet a moment more with the permission of those very dirtylooking turkish soldiers at the gate will place one in the city one rides up to the gate and as every one now has a matured opinion as to the taking of casemated batteries and the inefficiency of granite bastions ones first idea is how delightfully easy it would be to take jerusalem it is at any rate easy enough to enter it for the dirty turkish soldiers do not even look at you and you soon become pleasantly aware that you are beyond the region of passports  george bertram had promised himself that the moment in which he first saw jerusalem should be one of intense mental interest and when riding away from the orange gardens at jaffa he had endeavoured to urge his arab steed into that enduring gallop which was to carry him up to the city of the sepulchre his heart was ready to melt into ecstatic pathos as soon as that gallop should have been achieved but the time for ecstatic pathos had altogether passed away before he rode in at that portal he was then swearing vehemently at his floundering jade and giving up to all the fiends of tartarus the accursed saddle which had been specially contrived with the view of lacerating the nether christian man  where on earth is this d hotel said he when he and his dragoman and portmanteau had been floundering for about five minutes down a steep narrow illpaved lane with a halfformed gully in the middle very slippery with orangepeel and old vegetables and crowded with the turbans of all the eastern races do you call this a street after all his sentiment all his emotions all his pious resolves it was thus that our hero entered jerusalem but what piety can withstand the wear and tear of twelve hours in a turkish saddle  is this a street said he it was the main street in jerusalem the first or among the first in grandeur of those sacred ways which he had intended hardly to venture to pass with shoes on his feet his horse turning a corner as he followed the dragoman again slipped and almost fell whereupon bertram again cursed but then he was not only tired and sore but very hungry also our finer emotions should always be encouraged with a stomach moderately full  at last they stopped at a door in a wall which the dragoman pronounced to be the entrance of zs hotel in fact they had not yet been full ten minutes within the town but the streets certainly were not well paved in five minutes more george was in his room strewing sofas and chairs with the contents of his portmanteau and inquiring with much energy what was the hour fixed for the table dhôte he found with much inward satisfaction that he had just twenty minutes to prepare himself at jerusalem as elsewhere these after all are the travellers first main questions when is the table dhôte where is the cathedral at what hour does the train start tomorrow morning it will be some years yet but not very many before the latter question is asked at jerusalem  bertram had arrived about a fortnight before easter and the town was already full of pilgrims congregated for that ceremony and of english and americans who had come to look at the pilgrims  the inn was nearly full and george when he entered the public room heard such a babel of english voices and such a clatter of english spoons that he might have fancied himself at the top of the righi or in a rhine steamboat but the subjects under discussion all savoured of the holy land  mrs rose we are going to have a picnic on monday in the valley of jehoshaphat will you and your young ladies join us we shall send the hampers to the tomb of zachariah  thank you miss todd we should have been so happy but we have only three days to do bethlehem the dead sea and jericho we must be off tomorrow  mamma i lost my parasol somewhere coming down the mount of offence those nasty arab children must have stolen it  they say the people in siloam are the greatest thieves in syria and nobody dares to meddle with them  but i saw it in your hand my dear at the well of enrogel  what no potatoes there were potatoes yesterday waiter waiter who ever heard of setting people down to dinner without potatoes  well i didnt know what to say to it if that is the tomb of nicodemus that seems to settle the question may i trouble you for the salt  mr pott i wont have anything more to say to you you have no faith i believe it all  what all from calvary upstairs in the gallery down to the dark corner where the cock crew  yes all mr pott why should not a cock crow there as well as anywhere else it is so beautiful to believe  george bertram found himself seated next to a ladylike welldressed englishwoman of the middle age whom he heard called miss baker and next to her again satan angel whom miss baker called caroline and whom an odious man sitting on the other side of her called miss waddington  all my readers will probably at different times have made part of a tabledhôte assemblage and most of them especially those who have travelled with small parties will know how essential it is to ones comfort to get near to pleasant neighbours the young mans idea of a pleasant neighbour is of course a pretty girl what the young ladies idea may be i dont pretend to say but it certainly does seem to be happily arranged by providence that the musty fusty people and the nicy spicy people and the witty pretty people do severally assemble and get together as they ought to do  bertrams nextdoor neighbour was certainly of the nicy spicy order but this did not satisfy him he would have been very well pleased to talk to miss baker had it not been for the close contiguity of miss waddington and even her onceremoved vicinity would not have made him unhappy had not that odious man on her left had so much to say about the village of emmaus and the valley of ajalon  now be it known to all men that caroline waddington is our donna primissimathe personage of most importance in these pages it is for her that you are to weep with her that you are to sympathize and at her that you are to wonder i would that i could find it compatible with my duty to introduce her to this circle without any minute details of her bodily and mental charms but i have already been idle in the case of adela gauntlet and i feel that a donna primissima has claims to description which i cannot get over only not exactly now in a few chapters hence we shall have miss waddington actively engaged upon the scene and then she shall be described  it must suffice now to say that she was an orphan that since her fathers death she had lived with her aunt miss baker chiefly at littlebath that miss baker had at her nieces instance been to egypt up the nile across the short desertshort having travelled from cairo to jerusalemand that now thoroughly sick of the oriental world she was anxious only to get back to littlebath while caroline more enthusiastic and much younger urged her to go on to damascus and lebanon to beyrout and smyrna and thence home merely visiting constantinople and athens on the way  had bertram heard the terms in which miss waddington spoke of the youth who was so great about ajalon when she and her aunt were in their own room and also the words in which that aunt spoke of him perhaps he might have been less provoked  aunt that mr mgabbery is an ass i am sure he has ears if one could only see them i am so tired of him dont you think we could get on to damascus tomorrow  if we did i have no doubt hed come too mr mgabbery had been one of the party who crossed the desert with them from cairo  impossible aunt the hunters are ready to start tomorrow or if not the day after and i know they would not have him  but my dear i really am not equal to damascus a few more days on a camel  but aunt youll have a horse  thats worse im sure and moreover ive found an old friend and one that you will like very much  what that exceedingly ugly young man that sat next to you  yes that exceedingly ugly young man i remember as the prettiest baby in the worldnot that i think he is ugly he is however no other than the nephew of mr bertram  what papas mr bertram  yes your fathers mr bertram therefore if old mr bertram should die and this young man should be his heir he would have the charge of all your money youd better be gracious to him  how odd but what is he like  he is one of the cleverest young men of the day i had heard that he had distinguished himself very much at oxford and he certainly is a most agreeable companion and so it was arranged between them that they would not start to damascus as yet in spite of any evil that mr mgabbery might inflict on them  on the next morning at breakfast bertram managed to separate the aunt from the niece by sitting between them it was long however before mr mgabbery gave up the battle when he found that an interloper was interfering with his peculiar property he began to tax his conversational powers to the utmost he was greater than ever about ajalon and propounded some very startling theories with reference to emmaus he recalled over and over again the interesting bits of their past journey how tired they had been at gaza where he had worked for the ladies like a slavehow terribly miss baker had been frightened in the neighbourhood of arimathea where he mr mgabbery had specially looked to his pistols with the view of waging war on three or four supposed bedouins who were seen to be hovering on the hillsides but all would not do miss waddington was almost tired of gaza and arimathea and miss baker seemed to have a decided preference for london news so at last mr mgabbery became silent and grand and betook himself to his associations and a map of palestine in a corner  bertram when fortified with a nights rest and a good breakfast was able to recover his hightoned feeling and thus armed proceeded alone to make his first visit to the church of the holy sepulchre it was a sunday the last sunday in lent and he determined to hear mass in the greek church and ascertain for himself how much devotion an english protestant could experience in the midst of this foreign worship but one mass was over and another not begun when he reached the building and he had thus time to follow his dragoman to the various wonders of that very wonderful building  it is now generally known in england of what the church of the holy places consists but no one who has not seen it and none indeed who have not seen it at eastertime can fully realize all the absurdity which it contains and all the devotion which it occasions bertram was first carried to the five different churches which have crowded themselves together under the same roof the greeks have by far the best of it their shrine is gaudy and glittering and their temple is large and in some degree imposing the latins whom we call roman catholics are much less handsomely lodged and their tinsel is by far more dingy the greeks too possess the hole in which stoodso they saythe cross of our saviour while the latins are obliged to put up with the sites on which the two thieves were crucified then the church of the armenians for which you have to descend almost into the bowels of the earth is still less grand in its pretensions is more sombre more dark more dirty but it is as the nave of st peters when compared to the poor woodencased altar of the abyssinians or the dark unfurnished gloomy cave in which the syrian christians worship so dark that the eye cannot at first discover its only ornamenta small illmade figure of the crucified redeemer  we who are accustomed to roman catholic gorgeousness in italy and france can hardly at first understand why the pope here should playso decidedly a second fiddle but as he is held to be gods viceregent among the people of southwestern europe so is the russian emperor among the christians of the east he the russian is still by far the greatest pope in jerusalem and is treated with a much greater respect a much truer belief than is his brother of rome even among romans  five or six times bertram had attempted to get into the tabernacle of the holy sepulchre but so great had been the rush of pilgrims that he had hitherto failed at last his dragoman espied a lull and went again to the battle to get into the little outside chapel which forms as it were a vestibule to the cell of the sepulchre and from which on easter saturday issue the miraculous flames was a thing to be achieved by moderate patience his close contiguity to candiotes and copts to armenians and abyssinians was not agreeable to our hero for the contiguity was very close and christians of these nations are not very cleanly but this was nothing to the task of entering the sanctum sanctorum to this there is but one aperture and that is but four feet high men entering it go in head foremost and those retreating come out in the other direction and as it is impossible that two should pass and as two or three are always trying to come out and ten or twelve equally anxious to get in the struggle to an englishman is disagreeably warm though to an oriental it is probably matter of interesting excitement  but for his dragoman bertram would never have succeeded he however so pulled and hauled these anxious devotees so thrust in those who endeavoured to come out and clawed back those who strove to get in that the passage became for a moment clear and our hero having bent low his head found himself standing with his hand on the marble slab of the tomb  those who were there around him seemed to be the outcasts of the world exactly those whom he would have objected to meet unarmed on the roads of greece or among the hills of armenia cutthroatlooking wretches with closeshaven heads dirty beards and angry eyes men clothed in skins or huge skinlikelooking cloaks filthy foul alive with vermin reeking with garlicabominable to an englishman there was about them a certain dignity of demeanour a natural aptitude to carry themselves with ease and even a not impure taste for colour among their dirt but these christians of the russian church hardly appeared to him to be brothers of his own creed  but he did put his hand on the slab of the tomb and as he did so two young greeks brothers by bloodgreeks by their creed though of what actual nation bertram was quite unable saypressed their lips vehemently to the marble they were dirty shorn about the head dangerous looking and skinclothed as we have described men very low in the scale of humanity when compared with their fellowpilgrim but nevertheless they were to him at that moment objects of envy they believed so much at any rate was clear to him by whatever code of morals they might be able to govern their lives whether by any or as alas might be too likely by none at least they possessed a faith christ to them was an actual living truth though they knew how to worship him no better than by thus kissing a stone which had in fact no closer reference to the saviour than any other stone they might have kissed in their own country they believed and as they reverently pressed their foreheads lips and hands to the top and sides and edges of the sepulchre their faith became ecstatic it was thus that bertram would fain have entered that little chapel thus that he would have felt thus that he would have acted had he been able so had he thought to feelin such an agony of faith had he been minded there to kneel but he did not kneel at all he remarked to himself that the place was inordinately close that his contiguity to his religious neighbours was disagreeable and then stooping low his head not in reverence but with a view to backing himself out from the small enclosure with some delay and much precaution and to speak truth with various expressions of anger against those who with their heads continued to push him the way he did not wish to go he retreated from the chapel nor while he was at jerusalem did he feel sufficient interest in the matter again to enter it he had done that deed he had killed that lion and ticking it off from his list of celebrities as one celebrity disposed of he thought but little more about it such we believe are the visits of most english christians to the socalled holy sepulchre  and then he killed the other lions there calvary up in the gallery the garden so called in which the risen saviour addressed the women running from the sepulchre the place where peters cock crew the tomb of nicodemusall within the same church all under the one roofall at least under what should be a roof only now it has fallen into ruin so that these sacred places are open to the rain of heaven and greeks and latins having quarrelled about the repairs the turks now lords of the holy sepulchre have taken the matter into their own hands and declared that no repairs shall be done by any of them  and then he attended the greek massat least he partly believed that he did so somewhat doubting for the mass was not said as are those of the romans out at an open altar before the people but in a holy of holies very holy it may be imagined from the manner in which the worshippers rubbed their foreheads against certain gratings through which a tantalizing glimpse might be had of the fine things that were going on within had they but known it it might all have been seen holy of holies headwagging priest idle yawning assistant with legs stretched out half asleep mumblement jumblement and all from a little back window in a passage opening from that calvary gallery upstairs from thence at least did these profane eyes look down and see all the mumblement and jumblement which after all was little enough but saw especially the idle clerical apprentice who had that screen been down and had he been called on to do his altar work before the public eye would not have been so nearly asleep as may perhaps be said of other clerical performers nearer home  but bertrams attention was mainly occupied with watching the devotions of a single woman she was a female of one of those strange nations decently clad about thirty years of age pleasant to the eye were she not so dirty and had she not that wild look half way between the sallow sublime and the dangerously murderous which seems common to oriental christians whether men or women heaven might know of what sins she came there to leave the burden heaven did know doubtless but from the length of her manoeuvres in quitting herself of their weight one would say that they were heavy and yet she went through her task with composed dignity with an alacrity that was almost joyous and certainly with no intentional selfabasement  entering the church with a quick step she took up a position as though she had selected a special stone on which to stand there with head erect but bowing between each ceremony she crossed herself three times then sinking on her knees thrice she pressed her forehead to the floor then rising again again she crossed herself having so done somewhat to the right of the church but near the altarscreen she did the same on the corresponding stone towards the left and then again the same on a stone behind the others but in the centre after this she retreated further back and did three more such worshippings always choosing her stone with an eye to architectural regularity then again getting to the backward she did three more thus completing her appointed task having crossed herself thirtysix times and pressed her head with twentyseven pressures upon the floor and so having finished she quickly withdrew did any slightest prayer any idea of praying any thought of a god giving grace and pardon if only asked to give once enter that bowing bosom  why do those turks sit there said bertram as he left the building why indeed it was strange to see five or six stately turks strict children of the prophet doubtless sitting there within the door of this temple dedicated to the nazarene god sitting there and looking as though they of all men had the most right so to sit and were most at home in so sitting nay they had a divan there were drinking coffee there out of little double cups as is the manner of these people were not smoking certainly as is their manner also in all other places  dem guard de keys said the dragoman  guard the keys  yes yes open de lock and not let de christian fight  so it is in such manner is proper fitting peaceable conduct maintained within the thrice christian walls of the church of the holy sepulchre  on his return to the hotel bertram accepted an invitation to join miss todds picnic in the valley of jehoshaphat and then towards evening strolled up alone on to the mount of olives     chapter vii  the mount of olives   if there be one place told of in holy writ the name of which gives rise to more sacred feelings than any other it is that of the mount of olives and if there be a spot in that land of wondrous memories which does bring home to the believer in christ some individualized remembrance of his saviours earthly pilgrimage that certainly is it  there is no doubting there no question there whether or no the ground on which you tread was not first called the mount by some byzantine sophia whether tradition respecting it can go back further than constantine whether in real truth that was the hill over which jesus walked when he travelled from the house of lazarus at bethany to fulfil his mission in the temple no let me take any ordinary believing protestant christian to that spot and i will as broadly defy him to doubt there as i will defy him to believe in that filthy church of the holy places  the garden of gethsemane near the city over the brook cedron where he left his disciples resting while he went yonder to pray the hillside on which the angel appeared unto him strengthening him and whither judas and the multitude came out to take him bethany the town of mary and martha fifteen furlongs from jerusalem where lazarus was raised from the dead the spot from whence he sent for the ass and the asss colt the path from thence to the city by which he rode when the multitude cried saying hosanna to the son of david the same multitude which afterwards came out against him with staves these places are there now as they were in his day very crediblenay more impossible not to be believed these are the true holy places of jerusalem places for which greeks and latins do not fight guarded by no sedate coffeedrinking turks open there to all men under the fair heavens and desolate enough too even in these pilgrim weeks for any one or two who will sit there alone and ponder over the wondrous history of the city that still lies over against him  but what is the so strong evidence of the actual identity of these places what is it that makes me so sure that this is the mount of olives and that waterchannel there the brook cedron and the hamlet on the other side the veritable bethany why is one to be so sure of these and yet feel such an infinity of doubt as to that village of emmaus that valley of ajalon that supposed arimathea and the rest of them nay i cannot well say at any rate not in these light novel pages dr stanley with considerable distinctness does say but go and see with the ordinary protestant christian seeing here will be believing as seeing over in that church of the holy places most indisputably will be disbelieving  hither bertram strolled and seated on the brow of the hill looked over to jerusalem till the short twilight of the syrian evening had left him and he could no longer discern the wondrous spots on which his eye still rested wondrous indeed there before him were the walls of jerusalem standing up erect from the hillsidefor the city is still all fenced upstretching from hill to hill in varying but ever continued line on the left was the hill of sion davids hill a hill still inhabited and mainly by jews here is still the jews quarters and the jews hospital too tended by english doctors nurtured also by english money and here too close to davids gate close also to that new huge armenian convent shall one somewhat closely scrutinizing among heaps of rubbish come upon a colony of lepers in the town but not of it within the walls but forbidden all ingress to the streets there they dwell a race of mournfullest pariahs from father to son from mother to daughter dire disease horrid polluting is handed down a certain legacy making the body loathsome and likening the divine face of man to a melancholy ape oh the silent sadness the inexpressible melancholy of those wan thoughtless shapeless boneless leaden faces to them no happy daily labour brings rest and appetite their lot forbids them work as it forbids all other blessings no on their dunghills outside their cabins there they sit in the sun the mournfullest sight one might look on the leper parents with their leper children beggars by inheritance paupers outcasts mutilated victimsbut still with souls if they or any round them did but know it  there also directly facing him was the mount moriah also inside the walls where solomon built the house of the lord where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite for this city jerusalem had in still more ancient days before the thought of that temple had come into mens minds been the city jebus a city even then fenced up and here had been the threshingfloor which ornan tendered to david without price but which the king bought for six hundred shekels of gold  yes here before him as he sat was the site of that temple solomons temple exceeding magnificent of fame and glory throughout all countries of which david had been worthy only to collect the materials the site nay but there were the very stones themselves  seen from that hill the city seems so close that you may lay your hand upon it between you and it you if ever you should happily come to sit there lies that valley of jehoshaphat in which miss todd is going to celebrate her picnic this is the valley in which the jews most love to have themselves buried as there according to them is the chosen site of the resurrection and thus they who painfully journeying thither in their old age and dying there can there be buried will have no frightful moleswork underground pilgrimage to detain them when that awful trumpet shall once more summon them to the upper world  the air in syria there is thin and clear clouded by no fogs and the lines of the wall and the minarets of the mosque are distinct and bright and sharp against the sky as in the evening light one looks across from one hill to the other the huge stones of the wall now standing stones which made part of that ancient temple can be counted one above another across the valley measured by a rough estimate some of them may be two and twenty feet in length seven in depth and five in height single blocks of hewn rock cut certainly by no turkish enterprise by no mediæval empire by no roman labour it is here and here only at the base of the temple that these huge stones are to be found at the base of what was the temple forming part of the wall that now runs along the side of mount moriah but still some forty feet above the ground  over them now is the mosque of omara spot to be desecrated no more by christian step on the threshingfloor of ornan the children of mahomet now read the koran and sing to allah with monotonous howl oh what a history from the treading of the jebusites oxen down to the first cry of the mussulman yes no christian may now enter here may hardly look into the walled court round the building but dignified turks drinking coffee on their divan within the building keep the keys of the christian churchkeep also the peace lest latin and greek should too enthusiastically worship their strange gods  there can be few spots on the worlds surface more sacred to any christian than that on which bertram sat coming up from bethany over a spur on the southern side of the mount of olives towards jerusalem the traveller as he rises on the hill soon catches a sight of the city and soon again loses it but going onward along his path the natural road which convenience would take he comes at length to the brow of the hill looking downwards and there has mount sion moriah and the site of the temple full before him no one travelling such a road could do other than pause at such a spot  twas here that jesus sat upon the mount over against the temple there is no possibility of mistaking the place and as he went one of the disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down there are the stones the very stones thrown down indeed from the temple but now standing erect as a wall supporting omars mosque  and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it yes walk up from bethany my reader and thou too shalt behold it even yet a matter to be wept over even now tis hard to sit there and not weep if a man have any heart within him any memory of those histories if thou hadst known even then at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but thou wouldest not know and where art thou now o jew and who is it that sittest in thy high place howling there to allah most unmusically  o jerusalem jerusalem not silently and in thought only but with outspoken words and outstretched hands so then spake our young english friend sitting there all alone gazing on the city what man familiar with that history could be there and not so speak o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate  when talking over the matter with harcourt at oxford and afterwards with his uncle at hadley bertram had expressed a sort of halfformed wish to go into the church not indeed in such a manner as to leave on the minds of either of his counsellors an idea that he would really do so but this profession of being a parson had been one of those of which he had spoken as being in some sort desirable for himself now as he sat there looking at the once holy city it seemed to him to be the only profession in any way desirable he resolved that he would be a clergyman thanked his god in that he had brought him there to this spot before it was too late acknowledged that doubting as he had done he had now at length found a divine counsellorone whose leading his spirit did not disdain there he devoted himself to the ministry declared that he too would give what little strength he had towards bringing the scattered chickens of the new house of israel to that only wing which could give them the warmth of life he would be one of the smallest one of the least of those who would fight the good fight but though smallest and least he would do it with what earnestness was in him  reader you may already perhaps surmise that george bertram does not become a clergyman it is too true that enthusiasm strong true real as it was did not last him much longer than his last walk round jerusalem at least did not bide by him till he found himself once more walking on the high street of oxford very contemptible this you will say yes contemptible enough as humanity so often is who amongst us have not made such resolvessome resolve of selfdevotion at the sound of the preachers voiceand forgotten it before our foot was well over the threshold it is so natural that wish to do a great thing so hard that daily task of bathing in jordan  when the bright day had disappeared all but suddenly and he could no longer see the minarets of the mosque bertram descended the hill it is but a short walk thence to jerusalemthence even into the centre of jerusalem  but what a walk to the left is the valleysidethat valley of the resurrectioncovered with tombsflat sturdy short stones each bearing a semblance at least of some short hebraic epitaph unmoved through heaven knows how many centuries apparently immovable the place in this respect being very unlike our more ornamental cemeteries on his right was the mount of olives a mount still of olives sprinkled over with olivetrees quite sufficiently to make it properly so called even to this day then he passed by the garden of gethsemane now a walledin garden in which grow rue and other herbs in which also is one fine aged olivetree as to which tradition of course tells wondrous tales this garden is now in charge of an old latin monka spaniard if i remember wellwho at least has all a spaniards courtesy  it was here or near to this just above on the hillside if our topography be reliable that jesus asked them whether they could not watch one hour bertram as he passed did not take the question to himself but he well might have done so  turning round the wall of the garden on his pathway up to stephens gate the socalled tomb of the virgin was on his right hand with its singular low subterranean chapel a very singular chapel especially when filled to the very choking with pilgrims from those strange retreats of oriental christendom and when the mass is being saidinaudible indeed and not to be seen at the furthest end of that dense underground crowd but testified to by the lighting of a thousand tapers and by the strong desire for some flicker of the holy flame  and then he ascended to the city up the steep hill the side of mount moriah to st stephens gate and there on his left was the entrance to omars mosque guarded by fierce dervishes against pollution from stray christian foot hence to his hotel every footstep was over ground sacred in some sense but now desecrated by traditionary falsehoods every action of our saviours passion has its spot assigned to it of every noted word the locale is given when once you are again within the walls all is again unbelievable fabulous miraculous nay all but blasphemous some will say quite so but nevertheless in passing by this way should you o reader ever make such passage forget not to mount to the top of pilates house it is now a turkish barrack whether it ever were pilates house or rather whether it stands on what was ever the site of pilates house or no from hence you see down into the court of the mosque see whatever a christian can see of that temples site and see also across them gloriously to those hills of jerusalem scopus and the hill of the men of galilee and the mount of olives and the mount of offenceso called because there did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab on the hill that is before jerusalem  on his return to his inn bertram at once found that there had been an arrival of some importance during his absence waiters and boots were all busyfor there are waiters and boots at jerusalem much the same as at the saracens head or white lion there is no chambermaid however only a chamberman colonel sir lionel bertram was there     chapter viii  sir lionel bertram   the personal peculiarities which sir lionel had mentioned in his letter to his son as being characteristic of himself were certainly true he was an old or perhaps rather an elderly gentleman in a military frock with a bald head a hook nose and a short allowance of teeth but he was more than this though elderly he was tall and upright he was distinguished looking and for an old man handsome in spite of his lost teeth and though bald as to the top of his head had yet enough hair to merit considerable attention and to be the cause of considerable pride his whiskers also and mustache though irongray were excellent in their way had his baldness been of an uglier description or his want of teeth more disagreeably visible he probably might not have alluded to them himself in truth sir lionel was not a little vain of his personal appearance and thought that in the matter of nose he was quite equal to the duke in aristocratic firmness and superior to sir charles napier in expression and general design  but though a vain man sir lionel was too clever to let his vanity show itself in an offensive manner the ars celare artem was his forte and he was able to live before the world as though he never cast a thought on his coat and pantaloons or ever did more than brush and smooth his irongray locks with due attention to cleanliness  i was going to say that sir lionels appearance was the best thing about him but in saying so i should belie his manner with which it was certainly difficult for any one to find fault it was what the world calls happy meaning thereby that so great was the possessors luck that he was able to make it pleasant to all men and to all womenfor a while mrs bertramshe had not lived to be my ladyhad i believe not always found it so  these joined to a readiness in the use of one or two languages besides his own were the qualifications which had given sir lionel his title and had caused him to be employed in so many missions in so many countries and on duty too which could not be said to be of a military nature he never made difficulties or enemies of his own and could generally smooth down the difficulties and enemies left behind them by others perhaps of a more sturdy temperament  but now the catalogue of his virtues is complete he was not a man of genius or even a man of talent he had performed no great service for his country had neither proposed nor carried through any valuable project of diplomacy nor had he shown any close insight into the habits and feelings of the people among whom he had lived but he had been useful as a great oiljar from whence oil for the quiescence of troubled waters might ever and anon be forthcoming expediency was his god and he had hitherto worshipped it with a successful devotion  that he had not been a good husband has been hinted that he had been a very indifferent father has been made apparent but at the moment of his meeting with his son he atoned for all his past sins in this respect by the excellence of his manner and before the evening was over george liked his father who had owed him everything and given him nothing ten times better than he had ever liked his uncle who had given him everything though he had owed him nothing  its an odd place for us to have met in at last is it not sir said george they were sitting after supper very close together on one of those stationary sofas which are found affixed to the wall in every room in the east and the son was half holding half caressing his fathers arm sir lionel to tell the truth did not much care for such caresses but under the peculiar circumstances of this present interview he permitted it  you see im always in odd places george  youve been in jerusalem before  no never its not on the road anywhere or on any road at all as one may well see i never knew such a place to get to now there are roads of some sort even about bagdad  and damascus  oh damascus is a highway but nobody comes to jerusalem except the pilgrims and those who like to look after the pilgrims we are just in the thick of them now i believe  yes sir there are thirteen thousand here i am sure youll like the place i am delighted with it although i have been here as yet only two days  perhaps more so than you will be when you have been ten  i dont think it but it is not the city itself  no that seems poor and dirty enough  i would not mind the dirt if the place were but true sir lionel did not quite understand him but he said nothing it is the country round the immediate vicinity of jerusalem that fascinates so wonderfully  ah the scenery is good is it  well in one way it is but i do not mean that i cannot explain it but tomorrow you will go to the mount of olives with me  mount of olives eh im not very good at climbing up a hill master george you must remember the difference between twentythree and sixtythree what is there to see there  what was there to see there this was said in a tone which made george feel rather indisposed to describe if describe he could what there was there to be seen he had quite wit enough to perceive that his father was not enthusiastic about bible history  and then they changed the conversation and began to talk about george bertram the elder  its eighteen years since ive seen my brother said sir lionel he was usually cross enough then i suppose he has hardly improved  i cant exactly call him cross he has been very kind to me you know  kindwell if you are contented i am but considering that you are his natural heir i dont think he has done so very much if he means to be kind why does he bother me every other month with a long account of which the postage comes to heaven knows how much  ah but sir i am not his heir  not his heir said sir lionel with more of sharpness in his tone than was at all usual with him with a little sharpness also in his eye as george quickly observed not his heirwho is his heir then  ah that i do not know some corporation perhaps or some hospital all i know is that i am not that he has told me quite plainly and he was very right to do so added george after a pause  sir lionel repressed the exclamation of anger against his brother which was in his heart and had all but risen to his tongue he had not been wandering for thirty years on foreign missions for nothing he must find out more of this lads disposition and feelings before he spoke out plainly before him what he thought he had intended not only that his son should be the rich uncles heir but the rich uncles adopted child also so that some portion of that vast wealth might be made use of certainly by george perhaps even in some modest degree by himself without the unnecessary delay of waiting for his brothers death it would be bad enough to wait seeing how probable it was that that brother might outlive himself but now to be told not only that his hopes in this respect were vain but that the old miser had absolutely repudiated his connection with his nephew this was almost too much for his diplomatic equanimity almost i say for in fact he did restrain himself  and did he say george in so many words that he meant to give you nothing  yes very plainlyin so many words and i told him as plainly and in as many that i wanted nothing from him  was that prudent my boy  it was the truth sir but i must tell you the whole he offered me a loan of three thousand pounds  well you took that  indeed no he offered it on the condition that i should be an attorney  an attorney and you with a doublefirst  ah he does not much value doublefirsts of course i was not going to make myself an attorney  of course not but what is he doing about an allowance for you  he has been very liberal he has given me a hundred and fifty a year  yes and sent me the bill of itwith great regularity  the son did not remind the father that all regularity in the matter had ended there and that the bills so sent had never been paid but he could not help thinking that in justice he might do so  but that expense will soon be over sir as regards either you or him the allowance will be discontinued next year  what he is going to stop even that schoolboys pittance  why not sir i have no claim on him and as he has not forgotten to tell me so once or twice  he was always a vulgar fellow said sir lionel how he came to have such a spirit of trade in his very blood i cant conceive god knows i have none of it  nor i either sir  well i hope not but does he expect you to live upon air this is bad news georgevery bad  of course i have always intended to go into a profession i have never looked at it in the same light as you do i have always intended to make my own way and have no doubt that i shall do so i have quite made up my mind about it now  about what george  i shall go into orders and take a college living  orders said sir lionel and he expressed more surprise and almost more disgust at this idea than at that other one respecting the attorney scheme  yes i have been long doubting but i think i have made up my mind  do you mean that you wish to be a parson and that after taking a doublefirst  i dont see what the doublefirst has to do with it sir the only objection i have is the system of the establishment i do not like the established church  then why go into it said sir lionel not at all understanding the nature of his sons objection  i love our liturgy and i like the ritual but what we want is the voluntary principle i do not like to put myself in a position which i can in fact hold whether i do the duties of it or no nor do i wish  well i understand very little about all that but george i had hoped something better for you now the army is a beggarly profession unless a man has a private fortune but upon my word i look on the church as the worst of the two a man may be a bishop of course but i take it he has to eat a deal of dirt first  i dont mean to eat any dirt said the son  nor to be a bishop perhaps replied the father  they were quite unable to understand each other on this subject in sir lionels view of the matter a profession wasa profession the word was understood well enough throughout the known world it signified a calling by which a gentleman not born to the inheritance of a gentlemans allowance of good things might ingeniously obtain the same by some exercise of his abilities the more of these good things that might be obtained the better the profession the easier the labour also the better the profession the less restriction that might be laid on a man in his pleasurable enjoyment of the world the better the profession this was sir lionels view of a profession and it must be acknowledged that though his view was commonplace it was also common sense that he looked at the matter as a great many people look at it and that his ideas were at any rate sufficiently intelligible but george bertrams view was different and much less easy of explanation he had an idea that in choosing a profession he should consider not so much how he should get the means of spending his life but how he should in fact spend it he would have in making this choice to select the pursuit to which he would devote that amount of power and that amount of life which god should allot to him fathers and mothers uncles and aunts guardians and grandfathers was not this a singular view for a young man to take in looking at such a subject  but in truth george was somewhat afflicted by a tête monté in this matter i say afflicted because having imagination and ideality to lead him to high views he had not a sufficient counterbalance in his firmness of character if his father was too mundane he was too transcendental as for instance he approved at the present moment in theory of the life of a parish clergyman but could he have commenced the life tomorrow he would at once have shrunk from its drudgery  they did not understand each other perceiving which sir lionel gave up the subject he was determined not to make himself disagreeable to his son he at any rate intended to make him no allowance to give him no fortune and was aware therefore that he had no right to interfere otherwise than as his advice might be asked nor indeed had he any wish to do so if he could only instil into the young mans mind a fewnot precepts precepts are harsh and disagreeablea few comfortable friendly hints as to the tremendous importance of the game which might be played with mr george bertram senior if he could only do this pleasantly and without offence to his son he would attempt nothing further  he turned the conversation and they talked agreeably on other mattersof oxford of the wilkinsons of harcourt and by degrees also a little of uncle george  what sort of a house does my brother keep at hadleyeh george dull enough it used to be  well it is dull not that he is dull himself i can always talk to my uncle when he will talk to me  sees no company i suppose  not much  never goes into society  he dines out in london sometimes and sometimes gives dinners too  what at taverns  yes at blackwall or greenwich or some of those places i have been at his dinners and he never spares anything  he doesnt feel his years then hes not infirm no rheumatism or anything of that sortstrong on his legs eh  as strong as you are sir  hes ten years my senior you know  yes i know he is hes not nearly so young a man as you are but i really think he is as strong hes a wonderful man for his years certainly  im delighted to hear it said sir lionel a keen judge of character however scrutinizing the colonels face closely would not then have read much warm delight therein depicted  you rather like him on the whole theneh george  well i really think i do i am sure i ought to like him but  well george speak out you and i need have no secrets  secrets no ive no secret my uncle has a way of saying too much himself about what he does for one  sends in the bill too ofteneh george  if it is to be a bill let him say so i for one shall not blame him there is no reason he should give me anything but situated as i have been at oxford it would have been almost absurd in me to refuse his allowance  quite absurd  when he knew i was coming out to you he made pritchettyou know pritchett  and his handwritingvery well indeed  he made pritchett put three hundred pounds to my credit that was over and above my allowance well i did almost make up my mind to return that as it is i have not touched it and i think i shall repay it  for heavens sake do no such thing it would be an offence which he would never forgive sir lionel did say so much with something of parental energy in his tone and manner  yes sir but to be told of it  but he does not ask you to pay it him back again  if he asks youis not that the same thing but you hardly understand me or him either  i think i understand him george i wonder whether they could give us a cup of coffee here  of course they can and george rang the bell  perhaps so but as far as my experience goes wherever englishmen frequent there the coffee is spoilt englishmen as far as i can see have a partiality for chicory but none at all for coffee  what i mean sir is this connected as i and my uncle are together seeing that he has all my life here george paused a moment for what he was about to say might have seemed to imply a censure on his father  paid your schoolbills and all that sort of thing filled in sir lionel  yes as he has always done that it seemed so natural that i should take what he gave me  quite natural you could have done nothing else  and now he speaks of it as thoughas thoughof course i am under an obligation to hima very deep obligation i understand that and should not fret at it but he thinks of it as though i had been to blame in spending his money when i see him next hell say something of the same sort about that three hundred pounds all i can do is to remind him that i did not ask for it and tell him that he may have it back again  do nothing of the kind george said sir lionel who regarded as little less than lunacy on his sons part this declared intention to refund money to a rich man i know very well what you mean it is disagreeable to be reminded of money that you have spent  but i havent spent it  well of money that you have received but what can you do it is not your fault as you truly say it would be absurd and ungrateful too if you were to decline to take such trifles from your own uncle especially seeing what he has done for you it is his manner and that was always disagreeable especially in money matters and so having given to his son the best advice he had to offer sir lionel sipped his coffee very badvery bad indeed it always is at these english places if i could have my own way i would always keep out of english haunts in this respect sir lionel had had his own way during the greater portion of his life  before they parted for the evening george communicated to his father the great fact of miss todds picnic as settled for the next day and sir lionel expressed himself as willing to make one of the party if miss todd could be induced to extend to him the light of her countenance on this head young bertram though his own acquaintance had certainly been short thought that he might take on himself to answer people soon get intimate with each other at such places as jerusalem when you have been up the great pyramid with a lady the chances are you know more about her than you would do from a years acquaintance fostered by a dozen london parties and a journey up the nile with a man may be considered quite equal to three years spent together at the same collegethat is if the fellowtravellers be young after a certain age men never become really intimate let their relations with each other be ever so close  there will be a miss baker there sir who says she knows you and a miss waddington a very fine girl who at any rate knows my name  what caroline waddington  yes caroline waddington  she is a ward of your uncle  so miss baker tells me but i never heard my uncle mention them indeed he never mentions anything  it will be very desirable that you should know miss waddington there is no saying what your uncle may do with his money yes ill go to the picnic only i hope the place is not distant so that matter was settled     chapter ix  miss todds picnic   that matter of obtaining permission for sir lionel to join the picnic was not found difficult of arrangement goodlooking pleasantmannered sir lionels who bear the queens commission and have pleasant military ways with them are welcome enough at such parties as these even though they be sixty years of age when george mentioned the matter to miss todd that lady declared herself delighted she had heard she said of the distinguished arrival at the hotel but she had been almost afraid to ask such a man as sir lionel to join their foolish little party then miss baker who in this affair bore the next authority to miss todd declared that she had intended to ask him taking upon herself the freedom of an old acquaintance and so that matter was arranged  the party was not to be a large one there was miss todd the compounder of it a maiden lady fat fair and perhaps almost forty a jolly jovial lady intent on seeing the world and indifferent to many of its prejudices and formal restraints if she threw herself in sir lionels way people would of course say that she wanted to marry him but she did not care a straw what people said if she found sir lionel agreeable she would throw herself in his way so she told miss bakerwith perhaps more courage than the occasion required  then there was mrs and miss jones miss jones was the young lady who lost her parasol on the mount of offence and so recklessly charged the arab children of siloam with the theft mr jones was also in jerusalem but could not be persuaded to attend at miss todds behest he was steadily engaged in antiquarian researches being minded to bring out to the world some startling new theory as to certain points in bible chronology and topography he always went about the city with a trowel and a big set of tablets and certain among the more enthusiastic of the visitors to jerusalem had put him down as an infidel  there were also mr and mrs huntera bridegroom and bride now on their wedding trip a somewhat fashionable couple who were both got up with considerable attention as to oriental costume mrs hunter seemed to think a good deal about her trousers and mr hunters mind was equally taken up with the fact that he had ceased to wear any they had a knowing way of putting on their turbans and carried their sashes gracefully those however who had seen mr hunter roll himself into his sash were of opinion that sooner or later he would suffer from vertigo in his head miss baker and her niece had fallen in with these people and were considered to be of the same party  there was a clergyman to be there one mr cruse the gentleman who had been so keenly annoyed at the absence of potatoes from the dinner board he was travelling in charge of a young gentleman of fortune a mr pott by whose fond parents the joint expense of the excursion was defrayed mr cruse was a university man of course had been educated at trinity college cambridge and piqued himself much on being far removed from the dangers of puseyism he was a man not of a happy frame of mind and seemed to find that from dan to beersheba everything in truth was barren he was goodlooking unmarried not without some talent and seemed to receive from the ladies there assembled more attention than his merits altogether deserved  mr mgabbery had talked of not going but had been overpersuaded by the goodnatured miss todd he had become almost overwhelmed by the intensity of his feelings in regard to the sacred associations of the place since george bertram had contrived to seat himself between miss baker and miss waddington up to that moment no one had been merrier than he he had so he had flattered himself altogether cut out mr cruse in that special quarter the good graces namely of those two ladies and had been prepared to take on his own shoulders all the hard work of the picnic but now things were altered with him he had some doubts whether the sacredness of the valley would not be desecrated by such a proceeding and consulted mr cruse on the matter hitherto these gentlemen had not been close friends but now they allied themselves as against a common enemy mr cruse did not care much for associations seemed indeed to think that any special attention to sacred places savoured of idolatry and professed himself willing to eat his dinner on any of the hills or in any of the valleys round jerusalem fortified with so good an opinion and relying on the excellence of his purpose mr mgabbery gave way and renewed his offers of assistance to miss todd  there was also mr pott mr cruses young charge the son of a man largely engaged in the linen trade a youth against whom very little can be alleged his time at present was chiefly given up to waiting on miss jones and luckier in this respect than his tutor mr cruse he had no rival to interfere with his bliss  miss baker and miss waddington made up the party of the former little more need be said and that little should be all in her praise she was a ladylike softmannered easytempered woman devoted to her niece but not strongly addicted to personal exertions on her own part the fact that she was now at jerusalem so far away from her own comfortable drawingroom sufficiently proved that she was devoted to her niece  and now for caroline waddington our donna primissima her qualities attributes and virtues must be given more in detail than those of her companions at the picnic seeing that she is destined to fill a prominent place upon our canvas  at the time of which we are speaking she might perhaps be twenty years of age but her general appearance her figure and especially the strong character marked in her face would have led one to suspect that she was older she was certainly at that time a beautiful girlvery beautiful handsome in the outline of her face graceful and dignified in her mien nay sometimes almost majestica juno rather than a venus but any paris who might reject her awed by the rigour of her dignity would know at the time that he was wrong in his judgment she was tall but not so tall as to be unfeminine in her height her head stood nobly on her shoulders giving to her bust that ease and grace of which sculptors are so fond and of which tightlaced stays are so utterly subversive her hair was very darknot black but the darkest shade of brown and was worn in simple rolls on the side of her face it was very long and very glossy soft as the richest silk and gifted apparently with a delightful aptitude to keep itself in order no stray jagged ends would show themselves if by chance she removed her bonnet nor did it even look as though it had been prematurely crushed and required to be afresh puffed out by some headdressers mechanism she had the forehead of a juno white broad and straight not shining as are some foreheads which seem as though an insufficient allowance of skin had been vouchsafed for their covering it was a forehead on which an angel might long to press his lipsif angels have lips and if as we have been told they do occasionally descend from their starry heights to love the daughters of men  nor would an angel with a shade of human passion in his temperament have been contented with her forehead her mouth had all the richness of youth and the full enticing curves and ruby colour of anglosaxon beauty caroline waddington was no pale passionless goddess her graces and perfections were human and in being so were the more dangerous to humanity her forehead we have said or should have said was perfect we dare not affirm quite so much in praise of her mouth there was sometimes a hardness there not in the lines of the feature itself but in the expression which it conveyed a want of tenderness perhaps of trust and too much selfconfidence it may be for a womans character the teeth within it however were never excelled by any that ever graced the face of a woman  her nose was not quite grecian had it been so her face might have been fairer but it would certainly have been less expressive nor could it be called retroussé but it had the slightest possible tendency in that direction and the nostrils were more open more ready to breathe forth flashes of indignation than is ever the case with a truly grecian nose  the contour of her face was admirable nothing could exceed in beauty the lines of her cheeks or the shape and softness of her chin those who were fastidious in their requirements might object to them that they bore no dimple but after all it is only prettiness that requires a dimple fullblown beauty wants no such adventitious aid  but her eyes miss waddingtons eyes the eyes are the poets strongest fortress it is for their description that he most gathers up his forces and puts forth all his strength what of her eyes well her eyes were bright enough large enough well set in her head they were clever eyes toonay honest eyes also which is better but they were not softly feminine eyes they never hid themselves beneath their soft fringes when too curiously looked into as a young girl at her window half hides herself behind her curtain they were bold eyes i was going to say but the word would signify too much in their dispraise daring eyes i would rather say courageous expressive never shrinking sometimes also suspicious they were fit rather for a man than for so beautiful a girl as our caroline waddington  but perhaps the most wonderful grace about her was her walk vera incessu patuit dea alas how few women can walk how many are wilfully averse to attempting any such motion they scuffle they trip they trot they amble they waddle they crawl they drag themselves on painfully as though the flounces and furbelows around them were a burden too heavy for easy graceful motion but except in spain they rarely walk in this respect our heroine was equal to an andalusian  such and so great were miss waddingtons outward graces some attempt must also be made to tell of those inner stores with which this gallant vessel was freighted for after all the outward bravery is not everything with a woman it may be that a man in selecting his wife rarely looks for much elsefor that in addition of course to money but though he has looked for little else some other things do frequently force themselves on his attention soon after the knot is tied and as caroline waddington will appear in these pages as wife as well as maid as a mans companion as well as his plaything it may be well to say now something as to her fitness for such occupation  we will say then that she was perhaps even more remarkable for her strength of mind than for her beauty of person at present she was a girl of twenty and hardly knew her own power but the time was to come when she should know it and should use it she was possessed of a stubborn enduring manly will capable of conquering much and not to be conquered easily she had a mind which if rightly directed might achieve great and good things but of which it might be predicted that it would certainly achieve something and that if not directed for good it might not improbably direct itself for evil it was impossible that she should ever grow into a piece of domestic furniture contented to adapt itself to such uses as a marital tyrant might think fit to require of it if destined to fall into good hands she might become a happy loving wife but it was quite as possible that she should be neither happy nor loving  like most other girls she no doubt thought much of what might be her lot in lovethought much of loving though she had never yet loved it has been said that her turn of mind was manly but it must not on that account be imagined that her wishes and aspirations were at present other than feminine her heart and feelings were those of a girl at any rate as yet but her will and disposition were masculine in their firmness  for one so young she had great and dangerous faults of charactergreat as being injurious to her happiness and dangerous as being likely to grow with her years her faults were not young faults though true herself she was suspicious of others though trustworthy she was not trustful and what person who is not trustful ever remains trustworthy who can be fit for confidence who cannot himself confide she was imperious too when occasion offered itself to her proud spirit with her aunt whom she loved she was not so her she was content to persuade using a soft voice and a soft eye but with those whom she could not persuade and wished to rule her voice was sometimes stern enough and her eye far from soft  she was a clever girl capable of talking well and possessed of more information than most young ladies of the same age she had been at an excellent school if any schools are really excellent for young ladies but there was nevertheless something in her style of thought hardly suitable to the softness of girlhood she could speak of sacred things with a mocking spirit the mockery of philosophy rather than of youth she had little or no enthusiasm though there was passion enough deep seated in her bosom she suffered from no transcendentalism she saw nothing through a halo of poetic inspiration among the various tints of her atmosphere there was no rose colour she preferred wit to poetry and her smile was cynical rather than joyous  now i have described my donna primissima with hardly sufficient detail for my own satisfaction doubtless with far too much for yours oh my reader it must be added however that she was an orphan that she lived entirely with her aunt miss baker that her father had been in early life a sort of partner with mr george bertram that mr george bertram was her guardian though he had hitherto taken but little trouble in looking after her whatever trouble he may have taken in looking after her money and that she was possessed of a moderate fortune say about four thousand pounds  a picnic undertaken from jerusalem must in some respects be unlike any picnic elsewhere ladies cannot be carried to it in carriages because at jerusalem there are no carriages nor can the provisions be conveyed even in carts for at jerusalem there are no carts the stock of comestibles was therefore packed in hampers on a camels back and sent off to the valley by one route whereas miss todd and her friends went on horseback and on donkeyback by another and a longer road  it may as well be mentioned that miss todd was a little ashamed of the magnitude to which her undertaking had attained her original plan had merely been thisthat she and a few others should ride through the valleys round the city and send a basket of sandwiches to meet them at some hungry point on the road now there was a cortège of eleven persons exclusive of the groomboys a boiled ham sundry chickens hardboiled eggs and champagne miss todd was somewhat ashamed of this here in england one would hardly inaugurate a picnic to kensal green or the highgate cemetery nor select the tombs of our departed great ones as a shelter under which to draw ones corks but miss todd boasted of high spirits when this little difficulty had been first suggested to her by mr mgabbery she had scoffed at it and had enlarged her circle in a spirit of mild bravado then chance had done more for her and now she was doomed to preside over a large party of revellers immediately over the ashes of james the just  none but englishmen or englishwomen do such things as this to other people is wanting sufficient pluck for such enterprises is wanting also a certain mixture of fun honest independence and bad taste let us go into some church on the continentin italy we will saywhere the walls of the churches still boast of the great works of the great masterslook at that man standing on the very altarstep while the priest is saying his mass look at his gray shootingcoat his thick shoes his wideawake hat stuck under one arm and his stick under the other while he holds his operaglass to his eyes how he shuffles about to get the best point of sight quite indifferent as to clergy or laity all that bellringing incenseflinging and breaststriking is nothing to him he has paid dearly to be brought thither he has paid the guide who is kneeling a little behind him he is going to pay the sacristan who attends him he is quite ready to pay the priest himself if the priest would only signify his wish that way but he has come there to see that fresco and see it he will respecting that he will soon know more than either the priest or his worshippers perhaps some servant of the church coming to him with submissive almost suppliant gesture begs him to step back just for one moment the lover of art glares at him with insulted look and hardly deigns to notice him further he merely turns his eye to his murray puts his hat down on the altarstep and goes on studying his subject all the worldgerman frenchman italian spaniardall men of all nations know that that ugly gray shootingcoat must contain an englishman he cares for no one if any one upsets him he can do much towards righting himself and if more be wanted has he not lord malmesbury or lord clarendon at his back but what would this englishman say if his place of worship were disturbed by some wandering italian  it was somewhat in this way with miss todd she knew that what she was about to do was rather absurd but she had the blood of the todds warm at her heart the todds were a people not easily frightened and miss todd was not going to disgrace her lineage true she had not intended to feed twelve people over a jewish sepulchre but as the twelve people had assembled looking to her for food she was not the woman to send them away fasting so she gallantly led the way through the gate of jaffa sir lionel attending her on a donkey  when once out of the town they turned sharp to the left their path lay through the valley of gihon through the valley of hinnom down among those strange open sepulchres deeply excavated in caves on the mountainsidessepulchres quite unlike those below in the valley of jehoshaphat there they are all covered each stone marking a grave but here they lie in open catacombsin caves at least of which the entrance is open the hardy stranger crawling in may lay his hand within the cellnay may crawl up into it if he willin which have mouldered the bones of some former visitor to jerusalem for this so saith tradition is the field purchased with the reward of iniquity it was the buryingplace for strangers aceldama the field of blood  but where be these bones now for the catacombs are mostly empty mr pott descending as far as he could into the deepest of them did at last bring forth a skull and two parts of a backbone did present the former with much grace to miss jones who on beholding it very nearly fell from off her donkey  for shame pott said mr cruse how could you handle anything so disgusting you are desecrating the grave of some unfortunate mussulman who has probably died within the last fifty years mr cruse was always intent on showing that he believed none of the traditions of the country  it was quite dreadful of you mr pott said miss jones quite dreadful indeed i dont know what you would not do but i am quite sure he was never a mahomedan  he looked like a jew didnt he said pott  oh i did not see the face but he was certainly either a jew or a christian only think perhaps those remains have been there for nearly eighteen hundred years is it not wonderful mamma it was just here that i lost my parasol  sir lionel had headed the cavalcade with miss todd but george bertram was true to his new friends miss baker and miss waddington so also for a time were mr mgabbery and mr cruse as the aunt and niece rode beside each other a great part of this gallant attention fell upon the former indeed the easiest way of addressing the beauty was often found to be through the beautys aunt and it may be doubted whether mr mgabbery would not have retreated long since in despair but for the scintillations of civility which fell to him from miss bakers goodhumour he had had the good fortune of some previous days journeying with them on horseback through the desert and had found that privilege gave him an inestimable advantage over mr cruse why should it not also suffice as regarded this new comer he had held much commune with himself on the subject that morning had called himself to task for his own pusillanimity and had then fortified his courage with the old reflection about fair ladies and faint heartsand also with a glass of brandy he was therefore disposed to make himself very unpleasant to poor george if occasion should require  how delighted you must have been to see your father said miss baker who though her temper would not permit her to be uncivil to mr mgabbery would readily have dispensed with that gentlemans attendance  indeed i was i never saw him before you know  never saw him your father before mr bertram said caroline why aunt mary says that i have seen him  i never saw him to remember him one doesnt count ones acquaintance before seven or eight years of age  your memory must be very bad then said mr mgabbery or your childhoods love for your father very slight i perfectly remember the sweetness of my mothers caresses when i was but three years old there is nothing miss waddington to equal the sweetness of a mothers kisses  i never knew them said she but i have found an aunts do nearly as well  a grandmothers are not bad said bertram looking very grave  i can never think of my mother without emotion continued mr mgabbery i remember as though it were yesterday when i first stood at her knee with a picturebook on her lap before me it is the furthest point to which memory carries meand the sweetest  i can remember back much before that said george a great deal before that listen to this miss baker my earliest impression was a hatred of dishonesty  i hope your views have not altered since said caroline  very materially i fear but i must tell you about my memory i was lying once in my cradle  you dont mean to tell me you remember that said mgabbery  perfectly as you do the picturebook well there i was lying miss baker with my little eyes wide open it is astonishing how much babies see though people never calculate on their having eyes at all i was lying on my back staring at the mantelpiece on which my mother had left her keybasket  you remember of course that it was her keybasket said miss waddington with a smile that made mgabbery clench his walkingstick in his hand  perfectly because she always kept her halfpence there also well there was a nurserygirl who used to be about me in those days i distinctly saw her go to that basket miss baker and take out a penny and i then made up my mind that the first use i would make of my coming speech should be to tell my mother that i think is the furthest point to which my memory carries me  the ladies laughed heartily but mr mgabbery frowned bitterly you must have dreamt it said he  it is just possible said george but i dont think it come miss waddington let us have your earliest recollections  ah mine will not be interesting they do not go back at all so far i think they have reference to bread and butter  i remember being very angry said miss baker because papa prophesied that i should be an old maid it was very hard on me for his prophecy no doubt brought about the fact  but the fact is no fact as yet said mr mgabbery with a smirking gallantry for which he ought to have been kicked  i beg your pardon mr mgabbery said miss waddington it is quite an established fact my aunt will never have my consent to marry and i am sure she will never dream of such a thing without it  and so mr mgabberys hopes in that direction are all at an end said george who was now able to speak to caroline without being heard by the others  i declare i think he has entertained some such idea for he never leaves my aunt alone for a minute he has been very civil very but mr bertram perhaps you know that a very civil man may be a bore  he always is i think no man is really liked who is ever ready to run on messages and tie up parcels it is generally considered that a man knows his own value and that if he be willing to do such work such work is fit for him  you never do anything to oblige then  very rarely at least not in the little domestic line if one could have an opportunity of picking a lady out of a fire or saving her from the clutches of an italian bravo or getting her a fortune of twenty thousand pounds one would be inclined to do it in such cases there would be no contempt mixed up with the ladys gratitude but ladies are never really grateful to a man for turning himself into a flunky  ah i like to be attended to all the same  then there is mr mgabbery half a smile will keep him at your feet the whole day  mr mgabbery and poor miss baker were now walking behind them side by side but his felicity in this respect was not at all sufficient for that gentleman in their long journey from egypt he and miss waddington had always been within speaking distance and who was the stranger of today that was thus to come and separate them  miss waddington he cried do you remember when your horse stumbled in the sand at el arish ah what a pleasant day that was  but you have not recalled it by a very pleasant incident i was very nearly being thrown out of my saddle  and how we had to wait for our dinner at gaza till the camels came up and mr mgabbery urging on his horse brought him up once more abreast with that of miss waddington  i shall soon have as great a horror of gaza as samson had said she sotto voce i almost feel myself already in bonds under philistian yoke whenever it is mentioned  talking of recollections that journey will certainly be among the sunniest of my lifes memories said mr mgabbery  it was sunny certainly said miss waddington for the heat of the desert had been oppressive  ah and so sweet that encamping in your own tent preparing your own meals having everything as it were within yourself civilized life has nothing to offer equal to that a person who has only gone from city to city or from steamboat to steamboat knows nothing of oriental life does he miss waddington this was intended as a blow at bertram who had got to jerusalem without sleeping under canvas  what ignorant wretches the natives must be said george for they apparently sleep as regularly in their own beds as any stupid christian in england  i am not sure that even mr mgabbery would admire the tents so much if he had not some christian comforts along with him  his brandyflask and dressingcase for instance said george  yes and his mattress and blankets said caroline  his potted meat and preserved soup  and especially his pot to boil his potatoes in  that was mr cruse said mr mgabbery quite angrily for myself i do not care a bit about potatoes  so it was mr mgabbery and i beg your pardon it is mr cruse whose soul is among the potatoes but if i remember right it was you who were so angry when the milk ran out then mr mgabbery again receded and talked to mrs jones about his associations  how thoroughly the turks and arabs beat us in point of costume said mrs hunter to mr cruse  it will be very hard at any rate for any of them to beat you said the tutor since i have been out here i have seen no one adopt their ways with half as much grace as you do  mrs hunter looked down well pleased to her ancles which were covered and needed to be covered by no ridinghabit i was not thinking so much of myself as of mr hunter women you know mr cruse are nothing in this land  except when imported from christendom mrs hunter  but i was speaking of gentlemens toilets dont you think the turkish dress very becoming i declare i shall never bear to see charles again in a coat and waistcoat and trousers  nor he you in an ordinary silk gown puffed out with crinoline  well i suppose we must live in the east altogether then i am sure i should not object i know one thingi shall never endure to put a bonnet on my head again bytheby mr cruse who is this sir lionel bertram that has just come is he a baronet  oh dear no nothing of that sort i imagine i dont quite know who he is but that young man is his son  they say hes very clever dont they  he has that sort of boys cleverness i dare say which goes towards taking a good degree mr cruse himself had not shone very brightly at the university  miss waddington seems very much smitten with him dont you think so  miss waddington is a beautiful girl and variableas beautiful girls sometimes are  mr cruse dont be satirical  praise undeserved is satire in disguise said mr cruse not quite understanding himself why he made the quotation but it did exceedingly well mrs hunter smiled sweetly on him said that he was a dangerous man and that no one would take him to be a clergyman upon which mr cruse begged that she would spare his character  and now they had come to the fountain of enrogel and having dismounted from their steeds stood clustering about the low wall which surrounds the little pool of water  this sir lionel said miss todd acting cicerone is the fountain of enrogel which you know so well by name  ah said sir lionel it seems rather dirty at present doesnt it  that is because the water is so low when there has been much rain there is quite a flood here those little gardens and fields there are the most fertile spot round jerusalem because there is so much irrigation here  thats where the jerusalem artichokes are grown i suppose  it is a singular fact that though there are plenty of artichokes that special plant is unknown said mr mgabbery do you remember miss waddington  but miss waddington had craftily slipped round the corner of the wall and was now admiring mrs hunters costume on the other side of the fountain  and that is the village of siloam continued miss todd pointing to a range of cabins some of which seemed to be cut out of the rock on the hillside on her right hand as she looked up towards the valley of jehoshaphat and that is the pool of siloam sir lionel we shall go up there  ah said sir lionel again  is it not interesting said miss todd and a smiling gleam of satisfaction spread itself across her jovial ruddy face  very said sir lionel but dont you find it rather hot  yes it is warm but one gets accustomed to that i do so like to find myself among these names which used to torment me so when i was a child i had all manner of mysterious ideas about the pool of bethesda and the beautiful gate about the hill of sion and gehenna and the brook cedron i had a sort of belief that these places were scattered wide over the unknown deserts of asia and now sir lionel i am going to show them all to you in one day  would they were scattered wider that the pleasure might last the longer said sir lionel taking off his hat as he bowed to miss todd but putting it on again very quickly as he felt the heat  yes but the mystery the beautiful mystery is all gone said miss jones i shall never feel again about these places as i used to do  nor i either i hope said mr pott i always used to catch it for scripture geography  yes the mystery of your childhood will be gone miss jones said mr mgabbery who in his present state of hopelessness as regarded miss waddington was illnaturedly interfering with young pott the mystery of your childhood will be gone but another mystery a more matured mystery will be created in your imagination your associations will henceforth bear a richer tint  i dont know that said miss jones who did not approve of being interfered with a bit better than did mr pott  and then they remounted and the cavalcade moved on they turned up the rising ground towards the city wall and leaving on the left the gardens in which jerusalem artichokes did not grow they came to the pool of siloam here most of them again descended and climbed down to the water which bursts out from its underground channel into a cool but damp and somewhat dirty ravine  you are my guide miss todd in everything said sir lionel is it necessary that i should study scripture geography down in that hole if you bid me ill do it  well sir lionel ill let you off the more especially as i have been down there myself already and got dreadfully draggled in doing so oh i declare there is miss waddington in the water  miss waddington was in the water not in such a manner gentlest of readers as to occasion the slightest shock to your susceptible nerves but in such a degree as to be very disagreeable to her boots and the cause of infinite damage to her stockings george bertram had handed her down and when in the act of turning round to give similar assistance to some other adventurous lady had left her alone on the slippery stones of course any young lady would take advantage of such an unguarded moment to get into some catastrophe  alas and again alas unfortunately mr mgabbery had been the first to descend to the pool he had calculated cunningly enough that in being there seeing that the space was not very large the duty must fall to his lot of receiving into his arms any such ladies as chose to come downmiss waddington who was known to be very adventurous among the number he was no sooner there however than george bertram jumped in almost upon him and hitherto he had not had an opportunity of touching miss waddingtons glove but now it seemed that fortune was to reward him  good heavens cried mr mgabbery as he dashed boldly into the flood thereby splashing the water well up into carolines face there was not much occasion for this display for the gentleman could have assisted the lady quite as effectually without even wetting his toes but common misfortunes do create common sympathiesor at least they should do would it not be natural that miss waddington and mr mgabbery when both wet through up to their knees should hang together in their sufferings make common cause of it talk each of what the other felt and understood so well nay might it not be probable that in obedience to the behests of some wise senior they might be sent back to the city togetherunderstand o reader that the wall of jerusalem had never yet been distant from them half a mileback we say together to get dry stockings to achieve such an object mr mgabbery would have plunged bodily beneath the wavehad the wave been deep enough to receive his body as it was it only just came over the tops of his boots filling them comfortably with water  oh mr mgabbery exclaimed the ungrateful lady now you have drowned me altogether  i never saw anything so awkward in my life said mgabbery looking up at bertram with a glance that should have frozen his blood  nor i either said caroline  what had you better do pray give me your hand miss waddington to leave you in such a manner as that we managed better in the desert did we not miss waddington you really must go back to jerusalem for dry shoes and stockings you really must where is miss baker give me your hand miss waddington both hands you had better  so much said mr mgabbery while struggling in the pool of siloam but in the meantime miss waddington turning quickly round had put out her hand to bertram who was standingand i regret to say all but laughingon the rock above her and before mr mgabberys eloquence was over she was safely landed among her friends  oh mr bertram said she you are a horrid man ill never forgive you had i trusted myself to poor mr mgabbery i should have been dryfooted at this moment and she shook the water from off her dress making a damp circle around herself as a newfoundland dog sometimes does if i served you right i should make you go to the hotel for a pair of shoes  do miss waddington make him go said sir lionel if he doesnt ill go myself  i shall be delighted said mr cruse my donkey is very quick and the clergyman mounted ready to start only i shouldnt know where to find the things  no mr cruse and i couldnt tell you besides there is nothing i like so much as wet feetexcept wet strings to my hat for which latter i have to thank mr mgabbery  i will go of course said mgabbery emerging slowly from the pool of course it is for me to go i shall be glad of an opportunity of getting dry boots myself  i am so sorry you have got wet said the beauty  oh its nothing i like it i was not going to see you in the water without coming to you pray tell me what i shall fetch i know all your boxes so well you know so i can have no difficulty will they be in the one with c w on it in brass nails that was the one which fell off the camel near the temple of dagon poor mr mgabbery that ride through the desert was an oasis in his otherwise somewhat barren life never to be forgotten  i am the sinner miss waddington said george at last and on me let the punishment fall i will go back to jerusalem and in order that you may suffer no inconvenience i will bring hither all your boxes and all your trunks on the backs of a score of arab porters  you know you intend to do no such thing said she you have already told me your ideas as to waiting upon young ladies  there was however at last some whispering between miss baker and her niece in which mr mgabbery vainly attempted to join and the matter ended in one of the grooms being sent into the town laden with a bunch of keys and a written message for miss bakers servant before dinnertime miss waddington had comfortably changed her stockings in the upper story of the tomb of st james and mr mgabberybut mr mgabberys wet feet did not receive the attention which they deserved  passing on from the pool of siloam they came to a watercourse at which there was being conducted a considerable washing of clothes the washerwomenthe term is used as being generic to the trade and not to the sex for some of the performers were menwere divided into two classes who worked separately not so separately but what they talked together and were on friendly terms but still there was a division the upper washerwomen among whom the men were at work were mahomedans the lower set were jewesses as to the men but little observation was made except that they seemed expert enough dabbing their clothes rubbing in the soap and then rinsing very much in the manner of christians but it was impossible not to look at the women the female followers of the prophet had as they always have some pretence of a veil for their face in the present instance they held in their teeth a dirty blue calico rag which passed over their heads acting also as a shawl by this contrivance intended only to last while the christians were there they concealed one side of the face and the chin no one could behold them without wishing that the eclipse had been total no epithet commonly applied to women in this country could adequately describe their want of comeliness they kept their faces to their work and except that they held their rags between their teeth they gave no sign of knowing that strangers were standing by them  it was different with the jewesses when they were stared at they stood up boldly and stared againand well worth looking at they were there were three or four of them young women all though already mothers for their children were playing on the grass behind them each bore on her head that moonshaped headdress which is there the symbol of a jewess and no more graceful tiara can a woman wear it was wonderful that the same land should produce women so different as were these close neighbours the mahomedans were apelike but the jewesses were glorious specimens of feminine creation they were somewhat too bold perhaps there was too much daring in their eyes as with their naked shoulders and bosoms nearly bare they met the eyes of the men that were looking at them but there was nothing immodest in their audacity it was defiant rather and scornful  there was one among them a girl perhaps of eighteen who might have been a sculptors model not only for form and figure but for the expression of her countenance and the beautiful turn of her head and shoulders she was very unlike the jewess that is ordinarily pictured to us she had no beaky nose no thin face no sharp small black bright eyes she was fair as esther was fair her forehead and face were broad her eyes large and open yet she was a jewess plainly a jewess such a jewess as are many still to be seenin palestine at least if not elsewhere  when they came upon her she was pressing the dripping water from some large piece of linen a sheet probably in doing this she had cunningly placed one end firmly under her foot upon a stone and then with her hands raised high above her head she twisted and retwisted it till the water oozing out fell in heavy drops round her feet her arms and neck were bare as were also her feet and it was clear that she put forth to her work as much strength as usually falls to the lot of a woman in any country  she was very fair to look at but there was about her no feminine softness do not laugh reader unless you have already stopped to think and thinking have decided that a girl of eighteen being a washerwoman must therefore be without feminine softness i would not myself say that it is so but here at least there was no feminine softness no tenderness in the eye no young shame at being gazed at she paused for a moment in her work and gave back to them all the look they gave her and then as though they were beneath her notice she strained once more at her task and so dropped the linen to the ground  if i knew how to set about the bargain i would take that woman home with me and mould her to be my wife such was george bertrams outspoken enthusiasm  moulded wives never answer well said sir lionel  i think he would prefer one that had been dipped whispered miss todd to the colonel but her allusion to miss waddingtons little accident on the water and to the chandlers wares was not thoroughly appreciated  it has been said that the hampers were to be sent to the tomb of zachariah but they agreed to dine immediately opposite to that of st james the less this is situated in the middle of the valley of jehoshaphat in the centre of myriads of jewish tombs directly opposite to the wall built with those huge temple stones not many feet over the then dry watercourse of the brook cedron such was the spot chosen by miss todd for her cold chickens and champagne  of course they wandered about a little in pairs and trios while these dainties were being prepared for them this st jamess tomb is a little temple built on the side of the rock singularly graceful the front towards the city is adorned with two or three roman pillars bearing if i remember rightly plain capitals there is i think no pediment above them or any other adjunct of architectural pretension but the pillars themselves so unlike anything else there so unlike any other sepulchral monument that i at least have seen make the tomb very remarkable that it was built for a tomb is i suppose not to be doubted though for whose ashes it was in fact erected may perhaps be questioned i am not aware that any claimant has been named as a rival to st james  the most conspicuous of these monuments is that which tradition allots to absalom close to this other which we have just described it consists of a solid square erection bearing what for want of a better name i must call a spire with curved sides the sides curving inwards as they fall from the apex to the base this spiral roof too low and dumpy to be properly called a spire is very strong built with stones laid in circles flat on each other the circles becoming smaller as they rise towards the top why absalom should have had such a tomb who can say that his bones were buried there the jews at least believe for jewish fathers as they walk by with their children bid their boys each cast a stone there to mark their displeasure at the child who rebelled against his parent it is now nearly full of such stones  while miss waddington was arranging her toilet within the tomb of st james her admirers below were not making themselves agreeable to each other it was the awkwardest thing i ever saw said mr cruse to mr mgabbery in a low tone but not so low but what bertram was intended to hear it  very said mr mgabbery some men are awkward by natureseem indeed as though they were never intended for ladies society  and then to do nothing but laugh at the mischief he had caused that may be the way at oxford but we used to flatter ourselves at cambridge that we had more politeness  cambridge said bertram turning round and speaking with the most courteous tone he could command were you at cambridge i thought i had understood that you were educated at st bees mr cruse had been at st bees but had afterwards gone to the university  i was a scholar at st johns sir replied mr cruse with much dignity mgabbery shall we take a stroll across the valley till the ladies are ready and so having sufficiently shown their contempt for the awkward oxonian they moved away  two very nice fellows are they not said bertram to mr hunter its a stroke of good fortune to fall in with such men as that at such a place as this  theyre very well in their own way said mr hunter who was lying on the grass and flattering himself that he looked more turkish than any turk he had yet seen but they dont seem to me to be quite at home here in the east few englishman in fact are cruse is always wanting boiled vegetables and mgabbery cant eat without a regular knife and fork give me a pilau and a bit of bread and i can make a capital dinner without anything to help me but my own fingers  cruse isnt a bad kind of coach said young pott he never interferes with a fellow his only fault is that hes so spoony about women  theyre gentlemanlike men said sir lionel very one cant expect you know that every one should set the thames on fire  cruse wont do that at any rate put in mr pott  but mr mgabbery perhaps may suggested george at any rate he made a little blaze just now at the brook above and then the ladies came down and the business of the day commenced seeing which the two injured ones returned to their posts  i am very fond of a picnic said sir lionel as seated on a corner of a tombstone he stretched out his glass towards miss todd who had insisted on being his cupbearer for the occasion excessively fond i mean the eating and drinking part of course there is only one thing i like better and that is having my dinner under a roof upon a table and with a chair to sit on  oh you ungrateful man after all that i am doing for you  i spoke of picnics generally miss todd could i always have my nectar filled to me by a goddess i would be content with no room but expect to recline on a cloud and have thunderbolts ready at my right hand  what a beautiful jupiter your father would make mr bertram  yes and what a happy king of gods with such a juno as you miss todd  ha ha ha oh dear no i pretend to no rôle higher than that of hebe mr mgabbery may i thank you for a slice of ham i declare these tombs are very nice tables are they not only i suppose its very improper mr cruse im so sorry that we have no potatoes but there is salad i know  talking of chairs said mr hunter after all there has been no seat yet invented by man equal to a divan either for ease dignity or grace mr hunter had long been practising to sit crosslegged and was now attempting it on on the grass for the first time in public it had at any rate this inconvenient effect that he was perfectly useless for when once seated he could neither help himself nor any one else  the cigar divan is a very nice lounge when one has nothing better to do suggested mr pott they have capital coffee there  a divan and a sofa are much the same i suppose said george  but to this mr hunter demurred and explained at some length what were the true essential qualities of a real turkish divan long before he had finished however george had got up to get a clean plate for miss waddington and in sitting down had turned his back upon the turk the unfortunate turk could not revenge himself as in his present position any motion was very difficult to him  picnic dinners are much the same in all parts of the world and chickens and salad are devoured at jerusalem very much in the same way as they are at other placesexcept indeed by a few such proficients in turkish manners as mr hunter the little arab children stood around them expectant of scraps as i have seen children do also in england and the conversation which was dull enough at the commencement of the feast became more animated when a few corks had flown as the afternoon wore on mr mgabbery became almost bellicose under the continual indifference of his ladylove and had it not been for the better sense of our herosuch better sense may be expected from gentlemen who are successfulsomething very like a quarrel would have taken place absolutely in the presence of miss todd  perhaps miss waddington was not free from all blame in the matter it would be unjust to accuse her of flirtingof flirting at least in the objectionable sense of the word it was not in her nature to flirt but it was in her nature to please herself without thinking much of the manner in which she did it and it was in her nature also to be indifferent as to what others thought of her though she had never before known george bertram there was between them that sort of family knowledge of each other which justified a greater intimacy than between actual strangers then too he pleased her while mr mgabbery only bored she had not yet thought enough about the worlds inhabitants to have recognized and adjudicated on the difference between those who talk pleasantly and those who do not but she felt that she was amused by this young doublefirst oxonian and she had no idea of giving up amusement when it came in her way of such amusement she had hitherto known but little miss baker herself was perhaps rather dull miss bakers friends at littlebath were not very bright but caroline had never in her heart accused them of being other than amusing it is only by knowing his contrast that we recognize a bore when we meet him it was in this manner that she now began to ascertain that mr mgabbery certainly had bored her ascertaining it she threw him off at onceperhaps without sufficient compunction  ill cut that cocks comb before i have done with him said mgabbery to his friend mr cruse as they rode up towards st stephens gate together the rest of the cavalcade following them sir lionel had suggested to miss todd that they might as well return somewhat early though it was seeing that there was cause why that feast of reason and that flow of soul should no longer be continued by them round the yet only halfemptied hampers so the ladies had climbed up into the tomb and there adjusted their hats and the gentlemen had seen to the steeds and the forks had been packed up and when mr mgabbery made the state of his mind known to mr cruse they were on their way back to jerusalem close to the garden of gethsemane  ill cut that young cocks comb yet before i have done with him repeated mr mgabbery  now mr cruse as being a clergyman was of course not a fighting man i shouldnt take any notice of him said he nor indeed of her either i do not think she is worth it  oh it isnt about that said mgabbery they were two women together and i therefore was inclined to show them some attention you know how those things go on from one thing to another it has come to this that they have depended on me for everything for the last three or four weeks  you havent paid any money for them have you  well no i cant exactly say that i have paid money for them that is to say they have paid their own bills and i have not lent them anything but i dare say you know that a man never travels with ladies in that free and easy way without feeling it in his pocket one is apt to do twenty things for them which one wouldnt do for oneself nor they for themselves if they had to pay the piper  now here a very useful moral may be deduced ladies take care how you permit yourselves to fall into intimacies with unknown gentlemen on your travels it is not pleasant to be spoken of as this man was speaking of miss baker and her niece the truth was that a more punctilious person in her money dealings than miss baker never carried a purse she had not allowed mr mgabbery so much as to lay out on her behalf a single piastre for oranges on the road nor had he been their sole companion on their journey through the desert they had come to jerusalem with a gentleman and his wife mr mgabbery had been kindly allowed to join them  well if i were you i should show them a cold shoulder said mr cruse and as to that intolerable puppy i should take no further notice of him except by cutting him dead  mr mgabbery at last promised to follow his friends advice and so miss todds picnic came to an end without bloodshed     chapter x  the effects of miss todds picnic   sir lionel did not participate violently either in his sons disgust at the falsehood of that holy sepulchre church nor in his enthusiasm as to the mount of olives in the former he walked about as he had done in many other foreign churches looked a little to the right and a little to the left observed that the roof seemed to be rather out of order declined entering the sanctum sanctorum and then asked whether there was anything more to be seen he did not care he said about going upstairs into the gallery and when george suggested that he should descend into the armenian chapel he observed that it appeared to be very dark and very crowded he looked at the turkish janitors without dismay and could not at all understand why george should not approve of them  he was equally cold and equally complaisant on the mount of olives he would willingly have avoided the ascent could he have done so without displeasing his son but george made a point of it a donkey was therefore got for him and he rode up  ah yes said he a very clear view of the city oh that was solomons temple was it and now they have a mosque there have they ah perhaps the brahmins will have a turn at it before the world is done its a barren sort of hill after all is it not  and then george tried very much in vain to make his father understand why he wished to go into the church  bytheby said sir lionelthey were then sitting exactly on the spot where george had placed himself before when he made that grand resolve to give up everything belonging to this world for the sake of being one of christs shepherdsbytheby george for heavens sake dont throw your uncle over in choosing a profession i certainly should be sorry to see you become an attorney  i have never thought of it for a moment said george  because with your abilities and at any rate with your chance of money i think you would be very much thrown away but considering his circumstances and yours were i you i would really submit almost to anything  i will not at any rate submit to that said george not very well able to reconcile his fathers tone to the spot on which they were sitting  well its your own affair my boy i have no right to interfere and shall not attempt to do so but of course i must be anxious if you did go into the church i suppose hed buy a living for you  certainly not i should take a college living  at your age any that you could get would be very small ah george if i could only put an old head upon young shoulders what a hand of cards you would have to play that old man could leave you half a million of money  this was certainly not the object with which the son had ascended the mount and he did not use much eloquence to induce his father to remain long in the place sir lionel got again on his donkey and they returned to jerusalem nor did george ever again talk to him about the mount of olives  and he was not very much more successful with another friend into whose mind he endeavoured to inculcate his own high feelings he got miss baker up to his favourite seat and with her miss waddington and then before he had left jerusalem he succeeded in inducing the younger lady to ramble thither with him alone  i do not know that i think so highly of the church as you do said caroline as far as i have seen them i cannot find that clergymen are more holy than other men and yet surely they ought to be so  at any rate there is more scope for holiness if a man have it in him to be holy the heart of a clergyman is more likely to be softened than that of a barrister or an attorney  i dont exactly know what you mean by heartsoftening mr bertram  i mean said bertram and then he paused he was not quite able with the words at his command to explain to this girl what it was that he did mean nor was he sure that she would appreciate him if he did do so and fond as he still was of his idea of a holy life perhaps at this moment he was fonder still of her  i think that a man should do the best he can for himself in a profession you have a noble position within your grasp and if i were you i certainly would not bury myself in a country parsonage  what this girl of twenty said to him had much more weight than the timehonoured precepts of his father and yet both doubtless had their weight each blow told somewhat and the seed too had been sown upon very stony ground  they sat there some three or four minutes in silence bertram was looking over to mount moriah imaging to himself the spot where the tables of the moneychangers had been overturned while miss waddington was gazing at the setting sun she had an eye to see material beauty and a taste to love it but it was not given to her to look back and feel those things as to which her lover would fain have spoken to her the temple in which jesus had taught was nothing to her  yes he was her lover now though he had never spoken to her of love had never acknowledged to himself that he did love heras so few men ever do acknowledge till the words that they have said make it necessary that they should ask themselves whether those words are true they sat there for some minutes in silence but not as lovers sit the distance between them was safe and respectful bertram was stretched upon the ground with his eyes fixed not upon her but on the city opposite and she sat demurely on a rock shading herself with her parasol  i suppose nothing would induce you to marry a clergyman said he at last  why should you suppose that mr bertram  at any rate not the parson of a country parish i am led to suppose it by what you said to me yourself just now  i was speaking of you and not of myself i say that you have a noble career open to you and i do not look on the ordinary life of a country parson as a noble career for myself i do not see any nobility in store i do not know that there is any fate more probable for myself than that of becoming a respectable vicaress  and why may not a vicars career be noble is it not as noble to have to deal with the soul as with the body  i judge by what i see they are generally fond of eating very cautious about their money untidy in their own houses and apt to go to sleep after dinner  george turned upon the grass and for a moment or two ceased to look across into the city he had not strength of character to laugh at her description and yet to be unmoved by it he must either resent what she said or laugh and be ruled by it he must either tell her that she knew nothing of a clergymans dearest hopes or else he must yield to the contempt which her words implied  and could you love honour and obey such a man as that yourself miss waddington he said at last  i suppose such men do have wives who love honour and obey them either who do or do not i dare say i should do much the same as others  you speak of my future miss waddington as though it were a subject of interest but you seem to think nothing of your own  it is useless for a woman to think of her future she can do so little towards planning it or bringing about her plans besides i have no right to count on myself as anything out of the ordinary run of women i have taken no doublefirst degree in anything  a doublefirst is no sign of a true heart or true spirit many a man born to grovel has taken a doublefirst  i dont perhaps know what you mean by grovelling mr bertram i dont like grovellers myself i like men who can keep their heads upwho once having them above the water will never allow them to sink some men in every age do win distinction and wealth and high place these are not grovellers if i were you i would be one of them  you would not become a clergyman  certainly not no more than i would be a shoemaker  miss waddington  well and what of miss waddington look at the clergymen that you know do they never grovel you know mr wilkinson he is an excellent man i am sure but is he conspicuous for highmindedness for truth and spirit it must be remembered that the elder mr wilkinson was at this time still living are they generally men of wide views and enlightened principles i do not mean to liken them to shoemakers but were i you i should think of the one business as soon as the other  and in my place what profession would you choose  ah that i cannot say i do not know your circumstances  i must earn my bread like other sons of adam  well earn it then in such manner that the eyes of the world shall be upon you that men and women shall talk of you and newspapers have your name in their columns whatever your profession let it be a wakeful one not one that you can follow half asleep  again he paused for awhile and again sat looking at the rock of the temple still he thought of the tables of the moneychangers and the insufficiency of him who had given as much as half to the poor but even while so thinking he was tempted to give less than half himself to set up on his own account a moneychanging table in his own temple he would fain have worshipped at the two shrines together had he been able but he was not able so he fell down before that of mammon  you can talk to me in this way urge me to be ambitious and yet confess that you could give yourself to one of those drones of whom you speak with such scorn  i speak of no one with scorn and i am not urging you and at present am not talking of giving myself to any one you ask as to the possibility of my ever marrying a clergyman i say that it is very possible that i may do so some day  miss waddington said george and now he had turned his face absolutely from the city and was looking upwards to the hill upwards full into the beauty of her countenance miss waddington  well mr bertram  you speak of me as though i were a being high in the scale of humanity  and so i think of you  listen for a momentand of yourself as one comparatively low  no no not low i have too much pride for that much lower than you certainly for i have given no proofs of genius  welllower than me that is what you have said and i do not believe that you would say so falsely you would not descend to flatter me  certainly not but  believe equally of me that i would not flatter you i have told you no falsehood as yet and i have a right to claim your belief as you look on me so do i on you i look up to you as one whose destiny must be high to me there is that about you which forbids me to think that your path in the world can ever be other than conspicuous your husband at least will have to live before the world  i shall not have the slightest objection to his doing so but that i think will depend a great deal more on him than on me  bertram was very anxious to say something which might tend towards the commingling of his destiny with hers he was hardly yet prepared to swear that he loved her and to ask her in good set terms to be his wife but he did not like to leave her without learning whether he had at all touched her heart he was fully sure now that his own was not whole  come mr bertram said she look at the sun how nearly it is gone and you know we have no twilight here let us go down my aunt will think that we are lost  one minute miss waddington one minute and then we will go miss waddingtonif you care enough for me to bid me take up any profession follow any pursuit i will obey you you shall choose for me if you will  she blushed not deeply but with a colour sufficiently heightened to make it visible to him and with a tingling warmth which made her conscious of it herself she would have given much to keep her countenance and yet the blush became her greatly it took away from the premature firmness of her womanly look and gave her for the moment something of the weakness natural to her age  you know that is nonsense on such a subject you must of course choose for yourself  bertram was standing in the path before her and she could not well go on till he had made way for her no said he thinking as i do of you feeling as i do regarding you it is not nonsense it would be absolute nonsense if i said so to your aunt or to mrs hunter or to miss jones i could not be guided by a person who was indifferent to me but in this matter i will be guided by you if you will consent to guide me  of course i shall do no such thing  you have no personal wish then for my welfare  yes i have your uncle is my guardian and i may therefore be allowed to look upon you as a friend of a longer standing than merely of yesterday i do regard you as a friend and shall be glad of your success here she paused and they walked on a few steps together in silence and then she added becoming still redder as she did so but now managing to hide her face from her companion were i to answer you in the way that you pretend to wish i should affect either less friendship than i feel or much more  much more said bertram with a shade of despondency in his tone  yes much more mr bertram why what would you have me say  ah me i hardly know nothingnothingi would have you say nothing you are quite right to say nothing and then he walked on again for a hundred yards in silence nothing miss waddington nothing unless indeed  mr bertram and as she spoke she put out her hand and gently touched his arm mr bertram stop yourself think at any rate of what you are going to say it is a pity when such as you speak foolishly it was singular to see how much more composed she was than he how much more able to manage the occasionand yet her feelings were strong too  nothing i would have you say nothingnothing unless this that whatever my destiny may be you will share it with me  as he spoke he did not look towards her but straight before him down the path he did not sigh nor look soft there was indeed not much capability for soft looks in his square and stronglyfeatured face he frowned rather set his teeth together and walked on faster than before caroline did not answer him immediately and then he repeated his words i do not care for you to say anything now unless you can say thisthat whatever your lot may be i may share it whatever mine that you will share it  mr bertram  well  now you have spoken foolishly do you not know that you have spoken foolishly  i have spoken truly do you speak as truly you should be as much above false girlish petty scruples as you will be and are above falsehood of another kind you will never tell a man that you love him if you do not  no certainly i never will  and do not deny it if it be the truth  but it is not the truth how long have we known each other mr bertram  counting by days and hours some fortnight but what does that signify you do not love a man the better always the longer you know him of you i discern that there is that in you i can love that would make me happy i have talent some sort of talent at least you have a spirit which would force me to use it i will not pretend to say that i am suited for you you must judge that but i know that you are suited for me now i will take any answer you will give me  to tell the truth miss waddington hardly knew what answer to give him he was one it seemed who having spoken with decision himself would take any answer as decisive he was one not to be tampered with and one also hardly to be rejected without consideration and certainly not so to be accepted she had liked him muchvery much considering the little she had known of him she had even asked herself half playfully whether it were not possible that she might learn to love him he was a gentleman and that with her was much he was a man of talent and that with her was more he was one whose character and mode of thought she could respect he was a man whom any woman might probably be able to respect but caroline waddington wanted much more than this in her future lord she could talk pleasantly of the probability of her marrying a country parson but she had in truth a much wider ambition for herself she would never marrysuch was the creed which was to govern her own lifewithout love but she would not allow herself to love where love would interfere with her high hopes in her catalogue of human blisses love in a cottage was not entered she was not avaricious she did not look to money as the summum bonumcertainly not to marry for moneys sake but she knew that no figure in the world could be made without means her own fortune was small and she did not even rate her beauty high her birth was the birth of a lady but that was all her talents had never been tried but she thought of them more indifferently than they deserved she felt therefore that she had no just ground to hope for much but she was determined that no folly on her own part should rob her of any chance that fortune might vouchsafe to her  under such circumstances what answer should she make to bertram her heart would have bid her not reject him but she was fearful of her own heart she dreaded lest she should be betrayed into sacrificing herself to love ought prudence now to step in and bid her dismiss a suitor whose youth had as yet achieved nothing whose own means were very small with whom if he were accepted her marriage must be postponed who however was of great talent who gave such promise of future distinction bertram when he made his offer made it from a full heart but caroline was able to turn these matters in her mind before she answered him  she will be called coldhearted mercenary and unfeminine but when a young girl throws prudence to the winds and allows herself to love where there is nothing to live on what then is she called it seems to me that it is sometimes very hard for young girls to be in the right they certainly should not be mercenary they certainly should not marry paupers they certainly should not allow themselves to become old maids they should not encumber themselves with early hopeless loves nor should they callously resolve to care for nothing but a good income and a good house there should be some handbook of love to tell young ladies when they may give way to it without censure as regards our heroine however she probably wanted no such handbook now i will take any answer you will give me bertram when he had said that remained silent awaiting her reply  mr bertram she said at last i think that you have spoken unwisely let us agree to forget it what you have said has come from impulse rather than judgment  not so miss waddington i cannot forget it nor can you i would not have it again unsaid if i could when i once learned that i loved you it became natural to me to tell you so  such quick speaking is not perhaps natural to me but as you demand an immediate answer i must give you one i have had much pleasure in your society but i have never thought of loving you nor can i love you without thinking of it  it would be hard to say what answer bertram expected indeed he had no expectations he had had no idea of making this offer when he walked up the hill with her his heart was then turned rather to worship at that other shrine it had been her own words her own eloquence in favour of the worlds greatness that had drawn him on he had previously filled his mind with no expectation but he had felt an intense desire for success when once he had committed himself to his offer  and now as he walked down beside her he hardly knew what to make of her answer a man if he be not absolutely rejected is generally inclined to think that any answer from a lady may be taken as having in it some glimmer of favour and ladies know this so well that they almost regard any reply on their own part short of an absolute refusal as an acceptance if a lady bids a gentleman wait awhile for his answer he thinks himself quite justified in letting all the world know that she is his own we all know what a reference to a parents judgment means a lady must be very decisivevery if she means to have her no taken at its full meaning now caroline waddington had not been very decisive  whatever bertrams thoughts or his hopes might be he said nothing more on the present occasion he walked silently down the hill by her side somewhat moodylooking but yet not with the hangdog aspect of a rejected suitor there was a fire in his eyes and a play upon his countenance which did not tell of hope altogether extinguished before they were at the foot of the hill he had resolved that he would have caroline waddington for his wife let the difficulties in his way be what they might but then he was ever so keen to resolve so often beaten from his resolutions  and caroline also walked silently down the hill she knew that she had given an ambiguous answer and was content to let it remain so in the silence of her chamber she would think over this thing and make her calculations she would inquire into her own mind and learn whether she could afford to love this man whom she could not but acknowledge to be so loveable as for asking any one else seeking counsel in the matter from her aunt that never for a moment suggested itself to caroline waddington  they had left miss baker and miss todd at the bottom of the hill it was a beautiful evening and those ladies had consented to sit down and rest there while the more enthusiastic and young lovers of the mount ascended to the spot of which bertram was so fond but in giving that consent they had hardly expected that such encroachment would be made on their goodnature when caroline and bertram again found them the daylight had almost waned away     chapter xi  vale valete   miss baker was a little querulous at being left so long sitting with miss todd at the corner of the garden wall but miss todd was never querulous she was one of those goodhumoured persons who never complain and find some antidote to every ill in life even in the ill itself true she had been kept a couple of hours and more sitting on a stone by the brook cedron but then she had acquired the privilege of telling how mr george bertram and miss caroline waddington had passed those hours têteàtête together on the mountainside  why caroline we thought you were never coming down again said miss baker  it was mr bertrams fault aunt he is immoveable when he gets to a certain rock up there he has an idea of turning hermit and constructing a cell for himself in that spot  if i did turn hermit it should certainly be for the sake of living there said he but i fear i want the proper spirit for so holy a life  i hope you have not kept us all this time for nothing you have had some success i trust said miss todd to bertram in a laughing whisper miss todds face was quite joyous as she whispered but then her face was always joyous  i certainly have not done that which i intended to do said bertram with mock sententiousness and so far i have been unsuccessful  then she has rejected him said miss todd to herself what a fool the girl must be but it was a great comfort to miss todd that she knew all about it  that evening their plans were decided on as to leaving jerusalemthe plans that is of those whose fortunes we must followmiss baker namely and her niece sir lionel and his son of miss todd we may here take our leave for awhile she did not on this occasion marry sir lionel nor did she even have the satisfaction of knowing that her friends accused her of wishing to do so miss todd had her weak points but taking her as a whole and striking the balance between good and bad i do not care how soon we may meet her again to her friends also we may bid adieu mr mgabbery did not die of love mr pott did propose to and was accepted by miss jones but the match was broken off by the parental potts who on the occasion nearly frightened poor mrs jones out of her life the hunters sojourned for awhile on the sides of lebanon but did at last return to the discomforts of european life mrs hunter tried the effect of her favourite costume at tenby but it was not found to answer of mr cruse i can only say that he was dreadfully scolded by mrs pott in that he had allowed her son to fall in love and that mr pott threatened to stop his salary an attorneys letter however settled that  it must be confessed that miss baker had allowed her plans to be altered by the arrival of the bertrams at jerusalem and confessed also that miss bakers complaisance in this respect had been brought about by her nieces persuasion their original intention had been to go on to damascus then miss baker had begged off this further journey alleging that her clothes as well as her strength were worn out and caroline had consented to return home by the shortest route then came the temptation of going as far as beyrout with the bertrams and miss baker had been enjoined to have herself patched up externally and internally she was accordingly being patched up but now things were altered again caroline knew that she could not travel with george bertram without engaging herself to be his wife or that if she did their journey would not be a happy one and she did not wish so to engage herself without further thought she determined therefore that they would fall back upon her aunts plan and return home by the easier route by jaffa that is and alexandria  her altered mind had to be explained not only to her aunt but to the bertrams and she came to the somewhat singular resolve to explain it in both cases by the simple truth she would tell her aunt what had happened and she would make george bertram understand in a few and as kind words as might be that under the present circumstances it would be better that they should not be thrown into the very close intercourse necessary for fellowtravellers in the east she was very prudent was miss waddington and having freed herself of one lover because she did not like him she prepared to rid herself of another because she did  the bertrams were to leave jerusalem together in a couple of days time george was to go with his father as far as constantinople and having seen something of real turks in real turkey was to return at once to england after his last visit to the mount of olives he said nothing further about the church as a profession  that evening caroline settled it all with her aunt aunt said she as they sat together brushing their hair before they went to bed you will think me very fanciful but after all i believe we had better go back by alexandria  oh dear i shall be so glad my dear jane says that i could not possibly get a travelling dress made here that i could wear  you could get a dress in damascus i dont doubt aunt but  and i really am not fit for much more riding i dont like to disappoint you but if you really wouldnt mind it  well i should mind itand i should not but let me tell you you must not think that i am so very changeable first pressing you to go one way and then begging you to go another without a reason  no i know you do it for my sake  not that either auntquite but do listen mr bertram today made  he has not offered to you has he  yes aunt that is just what he has done and therefore perhaps it will not be quite so well that we should travel together  but caroline tell mepray do tell me what did he say and what have you said oh dear me this is very sudden and miss baker sat back in her chair with her now grayish hair hanging over her shoulders with her hairbrush still held in one hand and with the other resting on the toilettable  as for what he said i may skip that aunt it was the old story i suppose merely signifying that he wanted me to marry him  well well  as you truly say aunt it was too sudden mr bertram has a great deal to recommend him a very great deal one cannot but like him he is very clever too  yes caroline and will be his uncles heirdoubtless  i know nothing of that to tell the truth indeed i never thought of that but it would have made no difference  and you refused him  well i hardly know i do know thisthat i did more towards refusing him than accepting him that i must have much more love for any man i do marry than i have for him at present and that after what has passed i think we had better not go to damascus together  to this latter proposition aunt mary fully agreed and thus it was decided that the extra patching for the longer journey need not be accomplished miss baker would explain the matter to sir lionel in her way and caroline would do the same to george bertram in hers on one other point also miss baker made up her mind fully though on this matter she did not think it prudent to make her mind known to her niece she was very confident that the marriage would take place and resolved to do all in her power to bring it about personally she was fond of george bertram she admired his talents she liked his father and felt very favourably inclined towards his uncles wealth she finished her toilet therefore in calm happiness she had an excellent match in view for her nieceand after all she would escape that dreadful horseback journey to damascus  during the next day caroline and george bertram were not together for a momentthat is they were not together alone for they breakfasted and dined at the same table and he sat between the aunt and her niece as he had done continually since he had been at jerusalem sir lionel told him in the forenoon that they were not to have the pleasure of the ladies company on their journey and rallied him as to the heartbreaking tendency of these tidings but george showed in his countenance at least no symptoms of heartbreaking  that evening as they all parted for the night george did press miss waddingtons hand more warmly than was usual with him and as he did so he did look into her face for one moment to see what encouragement he might find there i cannot say that there was no encouragement the pressure was perhaps not met by any similar warmth on her part but it was submitted to without any touch of resentment the love which shot from his eye was not returned to him from hers but hers were soft beneath his glance softer than was usual with caroline waddington  but on the next morning they did come together it was the day before the departure of the bertrams and whatever was to be said must be said then caroline watched her opportunity and as soon as breakfast was overthey all breakfasted in the public salonasked him to come into her aunts sittingroom she was quite collected had fully made up her mind what to say and was able also to say it without hesitation and with perfect selfpossession this was more than could be boasted of on the gentlemans behalf  you know mr bertram that we are not going to travel together  yes my father told me so yesterday  and you will understand the reason of it i am sure  not exactly miss waddington i cannot say i do understand it i may have been presumptuous in what i said to you the other day but i do not see why on that account your aunt should be put to the inconvenience of altering her plans you fear i suppose that i should annoy you but you might trust meand still may if you will do so  now mr bertram you are hardly so sincere as you asserted yourself to be and required me to be on the mount you are yourself quite aware that nobody has thought you presumptuous i have nothing to complain of and much to thank you forindependently of the honour you have now done mefor from you it is an honour but i cannot say that i love you it would not be natural that i should do so  good heavens not natural i love you with the whole strength of my heart is that unnatural  it is the province of men to take the initiative in such matters said caroline smiling  i know nothing as to mans province or of womans province either by province you mean custom and conventional rule and conventional rule means falsehood i have known you but a week or two and i love you dearly you of course have known me as long and are at any rate as capable of loving as i am there would be nothing unnatural in you loving methough indeed it may be very unlikely that you should do so  well i will not contradict you in anything if i can help it except perhaps as to that last little wouldbeproud petulant protest but putting out of sight all question of likelihood what ought i to do if i do not love you what in such a case would you recommend a sister to do is it not better that we should not be immediately thrown together as must so certainly be the case in travelling  then i am to understand that you positively can never love me  i have not said so but you press me unfairly mr bertram  unfairly no by heavens no pressure in such case can be unfair i would press the truth out from youthe real truth the truth that so vitally concerns myself you will not say that you have an aversion to me  aversion no certainly not  or that you cannot love me then why not let us remain together you argue that you do not yet know me well enough will not that be the way to know me better  if i were to travel with you now mr bertram it would be tantamount to accepting you your own sense will certainly tell you that were i to do so i should give you the privilege of coming with me as my lover forgive me for saying that i cannot give you that privilege i grieve to hurt your feelings for a day even but i am sure you will ultimately approve of what i am doing  and are we to meet no more then  of course we shall meet again at least in all human probability my guardian is your uncle  i never even knew that till i met you the other day  because you have always been at school or at college but you know it now i at least shall look forward to meeting youand so will my aunt  yes as acquaintances it would be impossible for me to meet you in that way i hardly think you know or realize what my feelings to you are i can only meet you to tell you again and again that i love you you are so cold yourself that you cannot understand mymymy impetuosity if you choose to call it so  in three or four months mr bertram you will be laughing at your own impetuositywhen i perhaps shall be grieving over my own coldness these last words she said with a smile in which there was much archness and perhaps also a little encouragement  you will tell me at any rate that i may hope  no certainly not you will hope enough for anything you really desire without my telling you but i will not joke as i believe that you are serious  oh you believe so do you  yes i suppose i must believe so your declaration the other day took me very much by surprise i had no conception that you had any feelings towards me of that sort i certainly had entertained none such towards you love with me cannot be the birth of a moment i cannot say that i will love merely because i am asked you would not wish me to be false even in your own favour we will part now mr bertram and being apart we shall better learn to know each of us how we value the other on my part i can truly say that i hope we shall meet againat any rate as friends and then she held out her hand to him  is this to be our farewell said he without at once taking it  it shall be if you so please we shall meet again only at the public table  and you will not tell me that i may hope  i will tell you nothing further mr bertram you will shake hands with me as with a friend will you not  he then took her hand and holding it in his own gazed for a moment into her face she bore the weight of his eyes with unabashed front she showed neither anger nor pleasure neither disdain nor pride the same sweet smile was still upon her face somewhat playful somewhat hopeful but capable of no definite construction either for making or marring a mans comfort  caroline he said at last  goodbye mr bertram i thoroughly hope you may enjoy your journey  caroline  she essayed to withdraw her hand from his feeling this he raised it to his lips and kissed it and then left the room as he closed the door the same smile was on her face  i hope it will be admitted that miss waddington had played her part with skill and judgment and good breeding and not altogether heartlessly either she had thought much on the subject since george had first thrown himself at her feet and had concluded putting the good against the bad and balancing the affair as accurately as facts would enable her that the match would be one which she ought to regard as desirable there were two valid reasons however why she should not at once accept his offer firstly he might not know his own mind and it might be serviceable to him to have the option of renewing his proposal or retreating from it after a few months trial of his own feelings and secondly she hardly knew her own mind she could not in truth say yet whether she did love him or whether she did not she was rather inclined to think she did but it would be well that she should try the matter before she committed herself  the statement made by her aunt that george would doubtless be his uncles heir certainly had its weight with her it would be wrong in her to engage herself to a man who was without the means of maintaining her in that rank of life in which she had resolved to live wrong both on his account and on her own she felt that she could not be a good poor mans wife it was not the walk of life for which she had destined herself she had made up her mind on that point too and having made it up was not weak enough to be driven from her resolve by any little gust of feeling she did like bertrammuch very much better then she had ever liked any other man he came up in many points to her idea of what a man should be he was not sufficiently collected not sufficiently thoughtful and perhaps almost too enthusiastic success in life would be easier to a man who put less heart into everything he said and did but years would teach him much in this respect and she also might perhaps teach him something she did like bertram and what objection could there be to the match if as appeared so probable he was to inherit his uncles money  prudent as she was she was ready to run some risk in this respect she did not wish to be a poor mans wife but neither did she wish to be an idle mans wife what she did desire was that her husband should be an earnest rising successful manone whose name as she had herself said to bertram might be frequent in mens mouths and daily to be read in the columns of newspapers she would not marry a fool even though he were also a croesus she would not marry a fool even though he were also an earl in choosing a master her first necessity was that she should respect him then that the world should do so also she could respect talenttalent if needs be alonebut nothing without talent the worlds respect could not be had without wealth as for love that was necessary too but it was only a third necessity  such being our heroines mind about marriage i make bold to say that she had behaved with skill and judgment and not altogether heartlessly either  on the following morning sir lionel and george left jerusalem together the colonel had his own servant as he always had george was followed by the dragoman who had now been with him for some time and each had also an arab groom on quitting jerusalem sir lionel had made no objection to having the entire bill settled by his son  well george he had said with a smile i know you are in ample funds and i never am you moreover have a milch cow that will not run dry the government is my cow and she is apt to be very chary in her supply she does run dry with uncommon quickness  george smiled also and paid the bill readily protesting that of course he ought to do so as sir lionel had come there only to see him the colonel plumed himself at once upon having managed well but he was greatly mistaken his calculation in this respect had been made on a false basis george he said to himself is a young man he will think nothing of this a fellow at his age cares nothing for money george did care but little for the money but he did care about his father and he understood the ways of the world well enough to know that his father ought to have paid his own bill he began for the first time to experience something of that feeling which his uncle so often expressed  they started too with somewhat different ideas as to the purport of their route sir lionel wished to get to constantinople and was content for georges sake to go by damascus and beyrout but george had to visit ramah and gibeon and luz to see the well of the woman of samaria at sichem to climb mount carmel and to sleep at least for a night within its monastery mount tabor also and bethsaida and capernaum he must visit he must bathe in the sea of galilee as he had already bathed in jordan and the dead sea gadara he must see and gergesa and chorazin and above all he must stand with naked feet in nazareth and feel within his heart that he was resting on holy ground  sir lionel did not care a straw for bethsaida or chorazinnot a straw even for nazareth for many reasons he wished to be well with his son in the first place a man whose bill is paid for him always makes some concession to the man who pays it he should do so at any rate and on this point sir lionel was willing to be just and then he had ulterior views which made it very necessary that george should like him in this respect he had hitherto played his cards wellwell with the exception of that jerusalem bill he had made his society very pleasant to his son had done much towards gaining the young mans heart and was well inclined to do moreanything indeed short of putting himself to real personal inconvenience we may perhaps add without doing too much violence to sir lionels established character that he himself really liked his son  all this for some days carried him hither and thither if not with patience at any rate with perseverance he went to spots which he was told had a worldwide celebrity of the names of which he had but a bare distant remembrance and which he found to be arid comfortless and uninteresting gibeon he did endure and shiloh and sichem gilgal also and carmel but there he broke down he could not he said justify it to himself to be absent longer from his official duties he found that he was near beyrout he could ride thither in two days avoiding damascus altogether the cookery at mount carmel did not add to his love of the holy land he found himself to be not very well he laughingly reminded george that there was a difference between twentythree and sixty and ended by declining altogether to go backwards towards the sea of galilee if george could only be induced to think that he had seen enough of these regions his father would be so delighted to have his company direct from beyrout to constantinople  george however was inexorable about nazareth and so they parted agreeing that they would meet again at constantinople we need not closely follow either on his journey sir lionel having had everything paid for him up to the moment of their separation arrivedlet us hope with a full purseat the bosphorus george when left to himself travelled more slowly and thought much of these holy placesmuch also of his love he could have found it in his heart to rush back and catch miss baker and caroline at jaffa he would have done so as soon as he quitted nazareth only that he was ashamed  about a fortnight after his fathers departure he found himself at damascus and in another week he was stepping on board the packet at beyrout when leaving palestine that land of such wondrous associations his feelings were not altogether consolatory he had at one moment acknowledged what he believed to be a spiritual influence within him and yielding himself to it had spoken of devoting his life to a high and holy purpose he had indeed spoken only to himself and the wound to his pride was therefore the less but his high and holy purpose had been blown to the winds by a few words from a pair of ruby lips by one glance of scorn from a pair of bright eyes and he had so yielded even though those lips would acknowledge no love for him though those eyes would not look on him kindly he could not be proud of his visit to the holy land and yet he felt a longing to linger there it might be that if he would return once more to that mount look once again on sion and the temple the spirit might yet get the better of the flesh but alas he had to own to himself that he had now hardly a wish that the spirit should predominate the things of the world were too bright to be given up the charms of the flesh were too strong for him with a sigh he looked back for the last time from mount hermon stretched out his arms once more towards jerusalem said one farewell in his heart as his eye rested for a moment on the distant glassy waters of galilee and then set his horses head towards damascus  when a traveller in these railroad days takes leave of florence or vienna or munich or lucerne he does so without much of the bitterness of a farewell the places are now comparatively so near that he expects to see them again or at any rate hopes that he may do so but jerusalem is still distant from us no sabbathdays journey a man who having seen it once takes his leave then sees it probably for the last time and a mans heart must be very cold who can think of palestine exactly as of any other land it is not therefore surprising that bertram was rather sad as he rode down the further side of mount hermon  at constantinople sir lionel and george again met and our hero spent a pleasant month there with his father it was still spring the summer heats had hardly commenced and george was charmed if not with the city of the sultan at any rate with the scenery around it here his father appeared in a new light they were more intimate with each other than they had been at jerusalem they were not now living in ladies society and sir lionel by degrees threw off what little restraint of governorship what small amount of parental authority he had hitherto assumed he seemed anxious to live with his son on terms of perfect equality began to talk to him rather as young men talk to each other than men of ages so very different and appeared to court a lack of reverence  in his ordinary habits of life and indeed in his physical vivacity sir lionel was very young for his time of life he never pleaded his years in bar of any pleasure and never pleaded them at all except when desirous of an excuse for escaping something that was disagreeable there are subjects on which young men talk freely with each other but on which they hesitate to speak to their elders without restraint sir lionel did his best to banish any such feeling on the part of his son of wine and women of cards and horses of money comforts and money discomforts he spoke in a manner which bertram at first did not like but which after awhile was not distasteful to him there is always some compliment implied when an old man unbends before a young one and it is this which makes the viciousness of old men so dangerous i do not say that sir lionel purposely tempted his son to vice but he plainly showed that he regarded morality in a man to be as thoroughly the peculiar attribute of a clergyman as a black coat and that there could be no reason for other men even to pretend to it when there were no women by to be respected and deceived  bertram certainly liked his father and was at ease in his company but in spite of this he was ashamed of him and was sometimes very sorrowful he was young full of vivacity and without that strength of character which should have withstood the charm of sir lionels manner but he knew well that he would fain have had in his father feelings of a very different nature and he could not but acknowledge that the severity of his uncles tone was deserved  it had been georges intention to stay a week only at constantinople but his father had persuaded him to remain four he had boasted that when he returned to england he would be in a position to give back to his uncle the three hundred pounds which pritchett had placed to his account but he would not now be able to do this his father lived expensively and even here where sir lionel was now at home george paid more than his own share of the expense  one of their chief subjects of conversation that indeed which sir lionel seemed to prefer to any other was the ultimate disposal of his brothers money he perceived that georges thoughts on this subject were by far too transcendental that he was childishly indifferent to his own interests and that if not brought to a keener sense of his own rights a stronger feeling as to his position as the only nephew of a very wealthy man he might let slip through his fingers a magnificent fortune which was absolutely within his reach so thinking he detained his son near him for awhile that he might if possible imbue him with some spark of worldly wisdom  he knew how useless it would be to lecture a young man like george as to the best way in which he could play tufthunter to his uncle from such lectures george would have started away in disgust but something sir lionel thought might be done by tact by finesse and a daily halfscornful badinage skilfully directed towards the proper subject by degrees too he thought that george did listen to him that he was learning that he might be taught to set his eyes greedily on those mountains of wealth and so sir lionel persevered with diligence to the end  say everything that is civil from me to my brother said the colonel the day before george left him  uncle george does not care much for civil speeches said the other laughing  no i know he does not hed think more of it if i could send home a remittance by you to pay the bill eh george but as i cant do that i may as well send a few civil words uncle georges bill had gradually become a source of joke between the father and son sir lionel at least was accustomed to mention it in such a way that the junior george could not help laughing and though at first this had gone against the grain of his feelings by degrees he had become used to it  he expects i fancy neither money nor civil words said george the younger  he will not on that account be the less pleased at getting either the one or the other dont you believe everything that everybody tells you in his own praise when a man says that he does not like flattery and that he puts no value on soft words do not on that account be deterred from making any civil speeches you may have ready he will not be a bit stronger than another because he boasts of his strength  i really think you would find it difficult to flatter your brother  perhaps so and therefore i should set about it with the more care but were i in your shoes i should not attempt flattery i should be very submissive rather he always loved to play the tyrant  and i do not love to play the slave  an only nephews slavery would probably be of a very mild description  yes no harder than sitting on a clerks stool in a merchants countinghouse for seven or eight hours a day  that would be an unendurable bore as a continuance but take my word for it george if you could bring yourself to do it for six months by the end of that time you would have the game in your own hands  at any rate i shall not try it sir  well you are your own master i can only say that the temptation would be too strong for most men i have not the slightest doubt that if you would give way to him for six months two years would see you in parliament sir lionel had already ascertained that to sit in the house of commons was the dearest object of his sons ambition  on the evening of that day as they were drinking their coffee and smoking together sir lionel for the first time spoke to his son on another matter george said he i dont know whether there was anything in it but when we were at jerusalem i thought you were very sweet on caroline waddington  george blushed deeply and affected to laugh  she was certainly a very fine girl continued his father i think as handsome a girl as i have seen these ten years what a shoulder and neck she had when you used to be dragging her up the mount of olives i could not but think there was more in it than mere scripture geographyeh george  george merely laughed and looked rather like a simpleton  if you were not in love with her i can only say that you ought to have been i was i know  well sir i believe she is free as yet you can try your chance if you have a mind  ah i would i could if i knew medeas secret i would have myself chopped and boiled that i might come out young on her behalf but george i can tell you something about her  well sir  i would have told you then when we were at jerusalem but we were not so well acquainted then as we are now and i did not like to interfere  it could not be interference from you  well but the matter is this if my brother ever loved any human beingand i am not quite sure he ever didbut if he did it was that girls father had waddington lived he would now have been my age your uncle took him early by the hand and would have made his fortune for him but the poor fellow died in my opinion it would assist your views if your uncle knew that you were going to marry caroline waddington  george said nothing but sat sucking the mouthpiece of his pipestick and blowing out great clouds of smoke sir lionel said nothing further but easily changed the conversation early on the following morning bertram left constantinople having received a promise that sir lionel would visit him in england as soon as the exigencies of the public service would permit of his doing so     chapter xii  george bertram decides in favour of the bar   george bertram did not return directly to england since he had been in turkey he had made arrangement by letter with his friend harcourt to meet him in the tyrol and to travel home with him through switzerland it was about the middle of june when he left constantinople and harcourt was to be at innspruck on the 5th august george might therefore well have remained a week or two longer with his father had either of them so wished but neither of them did wish it the living at constantinople was dear and georges funds would not stand much more of it and sir lionel free and easy as he was still felt his sons presence as some impedimentperhaps in the way of his business perhaps in that of his pleasures  from constantinople bertram went up across the balkan to the danube and thence through bucharest into transylvania travelling as in those days was necessary somewhat by permission of the russian authorities he then again struck the danube at pesth remained some little time there again a week or so at vienna from thence he visited saltzburg and exactly on the appointed day shook hands with his friend in the hall of the old golden sun at innspruck  at first on leaving his father george was very glad to be once more alone men delighted him not nor women either at that momentseeing that his thoughts were running on caroline waddington and that her presence was not to be had but by the time that he found himself in the tyrol he was delighted once more to have a companion he had of course picked up englishmen and been picked up by them at every town he had passed one always does some ladies also he had casually encounteredbut he had met with no second caroline while wandering about the mountains of transylvania he had been quite contented to be alone at pesth he had not ceased to congratulate himself on his solitude though sometimes he found the day a little too long for his purpose in doing so at vienna he was glad enough to find an old oxonian though even while enjoying the treat he would occasionally say to himself that after all society was only a bore but by the time he had done the saltzburg country he was heartily sick of himself somewhat sick also of thinking of his love and fully able to reecho all that harcourt had to say in praise of some very fine old wine which that fastidious gentleman caused to be produced for them from the cellars of the golden sun  innspruck is a beautiful little town perhaps no town in europe can boast a site more exquisitely picturesque edinburgh would be equal to it if it had a river instead of a railroad running through its valley and under its castlehill but we sojourned too long in the holy land to permit of our dwelling even for half a chapter in the tyrol george however and his friend remained there for a fortnight they went over the brenner and looked down into italy made an excursion to those singular goldentinted mountains the dolomites among which live a race of men who speak neither german nor italian nor other language known among the hundred dialects of europe but a patois left to them from the ancient latins they wandered through the valleys of the inn and its tributaries and wondered at the odd way of living which still prevails in their picturesque castellated mansions  for awhile bertram thought that harcourt was the best companion in the world he was as agreeable and easy tempered as his father and was at the same time an educated man which his father certainly was not harcourt though he put his happiness in material things perhaps quite as much as did sir lionel required that his material things should be of a high flavour he was a reading man addicted in a certain cynical carping sort of way even to poetry was a critic almost by profession loved pictures professed to love scenery certainly loved to watch and scrutinize the different classes of his brothermen he was gifted preeminently with a lawyers mind but it was not a lawyers mind of a vulgar quality he too loved riches and looked on success in the world as a mans chief nay perhaps his only aim but for him it was necessary that success should be polished sir lionel wanted money that he might swallow it and consume it as a shark does its prey but like sharks in general he had always been hungryhad never had his bellyful of money harcourts desire for money was of a different class it would not suit him to be in debt to any one a good balance at his bankers was a thing dear to his soul he aimed at perfect respectability and also at perfect independence  for awhile therefore harcourts teaching was a great improvement on sir lionels and was felt to be so he preached a love of good things but the good things were to be corollaries only to good work sir lionels summum bonum would have been an unexpected pocketful of money three months of idleness in which to spend it and pleasant companions for the time who should be at any rate as well provided in pocket as himself harcourt would have required something more the worlds respect and esteem were as necessary to him as the worlds pleasures  but nevertheless after a time harcourts morality offended bertram as bertrams transcendentalism offended harcourt they admired the same view but they could not look at it through the same coloured glass  and so on the whole you liked your governor said harcourt to him one day as they were walking across a mountain range from one valley to another  yes indeed  one is apt to be prejudiced in ones fathers favour of course said harcourt that is to say when one hasnt seen him for twenty years or so a more common constant knowledge perhaps puts the prejudice the other way  sir lionel is undoubtedly a very pleasant man no one i fancy could help liking his society  i understand it all as well as though you had written a book about him you have none of that great art bertram which teaches a man to use his speech to conceal his thoughts  why should i wish to conceal my thoughts from you  i know exactly what you mean about your father he is no martinet in society even with his son he assumes to himself no mysterious unintelligible dignity he has none of the military grimgruffenuff about him he takes things easily and allows other people to do the same  exactly  but this was not exactly what you wanted if he had treated you as though a father and son were necessarily of a different order of beings had he been a little less familiar a little colder perhaps a thought more stern and forbidding in his parental way of pushing the bottle to you you would have liked him better  no not have liked him better i might perhaps have thought it more natural  just so you went to look for a papa with a boys feelings and the papa who had not been looking for you at all took you for a man as you are when he found you  i am sure of this at any rate that he was delighted to see me  i am sure he was and proud of you when he did see you i never supposed but that the gallant colonel had some feelings in his bowels have you made any arrangements with him about money  nonone  said not a word about so mundane a subject  i dont say that it is only natural that we should have said something but as to income he fights his battle and i fight mine  he should now have a large income from his profession  and large expenses i suppose there is no dearer place in europe than constantinople  all places are dear to an englishman exactly in comparison as he knows or does not know the ways of the place a turk i have no doubt could live there in a very genteel sort of manner on what you would consider a moderate pittance  i suppose he could  and sir lionel by this time should be a turk in turkey a greek in greece or a persian in bagdad  perhaps he is but i was not i know i shall be very fairly cleared out by the time i get to london and yet i had expected to have three hundred pounds untouched there  such expectations always fall to the groundalways every quarter i allow myself exactly what i shall want and then i double it for emergencies  you are a lucky fellow to have the power to do so  yes but then i put my quarterly wants at a very low figure a figure that would be quite unsuitablequite unintelligible to the nephew of a croesus  the nephew of a croesus will have to put his quarterly wants at something about fifty pounds as far as i can see  my dear fellow when i observe that water bubbles up from a certain spot every winter and every spring and occasionally in the warm weather too i never think that it has run altogether dry because it may for a while cease to bubble up under the blazing sun of august nature of whose laws i know so much tells me that the water will come again  yes water will run in its natural course but when you have been supplied by an artificial pipe and have cut that off it is probable that you may run short  in such case i would say that having a due regard to prudence i would not cut off that very convenient artificial pipe  one may pay too dear harcourt even for ones water  as far as i am able to judge you have had yours without paying for it at all and if you lose it it will only be by your own obstinacy i would i had such an uncle to deal with  i would you had as for me i tell you fairly i do not mean to deal with him at all  i would i had i should know then that everything was open to me now i have everything to do for myself i do not despair however as for you the ball is at your foot  they talked very freely with each other as to their future hopes and future destinies harcourt seemed to take it as a settled matter that bertram should enter himself at the bar and bertram did not any longer contradict him since he had learnt miss waddingtons ideas on the subject he expressed no further desire to go into the church and had in fact nothing serious to say in favour of any of those other professions of which he had sometimes been accustomed to speak there was nothing but the bar left for him and therefore when harcourt at last asked him the question plainly he said that he supposed that such would be his fate  but on one subject bertram did not speak openly to his friend he said not a word to him about caroline harcourt was in many respects an excellent friend but he had hardly that softness of heart or that softness of expression which tempts one man to make another a confidant in an affair of love if harcourt had any such affairs himself he said nothing of them to bertram and at the present time bertram said nothing on the subject to him he kept that care deep in his own bosom he had as yet neither spoken a word nor written a word concerning it to any one and even when his friend had once casually asked him whether he had met much in the way of beauty in jerusalem he had felt himself to wince as though the subject were too painful to be spoken of  they reached london about the middle of october and harcourt declared that he must immediately put himself again into harness ten weeks of idleness said he is more than a man can well afford who has to look to himself for everything and i have now given myself eleven  and what are you going to do  do work all day and read all night take notice of all the dullest cases i can come across and read the most ponderous volumes that have been written on the delightful subject of law a sucking barrister who means to earn his bread has something to doas you will soon know  bertram soon learntnow for the first time for harcourt himself had said nothing on the subjectthat his friends name was already favourably known and that he had begun that career to which he so steadily looked forward his ice was already broken he had been employed as junior counsel in the great case of pike v perch and had distinguished himself not a little by his success in turning white into black  then you had decidedly the worst of it said bertram to him when the matter was talked over between them  oh decidedly but nevertheless we pulled through my opinion all along was that none of the pikes had a leg to stand upon there were three of them but i wont bore you with the case youll hear more of it some day for it will be on again before the lordsjustices in the spring  you were pikes counsel  one of themthe junior i had most of the fag and none of the honour thats of course  and you think that perch ought to have succeeded  well talking to you i really think he ought but i would not admit that to any one else sir ricketty giggs led for us and i know he thought so too at first though he got so carried away by his own eloquence at last that i believe he changed his mind  well if id thought that i wouldnt have held the brief for all the pikes that ever swam  if a mans case be weak then he is to have no advocate thats your idea of justice  if it be so weak that no one can be got to think it right of course he should have no advocate  and how are you to know till you have taken the matter up and sifted it but what you propose is quixotic in every way it will not hold water for a moment you know as well as i do that no barrister would keep a wig on his head who pretended to such a code of morals in his profession such a doctrine is a doctrine of puritanismor purism which is worse all this moonshine was very well for you when you talked of being a clergyman or an author or a painter one allows outsiders any amount of nonsense in their criticism as a matter of course but it wont do now bertram if you mean to put your shoulders to the wheel in the only profession which to my mind is worthy of an educated mans energies you must get rid of those cobwebs  upon my word harcourt when you hit on a subject you like your eloquence is wonderful sir ricketty giggs himself could hardly say more to defend his sins of forty years endurance  harcourt had spoken in earnest such milkandwater unpractical scruples were disgusting to his very soul in thinking of them to himself he would call them unmanly what was such a fellow as bertram a boy just fresh from college to animadvert upon and condemn the practice of the whole bar of england he had too a conviction clearly fixed in his own mind though he could hardly explain the grounds of it in words that in the long run the cause of justice would be better served by the present practice of allowing wrong and right to fight on equal terms by giving to wrong the same privilege that is given to right by giving to wrong even a wider privilege seeing that being in itself necessarily weak it needs the more protection he would declare that you were trampling on the fallen if you told him that wrong could be entitled to no privilege no protection whateverto no protection till it was admitted by itself admitted by all to be wrong  bertram had now to establish himself in london and he was also as he thought under the necessity of seeing two persons his uncle and miss waddington he could not settle himself well to work before he had done both one preliminary business he did settle for himself in order that his uncle when he saw him might know that his choice for the bar was made up and past recalling he selected that great and enduring chancery barrister mr neversaye die as the gamaliel at whose feet he would sit as the fountain from whence he would draw the coming waters of his own eloquence as the instructor of his legal infancy and guide of his legal youth harcourt was at the common law bar and therefore he recommended the other branch of the profession to his friend the common law said he may have the most dash about it but chancery has the substance george after thinking over the matter for some days gave it as his opinion that chancery barristers were rogues of a dye somewhat less black than the others and that he would select to be a rogue of that colour the matter was therefore so settled  his first step then was to see his uncle he told himselfand as he thought trulythat his doing so was a duty disagreeable in all respects to be attended with no pecuniary results but necessary to be performed in truth however the teaching of sir lionel and harcourt had not been altogether without effect at this present moment having just paid to mr neversaye die his first yearly contribution he was wellnigh penniless and after all if a rich uncle have money to bestow why should he not bestow it on a nephew money at any rate was not in itself deleterious so much george was already prepared to allow  he therefore called on his uncle in the city ha georgewhat youre back are you well come and dine at hadley tomorrow i must be at the bank before three goodbye my boy  this was all his uncle said to him at their first meeting then he saw mr pritchett for a moment  oh mr george i am glad to see you back sir very glad indeed sir i hear you have been to very foreign parts i hope you have always found the money right mr george  mr george shaking hands with him warmly assured him that the money had always been quite rightas long as it lasted  a little does not go a long way im sure in those very foreign parts said mr pritchett oracularly but mr george why didnt you write eh mr george  you dont mean to say that my uncle expected to hear from me  he asked very often whether i had any tidings ah mr george you dont know an old mans ways yet it would have been better for you to have been led by me and so you have seen mr lionelsir lionel i should say now i hope sir lionel is quite well  george told him that he had found his father in excellent health and was going away when mr pritchett asked another question or rather made another observation and so you saw miss waddington did you mr george  bertram felt that there was that in his countenance which might again betray him but he managed to turn away his face as he said yes i did meet her quite by chance at jerusalem  at jerusalem said mr pritchett with such a look of surprise with such an awestruck tone as might have suited some acquaintance of Æneass on hearing that gentleman tell how he had travelled beyond the styx mr pritchett was rather fat and wheezy and the effort made him sigh gently for the next two minutes  bertram had put on his hat and was going when mr pritchett recovering himself asked yet a further question and what did you think of miss waddington sir  think of her said george  a very beautiful young lady isnt she and clever too i knew her father well mr georgevery well isnt she a very handsome young lady ah well she hasnt money enough mr george thats the fact thats the fact butand mr pritchett whispered as he continuedthe old gentleman might make it more mr george  mr pritchett had a somewhat melancholy way of speaking of everything it was more in his tone than in his words and this tone which was all but sepulchral was perhaps owing rather to a short neck and an asthmatic tendency than to any real sorrow or natural lowness of spirits  those who saw mr pritchett often probably remembered this and counted on it but with george there was always a graveyard touch about these little interviews he could not therefore but have some melancholy presentiment when he heard miss waddington spoken of in such a tone  on the following day he went down to hadley and as was customary there found that he was to spend the evening têteàtête with his uncle nothing seemed changed since he had left it his uncle came in just before dinner and poked the fire exactly as he had done on the last visit george had paid him after a long absence come john were three minutes late why dont we have dinner he asked no questionat least not at firsteither about sir lionel or about jerusalem and seemed resolute to give the traveller none of that éclat to pay to his adventures none of that deferential awe which had been so well expressed by mr pritchett in two words  but mr bertram though he always began so coldly did usually improve after a few hours his tone would gradually become less cynical and harsh his words would come out more freely and he would appear somewhat less anxious to wound the amour propre of his companion  are you much wiser for your travels george he said at last when john had taken away the dinner and they were left alone with a bottle of port wine between them this too was asked in a very cynical tone but still there was some improvement in the very fact of his deigning to allude to the journey  yes i think i am rather wiser  well im glad of that as you have lost a year in your profession it is well that you should have gained something has your accession of wisdom been very extensive  somewhat short of solomons sir but probably quite as much as i should have picked up had i remained in london  that is very probable i suppose you have not the slightest idea how much it cost you indeed that would be a very vulgar way of looking at it  thanks to your unexpected kindness i have not been driven to any very close economy  ah that was pritchetts doing he seemed afraid that the land would not flow with milk and honey unless your pocket was fairly provided but of course its your own affair george it is money borrowed thats all  george did not quite understand what this meant and remained silent but at one moment it was almost on his tongue to say that it ought at least to be admitted that the borrower had not been very pressing in his application  and i suppose you have come back empty continued his uncle  george then explained exactly how he stood with regard to money saying how he had put himself into the hands of mr neversaye die how he had taken chambers in the middle temple and how a volume of blackstone was already lying open in his dingy sittingroom  very well very well i have no objection whatever you will perhaps make nothing at the bar and certainly never the half what you would have done with messrs dry and stickatit but thats your affair the bar is thoroughly respectable bytheby is your father satisfied with it as a profession this was the first allusion that mr bertram had made to his brother  perfectly so said george  because of course you were bound to consult him if this was intended for irony it was so well masked that george was not able to be sure of it  i did consult him sir said george turning red in accordance with that inveterate and stupid habit of his  that was right and did you consult him about another thing did you ask him what you were to live on till such time as you could earn your own bread  in answer to this george was obliged to own that he did not there was no necessity said he for he knows that i have my fellowship  oh ah yes and that of course relieves him of any further cause for anxiety in the matter i forgot that  uncle george you are always very hard on my father much too hard  am i  i think you are as regards his duty to me if i do not complain you need not  oh that is it is it i did think that up to this his remissness in doing his duty as a father had fallen rather on my shoulders than on yours but i suppose i have been mistaken eh  at any rate if you have to complain your complaint should be made to him not to me  but you see i have not time to run across the world to jerusalem and were i to do so the chances are ten to one i should not catch him if you will ask pritchett too you will find that your father is not the best correspondent in the world perhaps he has sent back by you some answer to pritchetts halfyearly letters  he has sent nothing by me  ill warrant he has not but come george own the truth did he borrow money from you when he saw you if he did not he showed a very low opinion of your finances and my liberality  george might have declared without any absolute falseness that his father had borrowed no money of him but he had not patience at the present moment to distinguish between what would be false and what not false in defending his fathers character he could not but feel that his father had behaved very shabbily to him and that sir lionels conduct could not be defended in detail but he also felt that his uncle was quite unjustifiable in wounding him by such attacks it was not to him that mr bertram should have complained of sir lionels remissness in money matters he resolved that he would not sit by and hear his father so spoken of and therefore utterly disregardful of what might be the terribly ill effects of his uncles anger he thus spoke out in a tone not of the meekest  i will neither defend my father mr bertram nor will i sit still and hear him so spoken of how far you may have just ground of complaint against him i do not know nor will i inquire he is my father and that should protect his name in my presence  hoity toity  i will ask you to hear me if you please sir i have received very many good offices from you for which i heartily thank you i am aware that i owe to you all my education and support up to this time this debt i fear i can never pay  and therefore like some other people you are inclined to resent it  no by heaven i would resent nothing said by you to myself but i will not sit by and hear my father ill spoken of i will notno not for all the money which you could give or leave me it seems to me that what i spend of your money is added up as a debt against my father  pray dont imagine my boy that that is any burden to him  it is a burden to me and i will endure it no longer while at school i knew nothing of these things and not much while i was at college now i do know something and feel something if you please sir i will renounce any further assistance from you whatever and beg in return that you will say nothing further to me as to any quarrel there may be between you and sir lionel  quarrel said his uncle getting up and standing with his back to the fire he has not spirit enough to quarrel with me  well i have said george who was now walking about the room and from the fire in his eyes it certainly appeared that he spoke the truth in this respect  i know the bitterness of your spirit against your brother continued george but your feelings should teach you not to show it before his son  mr bertram was still standing with his hands in his pockets leaning against the mantelpiece with his coattails over his arms he said nothing further at once but continued to fix his eyes on his nephew who was now walking backwards and forwards from one end of the room to the other with great vehemence i think at last said george that it will be better that i should go back to town goodnight sir  you are an ass said his uncle  very likely said george but asses will kick sometimes  and bray too said his uncle  there was a certain spirit about them both which made it difficult for either altogether to get the better of the other  that i may bray no more in your hearing i will wish you goodnight and again he held out his hand to the old man  his uncle took hold of his hand but he did not go through the process of shaking it nor did he at once let it go again he held it there for a time looking stedfastly into his nephews face and then he dropped it you had better sit down and drink your wine he said at last  i had rather return to town said george stoutly  and i had rather you stayed here said his uncle in a tone of voice that for him was goodhumoured come you need not be in a pet like a child stay where you are now and if you dont like to come again why you can stay away  as this was said in the manner of a request george did again sit down it will be foolish to make a fuss about it said he to himself and what he says is true i need not come again and i will not so he sat down and again sipped his wine  so you saw caroline at jerusalem said the old man after a pause of about twenty minutes  yes i met her with miss baker but who told you  who told me why miss baker of course they were both here for a week after their return  here in this house  why shouldnt they be here in this house miss baker is usually here three or four times every year  is she said george quite startled by the information why on earth had miss baker not told him of this  and what did you think of caroline asked mr bertram  think of her said george  perhaps you did not think anything about her at all if so i shall be delighted to punish her vanity by telling her so she had thought a great deal about you or at any rate she talked as though she had  this surprised george a great deal and almost made him forgive his uncle the inquiry he had received oh yes i did think of her said he i thought of her a little at least  oh a little  well i mean as much as one does generally think of people one meetsperhaps rather more than of others she is very handsome and clever and what i saw of her i liked  she is a favourite of minevery much so only that you are too young and have not as yet a shilling to depend on she might have done for a wife for you  and so saying he drew the candles to him took up his newspaper and was very soon fast asleep  george said nothing further that night to his uncle about caroline but he sat longing that the old man might again broach the subject he was almost angry with himself for not having told his uncle the whole truth but then he reflected that caroline had not yet acknowledged that she felt anything like affection for him and he said to himself over and over again that he was sure she would not marry him without loving him for all the rich uncles in christendom and yet it was a singular coincidence that he and his uncle should have thought of the same marriage  the next morning he was again more surprised on coming down to the breakfastparlour he found his uncle there before him walking up and down the room with his hands behind his back as soon as george had entered his uncle stopped his walk and bade him shut the door  george said he perhaps you are not very often right either in what you do or what you say but last night you were right  sir  yes last night you were right whatever may have been your fathers conduct you were right to defend it and bad as it has been i was wrong to speak of it as it deserved before you i will not do so again  thank you sir said george his eyes almost full of tears  that is what i suppose the people in the army call an ample apology perhaps however it may be made a little more ample  sir sir said george not quite understanding him pray do not say anything more  no i wont for i have got nothing more to say only this pritchett wants to see you be with him at three oclock today  at three oclock bertram was with pritchett and learned from that gentleman in the most frozen tone of which he was capable and with sundry little goodhumoured asthmatic chuckles that he had been desired to make arrangements for paying to mr george regularly an income of two hundred a year to be paid in the way of annuity till mr bertrams death and to be represented by an adequate sum in the funds whenever that muchtobelamented event should take place  to be sure sir said pritchett two hundred a year is nothing for you mr george but  but two hundred a year was a great deal to george that morning he had been very much puzzled to think how he was to keep himself going till he might be able to open the small end of the laws golden eggs     chapter xiii  littlebath   i abhor a mystery i would fain were it possible have my tale run through from its little prologue to the customary marriage in its last chapter with all the smoothness incidental to ordinary life i have no ambition to surprise my reader castles with unknown passages are not compatible with my homely muse i would as lief have to do with a giant in my booka real giant such as goliathas with a murdering monk with a scowling eye the age for such delights is i think gone we may say historically of mrs radcliffes time that there were mysterious sorrows in those days they are now as much out of date as are the giants  i would wish that a serene gratification might flow from my pages unsullied by a single start now i am aware that there is that in the last chapter which appears to offend against the spirit of calm recital which i profess people will begin to think that they are to be kept in the dark as to who is who that it is intended that their interest in the novel shall depend partly on a guess i would wish to have no guessing and therefore i at once proceed to tell all about it  miss caroline waddington was the granddaughter of old mr george bertram and was therefore speaking with absolute technical propriety the firstcousin once removed of her lover young mr george bertrama degree of relationship which happily admits of love and matrimony  old mr bertram has once or twice been alluded to as a bachelor and most of those who were best acquainted with him had no doubt of his being so to you my reader is permitted the great privilege of knowing that he was married very early in life he doubtless had his reasons for keeping this matter a secret at the time and the very early death of his wife saved him from the necessity of much talking about it afterwards his wife had died in giving birth to a daughter but the child had survived there was then living a sister of mrs bertrams who had been married some few years to a mr baker and the infant was received into this family of which our friend miss baker was a child miss baker was therefore a niece by marriage of mr bertram in this family caroline bertram was educated and she and mary baker were brought up together as sisters during this time mr bertram did his duty by his daughter as regards money as far as his means then went and was known in that family to be her father but elsewhere he was not so known the bakers lived in france and the fact of his having any such domestic tie was not suspected among his acquaintance in england  in the course of time his daughter married one mr waddington hardly with the full consent of the bakers for mr waddingtons means were smallbut not decidedly in opposition to it nor had the marriage been opposed by mr bertram he of course was asked to assist in supplying money for the young couple this he refused to give but he offered to mr waddington occupation by which an income could be earned mr waddington wisely acceded to his views and had he lived would doubtless have lived to become a rich man he died however within four years of his marriage and it so fell out that his wife did not survive him above a year or two  of this marriage caroline waddington our heroine was the sole offspring mr waddingtons commercial enterprises had not caused him to live in london though he had been required to be there frequently mr bertram had therefore seen more of him than of his own daughter the infant had been born in the house of the bakers and there she was brought up as an orphan of four years old she had come under the care of mary baker and under her care she remained miss baker was therefore not in truth her aunt what was their exact relationship i leave as a calculation to those conversant with the mysteries of genealogy i believe myself that she was almost as nearly connected with her lover  when mr waddington and his daughter were both dead mr bertram felt himself to be altogether relieved from family ties he was not yet an old man being then about fiftyfive but he was a very rich man it was of course considered that he would provide liberally for his grandchild but when asked to do so by miss baker he had replied that she was provided for that he had enabled the childs father to leave behind him four thousand pounds which for a girl was a provision sufficiently liberal that he would not give rise to false hopes that she would be his heiress but that if his niece mary baker would take the charge of her he would allow an income for the purpose this he had done with sufficient liberality  all that is mysterious has now i believe been unravelled and we may go back to our story of mr pritchett we should perhaps say a word he had been habituated in his sundry money dealings to look on miss baker as his patrons niece and had always called her as such indeed the connection had been so far back that he usually styled her miss mary but he did not know northough he was very suspicious on the matterdid he quite suspect what was the truth as to miss waddington she was niece to his patrons niece he knew no more than that excepting of course that she was the daughter of mr waddington and that she was mistress in her own right of four thousand pounds  mr pritchett was very anxious about his patrons wealth here was mr bertram turned seventy years of agemr pritchett himself was sixtysixand no one knew who was to be his heir as far as he mr pritchett was aware he had no heir mr george would naturally be soso thought mr pritchett and the old mans apparent anxiety respecting his nephew the habit which he had now given himself for years of paying the cost of that nephews education and the income which he now allowed him all led to such a conclusion but then the uncle liked so well to lead and mr george was so unwilling to be led had waddington lived he would have been the heir doubtless miss waddington might still be so or even miss baker mr bertram in his way was certainly very fond of miss baker it was thus that mr pritchett speculated from day to day george however was always regarded by him as the favourite in the race  and now at last we may return to our story  having seen his uncle georges next business was to see his ladylove his was a disposition which would not allow him to remain quiet while his hopes were so doubtful and his heart so racked had he been travelling with miss baker ever since and living in daily intercourse with caroline it is probable enough that he might by this time have been half tired of her but his love had had no such safetyvalve and was now therefore bubbling and boiling within his heart in a manner very subversive of legal accuracy and injurious to legal studies  it was absolutely necessary he said to himself that he should know on what ground he stood absolutely necessary also that he should be able to talk to some one on the subject so he wrote to miss baker saying that he intended to do himself the pleasure of renewing his acquaintance with her at littlebath and he determined to see arthur wilkinson on his way these were the days in which wilkinson was taking pupils at oxford the days in which he used to think so much of adela gauntlet  the meeting of the two friends was sufficiently joyous for such love sorrows as those which oppressed bertram when sitting in the chambers of mr neversaye die rarely oppress a young man in moments which would otherwise be jovial and arthur had at this time gotten over one misery and not yet fallen into another he had obtained the fellowship which he had hardly expected and was commencing the life of a don with all a dons comforts around him  well upon my word i envy you arthur i do indeed said bertram looking round his cousins room at balliol as they sat down to pass an evening quietly together this was what i always looked forward to as you did also you have obtained it i have forsworn it  your envy cannot be very envious said wilkinson laughing as all my bliss is still within your own reach you have still your rooms at oriel if you choose to go into them for bertram had been elected to a fellowship at that college  all thats easily said but somehow it couldnt be i dont know why it is arthur but i have panted to have the privileges of an ordained priest and yet it is not to be so i have looked forward to ordination as the highest ambition of a man but yet i shall never be ordained  why not george  it is not my destiny  on such a subject do not talk such nonsense  well at any rate it will not be my lot i do not mind telling you arthur but there is no one else to whom i could own how weak i am there have been moments since i have been away in which i have sworn to devote myself to this work so sworn when every object around me was gifted with some solemn tie which should have made my oath sacred and yet  welland yet as yet everything is in your own power  no arthur no it is not so i am now one of the myrmidons of that most special of special pleaders mr neversaye die i have given myself over to the glories of a horsehair wig whereas and heretofore must now be my gospel it is my doom to propagate falsehood instead of truth the struggle is severe at first there is a little revulsion of feeling but i shall do it very well after a time as easily i have no doubt as harcourt does  it is harcourt who has led you to this  perhaps so partly but noi wrong myself in that it has not been harcourt i have been talked over i have weakly allowed myself to be talked out of my own resolve but it has not been done by harcourt i must tell you all it is for that that i came here  and then he told the history of his love that history which to men of twentyfour and girls of twenty is of such vital importance a young man when first he loves and first knows that his love is frequent in the thoughts of the woman he has chosen feels himself to be separated from all humanity by an ambertinted cloudto be enveloped in a mystery of which common mortals know nothing he shakes his mane as he walks on with rapid step and regards himself almost as a god  and did she object to your taking orders asked wilkinson  object no i am nothing to her nothing on earth she would not have objected to my being a shoemaker but she said that she would advise me to think of the one trade as soon as the other  i cannot say that i think she showed either good feeling or good taste said wilkinson stiffly  ah my dear fellow you do not know her there was no bad taste in it as she said it i would defy her to say anything in bad taste but arthur that does not matter i have told her that i should go to the bar and as a man of honour i must keep my word to her  his cousin had not much inclination to lecture him wilkinson himself was now a clergyman but he had become so mainly because he had failed in obtaining the power of following any other profession he would have gone to the bar had he been able and felt himself by no means called to rebuke bertram for doing what he would fain have done himself  but she has not accepted you you say why should she be so unwilling that you should take orders her anxiety on your behalf tells a strong tale in your own favour  ah you say that because you do not understand her she was able to give me advice without giving the least shadow of encouragement indeed when she did advise me i had not even told her that i loved her but the fact is i cannot bear this state any longer i will know the worst at any rate i wish you could see her arthur you would not wonder that i should be uneasy  and so he went on with a lovers customary eloquence till a late hour in the night wilkinson was all patience but about one oclock he began to yawn and then they went to bed early on the following morning bertram started for littlebath  the littlebath world lives mostly in lodgings and miss baker and caroline lived there as the world mostly does there are three sets of persons who resort to littlebath there is the heavy fast and the lighter fast set there is also the pious set of the two fast sets neither is scandalously fast the pace is never very awful of the heavies it may be said that the gentlemen generally wear their coats padded are frequently seen standing idle about the parades and terraces that they always keep a horse and trot about the roads a good deal when the hounds go out the ladies are addicted to whist and false hair but pursue their pleasures with a discreet economy of the lighter fast set assembly balls are the ruling passion but even in these there is no wild extravagance the gentlemen of this division keep usually two horses on the sale of one of which their mind is much bent they drink plentifully of cherrybrandy on hunting days but as a rule they do not often misbehave themselves they are very careful not to be caught in marriage and talk about women much as a crafty knowing salmon might be presumed to talk about anglers the ladies are given to dancing of course and are none of them nearly so old as you might perhaps be led to imagine they greatly eschew cardplaying but nevertheless now and again one of them may be seen to lapse from her sphere and fall into that below if we may justly say that the votaries of whist are below the worshippers of terpsichore of the pious set much needs not be said as their light has never been hid under a bushel in spite of huntclubs and assemblyrooms they are the predominant power they live on the fat of the land they are a strong unctuous moral uncharitable people the men never cease making money for themselves nor the women making slippers for their clergymen  but though the residents at littlebath are thus separated as a rule into three classes the classes do not always keep themselves accurately to their divisions there will be some who own a double allegiance one set will tread upon another there will be those who can hardly be placed in either miss baker was among this latter number on principle she was an admirer of the great divine on the domestic comfort of whose toes so many fair fingers had employed themselves but nevertheless she was not averse to a rubber in its mildest forms caroline did not play whist but she occasionally gave way to the allurement prevalent among the younger female world of littlebath  miss baker lived in lodgings and bertram therefore went to an hotel had she been mistress of the largest house in littlebath he would hardly have ventured to propose himself as a guest the plough however is a good inn and he deposited himself there the hunting season at littlebath had commenced and bertram soon found that had he so wished he could with but little trouble have provided himself with a stud in the coffeeroom of his hotel  he had intended to call on miss baker on the evening of his arrival but he had not actually told her that he would do so and though he walked down to the terrace in which she lived his courage failed him when he got there and he would not go in it may be that evening calls are not the thing at littlebath he said to himself and so he walked back to his hotel  and on the following day he did not go before two oclock the consequence was that poor miss baker and her niece were kept at home in a state of miserable suspense to them his visit was quite as important as to himself and by one of them the elder namely it was regarded with an anxiety quite as nervous  when he did call he was received with all the hospitality due to an old friend why had he not come to tea the night before tea had been kept for him till eleven oclock why at any rate had he not come to breakfast he had been much nicer in jerusalem miss baker said  bertram answered hardly with the spirit which had marked all that he had said in that faraway land he had been afraid to disturb them so late and had been unwilling to intrude so early miss waddington looked up at him from the collar she was working and began to ask herself whether she really did like him so much  of course you will dine with us said miss baker george said he would but assured her that he had not intended to give so much trouble could this be the same man thought caroline who had snubbed mr mgabbery and had stood by laughing when she slipped into the water  all manner of questions were then asked and answered respecting their different journeys constantinople was described on one side and the tyrol and on the other the perils of the ride to jaffa the discomforts of the austrian boat to alexandria and the manners of the ladies from india with whom miss baker and her niece had travelled in their passage from egypt to marseilles then they said something about uncle georgenot that miss baker so called himand bertram said that he had learnt that miss baker had been staying at hadley  yes said she when i am in town i have always money matters to arrange with mr bertram or rather to have arranged by mr pritchett and i usually stay a day or two at hadley on this occasion i was there a week  george could not but think that up to the period of their meeting at jerusalem miss baker had been instructed to be silent about hadley but that she was now permitted to speak out openly  and so they sat and talked for an hour caroline had given her aunt strict injunctions not to go out of the room so as to leave them together during bertrams first visit of course it would be palpable that you did so for a purpose said caroline  and why not said miss baker innocently  never mind aunt but pray do not i dont wish it miss baker of course obeyed as she always did and so george sat there talking about anything or nothing rather lackadaisically till he got up to take his leave  you have not a horse here i suppose said miss baker  no but why do you ask i can get one in ten minutes no doubt  because caroline will be so glad to have some one to ride with her  nothing will induce aunt mary to mount a steed since the day she was lifted out of her saddle at jaffa said caroline  oh that journey mr bertram but i am a stronger woman than i ever thought i was to have lived through it  it was soon arranged that george should go back to his inn and hire a horse and that he and caroline should then ride together in another hour or so they were cantering up the face of ridgebury hill  but the ride produced very little caroline here required her attention and george did not find it practicable to remain close enough to his love or long enough close to her to say what he had to say with that emphasis which he felt that the subject demanded there were some little tender allusions to feats of horsemanship done in syria some mention of the mount of olives of miss todds picnic and the pool of siloam which might if properly handled have led to much but they did lead to nothing and when george helped miss waddington to dismount at miss bakers door that young lady had almost come to the conclusion that he had thought better of his love and that it would be well that she should think better of hers  in accordance with our professed attempt at plain speaking it may be as well explained here that miss baker with the view of sounding her uncles views and wishes had observed to him that george had appeared to her to admire caroline very much had the old man remarked as he might so probably have done that they were two fools and would probably become two beggars miss baker would have known that the match would be displeasing to him but he had not done so ah he said did he it is singular they should have met now miss baker in her wisdom had taken this as a strong hint that the match would not be displeasing to him  miss baker had clearly been on georges side from the beginning perhaps had she shown a little opposition carolines ardour might have been heightened as it was she had professed to doubt she had nothing to say against george much might doubtless be said in his favour but in fact miss waddington would have been glad to know what were the intentions of mr george bertram senior  i really wish he had stayed away she said to her aunt as they were getting ready for dinner  nonsense caroline why should he have stayed away why should you expect him to stay away had he stayed away you would have been the first to grumble dont be missish my dear  missish upon my word aunt mary you are becoming severe what i mean is that i dont think he cares so very much for me and on the whole i am notnot quite sure whetherwell i wont say anything more only it does seem to me that you are much more in love with him than i am  bertram came to dinner and so also did one of the littlebath curates a very energetic young man but who had not yet achieved above one or two pairs of worked slippers and a kettleholder greater things however were no doubt in store for him if he would remain true to his mission aunt mary had intended to ask no one but caroline had declared that it was out of the question to expect that mr bertram should drink his wine by himself  the whole evening was dull enough and the work of disenchantment on carolines part was nearly accomplished but bertram a few minutes before he went away as the curate was expatiating to miss baker on the excellence of his rectors last sermon found an occasion to say one word  miss waddington if i call tomorrow early after breakfast will you see me miss waddington looked as though there were nothing in the proposition to ruffle her serenity and said that she would georges words had been tame enough but there had been something in the fire of his eye that at last reminded her of jerusalem  on the next morning punctually at ten his knock was heard at the door caroline had at first persisted that her aunt should not absent herself but even miss baker would not obey such an injunction as this  how do you expect that the poor young man is to behave she had said i do not much care how he behaves caroline had replied but nevertheless she did care  she was therefore sitting alone when bertram entered the room he walked up to her and took her hand and as he did so he seemed to be altogether a different man from that of yesterday there was purpose enough in his countenance now and a purpose apparently which he had an intention of pursuing with some energy  miss waddington he said still holding her hand caroline or am i to apologize for calling you so or is the privilege to be my own and then still holding her hand he stood as though expectant of an answer that should settle the affair at once  our connection through your uncle entitles you to the privilege said caroline smiling and using a womans wiles to get out of the difficulty  i will take no privilege from you on such a basis what i have to ask of you must be given on my own account or on my own refused caroline since we parted in that room in jerusalem i have thought seriously of little else than of you you could not answer me then you gave me no answer you did not know your own heart you said you must know it now absence has taught me much and it must have taught you something  and what has it taught you said she with her eyes fixed on the ground  that the world has but one thing desirable for me and that i should not take a mans part unless i endeavoured to obtain it i am here to ask for it and now what has absence taught you  oh so many things i cannot repeat my lesson in one word as you do  come caroline i look at least for sincerity from you you are too good too gracious to indulge a girlish vanity at the cost of a mans suspense  missish and girlish miss waddington felt that it behoved her to look to her character these were words which had not usually been applied to her  indeed mr bertram i should think myself unpardonable to keep you in suspense  then answer me said he he had by this time let go her hand and was standing at a little distance from her on the hearthrug never had lady been wooed in a sterner manner but caroline almost felt that she liked him the better for it he had simpered and said his little nothings so like an ordinary gentleman during their ride that his present brusqueness was quite a relief to her  but still she did not answer him at once she essayed to stick her needle into her work and pricked her finger in lieu of it  come caroline am i wrong in supposing that now at least you must know your own feelings or shall i tell you again how dearly how truly i love you  nonono  answer me then in honest plain christian sincerity answer me as a true woman should answer a true man do you love me  for a moment there was no answer  well i will not ask again i will not torment you  oh mr bertram what am i to say what would you have me say do not be so stern with me  stern  well are you not stern and coming up close to him she looked into his face  caroline said he will you be my wife  i will it was a motion of the lips rather than a spoken word but nevertheless he heard it fool that he was not to have heard it before in the beating of her heart not to have seen it in the tear in her eye not to have felt it in the warmth of her hand  on that afternoon miss waddingtons ride was much more energetic and on that evening miss baker did not think it necessary to catch a curate to drink wine with george bertram he was made quite at home and given to understand that he had better leave the diningroom when the ladies did so  there was much talked over that evening and the next day the upshot of which was that no marriage could take place till next summer that perhaps it might be expedient to postpone it till the summer twelvemonths to this george put or would have put an absolute veto but miss baker only shook her head and smilingly said that she thought it must be so nothing was to be done before christmas but as miss baker was to be at hadley very early in january she undertook to inform mr bertram and gave strong hopes that he would be prevailed on to favour the marriage  it can make no difference to my purpose whether he does or no said george very independently     chapter xiv  ways and means   on the following day bertram returned to town now that he was a successful lover and about to take upon himself at some future time the responsible duties of a married man he became very energetic in the chambers of mr die he could hardly spare a day during the winter for running down to littlebath and whenever he did do so he took coke upon lyttleton down with him nor did he work in vain he never had worked in vain facility of acquiring the special knowledge which he sought had ever been one of his gifts mr die was already beginning to prophesy great things and his friend harcourt who occasionally wanted his society declared that he overdid his labours  down at littlebath they did not quite approve of all this industry caroline naturally thought that more of her lovers hours should be devoted to her and miss baker who looked on mr bertrams money as certainly destined either for caroline or george considered that he was wasting his time with his fusty books she had not dared to say much to george on this subject and he had not taken very well the little that she did say she could not tell him that caroline was mr bertrams granddaughter but she did remind him that he himself was mr bertrams nephew and hinted that though a profession might be very eligible for a young man of such brilliant prospects it could hardly be necessary for him absolutely to make a slave of himself to this george had answered somewhat curtly that he had no reason to expect anything further from his uncle and that as he looked forward to maintain himself and his wife by his successful exertions as a barrister it was absolutely necessary that he should at present work very hard i have lost a whole year he said to miss baker and nothing but very sharp work can atone for that  he never once saw his uncle after his first visit to littlebath till the next year was far advanced he felt no desire to see him and certainly no wish to be the bearer of tidings as to his own engagement miss baker had undertaken to do this and might do so if she so pleased as far as he was concerned he had no idea of asking permission to marry from any one  why should i ask him he had once said to miss baker i shall marry just the same whether he permits it or whether he does not  this was grievous to the ladies at littlebath very little had been said about money between george and miss baker up to this time nothing had been said between george and caroline but the two ladies knew that there could be no marriage till there was an adequate income the income of the gentleman when stripped of his fellowship would be two hundred pounds a year that of the lady was about the same now caroline waddington had no intention whatever of marrying on four hundred pounds a year and it must be more than three years at the very least before all this profound study would result in golden fees  now that the matter was so far settledsettled as bertram considered ithe did tell harcourt of his love harcourt said he one day i have a piece of news which perhaps i ought to tell you i am engaged to be married  are you said harcourt rather too coolly to satisfy his friends expectation  i am not joking  who ever accused you of joking since you took to the law and mr die i did not give you credit for a joke not even for so bad a one as that would be shall i congratulate or condole with you  either or neither perhaps you had better wait till you see the lady  and when is it to be  well in this coming summer i suppose that is my wish at least  and your wish of course will be law i presume then that i may be justified in surmising that the lady has some considerable fortune  no indeed she has not something she has got about as much perhaps as myself we shall have bread to eat  and occasionally cheese said harcourt who could not understand that any rising man could marry early unless in doing so he acquired money  and occasionally cheese repeated bertram this is a state of things that would not suit your book i know  not exactly said harcourt but men have very different ideas about women i could do and have done and am doing with a small income myself but a wife is in some respects like a horse if a gentleman does keep a horse it should be well groomed  you could not endure a woman who was not always got up in satin and velvet  not satin and velvet exactly i do not require a curiouslymounted saddle for my horse but i dont think i should have much enjoyment with a cheap wife i like cold mutton and candleends myself very well but i do not love feminine economies family washingbills kept at the lowest a maidofallwork with an allowance in lieu of beer and a dark morning gown for household work would not if i know myself add fuel to the ardour of my conjugal affection i love women dearly i like them to be near me but then i like them to be nice when a woman is nasty she is very nasty  bertram said in his heart that harcourt was a beast an animal without a soul a creature capable of no other joys than those of a material nature but he kept this opinion at the present moment to himself not however that he was averse to express himself openly before his friend he often gave harcourt to understand that he suspected him of being deficient in the article of a soul and harcourt would take the reproach with perfect goodhumour remarking perhaps that he might probably find it possible to get on decently without one  is the ladys name a secret he asked  no not to you at least i believe it is generally considered advisable that these sort of things should not be talked about quite openly till the consummation of them is nigh at hand i have no wish for any mystery in the matter her name is caroline waddington  what a daughter of sir augustus  no nothing to sir augustus that i have heard  she must then be one of the generals family  not that either her only relative that i know is a miss baker  miss baker said harcourt and the tone of his voice was not encouraging  yes miss baker said bertram and the tone of his voice was hardly conciliatory  ohahyes i dont exactly think i know her miss baker  it would be odd if you did for she lives at littlebath and hardly ever comes to town when she does she stays down at hadley with my uncle  ohh thats a horse of another colour i beg your pardon entirely my dear fellow why did you not tell me at first that this is a match of your uncles making  my uncles making it is not a match of my uncles making  well well one that he approves i hardly gave you credit for so much prudence that will be as good as having everything settled exactly as you could wish it  you are giving me a great deal too much credit said bertram laughing my uncle knows nothing about my marriage and i have not the slightest idea of consulting him i should think it mean to do so considering everything  mean to consult the only relative you have who can do anything for you  yes he has told me over and over again that i have no claim on him and therefore i will make none  bertram had said to himself frequently that he cared nothing for this mans judgment in such matters but nevertheless after what had passed he did desire that harcourt should see caroline he was aware judging rather from harcourts tone than from his words that that keensighted friend of his had but a low opinion of miss waddington that he thought that she was some ordinary intriguing girl who had been baiting a hook for a husband after the manner which scandal states to be so common among the littlebathians and bertram longed therefore to surprise his eyes and astound his intellect with a view of her charms and a near knowledge of her attributes nothing should be said of her beauty and the blaze of it should fall upon him altogether unprepared  george was right in his feelings in this respect harcourt had formed a very false idea of miss waddingtonhad led himself to imagine that she was secondrate and unattractive in the first place he had his own ideas about littlebath and conceived that it was not the place in which the highest beauty of england should be looked for and in the next place he knew george bertram and regarded him as a man peculiarly liable to such dangers as these  you must come down with me to littlebath when will you give me a day  harcourt demurred as he did not wish to be called on imperiously to praise a woman of whom he knew he should disapprove and endeavoured to excuse himself from the journey but bertram persisted and at last it was settled that he would go down  this did not happen till towards the end of winter miss baker had as she promised seen mr bertram in the meantime and the answer returned from the hadley oracle had like most oracleanswers been neither favourable nor unfavourable mr bertram had expressed no great anger at the tale of love that was told him but neither had he expressed any gratification well he had said it is odd that they should have come together very odd he is a clever young man and i dare say may do well miss baker had then ventured but in a very modest way to ask him his opinion as to the sufficiency of the young peoples income they must judge of that themselves he had said rather sharply but i suppose they have no idea of marrying as yet they mean to wait dont they till he begins his profession to this miss baker had made no answer and nothing further had been said at that meeting  early in march miss baker had again seen the great man she had then ventured to explain to him that george was working very hard  ah you have his word for that i suppose said the uncle but if so believe me he will get on at such work as that quicker without a wife than he will with one  but at this interview miss baker did ask him plainly as had been agreed beforehand between her and her niece that she should do whether he would on their marriage make any increase to his granddaughters fortune  she has a liberal ladylike provision said he  but they will not have enough to live on said miss baker  they will have a third more mary than i had when i married your aunt and yet i saved money on my income  but remember how they have been brought up sir  if they will be fine ladies and gentlemen they must take the penalties of being so fine ladies and gentlemen cannot marry at a moments notice as do ploughboys and milkmaids if they cannot live on a limited income they must wait he did however on this occasion go so far as to say that if they would wait for another twelvemonth and that if he were then living he would add two thousand pounds to carolines fortune as to george he had done as much as he intended to docertainly for the present george likes his own way said the old man and as far as i am concerned he shall have it it will be well for him to make his own career in the world he will be happier so than in spending my money  on this occasion miss baker was permitted to tell caroline all the circumstances of her parentage and grandparentage the same story might now be told to george but they were both to be cautioned that their relatives displeasure would be incurred by any useless repetition of it and mary said he do not let them mislead themselves do not let them marry with the idea that by so doing they will inherit between them my money i wish them both to understand that my views are altogether different  miss baker when she returned to littlebath could not think that she had been successful in her mission and caroline immediately declared that any idea of a marriage for that year or even for the next must now be altogether out of the question she was very much startled at hearing that mr bertram was her mothers father but did not pretend to any suddenly intense affection for him if that be so said she coldly if george and i are his only near connections and if he does not disapprove of our marriage he ought to give us an income on which we can live it is astonishing how different are the views of grandfathers and grandchildren on such matters  unfortunately there was no unanimity of opinion on this matter either between the lovers themselves or between them and their aunt george was of opinion that they should marry immediately on their present income and trust to providence and his exertions for a future increase for one year he would have the income of his fellowship in two years and a half he would be called and in the meantime he could make something by the magazines if caroline was not afraid he was not  but caroline was very much afraid it had by no means formed part of the project of her life to live in london as a married woman on four hundred pounds a year she knew she said to miss baker what effect that would have on her husbands affections she seemed indeed to share some of harcourts opinions on the subject and to have a dislike to feminine economies or at least to the use of them under the surveillance of a mans eye as far as she could see the marriage must be postponed indefinitelyat any rate till after george should have been called to the bar  miss bakers voice was for a middle course she suggested that they should wait for mr bertrams two thousand pounds and then marry they would then have an income increased to some extent they would also show a deference to the old mans views which would undoubtedlyso miss baker thoughthave ultimate results of a most beneficial nature after all as she remarked more than once to her niece who else is there  but the young people were quite as obstinate as the old man george would make no concession whatever to his uncle he was ready to marry on love and a small income and he expected caroline to show an equal warmth caroline would by no means alter her views or risk the misery of an illprovided nursery it had been the one great resolve of her life that she would not be a poor mans wife she was ready to wait she said if she could trust and wait surely george might do so a man with all the world around him encountered neither the misery nor the risk in waiting that fell to a girls lot  the disputes incidental to these different opinions did not ever take place between george and caroline he from a feeling of chivalry abstained from discussing money matters with her and she from a feeling of prudence was equally silent with him poor miss baker was the medium for it all george of course would press with a lovers ardour for an early day and caroline would of course say that an immediate marriage was she found impracticable and then each would refer the other to miss baker  things went on in this way till the middle of may sometimes george was almost angry and wrote letters that were somewhat savage sometimes caroline would be haughty and then she too could write letters which would tell her mind in good plain set terms but they were not near enough or sufficiently often with each other to quarrel  so matters went on till may and then on one fine mayday harcourt and george together took their places in the train for littlebath  i wonder what youll think of her said george of course youll tell the truth  oh of course said harcourt with his mind duly made up to praise her  you havent the pluck to find fault with her said george you would be afraid not to call her handsome even if you thought her as ugly as hecate  exactly said harcourt and therefore these little experimentary trips are never of any use     chapter xv  mr harcourts visit to littlebath   during the whole of the winter and spring georges attention to his work had been unremitting mr die was always prophesying still greater things and still greater once a fortnight on every other saturday bertram had gone down to littlebath but he had always returned to london by the first train on monday morning and was always up to his elbows in law even on that morning before eleven  during the whole of this time he had not once seen his uncle although miss baker had softly endeavoured to talk him into visiting hadley i never go there without being asked he had said it is quite understood between us  he had made but one excursion out of london except those to littlebath and that had been to hurst staple mr wilkinson had died very suddenly as has been told about the end of the winter and bertram had of course not been able to see him arthur wilkinson had then been quickly put into the living and as soon as he had taken up his residence in the parsonage bertram had gone down this visit had been made before the last walk to west putford but even then the young barrister had found the young vicar in rather a plaintive mood wilkinson however had said nothing of his love and george was too much occupied with talking of his own heart to think much of his cousins  miss gauntleti hope the reader has not altogether forgotten adela gauntlethad also an aunt living at littlebath miss penelope gauntlet and it so happened that very shortly after that memorable walk and the little scene that took place in the west putford drawingroom adela visited her aunt bertram who had known her well when they were children together had not yet seen her there indeed her arrival had taken place since his last visit but there she was staying with miss penelope gauntlet when he and harcourt went down to littlebath together  caroline and adela had for years been friends not bosom friends perhaps that is they did not correspond three times a week each sending to the other on each occasion three sheets of note paper crossed over on every page from top to bottom caroline had certainly no such bosom friend and perhaps neither had adela but they were friends enough to call each other by their christian names to lend each other music and patterns and perhaps to write when they had anything special to say there had been a sort of quasiconnection between miss baker and the elder miss gauntleta connection of a very faint local characterin years gone by miss baker by reason of her bertram relations had been at hurst staple and miss gauntlet had been at west putford at the same time they had thus become acquainted and the acquaintance there had led to a littlebath friendship friendships in littlebath are not of a very fervid description  miss waddington had now been engaged for six months and hitherto she had made no confidante she knew no resident at littlebath whom she would willingly trust with her hearts secret her aunt and her aunts cognizance of the matter were quite another thing no one could be more affectionate than aunt mary no one more trustworthy no one more thoroughly devoted to another than she was to her niece but then she was not only old but oldfashioned she was prudent and caroline also was prudent but their prudence was a different kind there was no dash no ambition about aunt marys prudence she was rather humdrum caroline thought and which was worse though she liked george bertram she did not seem to understand his character at all in the same light as that in which caroline regarded it  from these circumstances it came to pass that adela had not been a week at littlebath before she was made acquainted with the grand secret she also had a secret of her own but she did not tell that in return secrets such as carolines are made to be told but those other secrets those which burn up the heart instead of watering it as with a dew from heaven those secrets for the most part are not made to be told  and yet adela i suppose it will never happen this had been said on the morning of that saturday which was to bring down not only bertram but harcourt caroline knew well that the london friend the man of the world was being brought to inspect her and was by no means afraid of undergoing the inspection she was not timid by nature and though as has been already said she was hardly yet conscious of her powers of attracting she was never ashamed of herself  and why not i think that is nonsense caroline if you really thought that you would not receive him as you will do nor his friend neither  i do think it that is to say i think it very probable i cannot explain to you adela all the turns of my mind or of my heart i would not for worlds of gold marry a man i did not love  and do not you love mr bertram  yes i do at times very very much but i fear the time may come when i may love him less you will not understand me but the fact is i should love him better if he were less worthy of my loveif he were more worldly  no i do not understand that said adela thinking of her love and the worldly prudence of him who should have been her lover  that is ityou do not understand me and yet it is not selfishness on my part i would marry a man in the hope of making him happy  certainly said adela no girl should marry unless she have reasonable hope that she can do that  he would wish me to go to him now at once when we have no sufficient income to support us  four hundred a year said adela reproachfully  what would four hundred a year do in london were i to consent in a year or two he would be sick of me he would be a wretched man unless indeed his lawcourts and his club kept him from being wretchedhis home would not do so  adela silently compared the matter with her own affairs her ideas were so absolutely different if he could have contented himself to live upon potatoes she had once thought to herself i could have contented myself to live on the parings she said nothing of this however to caroline their dispositions she knew were different after all it may be that miss waddington had a truer knowledge of human nature  no i shall not consent i will not consent to be the cause of his misery and poverty and then he will be angry with me and we shall quarrel he can be very stern adela very  he is impetuous but however angry he may be he forgives immediately he never bears malice said adela remembering her early dealings with the boyfriend of her girlhood  he can be very stern now i know it will come to our quarrelling and when he finds that he cannot have his own way that i cannot yield to him his proud heart will revolt from me i know it will  adela could only say that were she in her friends place she would not think so much about income but her gentle speech the eloquence of which had an inward rather than an outward tendency had no effect on caroline if bertram could not persuade her it certainly was not probable that adela gauntlet should do so  messrs harcourt and bertram reached littlebath quite safely harcourt was to dine with the ladies in montpellier crescentit was in montpellier crescent that miss baker livedand as some sort of party was necessary for his honour the curate was again invited as were also the two miss gauntlets  youll go on first i suppose said harcourt when they had secured their rooms at the plough and were preparing to dress bertram was well known at the plough now and there was not a boots or chambermaid about the house who did not know why he came to littlebath  oh no said bertram ill wait for you  i didnt know i thought there might be some lovers privileges to be exercised for which the eyes of the world might be inconvenient  they shall be postponed on your behalf my dear fellow and so the two went off together  they found miss baker in her drawingroom and with her adela and aunt penelope  and where is caroline said george when the introductions had been duly performed he had to make a little effort to say this in a voice that should signify that he was at home there but which should not savour too much of the lover on the whole he succeeded pretty well  why to tell the truth said miss baker laughing she is doing duty at this moment as head butler in the diningroom if you feel any vocation that way you may go and help her  well i am a fairish good hand at drawing a cork said bertram as he left the room  so the lovers privileges are all arranged for thought harcourt to himself  when bertram entered the diningroom the butlers duties seemed to be complete at any rate miss waddington was not engaged in their performance she was leaning on the mantelpiece and was apparently engaged in contemplating a bouquet of flowers which bertram had contrived to send to the house since his arrival at littlebath it was no wonder that the boots should know all about it  let us agree to say nothing about the lovers privileges caroline waddington was not a girl to be very liberal of such favours and on the occasion in question she was not more liberal than usual  is mr harcourt here said she  yes of course he is he is upstairs  and i am to go up to be looked at how vain you men are of your playthings not that you have anything in this respect of which you ought to be vain  but a great deal of which i ought to be and am very proud i am proud of you caroline proud at this moment that my friend should see how beautiful is the girl that loves me  tush said caroline putting the back of her nosegay up to his mouth what delightful nonsense you can talk but come your london friend wont much appreciate my excellence if i keep him waiting for his dinner and so they went upstairs  but caroline though she laughed at her lover for showing her off had not failed to make the best of herself she was sufficiently anxious that bertram should be proud of her should have cause to be proud of her and she seemed to be aware that if she could satisfy mr harcourts fastidious judgment she might probably hope to pass as approved of among his other friends she determined therefore to look her best as she walked into the drawingroom and she did look her best  mr harcourt my niece miss waddington said miss baker harcourt as he rose and bowed was lost in wonder  bertram fell immediately into conversation with miss penelope gauntlet but even while listening to her enthusiasm as to arthur wilkinsons luck in getting the living of hurst staple and her praise of lord stapledean he contrived to keep an eye on his friend harcourt yes indeed quite fortunate wasnt it but as he thus spoke his very soul within him was rejoicing at his own triumph he had said nothing about caroline personally he had refrained his tongue and now he had his reward  we have said that harcourt was lost in wonder and such was literally the case he had taught himself to believe that caroline waddington was some tall sharpnosed dowdy with bright eyes probably and even teeth with a simpering wouldbewitty smile and full of little quick answers such as might suit well for the assemblyrooms at littlebath when he heard that she was engaged in seeing that the sherrybottles were duly decantered the standard of her value did not at all rise in his estimation candleends and cold mutton would doubtless be her forte an economical washingbill her strong point  so was he thinking much distressed in mindfor to do him justice he was as anxious on behalf of bertram as it was in his nature to be anxious for any onewhen a juno entered the room she did not swim in or fly in or glide in but walked in as women should walk if they properly understood their parts she walked in as though she were mistress of her own soul and afraid to meet no pair of eyes which any human being could bend upon her he had intended in his goodnature to patronise her but that other question instantly occurred to himwould she patronise him bertram he had known long and intimately and held him therefore somewhat cheap in many respects as we are all accustomed to hold our dearest friends but now at once he rose in his estimation a hundred per cent what might not be expected of a man whom such a woman would acknowledge that she loved  a juno had entered the room for her beauty as we have said before was that rather of the queen of the gods george immediately acknowledged to himself that he had never before seen her look so grandly beautiful her charms have been related and that relation shall not be repeated but when first seen by harcourt their power was more thoroughly acknowledged by him much more thoroughly than they had been by her lover when he had first met her then however she had been sitting at dinner between her aunt and mr mgabbery quite unconscious that any one was arriving whose existence could be of importance to her  there was no time for conversation then the surprise arising from her entrance had on harcourts part hardly subsided when the servant announced dinner and he was called on to give his arm to miss baker  i hope you approve your friends choice said that lady smiling  miss waddington is certainly the most lovely girl i ever beheld replied he with enthusiasm  the rev mr meek handed down miss penelope gauntlet and bertram followed with the two girls happy and highspirited he first tendered his arm to adela who positively refused it then to caroline who was equally determined then putting a hand behind the waist of each of them he pushed them through the door before him there are certainly some privileges which an accepted lover may take in a house and no one but an accepted lover  george took his seat at the bottom of the table as though he were quite at home and harcourt happy sinner found himself seated between adela and caroline he was not good enough for such bliss but had his virtues been ever so shining how could they have availed him neither of his neighbours had a portion of a heart left to call her own  but he was able to perceive that caroline was not only beautiful she talked to him almost exclusively for she had capriciously seated herself away from her lover and next to her aunt adela she had whispered going downstairs i shall look to you to talk to george all the evening for i mean to make a new conquest  bertram was delighted it was hardly in him to be jealous even had there been a shadow of cause as it was his love was doing exactly that which he wished her to do she was vindicating his choice to the man whose judgment on the matter was most vitally essential to him  when the ladies left the diningroom both bertram and harcourt heartily wished that miss baker had not been so scrupulously hospitable they hardly knew what to do with mr meek mr meek remarked that miss baker was a very nice person that miss waddington was a charming person that miss penelope gauntlet was a very nice person indeed and that miss adela was a very sweet person and then it seemed that all conversation was at end eh what none especially that is to say the middle temple such had been harcourts reply to mr meeks inquiry as to what london congregation he frequented and then the three gentlemen seemed to be much occupied with their wine and biscuits this invitation to mr meek had certainly been a mistake on miss bakers part  but the misery did not last long of the first occasion on which mr meeks glass was seen to be well empty george took advantage if you dont take any more wine mr meek we may as well go upstairs eh harcourt and he looked suppliantly at his friend  oh i never take any more wine you know im an anchorite on such occasions as these and so they went into the drawingroom long before miss baker had her coffee ready for them  you see a good deal of arthur now i suppose said bertram addressing adela  yes that is not a very great deal he has been busy since he took up the parish but i see mary frequently  do you think arthur likes it he seemed to me to be hardly so much gratified as i should have thought he would have been the living is a good one and the marquis was certainly goodnatured about it  oh yes he was said adela  it will be a long time i know before i earn five hundred pounds a year do you know he never wrote about it as though he thought hed been lucky in getting it  didnt he  never and i thought he was melancholy and out of spirits when i saw him the other day he ought to marry thats the fact a young clergyman with a living should always get a wife  you are like the fox that lost its tail said adela trying hard to show that she joined in the conversation without an effort  ah but the case is very different there can be no doubt that arthur ought to lose his tail his position in the world is one which especially requires him to lose it  he has his mother and sisters you know  oh mother and sisters mother and sisters are all very well or not very well as the case may be but the vicar of a parish should be a married man if you cant get a wife for him down there in hampshire i shall have him up to london and look one out for him there pray take the matter in hand when you go home miss gauntlet  adela smiled and did not blush nor did she say that she quite agreed with him that the vicar of a parish should be a married man  well i shant ask any questions said bertram as soon as he and harcourt were in the street or allow you to offer any opinion because as we have both agreed you have not pluck enough to give it impartially bertram as he said this could hardly preserve himself from a slight tone of triumph  she is simply the most most lovely woman that my eyes ever beheld said harcourt  tush cant you make it a little more out of the common way than that but harcourt without joke you need not trouble yourself i did want you to see her but i dont care twopence as to your liking her i shall think much more of your wife liking herif you ever have a wife  bertram upon my word i never was less in a mood to joke  that is saying very little for you are always in a mood to joke bertram understood it all saw clearly what impression miss waddington had made and for the moment was supremely happy  how ever you had the courage to propose yourself and your two hundred pounds a year to such a woman as that  ha ha ha why harcourt you are not at all like yourself if you admire her so much i shall beg you not to come to littlebath any more  perhaps i had better not but bertram i beg to congratulate you most heartily there is this against your future happiness  what  why you will never be known as mr george bertram but always as mrs george bertrams husband with such a brideelect as that you cannot expect to stand on your own bottom if you can count on being lordchancellor or secretary of state you may do so otherwise youll always be known as an appendage  oh ill put up with that misery  this visit of inspection had been very successful and george went to bed in the highest spirits in the highest spirits also he walked to church with harcourt and there met the two ladies there was something especially rapturous in the touch of his fingers as he shook hands with caroline when the service was over and miss baker declared that he looked almost handsome when he went home with them to lunch  but that afternoon his bliss was destined to receive something of a check it was imperative that harcourt should be in town early on the monday morning and therefore it had been settled that they should return by the latest train that sunday evening they would just be able to dine with miss baker and do this afterwards harcourt had of course been anxious to be allowed to return alone but bertram had declined to appear to be too much in love to leave his mistress and had persisted that he would accompany him  this having been so decided he had been invited to a little conference at miss bakers to be holden upstairs in her private little sittingroom before dinner he had had one or two chats with miss baker in that same room before now and therefore did not think so much of the invitation but on this occasion he also found caroline there he felt at once that he was to be encountered with opposition  miss baker opened the battle george said she caroline has made me promise to speak to you before you go up to town wont you sit down  upon my word said he seating himself on a sofa next to caroline i hardly know what to say to it you look so formal both of you if i am to be condemned my lord i hope youll give me a long day  thats just it said miss baker it must be a long day im afraid george  what do you mean  why this we think the marriage must be put off till after you have been called you are both young you know  nonsense said george rather too imperiously for a lover  nay but george it is not nonsense said caroline in her sweetest voice almost imploringly dont be impetuous dont be angry with us it is for your sake we say so  for my sake  yes for your sake for your sake and she put his hand inside her arm and almost pressed it to her bosom for your sake certainly george you of whom we are so much bound to think  then for my own sake i disdain any such solicitude i know the world at any rate as well as either of you  ah i am not sure of that said caroline  and i know well that our joint income should be ample for the next four or five years you will have to give up your horse  i should think nothing of that george nothing  and that is all how many thousand married couples are there do you suppose in london who are now living on less than what our income will be  many thousands doubtless but very few probably not one so living happily when the husband has been brought up in such a manner as has been master george bertram  caroline my belief is that you know nothing about it some of your wouldbegrand friends here in littlebath have been frightening you on the score of income  i have no friend in littlebath to whom i would condescend to speak on such a matter except aunt mary carolines tone as she said this showed some slight offence but not more than she had a right to show  and what do you say aunt mary  well i really agree with caroline i really do  ah she has talked you over this was true  and what is the date miss waddington that you are now kind enough to name for our weddingday asked george in a tone half of anger and half of banter to carolines ear the anger seemed to predominate  the day after you shall have been called to the bar mr bertram that is if the press of two such great events together will not be too much for you  of course you know that that is putting it off for nearly three years  for more than two i believe certainly  and you can talk quite coolly about such a delay as that  not quite coolly george but at any rate with a fixed purpose  and am not i then to have a fixed purpose also  certainly dearest you can you can say if you are cruel enough that it shall be postponed for two years again after that or you can say if you will do so that under such circumstances you will not marry me at all we have each got what you lawyers call a veto now george i put my veto upon poverty for you and discomfort and an untidy house and the perils of a complaining fretful wife if i can ever assist you to be happy and prosperous and elate before the world i will try my best to do so but i will not come to you like a clog round your neck to impede all your efforts in your first struggle at rising if i can wait george surely you can an unfulfilled engagement can be no impediment to a man whatever it may be to a girl  it may have been perceived by this time that miss waddington was not a person easy to be talked over on this occasion bertram failed altogether in moving her even though at one moment aunt mary had almost yielded to him caroline remained steady as a rock none of his eloquenceand he was very eloquent on the occasionchanged her at all she became soft in her tone and affectionate almost caressing in her manner but nothing would induce her to go from her point bertram got on a very high horse and spoke of the engagement as being thus practically broken off she did not become angry or declare that she took him at his word but with a low voice she said that she was aware that her determination gave him an option in the matter he would certainly be justified in so resolving nay might do so without the slightest stain upon his faith she herself would not violate the truth by saying that such a decision would give her pleasure that it wouldwould here for the first time she became rather agitated and before she could finish george was at her feet swearing that he could not would not live without her that she knew that he could not and would not do so  and so the little conference ended george had certainly gained nothing caroline had gained this that she had made known her resolution and had nevertheless not lost her lover to all the expressions of her determination not to marry till george should be a barrister aunt mary had added a little clausethat such decision might at any moment be changed by some new act of liberality on the part of uncle bertram in aunt marys mind the rich uncle the rich grandfather was still the god that was to come down upon the stage and relieve them from their great difficulty  as george returned to town with his friend his love was not quite so triumphant as it had been that morning on his road to church   end of vol i                                      the bertrams  a novel  by  anthony trollope  author of barchester towers doctor thorne etc  in three

marriagebells     the bertrams   chapter i  the new member for the battersea hamlets   i must now ask my readers to pass over two years with me it is a terrible gap in a story but in these days the unities are not much considered and a hiatus which would formerly have been regarded as a fault utterly fatal is now no more than a slight impropriety  but something must be told of the occurrences of these two years in the first place no marriage had taken placethat is among our personages nor had their ranks been thinned by any death in our retrospective view we will give the pas to mr harcourt for he had taken the greatest stride in winning that worlds success which is the goal of all our ambition he had gone on and prospered greatly and nowadays all men at the bar said all manner of good things of him he was already in parliament as the honourable member for the battersea hamlets and was not only there but listened to when it suited him to speak but when he did speak he spoke only as a lawyer he never allowed himself to be enticed away from his own profession by the meretricious allurements of general politics on points of law reform he had an energetic opinion on matters connected with justice he had ideas which were very much his ownor which at least were stated in language which was so being a denizen of the common law he was loud against the delays and cost of chancery and was supposed to have supplied the legal details of a very telling tale which was written about this time with the object of upsetting the lordchancellor as then constituted  but though he worked as a member only in legal matters of course he was always ready to support his party with his vote in all matters his party here had been his great difficulty on first entering the house of commons what should be his party  he had worked hard as a lawyer in so doing no party had been necessary to him honest hard workhonest that is as regarded the work itself if not always so as regarded the object honest hard work and some cunning in the method of his eloquence had at first sufficed him he was not called upon to have or at any rate to state any marked political tenets but no man can rise to great note as a lawyer without a party opulence without note would by no means have sufficed with mr harcourt  when therefore he found it expedient in the course of his profession to go into parliament and with this object presented himself to the inhabitants of the battersea hamlets it was necessary that he should adopt a party at that time the political watchword of the day was the repeal of the corn laws now the electors of the battersea hamlets required especially to know whether mr harcourt was or was not for free trade in corn  to tell the truth he did not care two straws about corn he cared only for lawfor that and what was to be got by it it was necessary that he should assume some care for cornlearn a good deal about it perhaps so as to be able if called on to talk on the subject by the hour at a stretch but it was not a matter on which he was personally solicitous a fortnight or so before he began his canvass  the conservatives were at that time in and were declared foes to free trade in corn they were committed to the maintenance of a duty on imported wheatif any men were ever politically committed to anything indeed it had latterly been their great shibbolethlatterly that is since their other greater shibboleths had been cut from under their feet  at that time men had not learnt thoroughly by experience as now they have that no reform no innovationexperience almost justifies us in saying no revolutionstinks so foully in the nostrils of an english tory politician as to be absolutely irreconcilable to him when taken in the refreshing waters of office any such pill can be swallowed this is now a fact recognized in politics and it is a great point gained in favour of that party that their power of deglutition should be so recognized let the people want what they will jew senators cheap corn vote by ballot no property qualification or anything else the tories will carry it for them if the whigs cannot a poor whig premier has none but the liberals to back him but a reforming tory will be backed by all the worldexcept those few whom his own dishonesty will personally have disgusted  but at that timesome twelve or fifteen years sinceall this was not a part of the political a b c and harcourt had much doubt in his own mind as to the party which ought to be blessed with his adherence lord chancellorships and lord chiefjusticeships though not enjoyed till middle life or indeed till the evening of a lawyers days must in fact be won or lost in the heyday of his career one false step in his political novitiate may cost him everything a man when known as a recognized whig may fight battle after battle with mercenary electors sit yawning year after year till twelve oclock ready to attack on every point the tactics of his honourable and learned friend on the treasury seats and yet see junior after junior rise to the bench before himand all because at starting he decided wrongly as to his party  if harcourt had predilections they were with the whigs but he was not weak enough to let any predilection be a burden to his interests where was the best opening for him the toriesi still prefer the name as being without definite meaning the direct falsehood implied in the title of conservative amounts almost to a libelthe tories were in but from the fact of being in were always liable to be turned out then too they were of course provided with attorneys and solicitorsgeneral lordsadvocate and legal hangerson of every sort the coming chances might be better with the whigs  under these circumstances he went to his old friend mr die mr neversaye die the rich quiet hardworking old chancery barrister to whose fostering care he had some time since recommended his friend bertram every one has some quiet old family confidential friend a man given to silence but of undoubted knowledge of the world whose experience is vast and who though he has not risen in the world himself is always the man to help others to do so every one has such a friend as this and mr neversaye die was harcourts friend mr die himself was supposed to be a tory quite of the old school a lord eldon tory but harcourt knew that this would in no way bias his judgment the mind of a barrister who has been for fifty years practising in court will never be biassed by his predilections  mr die soon understood the whole matter his young friend harcourt was going into parliament with the special object of becoming a solicitorgeneral as soon as possible he could so become by means only of two moving powers he must be solicitorgeneral either to the whigs or to the tories to which he should be so was a question mainly indifferent to mr harcourt himself and also to mr die in framing his advice  mr die himself of course regarded cornlaw repeal as an invention of the devil he had lived long enough to have regarded catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform in the same light could you have opened his mind you would probably have found there a settled conviction that the world was slowly coming to an end that end being brought about by such devilish works as these but you would also have found a conviction that the three per cents would last his time and that his fear for the future might with safety be thrown forward so as to appertain to the fourth or fifth or perhaps even to the tenth or twelfth coming generation mr die was not therefore personally wretched under his own political creed  i should be inclined to support the government if i were going into parliament as a young man said mr die  there are nine seniors of mine in the house who now do so by seniors mr harcourt alluded to his seniors at the bar  yes but they like young blood nowadays i think its the safest  i shall never carry the battersea hamlets unless i pledge myself on this cornlaw question  well said mr diewell a seat is certainly a great thing and not to be had at any moment i think i should be inclined to yield to the electors  and commit myself to the repeal of the corn laws  commit yourself said mr die with a gentle smile a public man has to commit himself to many things nowadays but my opinion is thatthat you may hold the popular opinion about free trade and be not a whit the less useful to sir robert on that account  mr harcourt was still a young man and was therefore excusable in not seeing to the depth of mr dies wisdom he certainly did not see to the depth of it but he had come to his oracle with faith and wisely resolved to be guided by wisdom so much superior to his own  never bind yourself wantonly to an expiring policy said mr die the man who does so has surely to unbind himself and to say the least of it that always takes time  so mr harcourt presented himself to the electors of the battersea hamlets as a man very anxious in their behalf in all things but anxious in their behalf above all things for free trade in corn is it credible that now in this year of grace 184 and so on such were the eloquent words which he addressed to the electors on this subject and so taken were they by his enthusiasm that they returned him by a large majority  mr dod therefore in his remarkably useful little parliamentary compendium put down mr harcourt as a liberal this he had an opportunity of doing immediately after mr harcourts election in his next edition however he added but supports the general policy of sir robert peels government  mr harcourt had altogether managed this little affair so well that despite his youth despite also those nine political seniors of his men began to talk of him as one who might shortly hope to fill high places he made himself very useful in the house and did so in a quiet businesslike unexciting manner very pleasant to the leading politician of the treasury bench  and then there came the irish famine and all the bindings of all the tories were scattered to the winds like feathers the irishmans potatopot ceased to be full and at once the great territorial magnates of england were convinced that they had clung to the horns of a false altar they were convinced or at least had to acknowledge such conviction the prime minister held short little debates with his underlingswith dukes and marquises with earls and viscounts held short debates with them but allowed to no underlingto no duke and to no viscountto have any longer an opinion of his own the altar had been a false altar it was enough for them that they were so told with great wisdom the majority of them considered that this was enough and so the bill for the repeal of the corn laws was brought before the house and the world knew that it would be carried  and now there was a great opportunity for mr harcourt he could support the prime minister and merit all manner of legal generalships without any selfunbinding alas such comfort as this can only belong to the young among politicians up to this period he had meddled only with law questions now was the time for him to come out with that great liberal speech which should merit the eternal gratitude of the tory leader just at the time at which we recommence our tale he did come out with a very great liberal speech in which as an independent member he vehemently eulogized the daring policy of that great man who as he said was brave enough and wise enough and good enough to save his country at the expense of his party whether there were not men who could have saved their country without betraying their friendswho would have done so had not sir robert been ready with his apostacy who in fact did so by forcing sir robert to his apostacyas to that mr harcourt then said nothing what might not be expected from the hands of a man so eulogized of a man who was thus able to keep the votes of the tories and carry the measures of the liberals of a man of whom it might now be predicated that his political power would end only with his political life we should be going on too fast were we to declare in how few months after this triumph that great political chieftain was driven from the treasury bench  mr harcourts name was now mentioned in all clubs and all diningrooms he was an acute and successful lawyer an eloquent debater and a young man the world was at his feet and mr die was very proud of him mr die was proud of him and proud also of his own advice he said nothing about it even to harcourt himself for to mr die had been given the gift of reticence but his old eye twinkled as his wisdom was confessed by the youth at his feet in politics one should always look forward he said as he held up to the light the glass of old port which he was about to sip in real life it is better to look backif one has anything to look back at mr die had something to look back at he had sixty thousand pounds in the funds  and now we must say a word of mr harcourt with reference to the other persons of our story he was still very intimate with bertram but he hardly regarded him in the same light as he had done two years before bertram had not hitherto justified the expectation of his friends this must be explained more at length in the next two chapters but the effect on harcourt had been that he no longer looked up with reverence to his friends undoubted talents he had a lower opinion of him than formerly indeed he himself had risen so quickly that he had left bertram immeasurably below him and the difference in their pursuits naturally brought them together less frequently than heretofore  but if harcourt was less concerned than he had been with george bertram junior he was much more concerned than he had been with george bertram senior he had in former days known nothing of the old merchant now he was within certain bounds almost intimate with him occasionally dined down at hadley and frequently consulted him on money matters of deep import  with miss baker also and caroline waddington mr harcourt was intimate between him and miss baker there existed a warm friendship and with caroline even he was on such terms that she often spoke to him as to the deep troubles of her love and engagement for these were deep troubles as will be seen also in the coming chapters  george bertram had been told by miss baker that caroline was the granddaughter of old mr bertram and george in his confidence with his friend had told him the secret indeed there had been hardly any alternative for george had been driven to consult his friend more than once as to this delay in his marriage and who can ever consult a friend with advantage on any subject without telling him all the circumstances  it was after this that harcourt and miss baker became so intimate the ladies at littlebath had many troubles and during those troubles the famous young barrister was very civil to them in the latter of those two years that are now gone circumstances had brought them up to london for a couple of months in the spring and then they saw much of mr harcourt but nothing of george bertram though george was still the affianced husband of miss waddington     chapter ii  retrospectivefirst year   george bertram had returned to town that sunday after the conference in miss bakers little room not in the very best of moods he had talked glibly enough on his way back because it had been necessary for him to hide his chagrin but he had done so in a cynical tone which had given harcourt to understand that something was wrong for some ten days after that there had been no intercourse between him and littlebath and then he had written a letter to caroline full of argument full also of tenderness in which he essayed to move her from her high resolve he had certainly written strongly if not well he was working he said nearly as hard as a man could work in order to insure success for her nothing he was aware but the idea that he was already justified in looking on her as his wife would have induced him to labour so strictly and for this he was grateful to her she had given him this great and necessary incitement and he therefore thanked god that he had on his shoulders the burden as well as in his heart the blessing of such an engagement but the strain would be too great for him if the burden were to remain present to him daily while the blessing was to be postponed for so long a time he had already felt his spirits numbed and his energy weakened it seemed to him in all his daily work that his great hope had been robbed from him his dreams told him that he was to be happy but his waking moments brought him back to disappointment he knew that he could not endure it that he could not remain there at his post diligent as he fain would be if his reward were to be postponed for so long as being under a holy engagement to you he wrote perhaps almost too solemnly i have given up that sort of life to which my natural disposition might have led me do not suppose that i say this with regret i rejoice to have done so rejoice to be so doing but it is for you that i do it should i not look to you for my reward granting that there may be risk shall not i share it supposing that there may be suffering shall not i endure it and if a man with his best efforts may protect a woman from suffering i will protect you so he had written and had ended by imploring her to let them be married that autumn  by return of post he got three lines from her calling him her dearest dearest george and requesting that he would allow her a week to answer his letter at length it could not be answered without deep thought this gratified him much and he wrote another note to her begging her on no account to hurry herself that he would wait for her reply with the utmost patience but again imploring her to be merciful it was however apparent in the tone of his note apparent at least to caroline that he judged the eloquence of his letter to be unanswerable and that he was already counting on her surrender this lessened the effect of it on carolines heartfor when first received it had had a strong effect  on that first morning when she read it in her bedroom before she went down to breakfast it certainly had a strong effect on her she made up her mind that she would say nothing about it to her aunt at any rate on that day her aunt would have advised her to yield at once and she would have preferred some counsellor of a sterner sort so she put the letter in her pocket went down tranquilly to breakfast and after breakfast wrote the note which we have mentioned  all that day she thought about it to herself and all the next day on the evening of the second day she had all but brought herself to give in then came georges note and the fancied tone of triumph hardened her heart once more on the evening of that day she was firm to her principles she had acted hitherto and would continue to act according to the course she had laid down for herself  on the fourth day she was sitting in the drawingroom alonefor her aunt had gone out of littlebath for the daywhen adela gauntlet came to call on her adela she knew would counsel her to yield and therefore she would certainly not have gone to adela for advice but she was sad at heart and sitting there with the letter among her threads and needles before her she gradually found it impossible not to talk of itto talk of it and at last to hand it over to be read  there could be no doubt at all as to the nature of adelas advice but caroline had had no conception of the impetuosity of matured conviction on the subject of the impassioned eloquence with which that advice would be given she had been far from thinking that adela had any such power of passion  well said she as adela slowly folded the sheet and put it back into its envelope well what answer shall i make to it  can you doubt caroline said adela and miss gauntlets eyes shone as caroline had never before seen them shine  indeed i do doubt doubt very much not that i ought to doubt what i knew to be wise a week ago i know also to be wise now but one is so weak and it is so hard to refuse those whom we love  hard indeed said adela to my thinking a woman would have a stone instead of a heart who could refuse such a request as that from a man to whom she has confessed her love  but because you love a man would you wish to make a beggar of him  we are too much afraid of what we call beggary said adela beggary caroline with four hundred pounds a year you had no right to accept a man if you intended to decline to live with him on such an income as that he should make no request it should come from him as a demand  a demand no his time for demands has not yet come  but it has come if you are true to your word you should have thought of all this and no doubt did think of it before you accepted him you have no right now to make him wretched  and therefore i will not make him poor  poor poor how fearfully afraid we are of poverty is there nothing worse than poverty what you call povertypoverty that cannot have its gowns starched above once a week caroline stared at her but adela went on broken hearts are not half so bad as that nor daily tears and disappointed hopes nor dry dull dead listless despondency without one drop of water to refresh it all that is as nothing to a wellgrounded apprehension as to ones larder never marry till you are sure that will be full let the heart be ever so empty  adela  for others there may be excuse she continued thinking then as always of that scene at west putford and defending to herself him whom to herself she so often accused but for you there can be none if you drive him from you now whatever evil may befall him will lie like a weight of lead upon your heart if you refuse him now he is not the man to take it quietly and wait  i can live without him  yes it is your pride to say so and i believe you could live without him but i think too well of you to believe that you could live happily without him nor will he be happy without you you will both be proud and stonyhearted and wretchedstonyhearted at least in appearance not fortunate enough to become so in reality  why adela one would think that you yourself were the victim of some passion nipped in its bud by a cruel prudence  and so i am as she said this she rose from her seat as though she intended standing there before her companion to go on with her impassioned warning but the effect was too much for her and falling down on her knees with her face buried in her hands she rested them on the sofa and gave way to sobs and tears  caroline was of course much shocked and did what she could to relieve her but adela merely begged that she might be left to herself one minute one minute she said plaintively in a voice so different from that she had used just now one minute and i shall be well again i have been very foolish but never say anything about it never never not to any one promise me promise me caroline dear caroline you do promise me no one knows it no one must know it  caroline did promise but with a natural curiosity she wanted to know the whole story adela however would tell her nothing would say no more about herself in the agony of her strong feeling she had once pointed to herself as a beacon but even she herself could not endure to do this again she would say nothing further about that but in a more plaintive and softer tone she did not cease to implore her friend not to throw away from her the rich heart which was still within her grasp  a scene such as this could not but have an effect on caroline but it did not ultimately have that which adela had wished it was miss waddingtons doctrine that she should not under any circumstances of life permit herself to be carried away by passion why then should she allow adelas passion to convince her what were the facts of adelas own case she knew nothing it might be that she had been cruelly treated her friends her lover or even she herself might have been in fault but it would surely be the extreme of folly for her caroline waddington to allow herself to be actuated by the example of one who had not even shown her of what that example consisted  the upshot of it all was that at the end of the week she wrote to george declaring that grieved as she was to grieve him she felt herself obliged to adhere to her former resolution she also wrote strongly and perhaps with more force of logic than her lover had done i trust the time will come she said when you will acknowledge that i have been right but of this i am quite sure that were i now to yield to you the time would come very quickly when you would acknowledge me to have been wrong and that you should then think me to have been wrong would kill me i am not i know fitted either by disposition or education to be a poor mans wife i say this with no pride though if you choose to take it for pride i cannot help myself nor are you fitted to be the husband of a poor wife your love and enthusiasm now make you look on want as a slight evil but have you ever tried want since you left school have you not had everything that money could buy you have you ever been called on to deny yourself any reasonable wish never i believe nor have i what right have we then to suppose that we can do that for each other which we have never yet done for ourselves  you talk of the misery of waiting is it not because you have as yet known no misery have not all men to wait who look for success in lifeto work and wait and bide their time your present work is i know too hard in whatever you do you have too much enthusiasm do not kill yourself by work for my sake if i may still plead my own sake do not do so you say you have given up that sort of life to which your disposition would have led you i do not believe your disposition to be bad and i should be grieved to think that you debar yourself from pleasures that are not bad because you are engaged to me there was that in the eagerness of bertrams protestations on this point which could not but be flattering to any girl but caroline when she thought of it did not wish to be so flattered she required less passion in her lover and more judgment she wanted him to be more awake to the fact that the true meaning of their engagement was this that they two should join themselves together in their worlds battle in order that together each might fight that battle more successfully than either of them could do apart  i write this with great grief she continued as i know that what i write will grieve you but i write it under a conviction that i am doing my duty by you i am ready however to acknowledge that such a delay may not be in consonance with your intentions when you proposed to me that neither of us have deceived the other wilfully i am quite sure but it may be that we have misunderstood each other if so dear george let all this be as though it had never been i do not say this on my own behalf if you so wish it i am ready to hold myself as yours and to wait ready i have said that is a cold word and you may supply any other that your heart wishes but if this waiting be contrary to your wishes be what you are not willing to endure then consider the matter as altogether in your own hands i certainly have no right to bind you to my will all that i ask in such case is that your decision shall not be delayed  such was miss waddingtons letter a portion of it at least for not above the half has been given here its effect upon bertram had not been exhilarating in his heart he called her cold and heartless and at first resolved to take her at her word and break off from her he would willingly have done so as far as she was concerned but he could not bring himself to do it on his own part he could not endure to part with her though he would willingly have punished her by telling her that she had forfeited her claim to him as it was he did nothing for three weeks he neither answered the letter nor went near her nor gave her any token that he was thinking about her  then came a note from miss baker asking him to come to littlebath it was goodhumoured playful almost witty too much so for miss bakers unassisted epistlecraft and he at once saw that caroline had dictated it her heart at any rate was light he answered it by one equally goodhumoured and playful and perhaps more witty addressed of course to miss baker in which he excused himself at present in consequence of the multiplicity of his town engagements it was june and he could not get away without making himself guilty of all manner of perjuries but in august he would certainly take littlebath on his way to scotland  he had intended that every light word should be a dagger in carolines bosom but there was not a pins prick in the whole of it sullen grief on his part would have hurt her and it would have hurt her had he taken her at her word and annulled their engagement for she had begun to find that she loved him more than she had thought possible she had talked in her prudence and written in her prudence of giving him up but when the time came in which she might expect a letter from him saying that so it should be her heart did tremble at the postmans knock she did feel that she had something to fear but his joyous clever laughing answer to her aunt was all that she could wish though she loved him she could wait though she loved him she did not wish him to be sad when he was away from her she had reason and measure in her love but it was love as she began to findalmost to her own astonishment  george had alluded not untruly to his own engagements on the day after he received carolines letter he shut up coke upon lyttleton for that term and shook the dust off his feet on the threshold of mr dies chambers why should he work why sit there filling his brain with cobwebs pouring over old fusty rules couched in obscure language and useful only for assisting mankind to cheat each other he had had an object but that was gone he had wished to prove to one heart to one soul that young as he was poor as he was she need not fear to trust herself to his guardianship despite his musty toils she did fear therefore he would have no more of them no more of them at any rate then while the sun was shining so brightly so he went down to richmond with twisleton and madden and hopgood and fortescue heaven knows what they did when they got back to town that nightor rather perhaps heavens enemy and why not caroline did not care whether or no he amused himself as other men do for her sake he had kept himself from these things as she was indifferent why need he care he cared no longer there was no more law that term no more eulogy from gratified mr die but of jovial days at richmond or elsewhere there were plenty plenty also of jovial bacchanalian nights in london miss waddington had been very prudent but there might perhaps have been a prudence yet more desirable  he did go down to littlebath on his way to scotland and remained there three days he made up his mind as he journeyed down to say nothing about their late correspondence to caroline till she should first speak of it and as she had come to an exactly similar resolution on her part and as both adhered to their intentions it so fell out that nothing in the matter was said by either of them caroline was quite satisfied but not so bertram he again said to himself that she was cold and passionless as cold as she is beautiful he declared as he walked home to the plough how very many young gentlemen have made the same soliloquy when their mistresses have not been so liberal as they would have had them  the lovers passed the three days together at littlebath with apparent satisfaction they rode together and walked together and on one evening danced together nay they talked together and miss baker thought that everything was smooth but bertram as he went off to scotland said to himself that she was very very cold and began to question with himself whether she did really love him  do write to me and tell me what sport you have caroline had said when he went away what a subject for a woman to choose for her lovers letters she never said write write often and always when you write swear that you love me oh yes ill write said bertram laughing ill give you a succinct account of every brace and send some of them too said miss baker certainly said george and so he did  he was joined with harcourt and one or two others in this trip to scotland and it was then that he told his friend how much he was disturbed by miss waddingtons obstinacy and how he doubted not as to her heart being his but as to her having a heart to belong to any one in answer to this harcourt gave him pretty nearly the same counsel as she had done wait my dear fellow with a little patience youll have lots of time before you for married troubles whats the use of a man having halfascore of children round him just when he is beginning to enjoy life it is that that miss waddington thinks about though of course she cant tell you so  and then alsothat is to say on some occasion a little subsequent to the conversation above alluded tobertram also told his friend what he knew of miss waddingtons birth  whewww whistled harcourt is that the case well now i am surprised  it is indeed  and he has agreed to the marriage  he knows of it and has not disagreed indeed he made some peddling little offer about money  but what has he said to you about it  nothing not a word i have only seen him once since christmas and then i did not speak of it nor did he  harcourt asked fifty other questions on the matter all eagerly as though he considered this newlylearned fact to be of the greatest importance all of which bertram answered till at last he was tired of talking of his uncle  i cannot see that it makes any difference said he whose granddaughter she is  but it does make the greatest difference i own that i am surprised now that miss waddington should wish to delay the marriage i thought i understood her feelings and conduct on the matter and must say that i regarded them as admirable but i cannot quite understand her now it certainly seems to me that with such a guarantee as that she needs be afraid of nothing whichever of you he selected it would come to the same thing  harcourt if she would marry me tomorrow because by doing so she would make sure of my uncles money by heaven i would not take her if she will not take me for myself and what i can do for her she may let me alone thus majestically spoke bertram sitting with his friend on the side of a scottish mountain with a flask of brandy and a case of sandwiches between them  then said harcourt you are an ass and as he spoke he finished the flask  bertram kept his word and told his ladylove all particulars as to the game he killed some particulars also he gave her as to scenery as to his friends and as to scotch people he wrote nice chatty amusing letters such as most people love to get from their friends but he said little or nothing about love once or twice he ventured to tell her of some pretty girl that he met of some adventure with a lairds daughter nay insinuated laughingly that he had not escaped from it quite heartwhole caroline answered his letter in the same tone told him with excellent comedy of the leading facts of life in littlebath recommended him by all means to go back after the lairds daughter described the joy of her heart at unexpectedly meeting mr mgabbery in the pumproom and her subsequent disappointment at hearing that there was now a mrs mgabbery he had married that miss jones of whom the parental potts had so strongly disapproved all this was very nice very amusing and very friendly but bertram as a lover knew that he was not satisfied  when he had done with the grouse and the lairds daughter he went to oxford but he did not then go again to littlebath he went to oxford and from thence to arthur wilkinsons parsonage here he saw much of adela and consoled himself by talking with her about caroline to her he did not conceal his great anger while he was still writing goodhumoured witty letters to his betrothed he was saying of her to adela gauntlet things harshharsher perhaps in that they were true  i had devoted myself to her he said i was working for her as a galleyslave works and was contented to do it i would have borne anything risked anything endured anything if she would have borne it with me all that i have should have gone to shield her from discomfort i love her still miss gauntlet it is perhaps my misery that i love her but i can never love her now as i should have done had she come to me then  how can i work now he said again i shall be called to the bar of course there is no difficulty in that and may perhaps earn what will make us decently respectable but the spirit the high spirit is gone she is better pleased that it should be so she is intolerant of enthusiasm is it not a pity miss gauntlet that we should be so different  what could adela say to him every word that he uttered was to her a trutha weary melancholy truth a repetition of that truth which was devouring her own heart she sympathized with him fully cordially ardently she said no word absolutely in dispraise of caroline but she admitted and at last admitted so often that according to her thinking caroline was wrong  wrong bertram would shout can there be a doubt can any one with a heart doubt adela said no no one with a heart could doubt  she has no heart said bertram she is lovely clever fascinating elegant she has everything a woman should have except a heartexcept a heart and then as he turned away his face adela could see that he brushed his hand across his eyes  what could she do but weep too and is it not known to all mencertainly it is to all womenhow dangerous are such tears  thus during his stay at hurst staple bertram was frequently at west putford but he observed that adela was not often at his cousins vicarage and that arthur was very seldom at west putford the families it was clear were on as good terms as ever adela and mary and sophia would be together and old mr gauntlet would dine at hurst staple and arthur would talk about the old rector freely enough but bertram rarely saw adela unless he went to the rectory and though he dined there with the wilkinson girls three or four times arthur only dined there once  have you and arthur quarrelled said he to adela one day laughing as he spoke  oh no said she but she could not keep down her rebellious colour as she answered him and bertram at once took the hint to her he said nothing further on that matter  and why dont you marry arthur he asked the next morning  and arthur also blushed not thinking then of adela gauntlet but of that pledge which he had given to lord stapledeana pledge of which he had repented every day since he had given it  and here it may be explained that as arthur wilkinson had repented of that pledge and had felt more strongly from day to day that it had put him in a false and unworthy position so did his mother from day to day feel with less force the compunction which she had at first expressed as to receiving her sons income this had become less and less and now perhaps it could no longer boast of an existence the arrangement seemed to her to be so essentially a good one her children were provided for in so convenient and so comfortable a manner it was so natural that she should regard herself as the mistress of that house that perhaps no blame is due to her in that this compunction ceased no blame is now heaped upon her and the fact is merely stated she had already learned to regard herself as the legal owner of that ecclesiastical income and seeing that her son deducted a stipend of one hundred and fifty pounds for merely doing the dutya curate would have only had the half of that sum as she sometimes said to herselfand seeing also that he had his fellowship she had no scruple in making him pay fairly for whatever extra accommodation he received at homeexactly as she would have done had poor dear old mr wilkinson not been out of the way considering all these comfortable circumstances poor dear old mr wilkinson was perhaps not regretted quite so much as might otherwise have been the case  mrs wilkinson was in the habit of saying many things from day to day in praise of that good lord stapledean who had so generously thought of her and her widowhood when she did so arthur would look grim and say nothing and his mother would know that he was displeased surely he cannot begrudge us the income she had once said to her eldest daughter oh no i am sure he does not said mary but somehow he is not so happy about things as he used to be then he must be a very ungrateful boy said the mother indeed what more could a young fullfledged vicar want than to have a comfortable house under his mothers apronstring  and why dont you marry bertram had asked his cousin it was odd that arthur should not marry seeing that adela gauntlet lived so near him and that adela was so very very beautiful  up to that day bertram had heard nothing of the circumstances under which the living had been given then did wilkinson tell him the story and ended by sayingyou now see that my marriage is quite out of the question  then bertram began to think that he understood why adela also remained unmarried and he began to ask himself whether all the world were as coldhearted as his caroline could it be that adela also had refused to venture till her future husband should have a good comfortable disposable income of his own but if so she would not have sympathized so warmly with him and if so what reason could there be why she and arthur should not meet each other could it then be that arthur wilkinson was such a coward  he said nothing on the matter to either of them for neither of them had confided to him their sorrowsif they had sorrows he had no wish to penetrate their secrets what he had said and what he had learnt he had said and learnt by accident he himself had not their gift of reticence so he talked of his love occasionally to arthur and he talked of it very often to adela  and the upshot of his talking to adela was always this why oh why was not his caroline more like to her caroline was doubtless the more beautiful doubtless the more clever doubtless the more fascinating but what are beauty and talent and fascination without a heart he was quite sure that adelas heart was warm  he went to littlebath no more that year it was well perhaps that he did not well or ill as the case may be had he done so he would in his then state of mind most assuredly have broken with miss waddington in lieu however of accepting miss bakers invitation for christmas he went to hadley and spent two or three days there uncomfortable himself and making the old man uncomfortable also  up to this time he had been completely idleat any rate as far as the law was concernedsince the day of his great break down on the receipt of miss waddingtons letter he still kept his temple chambers and when the day came round in october he made another annual payment to mr die on that occasion mr die had spoken rather seriously to him but up to that time his period of idleness had mainly been the period of the long vacation and mr die was willing to suppose that this continued payment was a sign that he intended to settle again to work  will it be impertinent to ask his uncle at hadley had said to himwill it be impertinent to ask what you and caroline intend to do at this time mr bertram was aware that his nephew knew in what relationship they all stood to each other  no impertinence at all sir but unfortunately we have no intentions in common we are engaged to be married and i want to keep my engagement  and she wants to break hers well i cannot but say that she is the wiser of the two  i dont know that her wisdom goes quite so far as that she is content to abide the evil day only she would postpone it  that is to say she has some prudence are you aware that i have proposed to make a considerable addition to her fortuneto hers mindon condition that she would postpone her marriage till next summer  i did hear something about some sum of moneythat you had spoken to miss baker about it i believe but i quite forget the particulars  you are very indifferent as to money matters mr barrister  i am indifferent as to the money matters of other people sir i had no intention of marrying miss waddington for her money before i knew that she was your granddaughter nor have i now that i do know it  for her money if you marry her for more money than her own fortune and perhaps a couple of thousands added to it you are likely to be mistaken  i shall never make any mistake of that kind as far as i am concerned you are quite welcome for me to keep your two thousand pounds  thats kind of you  i would marry her tomorrow without it i am not at all sure that i will marry her next year with it if you exercise any authority over her as her grandfather i wish you would tell her so as coming from me  upon my word you carry it high as a lover  not too high i hope as a man  well george remember this once for alland now the old man spoke in a much more serious voicei will not interfere at all as her grandfather nor will i have it known that i am such do you understand that  i understand sir that it is not your wish that it should be generally talked of  and i trust that wish has been and will be complied with by you  this last speech was not put in the form of a question but george understood that it was intended to elicit from him a promise for the future and an assurance as to the past  i have mentioned the circumstance to one intimate friend with whom i was all but obliged to discuss the matter  obliged to discuss my private concerns sir  with one friend sir with two indeed i thinkindeed i fear i have mentioned it to three  oh to three obliged to discuss your own most private concerns as well as mine with three intimate friends you are lucky sir to have so many intimate friends as my concerns have been made known to them as well as your own may i ask who they are  george then gave up the three names they were those of mr harcourt the rev arthur wilkinson and miss adela gauntlet his uncle was very angry had he utterly denied the fact of his ever having mentioned the matter to any one and had it been afterwards discovered that such denial was false mr bertram would not have been by much so angry the offence and the lie together but joined with the fear and deference to which the lie would have testified would be nothing so black as the offence without the lie and without the fear and without the deference  his uncle was very angry but on that day he said nothing further on the matter neither on the next day did he but on the third day just as george was about to leave hadley he said in his usual bantering tone dont have any more intimate friends george as far as my private matters are concerned  no sir i will not said george  it was in consequence of what mr bertram had then learnt that he became acquainted with mr harcourt as mr harcourt had heard this about his grandchild he thought it better to see that learned gentleman he did see him and as has been before stated they became intimate with each other  and so ended the first of these two years     chapter iii  retrospectivesecond year   the next year passed almost more uncomfortably for george bertram and for the ladies at littlebath than had the latter months of the last year its occurrences can i hope be stated less in detail so that we may get on without too great delay to the incidents of the period which is to be awhile for us the present existing time  this year was harcourts great year in january and february and march he did great things in chancery in april he came into parliament in may and june and july he sat on committees in august he stuck to his work till london was no longer endurable in the latter part of autumn there was an extraordinary session during which he worked like a horse he studied the cornlaw question as well as sundry legal reforms all the christmas week and in the following spring he came out with his great speech on behalf of sir robert peel but nevertheless he found time to devote to the cares and troubles of miss baker and miss waddington  in the spring bertram paid one or two visits to littlebath but it may be doubted whether he made himself altogether agreeable there he stated broadly that he was doing little or nothing at his profession he was he said engaged on other matters the great excitement to work under which he had commenced had been withdrawn from him and under these circumstances he was not inclined to devote himself exclusively to studies which certainly were not to his taste he did not condescend again to ask caroline to revoke her sentence he pressed now for no marriage but he made it quite apparent that all the changes in himself for the worseand there had been changes for the worsewere owing to her obstinacy  he was now living a life of dissipation i do not intend that it should be understood that he utterly gave himself up to pleasures disgraceful in themselves that he altogether abandoned the reins and allowed himself to live such a life as is passed by some young men in london his tastes and appetites were too high for this he did not sink into a slough of despond he did not become filthy and vicious callous and bestial but he departed very widely astray from those rules which governed him during his first six months in london  all this was well known at littlebath nor did bertram at all endeavour to conceal the truth indeed it may be said of him that he never concealed anything in this especial case he took a pride in letting caroline know the full extent of the evil she had done  it was a question with them whether he had not now given up the bar as a profession altogether he did not say that he had done so and it was certainly his intention to keep his terms and to be called but he had now no longer a legal gamaliel some time in the april of this year mr die had written to him a very kind little note begging him to call one special morning at the chambers in stone buildings if not very inconvenient to him bertram did call and mr die with many professions of regard and regret honestly returned to him his money paid for that years tutelage it had been he said a pleasure and a pride to him to have mr bertram in his chambers and would still be so to have him there again but he could not take a gentlemans money under a false pretence as it seemed to be no longer mr bertrams intention to attend there he must beg to refund it and he did refund it accordingly this also was made known to the ladies at littlebath  he was engaged he had said on other matters this also was true during the first six months of his anger he had been content to be idle but idleness did not suit him so he sat himself down and wrote a book he published this book without his name but he told them at littlebath of his authorship and some one also told of it at oxford the bookor bookling for it consisted but of one small demyoctavo volumewas not such as delighted his friends either at littlebath or at oxford or even at those two hampshire parsonages at littlebath it made miss bakers hair stand on end and at oxford it gave rise to a suggestion in some orthodox quarters that mr bertram should be requested to resign his fellowship  it has been told how sitting on the mount of olives he had been ready to devote himself to the service of the church to which he belonged could his mind have been known at that time how proud might one have been of him his mind was not then known but now after a lapse of two years he made it as it were public and oriel was by no means proud of him  the name of his little book was a very awful name it was called the romance of scripture he began in his first chapter with an earnest remonstrance against that condemnation which he knew the injustice of the world would pronounce against him there was nothing in his book he said to warrant any man in accusing him of unbelief let those who were so inclined to accuse him read and judge he had called things by their true names and that doubtless by some would be imputed to him as a sin but it would be found that he had gone no further in impugning the truth of scripture than many other writers before him some of whom had since been rewarded for their writings by high promotion in the church the bishops bench was the reward for orthodoxy but there had been a taste for liberal deans he had gone no further he said than many deans  it was acknowledged he went on to say that all scripture statements could not now be taken as true to the letter particularly not as true to the letter as now adopted by englishmen it seemed to him that the generality of his countrymen were of opinion that the inspired writers had themselves written in english it was forgotten that they were orientals who wrote in the language natural to them with the customary grandiloquence of orientalism with the poetic exaggeration which in the east was the breath of life it was forgotten also that they wrote in ignorance of those natural truths which men had now acquired by experience and induction and not by revelation their truth was the truth of heaven not the truth of earth no man thought that the sun in those days did rise and set moving round the earth because a prolongation of the day had been described by the sun standing still upon gibeon and then he took the book of job and measured that by the light of his own candleand so on  the book was undoubtedly clever and men read it women also read it and began to talk some of them at least of the blindness of their mothers who had not had wit to see that these old chronicles were very much as other old chronicles the romance of scripture was to be seen frequently in booksellers advertisements and mr mudie told how he always had two thousand copies of it on his shelves so our friend did something in the world but what he did do was unfortunately not applauded by his friends  harcourt very plainly told him that a man who scribbled never did any good at the bar the two trades he said were not compatible  no said george i believe not an author must be nothing if he do not love truth a barrister must be nothing if he do harcourt was no whit annoyed by the repartee but having given his warning went his way to his work  it was very well known that the romance of scripture was bertrams work and there was a comfortable row about it at oxford the row was all private of courseas was necessary the book having been published without the authors name but much was said and many letters were written bertram in writing to the friend at oriel who took up the cudgels in his defence made three statements first that no one at oxford had a right to suppose that he was the author second that he was the author and that no one at oxford had a right to find fault with what he had written thirdly that it was quite a matter of indifference to him who did find fault to this however he added that he was ready to resign his fellowship tomorrow if the commonroom at oriel wished to get rid of him  so the matter restedfor awhile those who at this time knew bertram best were confident enough that his belief was shaken in spite of the remonstrance so loudly put forth in his first pages he had intended to be honest in his remonstrance but it is not every man who exactly knows what he does believe every man is there one may almost ask any man who has such knowledge we all believe in the resurrection of the body we say so at least but what do we believe by it  men may be firm believers and yet doubt some bible statementsdoubt the letter of such statements but men who are firm believers will not be those to put forth their doubts with all their eloquence such men if they devote their time to scripture history will not be arrested by the suns standing on gibeon if they speak out at all they will speak out rather as to all they do believe than as to the little that they doubt it was soon known to bertrams world that those who regarded him as a freethinker did him no great injustice  this and other things made them very unhappy at littlebath the very fact of george having written such a book nearly scared miss baker out of her wits she according to her own lights would have placed freethinkers in the same category with murderers regicides and horrid mysterious sinners who commit crimes too dreadful for women to think of she would not believe that bertram was one of these but it was fearful to think that any one should so call him caroline perhaps would not so much have minded this flaw in her future husbands faith if it had not been proof of his unsteadiness of his unfitness for the worlds battle she remembered what he had said to her two years since on the mount of olives and then thought of what he was saying now everything with him was impulse and enthusiasm all judgment was wanting how should such as he get on in the world and had she indissolubly linked her lot to that of one who was so incapable of success no indissolubly she had not so linked it not as yet  one night she opened her mind to her aunt and spoke very seriously of her position i hardly know what i ought to do she said i know how much i owe him i know how much he has a right to expect from me and i would pay him all i owe i would do my duty by him even at the sacrifice of myself if i could plainly see what my duty is  but caroline do you wish to give him up  no not if i could keep him keep him as he was my high hopes are done with my ambition is over i no longer look for much but i would fain know that he still loves me before i marry him i would wish to be sure that he means to live with me in his present mood how can i know aught of him how be sure of anything  her aunt after remaining for some halfhour in consideration at last and with reluctance gave her advice  it all but breaks my heart to say so but caroline i think i would abandon it i think i would ask him to release me from my promise  it may well be imagined that miss waddington was not herself when she declared that her high hopes were done with that her ambition was over she was not herself anxiety sorrow and doubtdoubt as to the man whom she had pledged herself to love whom she did lovehad made her ill and she was not herself she had become thin and pale and was looking old and wan she sat silent for awhile leaning with her head on her hand and made no answer to her aunts suggestion  i really would caroline indeed i would i know you are not happy as you are  happy  you are looking wretchedly ill too i know all this is wearing you take my advice caroline and write to him  there are two reasons against it aunt two strong reasons  what reasons love  in the first place i love him aunt mary sighed she had no other answer but a sigh to give to this and in the next place i have no right to ask anything of him  why not caroline  he made his request to me and i refused it had i consented to marry him last year all this would have been different i intended to do right and even now i do not think that i was wrong but i cannot impute fault to him he does all this in order that i may impute it and that then he may have his revenge  nothing more was said on the matter at that time and things went on for awhile again in the same unsatisfactory state  early in the summer miss waddington and her aunt went up for a few weeks to london it had been miss bakers habit to spend some days at hadley about this time of the year she suggested to caroline that instead of her doing so they should both go for a week or so to london she thought that the change would be good for her niece and she thought also though of this she said nothing that caroline would see something of her lover if he were not to be given up it would be wellso miss baker thoughtthat this marriage should be delayed no longer bertram was determined to prove that marriage was necessary to tame him he had proved itat any rate to miss bakers satisfaction there would now be money enough to live on as uncle bertrams two thousand pounds had been promised for this summer on this little scheme miss baker went to work  caroline made no opposition to the london plan she said nothing about george in connection with it but her heart was somewhat softened and she wished to see him  miss baker therefore wrote up for rooms she would naturally one would say have written to george but there were now little jealousies and commencements of hot blood even between them george though still carolines engaged lover was known to have some bitter feelings and was believed perhaps by miss baker to be more bitter than he really was so the lodgings were taken without any reference to him when they reached town they found that he was abroad  then miss waddington was really angry they had no right it is true to be annoyed in that he was not there to meet them they had not given him the opportunity but it did appear to them that circumstanced as they were considering the acknowledged engagement between them he was wrong to leave the country without letting them have a word to say whither he was going or for how long it was nearly a fortnight since he had written to caroline and for anything they knew it might be months before she again heard from him  it was then that they sent for harcourt and at this period that they became so intimate with him bertram had told him of this foreign trip but only a day or two before he had taken his departure it was just at this time that there had been the noise about the romance of scripture bertram had defended himself in one or two newspapers had written his defiant letter to his friend at oxford and then started to meet his father at paris he was going no further and might be back in a week this however must be uncertain as his return would depend on that of sir lionel sir lionel intended to come to london with him  mr harcourt was very attentive to themin spite of his being at that time so useful a public man he was very attentive to both being almost as civil to the elder lady as he was to the younger which for an englishman showed very good breeding by degrees they both began to regard him with confidencewith sufficient confidence to talk to him of bertram with sufficient confidence even to tell him of all their fears by degrees caroline would talk to him alone and when once she permitted herself to do so she concealed nothing  harcourt said not a word against his friend that friend himself might perhaps have thought that his friend speaking of him behind his back might have spoken more warmly in his praise but it was hard at present to say much that should be true in bertrams praise he was not living in a wise or prudent manner not preparing himself in any way to live as a man should live by the sweat of his brow harcourt could not say much in his favour that bertram was clever honest true and highspirited that miss waddington knew that miss baker knew what they wanted to learn was that he was making prudent use of these high qualities harcourt could not say that he was doing so  that he will fall on his legs at last said harcourt once when he was alone with caroline i do not doubt with his talent and his high honest love of virtue it is all but impossible that he should throw himself away but the present moment is of such vital importance it is so hard to make up for the loss even of twelve months  i am sure it is said caroline but i would not care for that so much if i thought  thought what miss waddington  that his disposition was not altered he was so frank so candid sososo affectionate  it is the manner of men to change in that respect they become perhaps not less affectionate but less demonstrative  to this miss waddington answered nothing it might probably be so it was singular enough that she with her ideas should be complaining to a perfect stranger of an uncaressing unloving manner in her lover she who had professed to herself that she lived so little for love had george been even kneeling at her knee her heart would have been stern enough it was only by feeling a womans wrong that she found herself endowed with a womans privilege  i do not think that bertrams heart is changed continued harcourt he is doubtless very angry that his requests to you last summer were not complied with  but how could we have married then mr harcourt think what our income would have been and he as yet without any profession  i am not blaming you i am not taking his part against you i only say that he is very angry  but does he bear malice mr harcourt  no he does not bear malice men may be angry without bearing malice he thinks that you have shown a want of confidence in him and are still showing it  and has he not justified that want of confidence  to this harcourt answered nothing but he smiled slightly  well has he not what could i have done what ought i to have done tell me mr harcourt it distresses me beyond measure that you should think i have been to blame  i do not think so far from it miss waddington bertram is my dear friend and i know his fine qualities but i cannot but own that he justified you in that temporary want of confidence which you now express  mr harcourt though a member of parliament and a learned pundit was nevertheless a very young man he was an unmarried man also and a man not yet engaged to be married it may be surmised that george bertram would not have been pleased had he known the sort of conversations that were held between his dear friend and his betrothed bride and yet caroline at this period loved him better than ever she had done  a week or ten days after this three letters arrived from bertram one for caroline one for miss baker and one for harcourt caroline and her aunt had lingered in london both doubtless in the hope that bertram would return there can be little doubt now that had he returned and had he been anxious for the marriage miss waddington would have consented she was becoming ill at ease dissatisfied what the world calls heartbroken now that she was tried she found herself not to be so strong in her own resolves she was not sick from love alone her position was altogether wretchedthough she was engaged and persisted in adhering to her engagement she felt and often expressed to her aunt a presentiment that she and bertram would never be married  they waited for awhile in the hope that he might return but instead of himself there came three letters harcourt it seemed had written to him and hence arose these epistles that to miss baker was very civil and friendly had that come alone it would have created no complaint he explained to her that had he expected her visit to london he would have endeavoured to meet her that he could not now return as he had promised to remain awhile with his father sir lionel had been unwell and the waters of vichy had been recommended he was going to vichy with sir lionel and would not be in london till august his plans after that were altogether unsettled but he would not be long in london before he came to littlebath such was his letter to miss baker  to harcourt he wrote very shortly he was obliged to him for the interest he took in the welfare of miss waddington and for his attention to miss baker that was nearly all he said there was not an angry word in the letter but nevertheless his friend was able to deduce from it short as it was that bertram was angry  but on the head of his betrothed he poured out the vial of his wrath he had never before scolded her had never written in an angry tone now in very truth he did so an angry letter especially if the writer be well loved is so much fiercer than any angry speech so much more unendurable there the words remain scorching not to be explained away not to be atoned for by a kiss not to be softened down by the word of love that may follow so quickly upon spoken anger heaven defend me from angry letters they should never be written unless to schoolboys and men at college and not often to them if they be any way tender hearted this at least should be a rule through the letterwriting world that no angry letter be posted till fourandtwenty hours shall have elapsed since it was written we all know how absurd is that other rule that of saying the alphabet when you are angry trash sit down and write your letter write it with all the venom in your power spit out your spleen at the fullest twill do you good you think you have been injured say all that you can say with all your poisoned eloquence and gratify yourself by reading it while your temper is still hot then put it in your desk and as a matter of course burn it before breakfast the following morning believe me that you will then have a double gratification  a pleasant letter i hold to be the pleasantest thing that this world has to give it should be goodhumoured witty it may be but with a gentle diluted wit concocted brilliancy will spoil it altogether not long so that it be tedious in the reading nor brief so that the delight suffice not to make itself felt it should be written specially for the reader and should apply altogether to him and not altogether to any other it should never flatter flattery is always odious but underneath the visible stream of pungent water there may be the slightest undercurrent of eulogy so that it be not seen but only understood censure it may contain freely but censure which in arraigning the conduct implies no doubt as to the intellect it should be legibly written so that it may be read with comfort but no more than that caligraphy betokens caution and if it be not light in hand it is nothing that it be fairly grammatical and not ill spelt the writer owes to his schoolmaster but this should come of habit not of care then let its page be soiled by no business one touch of utility will destroy it all  if you ask for examples let it be as unlike walpole as may be if you can so write it that lord byron might have written it you will not be very far from high excellence  but above all things see that it be goodhumoured  bertrams letter to the lady that he loved was by no means one of this sort in the first place it was not goodhumoured it was very far from being so had it been so it would utterly have belied his feelings harcourt had so written to him as to make him quite clearly understand that all his sins andwhich was much more to himall his loves had been fully discussed between his friend and miss waddingtonbetween his caroline and another man to the pride of his heart nothing could be more revolting it was as though his dearest possession had been ransacked in his absence and rifled and squandered by the very guardian to whom he had left the key there had been sore misgivings sore differences between him and caroline but nevertheless she had had all his heart now in his absence she had selected his worldly friend harcourt and discussed that possession and its flaws with him there was that in all this of which he could not write with goodhumour nevertheless had he kept his letter to the second morning it may probably be said that he would have hesitated to send it  my dearest caroline it began now i put it to all lovers whether when they wish to please they ever write in such manner to their sweethearts is it not always my own love dearest love my own sweet pet but that use of the christian name which is so delicious in the speaking during the first days of intimacy does it not always betoken something stern at the beginning of a lovers letter ah it may betoken something very stern my dearest jane i am sorry to say it but i could not approve of the way in which you danced with major simkins last night my dearest lucy i was at kensingtongarden gate yesterday at four and remained absolutely till five you really ought is not that always the angry lovers tone  i fear that i must give bertrams letter entire to make the matter sufficiently clear      my dearest caroline     i learn from mr harcourt that you and miss baker are    in town and i am of course sorry to miss you would it    not have been better that i should have heard this from    yourself     mr harcourt tells me that you are dissatisfied and i    understand from his letter that you have explained your    dissatisfaction very fully to him it might have been    better i think that the explanation should have been    made to me or had you chosen to complain you might have    done so to your aunt or to your grandfather i cannot    think that you were at liberty to complain of me to    mr harcourt my wish is that you have no further    conversation with him on our joint concerns it is not    seemly and if feminine is at any rate not ladylike     i am driven to defend myself what is it of which    you complain or have a right to complain we became    engaged more than twelve months since certainly with no    understanding that the matter was to stand over for three    years my understanding was that we were to be married as    soon as it might reasonably be arranged you then took on    yourself to order this delay and kindly offered to give    me up as an alternative i could not force you to marry    me but i loved you too well and trusted too much in    your love to be able to think that that giving up was    necessary perhaps i was wrong     but the period of this wretched interval is at my own    disposal had you married me my time would have been    yours it would have been just that you should know how    it was spent each would then have known so much of the    other but you have chosen that this should not be and    therefore i deny your right now to make inquiry if i    have departed from any hopes you had formed you have no    one to blame but yourself     you have said that i neglect you i am ready to marry you    tomorrow i have been ready to do so any day since our    engagement you yourself know how much more than ready    i have been i do not profess to be a very painstaking    lover nay if you will the life would bore me even if    in our case the mawkishness of the delay did not do more    than bore at any rate i will not go through it i loved    and do love you truly i told you of it truly when i first    knew it myself and urged my suit till i had a definite    answer you accepted me and now there needs be nothing    further till we are married     but i insist on this that i will not have my affairs    discussed by you with persons to whom you are a stranger     you will see my letter to your aunt i have told her that    i will visit her at littlebath as soon as i have returned    to england     yours ever affectionately     g b   this letter was a terrible blow to caroline it seemed to her to be almost incredible that she she caroline waddington should be forced to receive such a letter as that under any circumstances and from any gentleman unseemly unfeminine unladylike these were the epithets her lover used in addressing her she was told that it bored him to play the lover that his misconduct was her fault and then she was accused of mawkishness he was imperative too in laying his orders to her i insist on this was it incumbent on her to comply with his insistings  of course she showed the letter to her aunt whose advice resulted in thisthat it would be better that she should pocket the affront silently if she were not prepared to give up the engagement altogether if she were so prepared the letter doubtless would give her the opportunity  and then mr harcourt came to her while her anger was yet at the hottest his manner was so kind his temper so sweet his attention so obliging that she could not but be glad to see him if george loved her if he wished to guide her wished to persuade her why was not he at her right hand mr harcourt was there instead it did not bore him multifold as his duties were to be near her  then she committed the first great fault of which in this history she will be shown as being guilty she showed her lovers letter to mr harcourt of course this was not done without some previous converse till he had found out that she was wretched and inquired as to her wretchedness till she had owned that she was ill with sorrow beside herself and perplexed in the extreme then at last saying to herself that she cared not now to obey mr bertram she showed the letter to mr harcourt  it is ungenerous said harcourt  it is ungentlemanlike said caroline but it was written in passion and i shall not notice it and so she and miss baker went back again to littlebath  it was september before bertram returned and then sir lionel came with him we have not space to tell much of what had passed between the father and the son but they reached london apparently on good terms with each other and sir lionel settled himself in a bedroom near to his sons chambers and near also to his own club there was however this great ground of disagreement between them sir lionel was very anxious that his son should borrow money from mr bertram and george very resolutely declined to do so it was now clear enough to sir lionel that his son could not show his filial disposition by advancing on his own behalf much money to his father as he was himself by no means in affluent circumstances  he went down to littlebath and took his father with him the meeting between the lovers was again unloverlike but nothing could be more affectionate than sir lionel he took caroline in his arms and kissed her called her his dear daughter and praised her beauty i believe he kissed miss baker indeed i know that he made an attempt to do so and i think it not at all improbable that in the overflowing of his affectionate heart he made some overture of the same kind to the exceedingly pretty parlourmaid who waited upon them whatever might be thought of george sir lionel soon became popular there and his popularity was not decreased when he declared that he would spend the remainder of the autumn and perhaps the winter at littlebath  he did stay there for the winter he had a years furlough during which he was to remain in england with full pay and he made it known to the ladies at littlebath that the chief object of his getting this leave was to be present at the nuptials of dear caroline and his son on one occasion he borrowed thirty pounds from miss baker a circumstance which their intimacy perhaps made excusable he happened however to mention this little occurrence casually to his son and george at once repaid that debt poor as he was at the time  you could have that and whatever more you chose merely for the asking said sir lionel on that occasion in a tone almost of reproach  and so the winter passed away george however was not idle he fully intended to be called to the bar in the following autumn and did to a certain extent renew his legal studies he did not return to mr die prevented possibly by the difficulty he would have in preparing the necessary funds but his great work through the winter and in the early spring was another small volume which he published in march and which he called the fallacies of early history  we need not give any minute criticism on this work it will suffice to say that the orthodox world declared it to be much more heterodox than the last work heterodox indeed it was so bad they said that there was not the least glimmer of any doxy whatever left about it the early history of which he spoke was altogether bible history and the fallacies to which he alluded were the plainest statements of the book of genesis nay he had called the whole story of creation a myth the whole story as there given so at least said the rabbis of oxford and among them outspoke more loudly than any others the outraged and very learned rabbis of oriel  bertram however denied this he had he said not called anything a myth there was the printed book and one might have supposed that it would be easy enough to settle this question but it was far from being so the words myth and mythical were used half a dozen times and the rabbis declared that they were applied to the statements of scripture bertram declared that they were applied to the appearance those statements must have as at present put before the english world then he said something not complimentary to the translators and something also very uncivil as to want of intelligence on the part of the oxford rabbis the war raged warmly and was taken up by the metropolitan press till bertram became a liona lion however without a hide for in the middle of the dispute he felt himself called on to resign his fellowship  he lost that hide but he got another in lieu which his friends assured him was of a much warmer texture his uncle had taken considerable interest in this dispute alleging all through that the oxford men were longeared asses and bigoted monks it may be presumed that his own orthodoxy was not of a high class he had never liked georges fellowship and had always ridiculed the income which he received from it directly he heard that it had been resigned he gave his nephew a thousand pounds he said nothing about it he merely told mr pritchett to arrange the matter  sir lionel was delighted as to the question of orthodoxy he was perfectly indifferent it was nothing to him whether his son called the book of genesis a myth or a gospel but he had said much very much as to the folly of risking the fellowship and more a great deal more as to the madness of throwing it away but now he was quite ready to own himself wrong and did do so in the most straightforward manner after all what was a fellowship to a man just about to be married in his position bertram had of course been free to speak out if indeed there had been any object in holding to the college then the expression of such opinions let alone their publication would not have been judicious  as it was however nothing could have been more lucky his son had shown his independence the rich uncle had shown the warm interest which he still took in his nephew and sir lionel was able to borrow two hundred and fifty pounds a sum of money which at the present moment was very grateful to him bertrams triumph was gilded on all sides for the booksellers had paid him handsomely for his infidel manuscript infidelity that can make itself successful will at any rate bring an income  and this brings us to the period at which we may resume our story one word we must say as to caroline during the winter she had seen her lover repeatedly and had written to him repeatedly their engagement therefore had by no means been broken but their meetings were cold and their letters equally so she would have married him at once now if he would ask her but he would not ask her he was quite willing to marry her if she would herself say that she was willing so far to recede from her former resolution but she could not bring herself to do this each was too proud to make the first concession to the other and therefore no concession was made by either  sir lionel once attempted to interfere but he failed george gave him to understand that he could manage his own affairs himself when a son is frequently called on to lend money to his father and that father is never called on to repay it the parental authority is apt to grow dull it had become very dull in this case     chapter iv  richmond   it was in the midst of this noise about bertrams new book that the scene is presumed to be reopened he had resigned his fellowship and pocketed his thousand pounds neither of these events had much depressed his spirits and he appeared now to his friends to be a happy man in spite of his love troubles at the same time harcourt also was sufficiently elate he had made his great speech with considerable éclat and his sails were full of windof wind of a more substantial character than that by which bertrams vessel was wafted  and just now harcourt and bertram were again much together a few months since it had appeared to harcourt that bertram intended to do nothing in the world to make no figure even now there was but little hope of his doing much as a barrister but it seemed probable that he might at any rate make himself known as an author such triumphs as harcourt well knew were very barren but still it was well to know men who were in any way triumphant and therefore the barrister himself so triumphant considered it judicious not to drop his friend  it may be said that bertram had given up all idea of practising as a barrister he still intended to go through the form of being called but his profession was to be that of an author he had all manner of works in hand poems plays political pamphlets infidel essays histories and a narrative of his travels in the east he had made up his mind fully that there were in england only two occupations worthy of an englishman a man should be known either as a politician or as an author it behoved a man to speak out what was in him with some audible voice so that the world might hear he might do so either by word of mouth or by pen and paper by the former in parliament by the latter at his desk each form of speech had its own advantage fate which had made harcourt a member of parliament seemed to intend him bertram to be an author  harcourt though overwhelmed by business at this period took frequent occasion to be with bertram and when he was with him alone he always made an effort to talk about miss waddington bertram was rather shy of the subject he had never blamed harcourt for what had taken place while he was absent in paris but since that time he had never volunteered to speak of his own engagement  they were together one fine may evening on the banks of the river at richmond george was fond of the place and whenever harcourt proposed to spend an evening alone with him they would go up the river and dine there  on this occasion harcourt seemed determined to talk about miss waddington bertram who was not in the best possible humour had shown one might say plainly enough that it was a subject on which he did not wish to speak one might also say that it was a subject as to talking on which the choice certainly ought to have been left to himself a man who is engaged may often choose to talk to his friend about his engaged bride but the friend does not usually select the lady as a topic of conversation except in conformity with the benedicts wishes  on this occasion however harcourt would talk about miss waddington and bertram who had already given one or two short answers began to feel that his friend was almost impertinent  they were cracking decayed walnuts and sipping not the very best of wine and bertram was expatiating on sir robert peels enormity in having taken the wind out of the sails of the whigs and rehearsing perhaps a few paragraphs of a new pamphlet that was about to come out when harcourt again suddenly turned the conversation  bytheby said he i believe there is no day absolutely fixed for your marriage  no said bertram sharply enough no day has been fixed could anything on earth have been more base than the manner in which he has endeavoured to leave cobden as a necessary legacy to the new government would he have put cobden into any place in a government of his own  oh d cobden one has enough of him in the housequite  but i have not that advantage  you shall have some of these days ill make over the battersea hamlets to you as soon as i can get a judges wig on my head but im thinking of other things now i wonder whether you and caroline waddington ever will be man and wife  probably about the time that you are made a judge  ha ha well i hope if you do do it it will come off before that but i doubt its coming off at all each of you is too proud for the other neither of you can forgive what the other has done  what do you mean but to tell you the truth harcourt i have no great inclination to discuss that matter just at present if you please we will leave miss waddington alone  what i mean is this said the embryo judge perseveringly that you are too angry with her on account of this enforced delay and she is too angry with you because you have dared to be angry with her i do not think you will ever come together  bertram looked full at harcourt as this was said and observed that there was not the usual easy gentlemanlike smile on the barristers face and yet the barrister was doing his best to look as usual the fact was that harcourt was playing a game and playing it with considerable skill but his performance was not altogether that of a garrick something might have been read in his face had bertram been cunning enough to read it but bertram was not a cunning man  bertram looked full in the others face had he been content to do so and to say nothing he would have gained his point and the subject would have been at once dropped harcourt then could have gone no further but bertram was now angry and being angry he could not but speak  harcourt you have interfered once before between me and miss waddington  interfered  yes interferedin what i then thought and still think to have been a very unwarrantable manner  it was a pity you did not tell me of it at the time  it is a pity rather that you should drive me to tell you of it now but you do so when i was in paris you said to miss waddington what you had no right to say  what did i say  or rather she said to you  ah that was no fault of mine  but it was a fault of yours do you think that i cannot understand that i cannot see she would have been silent enough to you but for your encouragement i do not know that i was ever so vexed as when i received that letter from you you took upon yourself  i know you were angry very angry but that was not my fault i said nothing but what a friend under such circumstances was bound to say  well let the matter drop now and let miss waddington and myself settle our own affairs  i cannot let the matter drop you have driven me to defend myself and i must do it as best i may i know that you were angry exceedingly angry  exceedingly angry he repeated but that was no fault of mine when miss baker sent for me i could not but go to her when i was there i could not but listen to her when caroline told me that she was wretched  miss waddington shouted bertram in a voice that caused the glasses to shake and made the waiter turn round and then suddenly recollecting himself he scowled round the room as he observed that he was noticed  hush my dear fellow it shall be miss waddington but not quite so loud and i beg your pardon but hearing the lady called by her christian name so often both by yourself and miss baker i forgot myself when she spoke to me of her wretched state what was i to do was i to say fie fie and take my hat and go away  she was very wretched he continued for bertram merely scowled and said nothing and i could not but sympathize with her she thought that you had neglected her it was clear that you had gone abroad without telling her was it to be wondered at that she should be unhappy  her telling you that she was so was unexcusable  at any rate i am blameless i myself think that she was also but that is another question in what i wrote to you i did my duty as a friend to both parties after that i do confess that i thought your anger too great to allow you ever to stand at the altar with her  you do not mean to say that she showed you my letter said bertram almost leaping at him  your letter what letter  you know what lettermy letter from paris the letter which i wrote to her in reference to the one i received from you i desire at once to have an answer from you did caroline show you that letter  harcourt looked very guilty extremely guilty but he did not immediately make any reply  harcourt answer me said bertram much more coolly i have no feeling of anger now with you did caroline show you that letter  miss waddington did show it to me  and thus the successful mr harcourt had been successful also in this and now having narrated this interview in a manner which does not make it redound very much to that gentlemans credit i must add to the narrative his apology if evenhanded justice were done throughout the world some apology could be found for most offences not that the offences would thus be wiped away and black become white but much that is now very black would be reduced to that sombre uninviting shade of ordinary brown which is so customary to humanity  our apology for mr harcourt will by no means make his conduct whitewill leave it perhaps of a deeper dingier brown than that which is quite ordinary among men nay will leave it still black many will say  mr harcourt had seen that which in his opinion proved that bertram and miss waddington could never be happy with each other he had seen that which in his opinion led to the conclusion that neither of them really wished that this marriage should take place but he had seen that also which made him believe that both were too proud to ask for a release under such circumstances would he be doing ill if he were to release them caroline had so spoken spoken even to him that it seemed impossible to him that she could wish for the marriage bertram had so written that it seemed equally impossible that he should wish for it would it not therefore be madness to allow them to marry he had said as much to miss baker and miss baker had agreed with him he cannot love her miss baker had said or he would not neglect her so shamefully i am sure he does not love her  but there was a man who did love her who had felt that he could love her from the first moment that he had seen her as an affianced bride he had not then courted her for himself for then it was manifest that she both loved and was loved but now now that this was altered was there good cause why he should not covet her now mr harcourt thought that there was no sufficient cause  and then this man who was not by nature a vain man who had not made himself apt at believing that young beauties fell readily in love with him who had not spent his years in basking in ladies smiles imagined that he had some ground to think that miss waddington was not averse to him oh how she had looked when that part of bertrams letter had been read in which he professed that he would not be bored by any loveduties for his lady and then this man had been kind to her he had shown that such service would be no bore to him he had been gentlemannered to her and she also she had been gentle to him      the woman cannot be of natures making     whom being kind her misery makes not kinder   and caroline was kind at least so he thought and heaven knows she was miserable also and thus hopes rose which should never have risen and schemes were made which if not absolutely black were as near it as any shade of brown may be  and then there was the fact that caroline was the granddaughter and might probably be the heiress of one of the wealthiest men in the city of london the consideration of this fact had doubtless its weight also the lady would at least have six thousand pounds might have sixty might have three times sixty harcourt would probably have found it inexpedient to give way to any love had there been no money to gild the passion he was notoriously a man of the world he pretended to be nothing else he would have thought that he had made himself ludicrous if he had married for love only with him it was a source of comfort that the ladys pecuniary advantages allowed him the hope that he might indulge his love so he did indulge it  he had trusted for awhile that circumstances would break off this illassorted match and that then he could step in himself without any previous interference in the matter but the time was running too close unless something was done these two poor young creatures would marry and make themselves wretched for life benevolence itself required that he should take the matter in hand so he did take it in hand and commenced his operationsnot unskilfully as we have seen  such is our apology for mr harcourt a very poor one the reader will say turning from that gentleman with disgust it is a poor one were we all turned inside out as is done with ladies and gentlemen in novels some of us might find some little difficulty in giving good apologies for ourselves our shade of brown would often be very dark  bertram sat for awhile silent and motionless at the table and harcourt seeing his look of grief almost repented what he had done but after all he had only told the truth the letter had been shown to him  it is incredible said bertram incredible incredible but nevertheless his voice showed plainly enough that the statement to him was not incredible  let it be so said harcourt who purposely misunderstood him i do not wish you to believe me let us leave it so come it is time for us to go back to town but bertram still sat silent saying nothing  harcourt called the waiter and paid the bill he then told bertram what his share was and commenced smoothing the silk of his hat preparatory to moving bertram took out his purse gave him the necessary amount of shillings and then again sat silent and motionless  come bertram there will be only one train after this and you know what a crowd there is always for that let us go  but bertram did not move harcourt if you would not mind it he said very gently i would rather go back by myself today what you have said has put me out i shall probably walk  walk to town  oh yes the walk will be nothing i shall like it dont wait for me theres a good fellow ill see you tomorrow or next day or before long  so harcourt shrugging his shoulders and expressing some surprise at this singular resolve put his hat on his head and walked off by himself what his inward reflections were on his journey back to london we will not inquire but will accompany our other friend in his walk  hurriedly as it had been written he remembered almost every word of that letter from paris he knew that it had been severe and he had sometimes perhaps regretted its severity but he knew also that the offence had been great what right had his affianced bride to speak of him to another man was it not fit that he should tell her how great was this sin his ideas on the matter were perhaps too strong but they certainly are not peculiar wespeaking for the educated male sex in englanddo not like to think that any one should tamper with the ladies whom we love  but what was this to that which she had since done to talk of him had been bad but to show his letters to show such a letter as that to show such a letter to such a person to make such a confidence and with such a confidant it could not be that she loved him it could not be but that she must prefer that other man to him  as he thought of this walking on hurriedly towards london on that soft may night his bosom swelled but with anger rather than with sorrow it must be all over then between them it could not go on after what he had now been told she was willing he presumed to marry him having pledged him her word that she would do so but it was clear that she did not care for him he would not hold her to her pledge nor would he take to his bosom one who could have a secret understanding with another man  miss baker he said to himself had treated him badly she must have known this why had she not told him if it were so that miss waddington liked another better than him would it not have been miss bakers duty to tell him so it did not signify however he had learnt it in timeluckily luckily luckily  should he quarrel with harcourt what mattered it whether he did or no or what mattered it what part harcourt took in the concern if that which harcourt had said were true if caroline had shown him this letter he bertram could never forgive that if so they must part and then if he did not possess her what mattered who did nay if she loved harcourt why should he prevent their coming together but of this he would make himself fully satisfied he would know whether the letter had truly been shown harcourt was a barrister and in bertrams estimation a barristers word was not always to be taken implicitly  so he still walked on but what should he first do how should he act at once and then it occurred to him that according to the ideas generally prevalent in the world on such matters he would not be held to be justified in repudiating his betrothed merely because she had shown a letter of his to another gentleman he felt in his own mind that the cause was quite sufficient that the state of mind which such an act disclosed was clearly not that of a loving trusting wife but others might think differently perhaps miss baker might do so or perhaps miss waddington  but then it was not possible that she could ever wish to marry him after having taken such a course as that had he not indeed ample cause to think that she did not wish to marry him she had put it off to the last possible moment she had yielded nothing to his urgent request in all her intercourse with him she had been cold and unbending she had had her moments of confidence but they were not with him they were with one whom perhaps she liked better there was no jealousy in this not jealousy of the usual kind his selfrespect had been injured and he could not endure that he hardly now wished that she should love him  but he would go to littlebath at once and ask her the question he would ask her all those questions which were now burning inside his heart she did not like severe letters and he would write no more such to her what further communication might of necessity take place between them should be by word of mouth so he resolved to go down to littlebath on the morrow  and then he reached his chambers weary and sad at heart but he was no longer angry he endeavoured to persuade himself that he was absolutely the reverse of angry he knelt down and prayed that she might be happy he swore that he would do anything to make her so but that anything was not to include any chance of a marriage with himself     chapter v  juno   in spite of his philosophy and his prayers bertram went to bed not in a very happy state of mind he was a man essentially of a warm and loving heart he was exigeant and perhaps even selfish in his love most men are so but he did love had loved and having made up his mind to part from that which he had loved he could not be happy he had often lain awake thinking of her faults to him but now he lay thinking of his faults to her it was a pity he said to himself that their marriage should have been so delayed she had acted foolishly in that certainly had not known him had not understood his character or appreciated his affection but nevertheless he might have borne it better he felt that he had been stern almost savage to her that he had resented her refusal to marry him at once too violently he threw heavy blame on himself but through all this he still felt that they could not now marry was it not clear to him that caroline would be delighted to escape from her engagement if the way to do so were opened to her  he lost no time in carrying out his plans by an early train on the following day he went down to littlebath and at once went to his fathers lodgings for sir lionel in order that he might be near his dear daughter was still living in littlebath he had entered the second or lighter fast set played a good deal at cards might constantly be seen walking up and down the assemblyrooms and did something in horseflesh  george first went to his fathers lodgings and found him still in bed the lighter fast set at littlebath do not generally get up early and sir lionel professed that he had not lately been altogether well littlebath was fearfully fearfully cold it was now may and he was still obliged to keep a fire he was in a very good humour however with his son for the period of the two hundred and fifty pounds loan was not long passed by gratitude for that had not yet given way to desire for more  oh george is that you i am delighted to see you going up to the terrace i suppose i was with caroline for a few minutes last night and i never saw her looking betternever  george answered by asking his father where he meant to dine sir lionel was going to dine out he usually did dine out he was one of those men who have a knack of getting a succession of gratis dinners and it must be confessed in his favourand the admission was generally made in the diningout worldthat sir lionel was worth his dinner  then i shall probably return this evening but i will see you before i go  sir lionel asked why he would not dine as usual in montpellier terrace but on this subject george at present gave him no answer he merely said that he thought it very improbable that he should do so and then went away to his work it was hard work that he had to do and he thoroughly wished that it was over  he did not however allow himself a moment to pause on the contrary he walked so quick that when he found himself in miss bakers drawingroom he was almost out of breath and partly from that cause and partly from his agitation was unable to speak to that lady in his usual unruffled manner  ah how do you do miss baker im very glad to see you i have run down today in a great hurry and i am very anxious to see caroline is she out  miss baker explained that she was not out and would be down very shortly  im glad shes not away for i am very anxious to see hervery  miss baker with her voice also in a tremble asked if anything was the matter  no nothing the matter but the truth is im tired of this miss baker and i want to settle it i dont know how she may bear it but it has half killed me  miss baker looked at him almost aghast for his manner was energetic and almost wild only that he so frequently was wild she would have feared that something dreadful was about to happen she had not however time to say anything further for carolines step was heard on the stairs  could you let us be alone for ten minutes said george but i feel the shame of turning you out of your own drawingroom perhaps caroline will not mind coming down with me into the parlour  but miss baker of course waived this objection and as she retreated the two ladies met just at the drawingroom door caroline was about to speak but was stopped by the expression on her aunts face ladies have little ways of talking to each other with nods and becks and wreathed smiles which are quite beyond the reach of men and in this language aunt mary did say something as she passed which gave her niece to understand that the coming interview would not consist merely of the delights which are common among lovers caroline therefore as she entered the room composed her face for solemn things and walked slowly and not without some dignity in her mien into the presence of him who was to be her lord and master  we hardly expected you george she said  his father had been right she was looking well very well her figure was perhaps not quite so full nor the colour in her cheek quite so high as when he had first seen her in jerusalem but otherwise she had never seemed to him more lovely the little effort she had made to collect herself to assume a certain majesty in her gait was becoming to her so also was her plain morning dress and the simple braid in which her hair was collected it might certainly be boasted of miss waddington that she was a beauty of the morning rather than of the night that her complexion was fitted for the sun rather than for gaslight  he was going to give up all this and why that which he saw before him that which he had so often brought himself to believe that which at this moment he actually did believe to be as perfect a form of feminine beauty as might be found by any search in england was as yet his own and he might keep it as his own he knew or thought he knew enough of her to be sure that let her feelings be what they might she would not condescend to break her word to him doubtless she would marry him and that in but a few months hence if only he would marry her beautiful as she was much as she was his own much as he still loved her he had come there to reject her all this flashed through his mind in a moment he lost no time in idle thoughts  caroline he said stretching out his hand to herusually when he met her after any absence he had used his hand to draw her nearer to him with more warmth than his present ordinary greeting showedcaroline i have come down to have some talk with you there is that between us which should be settled  well what is it she said with the slightest possible smile  i will not if i can help it say any word to show that i am angry  but are you angry george if so had you not better show it concealment will never sit well on you  i hope not nor will i conceal anything willingly it is because i so greatly dislike concealment that i am here  you could not conceal anything if you tried george it is useless for you to say that you will not show that you are angry you are angry and you do show it what is it i hope my present sin is not a very grievous one by your banishing poor aunt out of the drawingroom i fear it must be rather bad  i was dining with mr harcourt last night and it escaped him in conversation that you had shown to him the letter which i wrote to you from paris was it so caroline did you show him that very letter  certainly no indifferent listener would have said that there was any tone of anger in bertrams voice and yet there was that in it which made miss waddington feel that the room was swimming round and round her she turned ruby red up to her hair bertram had never before seen her blush like that for he had never before seen her covered by shame oh how she had repented showing that letter how her soul had grieved over it from the very moment that it had passed out of her hand she had done so in the hotness of her passion he had written to her sharp stinging words which had maddened her up to that moment she had never known how sharp how stinging how bitter words might be the world had hitherto been so soft to her she was there told that she was unfeminine unladylike and then he that was sitting by her was so smooth so sympathizing so anxious to please her in her anger and her sympathy she had shown it and from that day to this she had repented in the roughness of sackcloth and the bitterness of ashes it was possible that caroline waddington should so sin against a womans sense of propriety that alas had been proved but it was impossible that she should so sin and not know that she had sinned not feel the shame of it  she did stand before him red with shame but at the first moment she made no answer it was in her heart to kneel at his feet to kneel in the spirit if not in the body and ask his pardon but hitherto she had asked pardon of no human being there was an effort in the doing of it which she could not at once get over had his eyes looked tenderly on her for a moment had one soft tone fallen from his lips she would have done it down she would have gone and implored his pardon and who that he had once loved had ever asked aught in vain from george bertram ah that she had done so how well they might have loved each other what joy there might have been  but there was nothing tender in his eye no tender tone softened the words which fell from his mouth  what he said and in spite of his promise his voice had never before sounded so sternwhat show that letter to another man show that letter to mr harcourt is that true caroline  a child asks pardon from his mother because he is scolded he wishes to avert her wrath in order that he may escape punishment so also may a servant of his master or an inferior of his superior but when one equal asks pardon of another it is because he acknowledges and regrets the injury he has done such acknowledgment such regret will seldom be produced by a stern face and a harsh voice caroline as she looked at him and listened to him did not go down on her kneesnot even mentally instead of doing so she remembered her dignity and wretched as she was at heart she continued to seat herself without betraying her misery  is that true caroline i will believe the charge against you from no other lips than your own  yes george it is true i did show your letter to mr harcourt so stern had he been in his bearing that she could not condescend even to a word of apology  he had hitherto remained standing but on hearing this he flung himself into a chair and buried his face in his hands even then she might have been softened and he might have relented and all might have been well  i was very unhappy george she said that letter had made me very unhappy and i hardly knew where to turn for relief  what he said jumping up and flashing before her in a storm of passion to which his former sternness had been as nothingwhat my letter made you so unhappy that you were obliged to go to mr harcourt for relief you appealed for sympathy from me to him from me who amno who was your affianced husband had you no idea of the sort of bond that existed between you and me did you not know that there were matters in which you could not look for sympathy to such as him without being false nay almost worse than false have you ever thought what it is to be the one loved object of a mans heart and to have accepted that love she had been on the point of interrupting him but the softness of these last words interrupted her for a moment  such a letter as that do you remember that letter caroline  yes i remember it remember it too well i would not keep it i would not feel that such words from you were ever by me  you mean that it was harsh  it was cruel  harsh or cruel or what you willi shall not now stop to defend itit was one which from the very nature of it should have been sacred between us it was written to you as to one to whom i had a right to write as my future wife  no one could have a right to write such a letter as that  in it i particularly begged that mr harcourt might not be made an arbiter between us i made a special request that to him at least you would not talk of what causes of trouble there might be between us and yet you selected him as your confidant read it with him poured over with him the words which had come hot from my heart discussed with him my lovemymymy bah i cannot endure it had not you yourself told me so i could not have believed it  george  good god that you should take my letters and read them over with him why caroline it admits but of one solution there is but one reading to the riddle ask all the world  we sent for him as your friend  yes and seem to have soon used him as your own i have no friend to whom i allow the privilege of going between me and my own hearts love yes you were my own hearts love i have to get over that complaint now as best i may  i may consider then that all is over between us  yes there you have back your hand it is again your own to dispose of to whom you will let you have what confidences you will they will no longer imply falsehood to me  then sir if such be the case i think you may cease to scold me with such violence  i have long felt that i ought to give you this release for i have known that you have not thoroughly loved me  miss waddington was too proud too conscious of the necessity to maintain her pride at the present moment to contradict this but nevertheless in her heart she felt that she did love him that she would fain not give him up that in spite of his anger his bitter railing anger she would keep him close to her if she only could do so but now that he spoke of giving her up she could not speak passionately of her loveshe who had never yet shown any passion in her speech to him  it has grown on me from day to day and i have been like a child in clinging to a hope when i should have known that there was no hope i should have known it when you deferred our marriage for three years  two years george  had it been two years we should now have been married i should have known it when i learned that you and he were in such close intimacy in london but nowi know it now now at least it is all over  i can only be sorry that you have so long had so much trouble in the matter  troubletrouble but i will not make a fool of myself i believe at any rate that you understand me  oh perfectly mr bertram  but she did not understand him nor perhaps was it very likely that she should understand him what he had meant her to understand was this that in giving her up he was sacrificing only himself and not her that he did so in the conviction that she did not care for him and that he did so on this account strong as his own love still was in spite of all her offences this was what he intended her to understandbut she did not understand the half of it  and i may now go said she rising from her chair the blush of shame was over and mild as her words sounded she again looked the juno and i may now go  now go yes i suppose so that is i may go that is what you mean well i suppose i had better go not a moment since he was towering with passion and his voice if not loud had been masterful determined and imperious now it was low and gentle enough even now could she have been tender to him he would have relented but she could not be tender it was her profession to be a juno though she knew that when he was gone from her her heart would be breaking she would not bring herself down to use a womans softness she could not say that she had been wrong wrong because distracted by her misery wrong because he was away from her wrong because disturbed in her spirits by the depth of the love she felt for him she could not confess this and then taking his hand promise him that if he would remain close to her she would not so sin again ah if she could have done this in one moment her head would have been on his shoulder and his arm round her waist and in twenty minutes more miss baker would have been informed sitting as she now was up in her bedroom that the weddingday had been fixed  but very different news miss baker had to hear had things turned out so miss waddington would have been a woman and not a goddess no great as was the coming penalty she could not do that she had been railed at and scolded as never goddess was scolded before whatever she threw away it behoved her to maintain her dignity she would not bend to a storm that had come blustering over her so uncourteously  bertram had now risen to go it would be useless for me to trouble your aunt he said tell her from me that i would not have gone without seeing her had i not wished to spare her pain goodbye caroline and may god bless you and so saying he put out his hand to her  goodbye mr bertram she would have said something more but she feared to trust herself with any word that might have any sound of tenderness she took his hand however and returned the pressure which he gave it  she looked into his eyes and saw that they were full of tears but still she did not speak oh caroline waddington caroline waddington if it had but been given thee to know even then how much of womanhood there was in thy bosom of warm womanhood how little of goddessship of cold goddessship it might still have been well with thee but thou didst not know thou hadst gotten there at any rate thy junos pedestal and having that needs was that thou shouldst stand on it  god bless you caroline goodbye he repeated again and turned to the door  i wish to ask you one question before you go she said as his hand was on the handle of the lock and she spoke in a voice that was almost goddesslike that hardly betrayed but yet that did betray the human effort bertram paused and again turned to her  in your accusation against me just now  i made no accusation caroline  you not only made it mr bertram but i pleaded guilty to it but in making it you mentioned mr harcourts name while you were absent in paris i did talk with that gentleman on our private affairs yours and mine i hope i am believed to have done so because i regarded mr harcourt as your friend  bertram did not understand her and he showed that he did not by his look  it is difficult for me to explain myselfand now she blushed slightlyvery slightly what i mean is this i wish to be acquitted by you of having had recourse to mr harcourt on my own accountfrom any partiality of my own she almost rose in height as she stood there before him uttering these words in all her cold but beautiful dignity whatever her sins might have been he should not accuse her of having dallied with another while her word and her troth had been his she had been wrong she could not deny that he had justice on his sidestern harsh bare justicewhen he came there to her and flung back her love and promises into her teeth he had the right to do so and she would not complain but he should not leave her till he had acquitted her of the vile missish crime of flirting with another because he was absent seeing that he still hardly understood her she made her speech yet plainer  at the risk of being told again that i am unfeminine i must explain myself do you charge me with having allowed mr harcourt to speak to me as a lover  no i make no such charge now i have no right to make any charge on such a matter  no should mr harcourt be my lover now that is my affair and his not yours but had he been so then you owe it to me to say whether among other sins that sin also is charged against me  i have charged and do charge nothing against you but thisthat you have ceased to love me and that charge will be made nowhere but in my own breast i am not a jealous man as i think you might know what i have said to you here today has not come of suspicion i have thought no ill against you and believed no ill against you beyond that which you have yourself acknowledged i find that you have ceased to love me and finding that i am indifferent to whom your love may be given and so saying he opened the door and went out nor did he ever again see miss waddington at littlebath  some few minutes after he had left the room miss baker entered it she had heard the sound of the front door and having made inquiry of the servant had learned that their visitor had gone then she descended to her own drawingroom and found caroline sitting upright at the table as though in grief she despised the adventitious aid and everyday solace of a sofa there was no tear in her eye none as yet but it required no tears to tell her aunt that all was not well judging by the face she looked at aunt mary was inclined to say that all was as little well as might be  there was still to be seen there the beauty and the dignity and still even in part the composure of a juno but it was such composure as juno might have shown while she devoted to a third destruction the walls of a thricebuilt troy of juno in grief in jealousy almost in despair but of juno still mindful of her pedestal still remembering that there she stood a mark for the admiration of gods and men how long shall this juno mood serve to sustain her ah how long  has he gone said miss baker as she looked at her niece  yes aunt he has gone  when will he return  he will not return aunt he will not come any more it is all over at last  miss baker stood for a moment trembling and then threw herself upon a seat she had at least had no celestial gift by which she could compose herself oh caroline she exclaimed  yes aunt mary it is all over now  you mean that you have quarrelled said she remembering to her comfort that there was some old proverb about the quarrels of lovers miss baker had great faith in proverbs  the reader may find it hard to follow miss bakers mind on the subject of this engagement some time since she was giving advice that it should be broken off and now she was au désespoir because that result had been reached she had one of those minds that are prone to veering and which show by the way they turn not any volition of their own but the direction of some external wind some external volition nor can one be angry with or despise miss baker for this weathercock aptitude she was the least selfish of human beings the least opinionative the most goodnatured she had had her hot fits and her cold fits with regard to bertram but her hot fits and her cold had all been hot or cold with reference to what she conceived to be her nieces chances of happiness latterly she had fancied that caroline did love bertram too well to give him up and circumstances had led her to believe more strongly than ever that old mr bertram wished the marriage and that the two together if married would certainly inherit his wealth so latterly during the last month or so miss baker had blown very hot  no there has been no quarrel said caroline with forced tranquillity of voice and manner no such quarrel as you mean do not deceive yourself dear aunt it is over now over for ever  for ever caroline  yes for ever that has been said which can never be unsaid do not grieve about itaunt mary was now in tearsit is better so i am sure it is better we should not have made each other happy  but three years caroline three years said aunt mary through her tears thinking of the time that had been so sadly lost aunt mary was widely awake to the fact that three years was a long period in a girls life and that to have passed three years as the betrothed of one man and then to leave him was injurious to the matrimonial prospects of a young lady miss baker was full of these little mundane considerations but then they were never exercised never had been exercised on her own behalf  yes three years and caroline smiled even through her grief it cannot be helped aunt and the rest of it neither can that be helped three years say thirty aunt  miss baker looked at her not quite understanding and must it be so said she  must oh yes indeed it must it must now mustmustmust  then they both sat silent for awhile miss baker was longing to know the cause of this sudden disruption but she hesitated at first to inquire it was not however to be borne that the matter should be allowed to remain altogether undiscussed  but what is it he has said she at last asked caroline had never told her aunt that that letter had been shown to mr harcourt and had no intention of telling her so now  i could not tell you aunt all that passed it was not what he said more than what i said at leastno that is not true it did arise from what he said but i would not answer him as he would have me and so we agreed to part  he wished to have the marriage at once  no i think he wished no such thing you may rest assured he wishes no marriage now none with me at least and rest assured of this too that i wish none with him wish it is no use wishing it is now impossible  again there was a silence and again it was broken by miss baker i wonder whether you ever really loved him sometimes i have thought you never did  perhaps not said she musing on her fate  if it is never to be i hope that you did not  it would be to be hopedto be hoped for me and to be hoped also for him  oh he loved you there is no doubt of that no doubt at all of that if any man ever loved a girl he loved you to this miss waddington answered nothing nor would she just then talk any further with her aunt upon the subject they were to dine early on that day as their custom was when they went out in the evening on this evening they were going to the houselodgings ratherof an old friend they had not seen for some time she had arrived a week or two since at littlebath and though there had been callings between them they had not yet succeeded in meeting when bertram had arrived it was near their dinner hour and before he went that hour was already passed had his manner been as it ordinarily was he would of course have been asked to join them but as we have seen that had been no moment for such customary civility  now however they went to dinner and while seated there miss waddington told her aunt that she did not feel equal to going out that evening miss baker of course said something in opposition to this but that something was not much it might easily be understood that a young lady who had just lost her lover was not in a fit state to go to a littlebath cardparty  and thus early in the evening caroline contrived to be alone and then for the first time she attempted to realize all that had come upon her hitherto she had had to support herselfherself and her goddessshipfirst before george bertram and then with lighter effort before her aunt but now that she was alone she could descend to humanity now that she was alone she had so to descend  yes she had lost three years to a mortal goddess who possessed her divinity but for a short time this was much her doctrine had been to make the most of the world she had early resolved not to throw away either herself or her chances and now that she was threeandtwenty how had she kept her resolves how had her doctrine answered with her she had lived before the world for the last two years as a girl betrothed to a loverbefore such of the world as she knew and as knew her and now her lover was gone not dismissed by her but gone he had rather dismissed her and that not in the most courteous manner  but to do her justice this was not the grief that burnt most hotly into her heart she said to herself that it was so that this was her worst grief she would fain have felt that it was so but there was more of humanity in her of the sweetness of womanly humanity than she was aware he had left her and she knew not how to live without him that was the thorn that stuck fast in her womans bosom she could never again look into those deep thoughtful eyes never again feel the pressure of that strong manly arm never hear the poetry of that rich voice as she had heard it when he poured words of love and truth into her ear bertram had many faults and while he belonged to her she had thought of them often enough but he had many virtues also and now she could think but of them  she had said that he was gone gone for ever it was easy enough to say that with composed voice to miss baker there is nothing so easy as bravado the wretch who is to be hung can step lightly while multitudes are looking at him the woman who is about to give up all that her heart most values can declare out loud that the matter is very indifferent to her but when the victim of the law is lying in his solitary cell thinking on his doom the morning before the executioner comes to him when the poor girl is sitting alone on her bedside with her heart all emptyor rather not empty only hopeless it is very difficult then to maintain a spirit of bravado  caroline waddington did try it she had often said to herself in months now some time past that she repented of her engagement if so now was the time to congratulate herself that she was free from it but she could not congratulate herself while he had entirely belonged to her she had not known how thoroughly she had loved him when she had only thought of parting with him she had believed that it would be easy but now she found that it was not so easy it was about as easy for her to pluck his image from her heart as to draw one of her limbs from the socket  but the limb had to be drawn from the socket there was no longer any hope that it could be saved nay it had been already given up as far as the expression of the will was concerned and there was nothing left but to bear the pain  so she sat down and began to draw out the limb oh my sensitive reader have you ever performed the process it is by no means to be done with rosewater appliances and gentle motherly pressure the whole force of the hospital has to be brought out to perform this operation  she now discovered perhaps for the first time that she had a strong beating heart and that she loved this violent capricious man with every strong pulse of it there was more about him now that was lovable by such a woman as caroline waddington than when he had first spoken of his love on the side of mount olivet then he had been little more than a boy a boy indeed with a high feeling with a poetic nature and much humour but these gifts had hardly sufficed to win her heart now he had added to these a strong will a power of command a capability of speaking out to the world with some sort of voice after all power and will are the gifts which a woman most loves in a man  and now that caroline had lost her lover she confessed to herself that she did love him love him yes how could she recover him that was her first thought she could not recover him in any way that was her second thought as to asking him to come back to her the wrenching of the limb from the socket would be better than that that at least she knew she could not do and was it possible that he of his own accord should come back to her no it was not possible the man was tender hearted and could have been whistled back with the slightest lure while yet they two were standing in the room together but he was as proud as he was tender though there might also be some wrenching to be done within his heart he would never come back again uninvited  and thus while miss baker was at her old friends cardparty miss waddington sat in her own bedroom striving with bitter tears and violent struggles to reconcile herself to her loss     chapter vi  sir lionel in trouble   it has been said that miss baker was going to spend the evening with an old friend i trust that miss todd umquhile of the valley of jehoshaphat and now of no 7 paragon littlebath has not been forgotten miss todd of the free heart and the rosy face  yes miss todd had come to littlebath and was intent rather on forming a party of toddites than of joining herself to either of the regular sets she was perhaps not much given to be pious and she certainly was but ill inclined to be slow if fast however she chose to be fast in her own line  but before we have the pleasure of attending at her soirée we must say a word or two of one of the most distinguished of the expected guests sir lionel was to be there  now sir lionel had been leading a pleasant life at littlebath with one single exceptionthat he was rather in want of funds he had capital apartments four rooms ensuite a manservant a groom three horses and a phaeton and no one was more looked up to at littlebath ladies smiled young men listened old gentlemen brought out their best wines and all was delightful all but this that the res angusta did occasionally remind him that he was mortal oh that sordid brother of his who could have given him thousands on thousands without feeling the loss of them we have been unable to see much of old mr bertram in recapitulating the story of young mr bertrams latter doings but it should have been said that early in the present year he had not been quite as well as his friends could wish george had gone to see him once or twice and so also had his niece miss baker and his granddaughter he had said but very little to them but on miss bakers mind an impression had been left that it would please him to see the marriage completed  and at this time likewise his brother sir lionel had thought it expedient to see him there had hitherto been no interview between them since sir lionels return the colonel had found out and had been duly astonished at finding out the history of miss baker and her niece that george and caroline would be the heirs to a great portion of his brothers money he could not doubt that miss baker would have something he thought probable and then he reflected that in spite of all that was come and gone his brothers heart might relent on his deathbed it might be that he could talk the sick man round and if that were impracticable he might at least learn how others stood in his brothers favour sir lionel was not now a young man himself ease and a settled life would be good for him what if he married miss baker  he first called on pritchett mr pritchett told him that his brother was betterconsiderably better sir lionel was in raptures he had hurried up from littlebath in an agony he had heard most distressing accounts he would however go down to hadley and see his brother  i am afraid mr bertram is not very much up to company just at present wheezed out mr pritchett  but a brother you know suggested sir lionel  pritchett knew exactly how the brothers stood with each other and he himself though he was very partial to mr george had not any warm love for sir lionel  oh yes a brother is a brother surely but mr bertram you know sir  you mean said sir lionel that he is a little vexed about the account  oh yes the account there is the account sir lionel if it is to settle that perhaps i can manage without troubling you to go to hadley not but what settling the account will make matters smoother  sir lionel could get nothing more from mr pritchett but he would not be put off from his intention and he did go to hadley he found his brother sitting up in the diningroom but he would not have known him and indeed many who had seen him lately might have had some difficulty in recognizing him he was not only lean and lank and worn and wan but he spoke with some difficulty and on close examination it might be seen that his mouth was twisted as it were from the centre of his face since his relatives had seen him he had suffered what is genteelly called a slight threatening of paralysis  but his mind if touched at all had recovered itself and his spirit was in nowise paralyzed when sir lionel was shown into the roomhe had first of all taken the precaution of sending down his card from the hotel and saying that he would call in half an hourthe old man put out his hand to him but did not attempt to rise from his chair it must be remembered that the brothers had not seen each other for more than fifteen years  sir lionel had tutored himself carefully as to what he would say and what do george he said and the old man shrank as he heard the unaccustomed name when i heard that you were ill i could not but come and see you  very good of you sir lionel very good of you growled the old man  it is fifteen years since we met and we are both old men now  i am an old man now and nearly worn out too old and far gone to have many wants you are not in that condition i suppose  there was an amount of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke and in his eye also as he looked at his brother which made sir lionel perfectly understand that his rich relative was not specially anxious to be kind to him  well we are neither of us quite so far gone as that i hopenot quite so far gone as that and sir lionel looked very pleasant but speaking for myself i have not many wants nownor had he pleasant old man that he was only three or four comfortable rooms for himself and his servant a phaeton and a pair of horses and another smaller establishment in a secluded quiet street nothing more than that including of course all that was excellent in the eating and drinking linespeaking for myself i have not many wants now and he did look very goodhumoured and pleasant as he spoke  mr bertram senior did not look goodhumoured or pleasant there was that in his old eye which was the very opposite to goodhumour and pleasantness  ah said he well i am glad of that for you will be able to do the more for poor george he will have wants he is going to take care and trouble on himself neither he nor his sweetheart have i take it been accustomed to do without wants and their income will be tight enoughforby what you can do for them  the colonel sat and still looked pleasant but he began to think that it might be as well for him that he was back at littlebath  poor george i hope they will be happy i think they will my greatest anxiety now is of course for their happiness and yours is the same doubtless it is odd that my child and your childs child should thus come together is it not so spoke the colonel  mr bertram looked at him looked through him almost but he said nothing  it is odd continued sir lionel but a very happy circumstance she is certainly the sweetest girl i ever saw and george is a lucky fellow  yes he is a lucky fellow he will get more than he has any right to expect first and last she will have six thousand pounds i have not heard him say what he means to settle on her but perhaps he was waiting till you had come home  sir lionels forte during his whole official career had been the making pleasantby the pleasantness that was innate in himthings which appeared to be going in a very unpleasant manner but how was he to make things pleasant now  well you see george has been so much knocked about there was his fellowship i think they behaved shabbily enough to him  fellowship one hundred and seventy pounds a year and the run of his teeth at feast time or some such thing as that a man cant marry on his fellowship very well  ha ha ha no he cant exactly do that on the whole i think it was quite as well that he threw it up and so i told him  did you tell him at the same time what his future income was to be  no upon my soul i did not but if all i hear be true i believe you did you have been exceedingly generous to him georgeand to me also  then sir lionel allow me to tell you that all you hear is not true anything at all that you may have heard of that kind if you have heard anything is perfectly false i have said nothing to george about his income and have nothing to say to him  well i may have expressed myself wrongly and perhaps you did say nothing i was alluding especially to what you have done  i will tell you exactly what i have done i thought he showed a high spirit when he threw up his fellowship and as i had always a great contempt for those oxford fellows i sent him a thousand pounds it was a present and i hope he will make good use of it  i am sure he will said sir lionel who certainly had just cause for such confidence seeing how large a slice out of the sum had been placed at his own disposal  i am sure he will said sir lionel indeed i know that he has  ah im glad to hear of it of course you know more about it than i do of course you are arranging these matters but that is all he has had from me and all that he is likely to have  if such were to be the treatment of george of george who was certainly in some respects a favourite what hope could sir lionel have for himself but it was not so much his brothers words which led him to fear that his brothers moneybags were impregnable to him as his brothers voice and his brothers eye that eye was never off him and sir lionel did begin to wish that he was at littlebath  i dont know whether george may have formed any hopes continued the old man but here sir lionel interrupted him and not imprudently if anything was to be said it should be said now  well if he has formed hopes george you cannot but own that it is natural he has looked on you as a man without any child of your own and he has been taught so to look by your treating him almost as though he were your son  you mean that i paid his school debts and his oxford debts when you forgot to do so growled out the elder brother  yes and that you afterwards gave him an income when he came up to live in london i hope you do not think that i am ungrateful george and sir lionel used his softest and at the same time his most expressive tone  grateful i seldom look for much gratitude but i shall be glad to know when it may suit you to settle with me the account has been running on now for a great many years probably pritchett may have sent it you and as he spoke mr bertram rose from his chair and took an ominouslooking piece of paper from off the mantelpiece  yes mr pritchett is punctuality itself in these matters said sir lionel with a gentle laugh which had not about it all his usual pleasantness  you have probably checked it and can say whether or no it be correct said mr bertram senior looking at the paper in his hand  well i cant say that i have exactly but i dont in the least doubt the figures not in the least mr pritchett is always correct i know  yes mr pritchett is generally correct and may i ask sir lionel what you intend to do in the matter  it was necessary now that sir lionel should summon up his best courage he reminded himself that after all his brother was but a feeble old manimpotent in all but money and as it seemed now clear that no further pecuniary aid was to be expected why need he fear him on this account had it been possible for him to get away without further talk he would have done so but this was not possible so he determined to put a good face on it  i suppose you are joking now george said he  i wish i could describe the tone of voice in which the word joking was repeated by the elder mr bertram it made the military knight jump in his chair and confess to himself that the word impotent could not be safely applied to his ancient relative  well i dare say it is a joke the old man went on to say if i expect to be paid what i have expended in saving george from being turned loose upon the world without education i suppose it is a joke ha ha ha i never thought of laughing at it before but now i will i always heard that you were a joker sir lionel ha ha ha i dare say you have laughed at it often enough yourself eh  what i mean is this when you took upon yourself georges education and maintenance you could hardly have intended to have it paid back again by such a poor devil as i am  oh i couldnt couldnt i  at any rate i dont suppose you did count on having your money back  well i must admit this i did not feel very sure of it i did think there might be a doubt but what could i do i could not let poor wilkinson ruin himself because you would not pay your debts  i am sorry that you take it up in such a manner said the colonel assuming a tone of injured innocence i came here because i heard that you were ill  thought i was dying eh  i did not exactly think that you were dying george but i knew that you were very ill and old feelings came back on me the feelings of our early youth george and i could not be happy without seeing you  very kind of you i am sure you altogether decline then to settle the account eh  if you desire it i willwill make arrangements certainly you do not want it all at once i suppose  oh no half in three months and other half in six will do for me  it would take a great deal more than all my income to do that i fear  your professional income yes i suppose it would i fear they dont give you five or six thousand a year for staying at home at littlebath but surely you must have saved money you must have intended to do something for your son  i have looked upon him as provided for by his uncle  oh  and have therefore been satisfied that he would do well  now sir lionel i will tell you how the matter is i know you will never repay me a shilling of this money and therefore i shall tell pritchett not to bother himself with sending you any more accounts  he is a worthy man and i am sorry he should have had so much trouble  so am i very but thats done he has had the trouble and ive paid the money and as far as george is concerned i do not begrudge it  you would not if you knew what his sentiments are  i dont care a fig for his sentiments  his feelings of gratitude to you are very strong  no they are not he is not in the least grateful to me nor do i wish him to be so he is an honest lad with a high spirit a good heart and a bad head sometimes i have thought of making him my heir  ah sighed sir lionel  but i have now firmly made up my mind to do no such thing he has no knowledge of the worth of money he does not value money  oh there you mistake him indeed you do  he would do no good with it and as regards mine he wont have it sir lionels face again became very doleful  but who will have it george whom else have you got to leave it to  when i want to consult you on that subject ill send for you just at present i have no wish to do so and now if you please well say no more about money  nothing more was said about money and very little on any other subject on what other subject could a pleasant votary of pleasure such as sir lionel wish to hold conversation with a wornout old miser from the city he had regarded his brother as a very full sponge from which living water might probably be squeezed but the sponge it seemed was no longer squeezable by him in any way so he left hadley as quickly as he could and betook himself to littlebath with a somewhat saddened heart he consoled himself however by reflecting that an old mans whims are seldom very enduring and that george might yet become a participator in the huge prize if not on his own account at least on that of his wife  sir lionel returned to littlebath resolving that come what might he would not again have personal recourse to his brother he had tried his diplomatic powers and had failedfailed in that line on being successful in which he so preeminently piqued himself in ireland it is said of any man who is more than ordinarily persuasive that he can talk the devil out of the liver wing of a turkey sir lionel had always supposed himself to be gifted with this eloquence but in that discourse at hadley the devil had been too stout for him and he had gone away without any wing at allliver or other  on one point on which he had been very anxious to say a word or two he had been unable to introduce the slightest hint he had not dreamt that it would be possible to ask his brother in so many words whether or no miss baker would be made a participator in the great prize but he had imagined that he might have led the way to some conversation which would have shown what were the old mans feelings with reference to that lady but as the reader will have perceived he had not been able to lead the conversation in any way and he had left hadley without further light for the guidance of his steps in that matrimonial path in which he had contemplated the expediency of taking a leisurely evening stroll  the wicked old miser had declared that george should not be his heir and had also said that which was tantamount to a similar declaration regarding caroline she would have six thousand pounds first and last nothing more than a beggarly six thousand pounds of which twothirds were already her own without thanks to any one what a wretched old miser who then would have his money it would hardly be possible that he would leave it all to miss baker and yet he might it was just possible anything was possible with a capricious miserly old fool like that what a catch would it be if he sir lionel could become the heir in so deliciously easy a manner  but in all probability anything the old man might say was exactly the opposite of that which he intended to do he probably would leave his money to georgeor very probably to caroline but most probably he would do something for miss baker something handsome for that soft obedient handmaid who had never disobeyed any of his commands and better still had never drawn upon him for more than her regular allowance  such were sir lionels thoughts as he made his way back to littlebath yes he would make himself acceptable to miss baker that george old george was not long for this world was very evident to the colonel he troublesome old crossgrained churl that he was would soon be out of the way such being certainall but certaincould not sir lionel manage matters in this way could he not engage himself to the lady while his brother was yet alive and then marry her afterwardsmarry her or perhaps not marry her as might then become expedient he was well sure of this that if she promised to marry him before her acquisition of fortune such acquisition would not induce her to break off from the match she is too true too honourable for that said sir lionel to himself feeling a warm admiration for the truth of her character as he resolved how he might himself best back out of such an engagement in the event of its being expedient for him so to do  so passed his thoughts as he made his way back to littlebath and when there he did not allow idleness to mar his schemes he immediately began to make himself pleasantmore than ordinarily pleasant to miss baker he did not make love to her after the manner of his youth had he done so he would only have frightened the gentle lady but he was assiduous in his attentions soft and sweetly flattering in his speech and friendly oh so friendly in his manner he called almost every day at montpellier crescent to be sure there was nothing unnatural in this for was he not about to become the father of his dear caroline but dear to him as his dear caroline might be his softest whispers his most sugared words were always for her aunt  he had ever some little proposition to make some kind family suggestion to put forward he was a man of the world they were ladies delicate unfit for coping with the world necessarily ignorant of its naughtier darker ways he would do everything for them and by degrees he did almost everything for miss baker  and so that lady was charmed without knowing it let us do her full justice she had not the remotest idea of opening a flirtation with sir lionel bertram she had looked on him as the future fatherinlaw of her own dear child never as anything more no idea of becoming lady bertram had ever for an instant flashed upon her imagination but nevertheless by degrees the warriors attentions became pleasant to her  she had had no youthful adorers this poor good miss baker never at least since she had been merry as other children are when her little lovers came she had advanced to her present nearly mature age without perhaps feeling the want of them but nevertheless even in her bosom was living the usual feminine passion for admiration she was no lusus naturæ but a woman with a heart and blood in her veins and not as yet a very old woman either and therefore though she had no idea that sir lionel was her lover she had learned to be fond of him  her little conversations with caroline on this subject were delightful the younger lady was certainly the sharper of the two and though she had her own concerns to occupy her she was able to see that something might perhaps be intended her liking for sir lionel was by no means a strong passion something probably had passed between her and george for george could keep no secret from her at any rate she suspected the knight but she could not say anything to put her aunt on her guard beyond using cold expressions in speaking of her future father but miss baker who suspected nothing who expected nothing could not be too lavish in her praises  caroline she would say i do think you are so happy in having such a fatherinlaw  oh certainly caroline had answered but for myself i think more of my fatherinlaws son  oh of course you do i know that but sir lionel is such a perfect gentleman did you ever know a gentleman of his age so attentive to ladies as he is  well perhaps not except one or two old men whom i have seen making love  thats a very different sort of thing you knowthats absurd but i must say i think sir lionels behaviour is perfect what would she have said of sir lionels behaviour had she known all the secrets of his establishments  and thus partly on sir lionels account miss baker began in these days to have perhaps her hottest fit her strongest wish with reference to her nieces marriage and then just at this hottest moment came the blow which has been told of in the last chapter  but miss baker as she prepared herself for miss todds party would not believe that the matter was hopeless the quarrels of lovers have ever been the renewal of love since the day when a verb between two nominative cases first became possessed of the power of agreeing with either of them there is something in this sweet easiness of agreement which seems to tend to such reconciliations miss baker was too good a grammarian to doubt the fact  she would probably under existing circumstances have stayed at home with her niece but that she knew she should meet sir lionel at miss todds party she was very anxious to learn whether sir lionel had heard of this sad interruption to their harmony anxious to hear what sir lionel would say about it anxious to concert measures with sir lionel for repairing the breachthat is if sir lionel should appear to be cognizant that the breach existed if she should find that he was not cognizant she would not tell him at least she thought she would not circumstances must of course govern her conduct to a certain degree when the moment of meeting should arrive and so miss baker went to the party certainly with a saddened heart but comforted in some degree by the assurance that she would meet sir lionel dear sir lionel what a thing it is to have a friend she said to herself as she stepped into the fly yes indeed the best thing in the worldthe very best but dear miss baker it is of all things the most difficult to acquireand especially difficult for both ladies and gentlemen after forty years of age  in the meantime sir lionel had been calling on miss toddhad heard a good deal about miss todd and was strong at heart as a man is strong who has two good strings to his bow     chapter vii  miss todds cardparty   yes the great miss todd had arrived at littlebath and had already been talked about not a little being a maiden lady with no family but her one own maid she lived in lodgings of course people at littlebath indeed are much given to lodgings they are mostly a comeandgo class of beings to whom the possession of furniture and the responsibilities of householding would be burdensome but then miss todds lodgings were in the paragon and all the world knows how much it costs to secure eligible rooms in the paragon two spacious sittingrooms for instance a bedroom and a closet for ones own maid and miss todd had done this in the very best corner of the paragon in that brazenfaced house which looks out of the paragon right down montpellier avenue as regards the front windows and from the back fully commands the entrance to the railway station this was mrs oneils house and as mrs oneil herself loudly boasted when miss todd came to inspect the premises she rarely took single ladies or any ladies that had not handles to their names her very last lodger had been lady mcguffern the widow of the medical director of the great indian eyesore district as mrs oneil called it and lady mcguffern had paid her oh ever so much per week and had always said on every saturdaymrs oneil your terms for such rooms as these are much too low it is in such language that the widows of scotch doctors generally speak of their lodgings when they are paying their weekly bills  and these rooms miss todd had secured she had moreover instantly sent for mr wutsanbeans who keeps those remarkably neat livery stables at the back of the paragon and in ten minutes had concluded her bargain for a private brougham and private coachman in demilivery at so much per week and very wide awake she is is miss todd said the admiring mr wutsanbeans as he stood among his bandylegged satellites and then her name was down at the assemblyrooms and in the pumproom and the bookroom and in the best of sittings in mr ocallaghans fashionable church in almost less than no time there were scores of ladies desirous of being promoted from the side walls to the middle avenues in mr ocallaghans church for after all what is the use of a french bonnet when stuck under a side wall but though all these were desirous and desirous in vain miss todd at once secured a place where her head was the cynosure of all the eyes of the congregation such was miss todds power and therefore do we call her great  and in a weeks time the sound of her loud but yet pleasant voice and the step of her heavy but yet active foot and the glow of her red cherry cheek were as well known on the esplanade as though she were a littlebathian of two months standing of course she had found friends there such friends as one always does find at such placesdear delightful people whom she had met some years before for a week at ems or sat opposite to once at the hotel table at harrowgate for a fortnight miss todd had a very large circle of such friends and to do her justice we must say that she was always glad to see them and always treated them well she was ready to feed them at all times she was not candid or malicious when backbiting them she never threw the burden of her pleasures on her friends shouldersas ladies at littlebath will sometimes do she did not boast either of her purse or her acquaintance and as long as she was allowed to do exactly what she liked she generally kept her temper she had an excellent digestion and greatly admired the same quality in other people she did not much care what she said of others but dearly liked to have mischief spoken of herself some one once had saidor very likely no one had said it but a soupçon of a hint had in some way reached her own earsthat she had left torquay without paying her bills it was at any rate untrue but she had sedulously spread the report and now wherever she ordered goods she would mysteriously tell the tradesman that he had better inquire about her in devonshire she had been seen walking one moonlight night with a young lad at bangor the lad was her nephew but some one had perhaps jested about miss todd and her beau and since that time she was always talking of eloping with her own flesh and blood  but miss todd was not a bad woman she spent much in feeding those who perhaps were not hungry but she fed the hungry also she indulged a good deal in silk brocades but she bought ginghams as well and calicos for poor women and flannel petticoats for motherless girls she did go to sleep sometimes in church and would sit at a whisttable till two oclock of a sunday morning but having been selected from a large family by an uncle as his heir she had divided her good things with brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces and so there were some hearts that blessed her and some friends who loved her with a love other than that of her friends of littlebath and ems of jerusalem and harrowgate  and she had loved in her early days and had been told and had believed that she was loved but evidence had come to her that her lover was a scampa man without morals and without principle and she had torn herself away from him and miss todd had offered to him money compensation which the brute had taken and since that for his sake or rather for her loves sake she had rejected all further matrimonial tenders and was still miss todd and miss todd she intended to remain  being such as she was the world of littlebath was soon glad to get about her those who give suppers at their cardparties are not long in littlebath in making up the complement of their guests she had been there now ten days and had already once or twice mustered a couple of whisttables but this affair was to be on a larger scale  miss baker she had not yet seen nor miss waddington the ladies had called on each other but had missed fire on both occasions but with sir lionel she had already renewed her intimacy on very affectionate terms they had been together for perhaps three days at jerusalem but then three days at jerusalem are worth a twelvemonth in such a dull slow place as london and sir lionel therefore and miss todd had nearly rushed into each others arms and they both without any intentional falsehood were talking of each other all over littlebath as old and confidential friends  and now for miss todds party assist me my muse come down from heaven o calliope my queen and aid me to spin with my pen a long discourse hark do you hear or does some fond delusion mock me i seem to hear and to be already wandering through those sacred recessesthe drawingrooms namely at littlebathwhich are pervious only to the streams and breezes of good society  miss todd stood at her drawingroom door as her guests were ushered in not by the greengrocers assistant but by the greengrocer himself in person and she made no quiet little curtsies whispered no unmeaning welcomes with bated breath no as they arrived she seized each littlebathian by the hand and shook that hand vigorously she did so to every one that came rejoiced loudly in the coming of each and bade them all revel in tea and cake with a voice that demanded and received instant obedience  ah lady longspade this is kind i am delighted to see you do you remember dear ems and the dear kursaal ah me well do take some tea now lady longspade what miss finessewellwellwell i was thinking of ostend only the other day youll find flounce there with coffee and cake and all that you remember my woman flounce dont you mrs fuzzybell you really make me proud but is not mr fuzzybell to be here oh hes behind is he wellim so glad ha ha ha a slow coach is he ill make him faster but perhaps you wont trust him to me im such a dangerous creature im always eloping with some one who knows but i might go off with mr fuzzybell we were near it you know at the end of that long walk at malvernonly he seemed too tiredha ha ha theres tea and cake there mrs fuzzybell my dear sir lionel i am delighted i declare you are five years youngerwe are both five years younger than when we were at jerusalem  and so forth but sir lionel did not pass on to the teatables as did the finesses and the longspades he remained close at miss todds elbow as though his friendship was of a more enduring kind than that of others as though he were more to miss todd than mrs fuzzybell nearer than miss ruff who had just been assured at her entrance that the decks should be made ready for action almost at once a lionhearted old warrior was miss ruffone who could not stand with patience the modern practice of dallying in the presence of her enemies guns she had come there for a rubber of whistto fight the good fightto conquer or to die and her soul longed to be at it wait but one moment longer miss ruff and the greengrocer and i will have done with our usherings and then the decks shall be cleared  but we must certainly do the honours for our old friend miss baker miss todd when she saw her looked as though she would have fallen on her neck and kissed her but she doubtless remembered that their respective headdresses might suffer in the encounter  at last dear miss baker at last i am so delighted but where is miss waddington where is the brideelect these last words were said in a whisper which was not perhaps quite as plainly audible at the other side of the paragon as were the generality of miss todds speeches indisposed why is she indisposed you mean that she has loveletters to write i know that is what you mean and the roar again became a whisper fit for drury lane well i shall make a point of seeing her tomorrow do you remember jehoshaphat dear jehoshaphat and then having made her little answers miss baker also passed on and left miss todd in the act of welcoming the rev mr ocallaghan  miss baker passed on but she did so slowly she had to speak to sir lionel who kept his place near miss todds shoulder and perhaps she had some secret hopeno not hope some sort of an anticipationthat her dear friend would give her the benefit of his arm for a few moments but sir lionel did nothing of the kind he took her hand with his kindest little squeeze asked with his softest voice after his dear caroline and then let her pass on by herself miss baker was a bird easily to be lured to her perchor to his sir lionel felt that he could secure her at any time therefore he determined to attach himself to miss todd for the present and so miss baker walked on alone perhaps a little piqued at being thus slighted  it was a strange sight to see the rev mr ocallaghan among that worldly crowd of pleasureseeking sinners there were as we have said three sets of people at littlebath that miss todd with her commanding genius and great power of will should have got together portions of two of them was hardly to be considered wonderful both the fast and heavy set liked good suppers but it did appear singular to the men and women of both these sets that they should find themselves in the same room with mr ocallaghan  mr ocallaghan was not exactly the head and font of piety at littlebath it was not on his altars not on his chiefly that hecatombs of needlework were offered up he was only senior curate to the great highpriest to dr snort himself but though he was but curate he was more perhaps to littlebathto his especial set in littlebaththan most rectors are to their own people  mr ocallaghan was known to be condescending and mild under the influence of tea and muffinssweetly so if the cream be plentiful and the muffins soft with butter but still as a man and a pastor he was severe in season and out of season he was hot in argument against the devil and all his works he was always fighting the battle with all manner of weapons he would write letters of killing reproach to persons he had never known and address them by post to      john jones esq    the sabbathbreaker    5 paradise terrace    littlebath   or      mrs gambler smith    2 little paragon    littlebath   nothing was too severe for him one may say that had he not been a clergyman and therefore of course justified in any interference he would have been kicked from littlebath to london and back again long since how then did it come to pass that he was seen at miss todds party the secret lay in miss todds unbounded power she was not as other littlebathians when he unintentionally squeezed her hand she squeezed his in return with somewhat of a firmer grasp when gently whispering he trusted that she was as well in spirit as in body she answered aloudand all the larger paragon heard herthat she was very well in both thank god and then as her guests pressed in she passed him on rapidly to the tea and cake and to such generous supplies of cream as mrs flounce in her piety might be pleased to vouchsafe to him  what mr ocallaghan said sir lionel into miss todds ear in a tone of wellbred wonder and triumphant admiration mr ocallaghan among the sinners my dear miss todd how will he like the whisttables  if he does not like them he must just do the other thing if i know anything of miss ruff a whole college of ocallaghans would not keep her from the devils books for five minutes longer oh here is lady ruth revoke my dear lady ruth i am charmed to see you when i wonder shall we meet again at baden baden dear baden baden flounce green tea for lady ruth revoke and so miss todd continued to do her duty  what miss todd had said of her friend was quite true even then miss ruff was standing over a cardtable with an open pack in her hands quite regardless of mr ocallaghan come lady longspade she said we are wasting time sadly it is ever so much after nine i know miss todd means us to begin she told me so suppose we sit down  but lady longspade merely muttered something and passed on in the first place she was not quite so eager as was miss ruff and in the next miss ruff was neither the partner nor the opponent with whom she delighted to cooperate lady longspade liked to play firstfiddle at her own table but miss ruff always played firstfiddle at her table let the others be whom they might and she very generally played her tunes altogether con spirito  miss ruff saw how lady longspade passed on but she was nothing disconcerted she was used to that and more than that hightytighty was all she said well mrs garded i think we can manage without her ladyship cant we mrs garded said that she thought they might indeed and stood by the table opposite to miss ruff this was mrs king garded a widow of great littlebathian repute to whom as a partner over the green table few objected she was a careful silent painstaking player one who carefully kept her accounts and knew well that the monthly balance depended mainly not on her good but on her bad hands she was an old friend and an old enemy of miss ruffs the two would say very spiteful things to each other things incredible to persons not accustomed to the cardtables of littlebath but nevertheless they were always willing to sit together at the same rubber  to them came up smirking little mr fuzzybell mr fuzzybell was not great at whist nor did he much delight in it but nevertheless he constantly played he was taken about by his wife to the parties and then he was always caught and impaled and generally plucked and skinned before he was sent home again he never disported at the same table with his wife who did not care to play either with him or against him but he was generally caught by some miss ruff or some mrs king garded and duly made use of the ladies of littlebath generally liked to have one black coat at the table with them it saved them from that air of destitution which always in their own eyes attaches to four ladies seated at a table together  ah mr fuzzybell said miss ruff you are the very person we are looking for mrs garded always likes to have you at her table sit down mr fuzzybell mr fuzzybell did as he was told and sat down  just at this moment as miss ruff was looking out with eager eyes for a fourth who would suit her tastes and had almost succeeded in catching the eye of miss finesseand miss finesse was a silent desirable correct playerwho should walk up to the table and absolutely sit down but that odious old woman lady ruth revoke it was mrs gardeds great sin in miss ruffs eye that she toadied lady ruth to such an extent as to be generally willing to play with her now it was notorious in littlebath that she had never played well and that she had long since forgotten all she had ever known the poor old woman had already had some kind of a fit she was very shaky and infirm and ghastly to look at in spite of her paint and ribbons she was long in arranging her cards long in playing them very long in settling her points when the points went against her as they generally did and yet in spite of all this mrs king garded would encourage her because her father had been lord whitechapel  there was no help for it now there she was in the chair and unless miss ruff was prepared to give up her table and do something that would be uncommonly rude even for her the rubber must go on she was not prepared at any rate to give up her table so she took up a card to cut for partners there were two to one in her favour if fortune would throw her ladyship and mr fuzzybell together there might yet be found in the easiness of the prey some consolation for the slowness of the play  they cut the cards and miss ruff found herself sitting opposite to lady ruth revoke it was a pity that she should not have been photographed and now mr fuzzybell said mrs king garded triumphantly  but we must for awhile go to other parts of the room lady longspade mrs fuzzybell and miss finesse soon followed the daring example of miss ruff and seated themselves with some worthy fourth compatriot  did you see miss ruff said lady longspade whose ears had caught the scornful hightytighty of the rejected lady she wanted to get me at her table but no i thank you i like my rubber too and can play it as well as some other people but it may cost too dear eh mrs fuzzybell i have no idea of being scolded by miss ruff  no nor i said mrs fuzzybell i hate that continual scolding we are playing only for amusement and why not play in good tempernevertheless mrs fuzzybell had a rough side to her own tongue it is you and i miss finesse shillings i suppose and and then there was a little whispering and a little grinning between lady longspade and mrs fuzzybell the meaning of which was that as the occasion was rather a special one they would indulge themselves with halfacrown on the rubber and sixpence each hand on the odd trick and so the second table went to work  and then there was a third and a fourth and a fifth miss ruffs example was more potent than mr ocallaghans presence in that assembly that gentleman began to feel unhappy as there was no longer round him a crowd of listening ladies sufficient to screen from his now uninquiring eyes the delinquencies of the more eager of the sinners the snorting of the warhorse and the sound of the trumpet had enticed away every martial bosom and mr ocallaghan was left alone in converse with mrs flounce  he turned to miss todd who was now seated near enough to the door to do honour to any late arriving guest but near enough also to the table to help herself easily to cake his soul burned within him to utter one anathema against the things that he saw miss todd was still not playing he might opine that she objected to the practice sir lionel was still at her back he also might be a brand that had been rescued from the burning at a little distance sat miss baker he knew that she at any rate was not violently attached to cards could he not say something could he not lift up his voice if only for a moment and speak forth as he so loved to do as was his wont in the meetings of the saints his brethren  he looked at miss todd and he raised his eyes and he raised his hands but the courage was not in him to speak there was about miss todd as she stood or as she sat a firmness which showed itself even in her rotundity a vigour in the very rubicundity of her cheek which was apt to quell the spirit of those who would fain have interfered with her so mr ocallaghan having raised his eyes considerably and having raised his hands a little said nothing  i fear you do not approve of cards said miss todd  approve oh no how can i approve of them miss todd  well i do with all my heart what are old women like us to do we havent eyes to read at night even if we had minds fit for it we cant always be saying our prayers we have nothing to talk about except scandal its better than drinking and we should come to that if we hadnt cards  oh miss todd  you see you have your excitement in preaching mr ocallaghan these cardtables are our pulpits we have got none other we havent children and we havent husbands that is the most of us and we should be in a lunatic asylum in six weeks if you took away our cards now will you tell me mr ocallaghan what would you expect miss ruff to do if you persuaded her to give up whist  she has the poor with her always miss todd  yes she has the woman that goes about with a clean apron and four borrowed children and the dumb man with a bit of chalk and no legs and the very red nose she has these to be sure and a lot more but suppose she looks after them all the day she cant be looking after them all the night too the mind must be unbent sometimes mr ocallaghan  but to play for money miss todd is not that gambling  well i dont know i cant say what gambling is but do you sit down and play for love mr ocallaghan and see how soon youll go to sleep come shall we try i can have a little private bet just to keep myself awake with sir lionel here  but mr ocallaghan declined the experiment so he had another cup of tea and another muffin and then went his way regretting sorely in his heart that he could not get up into a high pulpit and preach at them all however he consoled himself by improving the occasion on the following sunday  for the next fifteen minutes sir lionel stood his ground saying soft nothings to miss todd and then he also became absorbed among the rubbers he found that miss todd was not good at having love made to her in public she was very willing to be confidential very willing to receive flattery attentions handpressings and the like but she would make her confidences in her usual joyous loud voice and when told that she was looking remarkably well she would reply that she always did look well at littlebath in a tone that could not fail to attract the attention of the whole room now sir lionel would fain have been a little more quiet in his proceedings and was forced to put off somewhat of what he had to say till he could find miss todd alone on the top of a mountain twas thus at least that he expressed his thoughts to himself in his chagrin as he took his place opposite to mrs shortpointz at the seventh and last establishment now formed in the rooms  the only idlers present were miss baker and miss todd miss baker was not quite happy in her mind it was not only that she was depressed about caroline her firm belief in the grammatical axiom before alluded to lessened her grief on that score but the conduct of sir lionel made her uncomfortable and she began to find without at all understanding why that she did not like miss todd as well as she used to do at jerusalem her heart took mr ocallaghans side in that little debate about the cards and though sir lionel in leaving miss todd did not come to her nevertheless the movement was agreeable to her she was not therefore in her very highest spirits when miss todd came and sat close to her on the sofa  i am so sorry you should be out said miss todd but you see ive had so much to do at the door there that i couldnt see who was sitting down with who  id rather be out said miss baker i am not quite sure that mr ocallaghan is not right this was her revenge  no hes not a bit right my dear he doesjust what the man says in the rhymeswhat is it you knowmakes up for his own little peccadilloes by damning yours and mine i forget how it goes but therell be more in byandby and then well have another table those who come late will be more in your line not so ready to peck your eyes out if you happen to forget a card that miss ruff is dreadful here an awful note was heard for the lady ruth had just put her thirteenth trump on miss ruffs thirteenth heart what littlebathian female soul could stand that unmoved  oh dear that poor old woman continued miss todd you know one lives in constant fear of her having a fit miss ruff is horrible she has a way of looking with that fixed eye of hers that is almost worse than her voice the fact was that miss ruff had one glass eye i know shell be the death of that poor old creature some of these days lady ruth will play and she hardly knows one card from another and then miss ruff she will scold good heavens do you hear that  its just seven minutes since i turned the last trick of the last hand miss ruff had said scornfully we shall have finished the two rubbers about six in the morning i take it  will your ladyship allow me to deal for you said mr fuzzybell meaning to be civil  ill allow you to do no such thing croaked out lady ruth i can deal very well myself at any rate as well as miss ruff and im not the least in a hurry and she went on slobbering out the cards and counting them over and over again almost as each card fell  thats a double and a treble against a single said lady longspade cheerfully from another table six points and fivethe other rubbermakes eleven and the two halfcrowns is sixteen and seven odd tricks is nineteen and six heres sixpence mrs fuzzybell and now well cut again  this was dreadful to miss ruff here had her rival played two rubbers won them both pocketed all but a sovereign and was again at work while she she was still painfully toiling through her second game the first having been scored against her by her partners fatuity in having trumped her long heart was this to be borne with patience lady ruth she said emitting fire out of her one eye do you ever mean to have done dealing those cards  lady ruth did not condescend to make any answer but recommenced her leisurely counting and then miss ruff uttered that terrific screech which had peculiarly excited miss todds attention  i declare i dont like it at all said the tenderhearted miss baker i think mr ocallaghan was quite right  no my dear he was quite wrong for he blamed the use of cards not the abuse and after all what harm comes of it i dont suppose miss ruff will actually kill her i dare say if we were playing ourselves we shouldnt notice it do you play cribbage shall we have a little cribbage but miss baker did not play cribbage or at any rate she said that she did not  and do tell me something about dear caroline continued miss todd i am so anxious to see her but it has been a very long engagement hasnt it and there ought to be lots of money oughtnt there but i suppose its all right you know i was very much in love with young bertram myself and made all manner of overtures to him but quite in vain ha ha ha i always thought him a very fine fellow and i think her a very lucky girl and when is it to be and do tell me is she over head and ears in love with him  what was miss baker to say to this she had not the slightest intention of making miss todd a confidante in the matter certainly not now as that lady was inclined to behave so very improperly with sir lionel and yet she did not know how to answer it  i hope it wont be put off much longer continued miss todd is any day fixed yet  no no day is fixed yet replied miss baker blushing  miss todds ear was very quick there is nothing the matter i trust well i wont ask any questions nor say a word to anybody come there is a table vacant and we will cut in and then she determined that she would get it all out from sir lionel  the parties at some of the tables were now changed and miss baker and miss todd found themselves playing together miss baker too loved a gentle little rubber if she could enjoy it quietly without fear of being gobbled up by any ruff or any longspade and with miss todd she was in this matter quite safe she might behave as badly as had the lady ruth and miss todd would do no worse than laugh at her miss todd did not care about her points and at her own house would as soon lose as win so that miss baker would have been happy had she not still continued to sigh over her friends very improper flirtation with sir lionel  and thus things went on for an hour or so every now and again a savage yell was heard from some illused angry lady and low growls prolonged sometimes through a whole game came from different parts of the room but nobody took any notice of them twas the manner at littlebath and though a stranger to the place might have thought on looking at those perturbed faces and hearing those uncourteous sounds that there would be a flow of bloodsuch a flow as angry nails may producethe denizens of the place knew better so the rubbers went on with the amount of harmony customary to the place  but the scene would have been an odd one for a nonplaying stranger had a nonplaying stranger been there to watch it every person in the room was engaged at whist except mrs flounce who still remained quiescent behind her tea and cakes it did not happen that the party was made up of a number of exact fours there were two over two middleaged ladies a maiden and a widow and they perhaps more happy than any of the others certainly more silent for neither of them had a partner to scold were hard at work at doubledummy in a corner  it was a sight for a stranger it is generally thought that a sad ennui pervades the life of most of those old ladies in england to whom fate has denied the usual cares and burdens of the world or whose cares and burdens are done and gone but there was no ennui here no stockjobber on change could go about his exciting work with more animating eagerness there were those who scolded and those who were scolded those who sat silent being great of mind and those who being weak could not restrain their notes of triumph or their notes of woe but they were all of them as animated and intense as a tiger springing at its prey watch the gleam of joy that lights up the halfdead sallow countenance of old mrs shortpointz as she finds the ace of trumps at the back of her hand the very last card happy happy mrs shortpointz watch the triumph which illumines even the painted cheeks and halfhidden wrinkles of lady longspade as she brings in at the end of the hand three winning little clubs and sees kings and queens fall impotent at their call triumphant successful lady longspade was napoleon more triumphant did a brighter glow of selfsatisfied inward power cross his features when at ulm he succeeded in separating poor mack from all his friends  play on ladies let us not begrudge you your amusements we do not hold with pious mr ocallaghan that the interchange of a few sixpences is a grievous sin at other hours ye are still soft charitable and tenderhearted tenderhearted as english old ladies are and should be but dear ladies would it not be well to remember the amenities of lifeeven at the whisttable  so things went on for an hour or so and then miss baker and sir lionel again found themselves separated from the cardtables a lonely pair it had been sir lionels cue this evening to select miss todd for his special attentions but he had found miss todd at the present moment to be too much a public character for his purposes she had a sort of way of speaking to all her guests at once which had doubtless on the whole an extremely hilarious effect but which was not flattering to the amour propre of a special admirer so faute de mieux sir lionel was content to sit down in a corner with miss baker miss baker was also content but she was rather uneasy as to how she should treat the subject of carolines quarrel with her lover  of course you saw george today she began  yes i did see him but that was all he seemed to be in a tremendous hurry and said he must be back in town tonight hes not staying is he  no hes not staying  i didnt know when i saw that dear caroline was not with you i thought she might perhaps have better company at home  she was not very well george went back to london before dinner  nothing wrong i hope  well no i hope not that isyou havent heard anything about it have you sir lionel  heard anything no i have heard nothing what is it  it may be presumed that such a conversation as this had not been carried on in a very loud tone but nevertheless low as miss baker had spoken low as sir lionel had spoken it had been too loud they had chosen their places badly the table at which lady ruth and her party were sittingwe ought rather to say miss ruff and her partywas in one corner of the room and our friends had placed themselves on a cushioned seat fixed against the wall in this very corner things were still going badly with miss ruff as sindbad carried the old man and could not shake him off so did miss ruff still carry lady ruth revoke and the weight was too much for her  she manfully struggled on howeverwomanfully would perhaps be a stronger and more appropriate word she had to calculate not only how to play her own hand correctly but she had also to calculate on her partners probable errors this was hard work and required that all around her should be undisturbed and silent in the midst of a maze of uncontrollable difficulties the buzz buzz of miss bakers voice fell upon her ears and up she rose from her chair  miss todd she said and miss todd looking round from a neighbouring table shone upon her with her rosy face but all the shining was of no avail  miss todd if this is to be a conversazione we had better make it so at once but if its whist then i must say i never heard so much talking in my life  its a little of both said miss todd not sotto voce  oh very well now i understand said miss ruff and then she resumed her work and went on with her calculations  miss baker and sir lionel got up of course and going over to the further part of the room continued their conversation she soon told him all she knew she had hardly seen george herself she said but caroline had had a long interview with him and on leaving him had said that allall now was over  i dont know what to make of it said miss baker with her handkerchief to her eyes what do you think sir lionel you know they say that lovers always do quarrel and always do make it up again  george is a very headstrong fellow said sir lionel  yes that is what i have always felt always there was no being sure with him he is so wild and has such starts  has this been his doing  oh yes i think so not but that caroline is very spirited too i suppose somehow it came about between them  he was tired of waiting  that might have been a reason twelve months ago but there was to be no more delay now that is as i understood it no it has not been that sir lionel it makes me very unhappy i know and miss baker again used her handkerchief  you mustnt distress yourself my dearest friend said lionel for my sake dont oh if you knew how it pains me to see you suffering in that way i think more of you in the matter than even of george i do indeed and sir lionel contrived to give a little pinch to the top of one of miss bakers fingersnot however without being observed by the sharp eyes of his hostess  but caroline sobbed miss baker behind her handkerchief she was nicely ensconced in the depth of a loungingchair so that she could turn her face from the cardtables it is so sweet to be consoled in ones misery especially when one really believes that the misery is not incurable so that on the whole miss baker was not unhappy  yes dear caroline said sir lionel of course i can say nothing till i have heard more of the matter but do you think caroline really loves him sometimes i have thought  so have i sometimes that is i used but she does love him sir lionel that is if i know anything about it  ah dearest friend do you know anything about it that is the very question i want to ask you do you know anything about it sometimes i have thought you knew nothing and then sometimes i have thought been bold enough to think and sir lionel looked intently at the handkerchief which covered her face and miss todd looked furtively ever and anon at sir lionel i declare i think it would do very well said miss todd to herself goodnaturedly  miss baker did not quite understand him but she felt herself much consoled sir lionel was a remarkably handsome man as to that she had made up her mind long since then he was a peculiarly gentlemanlike man a very friendly man and a man who exactly suited all her tastes she had for some weeks past begun to think the day tedious in which she did not see him and now it was driven in upon her mind that conversation was a much pleasanter occupation than whist that is conversation with so highlypolished a man as sir lionel bertram but nevertheless she did not quite understand what he meant nor did she know how she ought to answer it why need she answer him at all could she not sit there wiping her eyes softly and comfortably and listen to what might come next  i sometimes think that some women never love said sir lionel  perhaps they dont said miss baker  and yet in the depth of many a heart there may be a fund of passion  oh there may certainly said miss baker  and in your own my friend is there no such fund there are there no hidden depths there unexplored still fresh but still perhaps still to be reached  again miss baker found it easiest to lie well back into her chair and wipe her eyes comfortably she was not prepared to say much about the depths of her own heart at so very short a notice  sir lionel was again about to speakand who can say what might have come next how far those hidden depths might have been triedwhen he was arrested in the midst of his pathos by seeing mrs garded and mr fuzzybell each rush to a shoulder of lady ruth revoke the colonel quitted his love for the moment and hurried to the distant table while miss baker removing her handkerchief sat up and gazed at the scene of action  the quarrelling had been going on unabated but that had caused little surprise it is astonishing how soon the ear becomes used to incivilities they were now accustomed to miss ruffs voice and thought nothing of her exclamations well i declarewhat the ten of spadesha ha ha well it is an excellent jokeif you could have obliged me lady ruth by returning my lead of trumps we should have been out c c c all this and more attracted no attention and the general pity for lady ruth had become dead and passive  but at last miss ruffs tongue went faster and faster and her words became sharper and sharper lady ruths countenance became very strange to look at she bobbed her head about slowly in a manner that frightened mr fuzzybell and ceased to make any remark to her partner then mrs garded made two direct appeals to miss ruff for mercy  but miss ruff could not be merciful perhaps on each occasion she refrained for a moment but it was only for a moment and mrs garded and mr fuzzybell ceased to think of their cards and looked only at the lady ruth and then of a sudden they both rose from their seats the colonel as we have said rushed across the room and all the players at all the tables put down their cards and stood up in alarm  lady ruth was sitting perfectly still except that she still bobbed her old head up and down in a strange unearthly manner she had about ten cards in her hand which she held motionless her eyes seemed to be fixed in one continued stare directly on the face of her foe her lower jaw had fallen so as to give a monstrous extension to her cadaverous face there she sat apparently speechless but still she bobbed her head and still she held her cards  it was known at littlebath that she had suffered from paralysis and mrs garded and mr fuzzybell thinking that she was having or about to have a fit naturally rushed to her assistance  what is the matter with her said miss ruff is anything the matter with her  miss todd was now at the old ladys side lady ruth said she do you find yourself not well shall we go into my room sir lionel will you help her ladyship and between them they raised lady ruth from her chair but she still clutched the cards still fixed her eyes on miss ruff and still bobbed her head  do you feel yourself ill lady ruth said miss todd but her ladyship answered nothing  it seemed however that her ladyship could walk for with her two supporters she made her way nearly to the door of the room there she stood and having succeeded in shaking off sir lionels arm she turned and faced round upon the company she continued to bob her head at them all and then made this little speech uttering each word very slowly  i wish she had a glass tongue as well because then perhaps shed break it and having so revenged herself she suffered miss todd to lead her away into the bedroom it was clear at least that she had no fit and the company was thankful  sir lionel seeing how it was left them at the door of the bedroom and a few minutes afterwards miss todd mrs flounce and lady ruths own maid succeeded in getting her into a cab it is believed that after a day or two she was none the worse for what had happened and that she made rather a boast of having put down miss ruff for the moment miss ruff was rather put down  when miss todd returned to the drawingroom that lady was sitting quite by herself on an ottoman she was bolt upright with her hands before her on her lap striving to look as though she were perfectly indifferent to what had taken place but there was ever and again a little twitch about her mouth and an involuntary movement in her eye which betrayed the effort and showed that for this once lady ruth had conquered mr fuzzybell was standing with a frightened look at the fireplace while mrs king garded hung sorrowing over her cards for when the accident happened she had two by honours in her own hand  when miss todd returned some few of her guests were at work again but most of the tables were broken up poor dear old lady said miss todd she has gone home none the worse she is very old you know and a dear good creature  a sweet dear creature said mrs shortpointz who loved the peerage and hated miss ruff  come said miss todd parsnip has got a little supper for us downstairs shall we go down miss ruff you and i will go and call on lady ruth tomorrow sir lionel will you give your arm to lady longspade come my dear and so miss todd took miss baker under her wing and they all went down to supper but miss ruff said not another word that night  ha ha said miss todd poking her fan at miss baker i see all about it i assure you and i quite approve  miss baker felt very comfortable but she did not altogether understand her friends joke     chapter viii  three letters   george bertram as we have seen returned to town after his interview with miss waddington without seeing his father neither to his mind nor to hers was any comfort brought by that grammatical rule in which miss baker had found so much consolation for both of them the separation was now a thing completed each knew enough of the other to feel that that others pride was too high to admit of his or her making any first fresh advancement  george endeavoured to persuade himself that he was glad of what he had done but he failed utterly he had loved her did love her dearly and found that he never valued her as he did now she had behaved shamefully to him he said that to himself over and over again but what had that to do with love he did not love her the less because she had made public his letter the secrets of his heart that which should have been as private as the passion of her own bosom he could not love her less because she talked over these with another man however much he might feel himself bound to cast her off for doing so so he shut himself up in his chambers wrote pages for his new book that were moody misanthropical and unbelieving and on the whole was very unhappy  nor was caroline much better able to bear the shock though with her there was more propriety of demeanour under the blow and a better mental control that was of course for she was a womanand being a woman she had to take care that the world knew nothing of what was going on within her heart  for two days she remained perfectly calm she allowed herself no vent whatever for her feelings she made the breakfast sat close at her tambour frame or more frequently close at her book read aloud to her aunt went out and made calls and attended minutely to all the ordinary occupations of her life her aunt never once caught her with a tear in her eye never saw her sitting thoughtful unoccupied with her head leaning on her arm had she done so she would have spoken to her about george as it was she did not dare to do so there was during these days and indeed outwardly for many days afterwards an iron stubbornness about caroline which frightened miss baker and altogether prevented her from alluding to the possibility of a reconciliation nothing could be more gentle nay more obedient than carolines manner and way with her aunt at this time she yielded to her in everything but her aunt perceived that all utterance as to the one subject which was nearest to both their hearts was effectually forbidden  caroline allowed two whole days to pass before she would allow herself to think of what had taken place she read through half the nights so as to secure sleep for herself when she lay down but on the third morning she opened her desk in her own room and sat down and wrote to adela gauntlet      littlebath friday     dearest adela     an occurrence has taken place of which i have not yet    allowed myself to think and which i shall first realize    and bring home to myself in writing to you and yet before    it happened i had thought of it very ofteneven talked of    it with aunt mary and sometimes thought of it and talked    of it as though it were almost desirable i wish i may    teach myself so to think of it now     all is over between me and mr bertram he came down here    on tuesday and told me so i do not blame him nor can i    blame him not at least for what he has done though his    manner in doing it was very harsh     i would tell you all if i could but it is so hard in a    letter i wish you were here but no you would drive me    mad by advice which i could not would not take last    summer when i was so unhappy in london aunt and i had    some conversation about our affairs with a person there    mr bertram heard of this while he was in paris he did    not approve of it and he wrote me oh such a letter i    should have thought it impossible for him to have written    such words to me i was mad with grief and i showed this    letter to the same person there adela i must tell you    all it was mr harcourt georges intimate friend george    particularly begged me in that letter not to talk to him    any more and yet i did this but i was half frenzied    with grief and why was i to obey one who had no right    to command me and who made his commands so harsh his    request would have been a law to me     but i know i was wrong adela i have known it every    minute since i showed the letter i was sure i was wrong    because i could not tell him that i had done so it made    me afraid of him and i never before was afraid of any    one well i did not tell him and now he has found it    out i would not condescend to ask him how but i think i    know this at least i know that he did so in no ignoble    way by no mean little suspicions he did not seek to    discover it it had come upon him like a great blow and    he came at once to me to learn the truth i told him the    truth and this has been the end of it     now you know it all all except his look his tone his    manner these i cannot tell youcannot describe i seem    now to know him better understand him more thoroughly    than ever i did he is a man for a tenderhearted woman    to love to madness and i ah never mind dearest i    thinknay i am sure i can get over it you never could    yes he is a man for a woman to worship but yet he is    so rough so stern so harsh in his anger he does not    measure his words at all i dont think he knows the kind    of things he says and yet the while his heart is so    tender so soft i could see it all but he gives one no    time to acknowledge itat least he gave me none were    you ever scolded upbraided scorned by a man you loved    and did you ever feel that you loved him the better for    all his scorn i felt so i could so feel though it    was impossible to confess it but he was wrong there    he should not have upbraided me unless he intended to    forgive i think i have read that it is not kingly for a    king to receive a suppliant for pardon unless he intends    to forgive i can understand that if his mind was made    up to condemn me altogether he should have written and    so have convicted me but in such matters he considers    nothing he acts altogether from the heart     i am however sure of this dear adela that it is    all better as it is there with you i will scorn all    falsehood for once and if possible only for once the    truth shall stand out plainly i love him as i never    never can love another man i love him as i never thought    to love any man i feel at this moment as though i could    be content to serve him as his menial for she who is his    wife must so serve himand how long should i be content    to do so     but yet i wrong him in this he is most imperious    absolutely imperiousmust be altogether master in all    things that is what i mean but to one who loved him    well and would permit this he would be the tenderest    gentlest most loving of masters he would not permit the    wind to blow too harshly on his slave i have loved him    well but i could not permit this i could not permit it    for a whole lifetime and therefore it is well that we    have parted     you will hardly believe this of him for he seems in    general company to be so goodhumoured with people that    are indifferent to him no man is less exacting but with    those near to him in life he never bends not an inch    it is this that has estranged his uncle from him but    yet how noble how grand a man he is to all pecuniary    considerations he is absolutely indifferent a falsehood    even a concealment is impossible with him who that    either of us knows is equal to or approaches him in    talent he is brave generous simplehearted beyond all    that i have ever known who is like him and yet to    you once for all i say all this but adela do not take    advantage of me you ought to know that were it not all    over i should not say it     i wish that you had been betrothed to him oh how i wish    it you are not worldly as i am not stubborn nor proud    of heart not that you have not pride a truer better    pride you could have brought yourself to submit to be    guided to be a secondary portion of himselfand then how    he would have loved you     i have often wondered that he should have thought of me    no two persons were ever less suited for each other i    knew that when i accepted him foolishly accepted him    because i liked him and now i am rightly punished but    ah that he should be punished too for he is punished    i know he loves me though i know nothing would now    induce him to take me and i know this also that    nothingnothingnothing would induce me to be so taken    not if he were beggingas he never will beg to any woman    i would be too true to him too true to what i now know to    be his happiness     as for me i dare say i shall marry yet i have some    little money and that sort of manner which many men    think most becoming for the top of their tables and the    management of their drawingrooms if i do there shall be    no deceit i certainly shall not marry for love indeed    from early years i never thought it possible that i should    do so i have floundered unawares into the pitfall and    now i must flounder out i have always thought that there    was much in the world well worth the living for besides    love ambition needs not be a closed book for women    unless they choose to close it i do not see but that a    statesmans wife may stand nearly as high in the world as    the statesman stands himself money position rank are    worth the havingat any rate the world thinks so or why    else do they so scramble for them i will not scramble for    them but if they come in my way why i may probably pick    them up     this will be odious to you i know it will a    potatoparing and a true heart are your beauideal for    this world i am made of viler stuff i have had the true    heart and see what i have made of it     you will answer me of course i could find it in my heart    to beg you not to do so only now i could not afford to    think that you were cold to me i know you will write to    me but pray pray do not advise me to submit myself to    him under the idea that a reconciliation is possible a    reconciliation is not possible and i will not submit    myself to him i know i speak the truth when i say that    our marriage is not to be desired i acknowledge his    merits i confess his superiority but these very merits    this great superiority make it impossible that i should    suit him as a wife     on that matter i have made up my mind i will never marry    him i only say this to deter you from wasting your energy    in endeavouring to bring us again together i know very    well that i shall not be askedthat his mind is equally    firm     and now goodbye you know all my heart and as far    as i can tell them all my feelings a long letter from    you will give me much delight if you will comply with my    earnest request     this letter has been a very selfish one for it is all    about myself but you will forgive that now god bless    you     your affectionate friend     caroline     ps i have said nothing to aunt mary except to tell    her that the match is broken off and she has kindlyso    kindly abstained from any questions   adela gauntlet was all alone when she received this letter at west putford in these days she generally was all alone that she should answer it answer it at once was of course certain but how should she answer it her mind was soon made up with many tears partly for her friend and partly for herself carolines happiness had been nay probably still was in her own hands and she was going to throw it away for herself happiness had never been within her own reach be his menial servant she repeated to herself as she read and reread the letter yes of course she should if he required it it would be for her to make him know that she could be something better to him  her judgment was soon formed she condemned caroline altogether on carolines own showing in such matters one woman almost always condemns another she took no notice of the allusion to bertrams harshness she almost overlooked the generosity with which her friend had written of the lover who had rejected her she only saw carolines great fault how could she have brought herself to talk with mr harcourtwith a young unmarried manon such a subject and oh how was it possible that she could have brought herself to show him such a letter she wrote her answer that same night as follows      west putford saturday night     dearest caroline     your letter has made me most unhappy i almost think that    i have suffered more in reading it than you did in writing    it you have made a request to me with which i cannot    will not comply i can only write to you the truth as i    think it what else can i write how can i frame my letter    in any other way     but i will acknowledge this that it is useless for me    to suggest anything to you as to your own happiness but    there is more than that to be thought of there is that    which you are bound to think of before that whether you    have broken with mr bertram or not there has been that    between you which makes it your duty in this matter to    regard his happiness as your first consideration     dearest dearest caroline i fear that you have been wrong    throughout in this affair i do not dread your being angry    with me for saying so in spite of what you say i know    your heart is so warm that you would be angry with me if    i blamed him you were wrong in talking to mr harcourt    doubly wrong in showing to him that letter if so is it    not your business to put that wrong right to remedy if    you can the evil that has come of it     i feel quite sure that mr bertram loves you with all his    heart and that he is one who will be wretched to his    hearts core at losing what he loves it is nothing to say    that it is he who has rejected you you understand his    moods even i understand them well enough to know in what    temper that last visit was made answer this to yourself    had you then asked his pardon do you not know that he    would have given it you with a rapture of joy do you not    feel that he was then at that moment only too anxious to    forgive and are you you who have sinned against him are    you to let him break his heart against a rock because    you are too proud to own to him the fault which you    acknowledge to yourself is that your return for the love    which he has borne you     you wish that he had loved me you say do not wish away    the sweetest gift which god can give to a woman in this    world it was not possible that i should have loved him    it is quite impossible now that you should not do so     try to think in this affair with severity towards    yourself and ask yourself what justice requires of you    my advice to you is to write to him tell him with frank    humility and frank affection that you ask his pardon    for the injury that you had done him say no more    than that if it shall still please him to consider    that the engagement between you is at an end such an    acknowledgment from you will in no way constrain him to    violate that resolve but if he relentand i know that    this other if will be the true onethe first train that    runs will bring him back to you and he who i am sure is    now wretched will again be happy ah happier than he has    been for so long     i implore you to do this not for your own sake but for    his you have done wrong and it is he that should be    considered you will think what will be your sufferings if    he does not notice your letter should he not be softened    by your humility but you have no right to think of that    you have done him wrong and you owe him reparation you    cannot expect that you should do wrong and not suffer     i fear i have written savagely dear dear caroline come    to me here and i will not talk savagely i too am not    happy i have not my happiness so much in my own hands as    you have do come to me papa will be delighted to see    you i am sure miss baker could spare you for a fortnight    do do come to     your true friend     adela   there was much of craft in adela gauntlets letter but if craft could ever be pardonable then was hers pardonable in this case she had written as though her sole thought was for mr bertram she had felt that in this way only could she move her friend in her mindadelas mindit was a settled conviction firm as rocks that as caroline and mr bertram loved each other neither of them could be happy unless they were brought together how could she best aid in doing this that had been her main thought and so thinking she had written this letter filled to overflowing with womanly craft  and her craft was nearly successful but only nearly that was all caroline sat in her solitude and cried over this letter till her eyes were weary with tears she strove strove valiantly to take her friends advice strove to do so in spite of all her former protestations she got pen and ink and sat herself down to write the letter of humiliation but the letter would not be written it was impossible to her the words would not form themselves for two days she strove and then she abandoned the task as for ever hopeless and thus this third short epistle must be laid before the reader  i cannot do it adela it is not in my nature you could do it because you are good and high and pure do not judge others by yourself i cannot do it and will not madden myself by thinking of it again goodbye god bless you if i could cure your grief i would come to you but i am not fit god in his own time will cure yours because you are so pure i could not help you nor you me i had better therefore remain where i am a thousand thousand kisses i love you so now because you and you only know my secret oh if you should not keep it but i know you will you are so true  this was all there was no more no signature may god help them both said adela as she read it     chapter ix  bidding high   i hope to press all the necessary records of the next three or four months into a few pages a few pages will be needed in order that we may know how old mr bertram behaved when he heard of this rupture between his nephew and his granddaughter  george when he found himself back in town shut himself up in his chambers and went to work upon his manuscript he too recognized the necessity of labour in order that the sorrow within his heart might thus become dull and deadened  but it was deep true sorrowto him at some periods almost overwhelming he would get up from his desk during the night and throwing himself on the sofa lie there writhing in his agony while he had known that caroline was his own he had borne his love more patiently than does many a man of less intensity of feeling he had been much absent from her had not abridged those periods of absence as he might have done had indeed been but an indifferent lover if eagerness and empressement are necessary to a lovers character but this had arisen from two causes and lukewarmness in his love had not been either of them he had been compelled to feel that he must wait for the fruition of his love and therefore had waited and then he had been utterly devoid of any feeling of doubt in her he loved she had decided that they should wait and so he had waited as secure away from her as he could have been with her  but his idea of a womans love of the purity and sanctity of her feelings had been too high he had left his betrothed to live without him frequently without seeing him for months and yet he had thought it utterly impossible that she should hold confidential intercourse with another man we have seen how things fell out with him the story need not be repeated he was shocked outraged torn to the hearts core but he loved as warmly perhaps more warmly than ever  what he now expected it is impossible to describe but during that first fortnight of seclusion in the midst of london he did half expect half hope that something would turn up he waited and waited still assuring himself that his resolve was inviolable and that nothing should make him renew his engagement and yet he hoped for something there was a weight on his heart which then might have been removed  but no sign was made we have seen how adela who felt for him had striven in vain no sign was made and at the end of the fortnight he roused himself shook his mane and asked himself what he should do  in the first place there should be no mystery there were those among his friends to whom he had felt himself bound to speak of his engagement when it was made and to them he felt himself bound to communicate the fact now that it was unmade he wrote accordingly to arthur wilkinson he wrote to harcourt and determined to go down to hadley he would have written also to his uncle but he had never done so and hardly knew how to commence a correspondence  his letter to harcourt had been a difficult task to him but at last it was finished in a very few words he did not at all refer to what had taken place at richmond or allude in any way to the nature of the cause which had produced this sudden disrupture he merely said that his engagement with miss waddington was broken off by mutual consent and that he thought it best to let his friend know this in order that mistakes and consequent annoyance might be spared this was very short but nevertheless it required no little effort in its accomplishment  on the very next day harcourt came to him at his chambers this surprised him much for though he had no intention of absolutely quarrelling with the rising legal luminary he had taught himself to look upon any renewal of their real intimacy as out of the question they were sailing on essentially different tacks in their lifes voyages they had become men of different views in everything their hours their habits their friends their ways were in all things unlike and then moreover bertram no longer liked the successful barrister it may be said that he had learned positively to dislike him it was not that harcourt had caused this wound which was tearing his heart to pieces at least he thought that it was not that he declared to himself a dozen times that he did not blame harcourt he blamed no one but carolineher and himself nor was it because the man was so successful bertram certainly did not envy him but the one as he advanced in manhood became worldly false laborious exact polished rich and agreeable among casual acquaintances the other was the very reverse he was generous and true but idleidle at any rate for any good he was thoughtful but cloudy in his thoughts indifferent as to society poor much poorer than he had been as a lad at college and was by no means gifted with the knack of making pretty conversation for the world at large of late whenever they had met harcourt had said something which grated painfully on the others inner sensibilities and hence had arisen this dislike  but the dislike seemed to be all on one side harcourt now was a man whose name was frequent in other mens mouths great changes were impending in the political world and harcourt was one of the men whom the world regarded as sure to be found swimming on the top of the troubled waters the people of the battersea hamlets were proud of him the house of commons listened to him suitors employed him and men potent in the treasury chambers and men also who hoped to be potent there courted and flattered him  all this made him busy but nevertheless he found time to come to his dear friend  i am sorry for this very sorry he said as he put out his hand in a manner that seemed to his friend to be almost patronizing can nothing be done  nothing at all said bertram rather curtly  can i do nothing said the cunning legal man  nothing at all said bertram very curtly  ah i wish i could i should be so happy to rearrange matters if it be at all possible there are some men who are so specially good at rearranging the domestic disarrangements of others  it is an affair said bertram which admits of no interference perhaps it is unnecessary that i should have troubled you on the matter at all for i know that you are very busy but  my dear fellowbusy indeed what business could be more important to me than my friends happiness  but continued george as the affair had been talked over so often between you and me i thought it right to tell you  of courseof course and so nothing can be done ah well it is very sad very but i suppose you know best she is a charming girl perhaps rather  harcourt i had rather not hear a word spoken about her in any way but certainly not a word in her dispraise  dispraise no certainly not it would be much easier to praise her i always admired her very much very much indeed  well theres an end of it  so be it but i am sorry very sorry heartily sorry you are a little rough now bertram of course i see that you are so every touch goes against the hair with you every little blow hits you on the raw i can understand that and therefore i do not mind your roughness but we are old friends you know each is perhaps the others oldest friend and i dont mean to lose such a friend because you have a shade of the misanthrope on you just now youll throw the bile off in another essay rather more bitter than the last and then youll be all right  im right enough now thank you only a man cant always be in high spirits at least some men cannot  well god bless you old fellow i know you want me gone so ill go now but never talk to me about my business i do get through a good deal of business but it shall never stand between you and me  and so the cunning legal man went his way  and then there remained the journey to hadley after that it was his purpose to go abroad again to go to paris and live in dingy lodgings there au cinquième to read french freethinking books to study the wild side of politics to learn if he could among french theatres and french morals french freedom of action and freedom of speech and freedom of thoughtfrance was a blessed country for freedom in those days under the paternal monarchy of that paternal monarch louis philippeto learn to forget among these sources of inspiration all that he had known of the sweets of english life  but there remained the journey to hadley it had always been his custom to go to mr pritchett in the city before he went to his uncles house and he did so now everybody who wished to see mr bertram always went to mr pritchett first and mr pritchett would usually send some avantcourier to warn his patron of the invasion  ah mr george said pritchett wheezing with his most melancholy sigh you shouldnt have left the old gentleman so long sir indeed you shouldnt  but he does not want to see me said george  think what a sight of money that is continued pritchett one would really think mr george that you objected to money there is that gentleman your particular friend you know the member of parliament he is down there constantly paying his respects as he calls it  what mr harcourt  yes mr harcourt and he sends grapes in spring and turkeys in summer and green peas in winter  green peas in winter they must cost something  of course they do sprats to catch big fish with mr george and then the old gentleman has got a new lawyer some sharp new light of mr harcourts recommending oh mr george mr george do be careful do now could not you go and buy a few ducks or pigeons and take them in a basket the old gentleman does seem to like that kind of thing though ten years since he was so different half a million of money mr george its worth a few grapes and turkeys and mr pritchett shook his head and wrung his hands for he saw that nothing he said produced any effect  george went to hadley at last without ducks or pigeons grapes or turkeys he was very much amused however with the perpetual industry of his friend labor omnia vincit improbus said he to himself it is possible that harcourt will find my uncles blind side at last  he found the old gentleman considerably changed there were occasionally flashes of his former customary sarcastic pungency now and again he would rouse himself to be illnatured antagonistic and selfwilled but old age and illness had sadly told upon him and he was content for the most part to express his humour by little shrugs shakes of the head and an irritable manner he had lately acquired of rubbing his hands quickly together  well george he said when his nephew shook hands with him and asked after his health  i hope you are better than you were sir i was sorry to hear that you had been again suffering  suffer yes a man looks to suffer when he gets to my age hes a fool if he doesnt at least dont trouble yourself to be sorry about it george  i believe you saw my father not long since bertram said this not quite knowing how to set the conversation going so that he might bring in the tidings he had come there to communicate  yes i did said mr bertram senior and his hands went to work as he sat in the armchair  did you find him much altered since you last met it was a great many years since i believe  not in the least altered your father will never alter  george now knew enough of his fathers character to understand the point of this so he changed the subject and did that which a man who has anything to tell should always do at once he commenced the telling of it forthwith  i have come down here today sir because i think it right to let you know at once that miss waddington and i have agreed that our engagement shall be at an end  mr bertram turned sharp round in his chair what said he what  our engagement is at an end we are both aware that it is better for us it should be so  what do you mean better for you how can it be better for you you are two fools  very likely sir we have been two fools or at any rate i have been one  mr bertram sat still in his chair silent for a few moments he still kept rubbing his hands but in meditation rather than in anger though his back reached to the back of his chair his head was brought forward and leaned almost on his chest his cheeks had fallen in since george had seen him and his jaw hung low and gave a sad thoughtful look to his face in which also there was an expression of considerable pain his nephew saw that what he had said had grieved him and was sorry for it  george he said in a softer voice than had ever been usual with him i wish you to marry caroline go back to her and make it up tell her that i wish it if it be necessary to tell her anything  ah sir i cannot do that i should not have come to you now if there had been any room for doubt  there must be no room for doubt this is nonsense sheer nonsense i shall send to mary george had never before heard him call miss baker by her christian name  it cannot be helped sir miss baker can do nothing in the matter now nor can any one else we both know that the marriage would not suit us  not suit you nonsense two babies two fools i tell you it will suit you it will suit me  now had george bertram junior not been an absolute ass or a mole rather with no eyesight whatever for things above ground he would have seen from this that he might not only have got back his love but have made sure of being his uncles heir into the bargain at any rate there was sufficient in what he said to insure him a very respectable share of those moneybags how would pritchett have rejoiced had he heard the old man speak so and then how would he have sighed and wheezed when he saw the young mans indifference  but george would not take the hint he must have been blind and dull and dead and senseless who before had ever heard mr bertram senior speak out in that way it will suit me and that from an old bachelor with uncountable moneybags to his only nephew and such a request too as it conveyedthat he would again make himself agreeable to a beautiful girl whom he thoroughly loved and by whom also he was thoroughly loved but george was an ass as we have said and a mole a blind mole and a mule a stiffnecked stubborn mule he would not yield an inch to his uncle nor an inch to his own feelings  i am sorry to vex you sir he said coldly but it is impossible  oh very well said the uncle as he compressed his lips and moved his hands very well and so they parted  george went back to town and commenced his preparations for paris but on the following day he received the unwonted honour of a visit from mr pritchett and the honour was very pointed in this wise mr pritchett not finding him at home had gone to a neighbouring tavern to get a bit of dinner as he told the woman at the chambers and stated that he should go on calling till he did find mr george and in this way on his third or fourth visit mr george was found  mr pritchett was dressed in his best and was very sad and solemn mr george said he your uncle wishes to see you at hadley particular  why i was there yesterday  i know you was mr george and thats just it your uncle mr george is an old man and it will be only dutiful you should be with him a good deal now youd wish to be a comfort to your uncle in his last days i know that mr george hes been good to you and youve your duty to do by him now mr george and youll do it so said mr pritchett having thoroughly argued the matter in his own mind and resolved that as mr george was a wilful young horse who would not be driven in one kind of bridle another must be tried with him  but has my uncle sent to say that he wants to see me again at once  he has mr george sent to say that he wants to see you again at once particular  there was nothing of course for mr george to do but to obey seeing that the order was so particular on that same evening therefore he put his dressingthings into a bag and again went down to hadley  on his first arrival his uncle shook hands with him with much more than ordinary kindness and even joked with him  so pritchett came to you did he and sent you down at a moments notice ha ha hes a solemn old prig is pritchett but a good servant a very good servant when i am gone hell have enough to live on but hell want some one to say a word to him now and again dont forget what i say about him its not so easy to find a good servant  george declared that he always had had and would have a regard for mr pritchett though i wish he were not quite so sad  poor pritchett well yes he is sad said the uncle laughing and then george went upstairs to get ready for dinner  the dinner considering the house in which it was spread was quite recherché george said to himself that the fat fowls which he saw must have come from harcourts larder roast mutton and boiled beefnot together but one on one day and the other on the nextgenerally constituted the fare at mr bertrams house when he did not sit down to dinner alone but now there was quite a little banquet during dinner he made sundry efforts to be agreeable pressed his nephew to eat and drank wine with him in the oldfashioned affectionate manner of past days your health george he said youll find that sherry good i think it ought to be if years can make it so  it was good and george was very sorry to find that the good wine had been brought out for him he felt that something would be required in return and that he could not give that something  after dinner that something was soon asked for george said the old man i have been thinking much since you went away the other day about you and caroline i have taken it into my stupid old head to wish that you two should be married  ah sir  now listen to me i do wish it and what you have said has disturbed me now i do believe this of you that you are an honest lad and though you are so fond of your own way i dont think youd wish to grieve me if you could help it  not if i could help it sir not if i could help it certainly  you can help it now listen to me an old man has no right to have his fancies unless he chooses to pay for them i know that well enough i dont want to ask you why you have quarrelled with caroline its about money very likely  no sir no not in the least  well i dont want to inquire a small limited income is very likely to lead to misunderstandings you have at any rate been honest and true to me you are not a bit like your father  sir sir  and andill tell you what ill do caroline is to have six thousand pounds isnt she  pray believe me sir that money has nothing whatever to do with this matter  yes six continued mr bertram four of her own and two from me now ill tell you what ill do let me see you have two hundred a year thats settled on you and you had a thousand pounds the other day is that all gone yet  i am in no want of money uncle none whatever  no not as a bachelor but as a married man you would be now do tell mehow much of that thousand pounds did the colonel get out of you  dear uncle do remember that he is my father  well well two hundred a year and two thousand pounds and one and pritchetts account ill tell you what george i should like to see you comfortable and if you and caroline are married before next october ill give you  i cant tell you how you pain me sir  ill give you i wonder how much income you think youll want  none sir none as our marriage is out of the question we shall want no income as i am and am likely to remain unmarried my present income is sufficient for me  ill give youlet me see and the old miserfor though capable of generosity to a great extent as he had certainly shown with reference to his nephews early years he certainly was a miserthe old miser again recapitulated to himself all that he had already done and tried to calculate at what smallest figure at what lowest amount of ready money to be paid down he could purchase the object which he now desired ill give you four thousand pounds on the day you are married there that will be ten thousand beside your own income and whatever your profession will bring you  what am i to say sir i know how generous you are but this is not an affair of money  what is it then  we should not be happy together  not happy together you shall be happy i tell you you will be happy if you have enough to live on remember i may leave you something more than that when i die that is i may do so if you please me you will understand however that i make no promise  dear uncle said george and as he spoke he rose from his seat and crossing over to his uncle took the old mans hand in his own you shall be asked for no promise you shall be asked for nothing you have been most liberal most kind to me too kind i know for i have not returned it by that attention which you deserved from me but believe me i cannot do as you ask me if you will speak to miss waddington she will tell you the same  miss waddington pshaw  caroline i mean it is impossible sir and it adds greatly to my own sufferingfor i have suffered in all thisthat you also should be grieved  why you were so much in love with her the other day mary told me that you were dying for her  i cannot explain it all but shecarolinedoubtless will however pray pray take this for granted the engagement between us cannot be renewed  old mr bertram still kept his nephews hand and it seemed as though he liked to hold it he continued to look up into georges face as though striving to read there something different from the words which he heard something which might yet give him some consolation he had said that george was honest and he believed it as far as he could believe in honesty but nevertheless he was still meditating at what price he could buy over his nephew to his purpose after such a struggle as that of his whole lifetime could he have any other faith but that money were omnipotent no this of course this necessarily was his belief as to the sufficient quantityon that point it was possible for him to doubt his nephews manner to him was very touching the tone of his voice the look of his countenance the grief which sat on his brow did touch him but they touched him in this manner they made him feel that a few thousands were not sufficient he had at last a desire at his heart a family domestic warm desire and he began to feel that if he were not prepared to give up his desire he must bid high for its fulfilment  george said he after all you and caroline are the nearest relatives i have the nearest and the dearest  caroline is your own childs child sir  she is but a girl and it would all go to some spendthrift whose very name would be different and i dont know but i think i like you better than her look here now according to my present will ninetenths of my property will go to build a hospital that shall bear my name youll not repeat that to anybody will you  no sir i will not  if youll do as i would have you about this marriage ill make a new will and you and your children shall have ill let you say yourself how much you shall have thereand you shall see the will yourself before the wedding takes place  what can i say to him what can i say to him said george turning away his face sir it is quite impossible is not that enough money has nothing to do with it can have nothing to do with it  you dont think id deceive you do you and make another will afterwards it shall be a deed of gift if you like or a settlementto take effect of course after my death on hearing this george turned away his face you shall have half george there by g you shall have half settled on youtherehalf of it settled on you and then only did the uncle drop his nephews hand he dropped it and closing his eyes began to meditate on the tremendous sacrifice he had made  there was something terrible in this to young bertram he had almost ceased to think of himself in watching his uncles struggles it was dreadful to see how terribly anxious the old man was and more dreadful still to witness the nature of the thoughts which were running through his mind he was making lavish tenders of his heaven his god his blessings he was offering to part with his paradise seeing that nature would soon imperatively demand that he should part with it but useless as it must soon be to him he could not bring himself to believe that it was not still allpowerful with others  mr bertram it is clearly necessary that we should understand each other said george with a voice that he intended should be firm but which in truth was stern as well as firm i thought it right to come and tell you that this match was broken off but seeing that that has once been told there is no longer room for further conversation on the matter we have made up our minds to part and having done so i can assure you that money can have no effect upon our resolution  then you want it allall said the uncle almost weeping  not all nor ten times all would move me one inchnot one inch said george in a voice that was now loud and almost angry  mr bertram turned towards the table and buried his face in his hands he did not understand it he did not know whence came all this opposition he could not conceive what was the motive power which caused his nephew thus to thwart and throw him over standing forward as he did with thousands and tens of thousands in his hand but he knew that his request was refused and he felt himself degraded and powerless  do not be angry with me uncle said the nephew  go your own way sir go your own way said the uncle i have done with you i had thoughtbut never mind and he rang the bell violently sarah i will go to bedare my things ready woman is my room ready i say and then he had himself led off and george saw him no more that night  nor did he see him the next morning nor for many a long day afterwards when the morning came he sent in his love with a hope that his uncle was better sarah coming out with a long face told george that his uncle had only muttered between his teeththat it was nothing to himto his nephew namelywhether he were better or worse and so having received this last message he went his way and returned to town     chapter x  does he know it yet   almost immediately after this george bertram did go to paris but before he went he received a letter from arthur wilkinson begging him to go down to hurst staple this was arthurs answer to the letter in which bertram had communicated the last news from littlebath there were not as many words in the letter as there had been in that from adela to caroline but they were much to the same effect this is an important step old fellow very praypray be careful for your own sake and hers i am not good at letterwriting as you know but come down here and talk it over i have other things of my own i want to talk about the spare bedroom is empty that was nearly the whole of it in answer to this bertram had declared his intention of going to paris but had promised to go down to hurst staple as soon as he returned home  at this time the popularity of louis philippe was on the wane the grocers of paris were becoming sick of their paternal citizen king who in spite of his quiet family costume and citizen umbrella seemed to think as much as some other kings of crowds of soldiers of fortifications and war taxes who seemed to think also that freespoken deputies might be judiciously controlled that a paternallyroyal family might be judiciously enriched and that a good many of the old crown tenets and maxims might again be judiciously brought to bear upon the commonwealth poor grocers too much prosperity had made them overnice when mr smith had been about six months gone from them how gladly would they have had him back again  but they are again satisfied the grocer interest which on the whole may perhaps be looked on as predominant in paris is once more swathed in roseleaves the swathings certainly are somewhat tight and roseleaves may be twisted till there is no breaking them but there will still remain the fragrance the potpourri odour which is so delectable to ancient housewives the oily savour of plenteousness if a king can so devise that chocolate shall be soldand paid forwhat more can a grocer interest need what more than this that having sold its daily quantum of chocolate it shall have a theatre to go to a spectacle to look at ices coffee and eau sucrée since the world began to open its young eyes and look about it with any understanding what else has been desirable what does a man and a grocer want panem et circenses soup that shall not be too maigre and a seat at the porte st martin that shall not be too dear is it not all written in that  england a nation of shopkeepers no let us hope not not as yet at any rate there have been nations to whom the buying and selling of bread and honeyespecially of honeyhas been everything lost nationspeople deadened whose souls were ever sleeping whose mouths only and gastric organs attested that life was in them there were such people in the latter days of ancient rome there were such also in that of eastern rome upon the bosphorus rich and thriving people with large mouths and copious bellies wanting merely the salt of life but let us hope that no english people will be such as long as the roads are open to australia to canada and new zealand  a young man whose life was to be spent in writing politicoreligious pamphlets had much to learn in paris in those days indeed paris has ever been a school for such writers since men began to find that something was wrong even under the reign of the great dubarry since those days it has been the laboratory of the political alchemist in which everything hitherto held precious has been reduced to a residuum in order that from the ashes might be created that great arcanum a fitting constitution under which thinking men may live contented the secret had been hardly solved in those latter days of poor louis philippe much had certainly been done when a citizen king was thought of and set agoing but even a citizen king required to be wound up and the alchemist was still at his crucibles  now indeed the work has been finished the laboratory is closed the philosopher his task all done has retired to his needed rest thinking men even thinking frenchmen can live contented chocolate is soldand paid for and a score and a half of daily theatres are open at the most moderate of prices  intent on such things and on his coming volume our young brokenhearted philosopher stayed out three months at paris we need not follow him very closely in his doings there his name was already sufficiently known to secure his admittance amongst those learned men who if they had hitherto established little had at any rate achieved the doubting of much while he was here the british ministry went out of office sir robert having repealed the corn laws fell to the ground between two stools and the number of the daily jupiter which gave the first authentic list of the members of the new government contained among the few new names that were mentioned that of sir henry harcourt as her majestys solicitorgeneral  at the end of the three months bertram returned to england enriched by many new ideas as to the government of mankind in general his volume was not yet finished so he packed up his papers in his portmanteau and took them down with him to hurst staple he saw no one as he passed through london the season was then over and his friend sir henry was refreshing himself with ten days grouseshooting after the successful campaign of the last session but had he been in london bertram would not have seen him for he saw no one he asked no questions about caroline nor any about his uncle he did not even call on his sincere friend pritchett had he done so he would have learned that miss baker and her niece were both staying at hadley he might also have learned other news which however was not long in following him  he went down to hurst staple merely writing a line the day before he started to prepare his friend for his advent but when he reached the vicarage arthur wilkinson was not there he was at oxford but had left word that he was to be summoned home as soon as bertram arrived the ladies however expected him and there would have been nothing for him to remark in the state of the quiet household had there not been another visitor in the house adela gauntlet was staying there and she was dressed in the deepest mourning  the story was soon told to him mr gauntlet had one morning been found dead in his dressingroom the good old man had been full of years and there was nothing frightful in his death but its suddenness but sudden death is always frightful overnight he had been talking to his daughter with his usual quiet very quiet mirth and in the morning she was woke with the news that his spirit had fled his mirth for this world was over his worldly duties were done he had received his daughters last kiss had closed for the last time the book which had been his lifes guide had whispered to heaven his last prayer and his soul was now at rest  there was nothing in this that the world need regard as mournful there was no pain no mental pangs no dire remorse but for adela the suddenness had been very dreadful  among her other miseries had been the great misery of having to seek a home an englishmans house is his castle and a rectors parsonage is as much the rectors castle his own freehold castle as is the earls family mansion that of the earl but it is so with this drawback that the moment the rectors breath is out of his body all right and claim to the castle as regards his estate and family cease instantly if the widow and children remain there one night they remain there on sufferance  adelas future home would now necessarily be with her aunt miss penelope gauntlet but it happened most unfortunately that at the moment of her brothers death miss gauntlet was absent with other relatives in italy nor was her address accurately known her party had been at rome but it was supposed that they had left the holy city before the end of may and now at the end of august when her presence in england was so necessary adela had no more than a faint belief that her aunt was at the baths of lucca in the meantime it was absolutely necessary that she should somewhere find a restingplace for herself  both caroline waddington and miss baker wrote to her at once unfortunately they were at hadley but if adela would come to them they would return to littlebath they or at any rate one of them would do so there was much that was really generous in this offer as will be seen when we come in the next page or two to narrate what had lately occurred at hadley but adela already knew what had occurred and much as she then longed for a home she knew that she could not allow either of them to go to littlebath  immediately that mr gauntlets death was known at hurst stapleand it was known there two hours after adela knew it herselfmrs wilkinson went over to bring her to the vicarage the reader will know that there were reasons why adela should be most unwilling to choose that house as her temporary residence she was most unwilling and for a day or two much to mrs wilkinsons surprise she refused to leave west putford but it was necessary that she should leave it she could not remain alone in the house on the day that her fathers body was carried to his grave and so at last she submitted and allowed herself to be taken over to hurst staple  it is provoking dear said mrs wilkinson to her and i am sure you will think it very uncivil but arthur went off to oxford yesterday and it was uncivil i am sure he needs not have gone at this very moment  then adela felt very grateful to her neighbour and acknowledged in her heart that he had been kind to her  but he must be back on saturday continued the widow for he could get no clergyman to take his duty indeed he has to take the evening service at west putford as well  on the day following this george bertram arrived at the vicarage  his first evening in the house was not very bright mrs wilkinson had never been a bright woman she had certain motherly good qualities which had been exerted in georges favour in his earliest years and on this account she was still able to speak to him in a motherly way she could talk to him about his breakfasts and dinners and ask after his buttons and linen and allude to his bachelor habits and in such conversation the first evening was chiefly passed adela said almost nothing the wilkinson girls who were generally cheerful themselves were depressed by adelas sorrowand depressed also somewhat by what they knew of bertrams affairs on this matter mrs wilkinson was burning to speak but she had made up her mind to leave it in silence for one evening she confined herself therefore to the button question and to certain allusions to her own griefs it appeared that she was not quite so happy with reference to arthur as one would have wished her to be she did not absolutely speak against him but she said little snubbing things of him and seemed to think him by no means sufficiently grateful for all the care she took of him  that night in the privacy of adelas own room something was said about george bertram i am sure he does not know it yet said sophia  caroline told me she would write to him said adela she would be very wrong not to do sovery wrong  you may be sure he has not heard it repeated the other did you not observe the way he spoke of mr harcourt  sir henry harcourt said mary  i did not hear it said adela  oh he did speak of him he said something about his great good fortune he never would have spoken in that way had he known it  do you know said mary i do not think he would have come down here had he heard itnot yet at least  the next morning two letters were laid before george bertram as they were sitting at breakfast then he did know it then he did learn it and not till then it was now the end of august and in the coming month of novemberabout the end of novembersir henry harcourt her majestys solicitorgeneral and member for the battersea hamlets was to lead to the hymeneal altar miss caroline waddington the granddaughter and presumed heiress of the great millionaire mr bertram who so high now on the ladder of fortune as the fortunate sir henry harcourt in love and politics and the realms of plutus he carried all before him yes sir henry harcourt was the coming man quidnuncs at the clubs began to say that he would give up the legal side of politics and devote himself to statesmanship he would be the very man for a home secretary old bertram they observed was known to be dying old bertram they also observed had made a distinct promise to sir henry and his granddaughter the marriage was to take place at hadley from the old mans house the old man was delighted with the match c c c who so happy who so great who so fortunate as sir henry harcourt  that habit of bringing in letters at the breakfasttable has its good points certainly it is well that one should have ones letters before the work or pleasure of the day commences it is well to be able to discuss the different little subjects of mutual interest as they are mentioned elizas baby has got her first tooth its all right theres nothing like daffys elixir after all my dear the guano will be here today so the horses will be wanted all the weekremember that what a bore papa for heres a letter to say that kate carnabies coming and we must go over to the poldoodles frank poldoodle is quite smitten with kate this is all very convenient but the plan has its drawbacks some letters will be in their nature black and browcompelling tidings will come from time to time at which men cannot smile there will be news that ruffles the sweetest temper and at receipt of which clouds will darken the most kindly face one would fain receive such letters in private  two such letters bertram received that morning and read while the eyes of the parsonage breakfasttable werenot fixed on him but which under such circumstances is much worsewere purposely turned away he knew well the handwriting of each and would fain have escaped with them from the room but this he felt to be cowardly and so he read them both sitting there in the family circle they were from caroline and sir henry we will give precedence to the lady but bertram did not so read them the ladys letter was the most trying to his nerves and was therefore taken the last it can hardly be said that their contents surprised him when they both came into his hands together he seemed to feel by intuition what was the news which they contained that from caroline was very fairly written but how many times had it been rewritten before that fair copy was prepared      hadley august 184     my dear mr bertram     i do not know whether i am right in thinking that i ought    myself to tell you of the step which i am going to take    if it is unnecessary i know you will forgive me and will    be certain that i have intended to do what is right sir    henry harcourt has proposed to me and i have accepted    him i believe we shall be married some time before    christmas     we are staying here with grandpapa i think he approves    of what i am doing but you know that he is not very    communicative at any rate i shall be married from this    house and i think that he likes sir henry aunt mary is    reconciled to all this now     i do not know that i need say any more excepting that    i shall alwaysalways hope for your welfare and be so    happy if i can hear of your happiness i pray you also to    forgive me what injuries i may have done you     it may be that at some future time we shall meet as    friends in london i hope we may it is a comfort to me    that sir henry harcourt knows exactly all that there has    been between us     believe me to be    yours most sincerely     caroline waddington   harcourts letter was written in faster style and a more running hand solicitorsgeneral have hardly time to stop and pick their words but though the manner of it was free and easy it seemed to bertram that the freedom and easiness were but affected      my dear bertram     i hope and trust that the news i have to tell you will    be no interruption to our friendship i am sure that it    should not be seeing that i am doing you no injury    caroline waddington and i have agreed to put our fortunes    into the same boat we shall feel much more comfortable on    the seas if you will be gracious enough to say god save    the bark     caroline has of course told me all that has occurred as    indeed you had done previously as far as i am concerned    i must say she has behaved gloriously i always admired    her greatly as you know though of course till lately i    never thought it possible i should possess what i so much    admired     speaking plainly i think that she will be happier with    me than she would have been with you and that i shall be    happier with her than you would have been we are better    adapted to each other there is a dash of worldliness    about us both from which your more ethereal composition is    happily free     god bless you old fellow pray write a line in answer    saying as much to me of course you will let us see you    in london caroline wishes it particularly and so do i     i believe i shall be turned off in december such a    millhorse as i am cannot choose my time i am going to    scotland for ten days and shall then be hard at work till    our marriage i must of course be back when the session    commences we talk of going to nice and thence to genoa     the old gentleman is very civil but there has been no    word of money nor will there be a word however thank    god i dont want it     always your sincerest friend     henry harcourt     reform clubaugust 184   these letters did not take long in the reading within five minutes bertram was spreading the butter on his toast and within two minutes more he was asking what news there was from arthurwhen would he be home he had received a great blow a stunning blow but he was able to postpone the faintness which would follow it till he should be where no eye could see him  the breakfast passed away very silently they all knew what those two letters contained one of the girls had had them in her hand and had known the handwriting of one and guessed that of the other but even without this they would have known are not most of our innermost secrets known to all the world  and then bertram skulked offor endeavoured rather to do so for mrs wilkinson detected him in the act and stopped him she had said nothing hitherto about his matrimonial or nonmatrimonial affairs she had abstained with wonderful discretion and she now intended that her discretion should be rewarded  george george she said as he turned from the breakfastparlour door to the rack in the hall on which his hat was hanging i want you just for a minute so george returned into the parlour as the girls passed across the hall into the drawingroom  im afraid youll think me unkind because ive said nothing about this sad affair of yours  not at all aunt he said though she was no aunt of his he had always called her so when he had been at hurst staple as a child there are some things which had perhaps better not be talked about mrs wilkinson however was not the woman to be deterred by such a faint repulse as this  exactly so except among intimate family friends but i was very sorry to hear about your breaking off the affair with caroline waddington i was indeed very it would have been so suitable as regards the old gentlemani know all about that you know and the lady nodded her head as ladies will do sometimes when they flatter themselves that they know more about such things than their neighbours  it was necessary said bertram  necessaryah yes i dare say i dont in the least mean to blame you george i am sure you would not behave badly to any girland from what i have heard i am quite surequite sure it was not your fault indeed i know very well and in lieu of finishing her speech mrs wilkinson again nodded her head  nobody was to blame aunt nobody and it is much better to say nothing about it  that is very good of you george very but i always shall say  dear aunt pray say nothing we had thought when we knew little of each other that it would suit us to live together as we learnt each others characters more thoroughly we found that we had been wrong it was better for us therefore to part and we did part  and so now she is going to be lady harcourt  yes it seems so  well at any rate we must all say this she hasnt lost any time i dont know what sir henry may think of it but it certainly does seem to me  dear aunt pray do not talk to me about this i think miss waddington quite right to accept sir henry harcourt that is i think her right under the circumstances he is a rising man and she will grace any station in which he can place her i do not at all blame her not in the least it would be monstrous if i did  oh of coursewe all know that it was you broke off the other match all the world knows that but what i want to speak about is this the old gentlemans money george now sir henry of course is looking to that  he has my permission  and of course he will get some of it thats to be expectedshes his grandchildof course i know that and mrs wilkinson again nodded her head but george you must look very close after the old gentleman it wont at all do to let harcourt cut you out altogether i do hope you mean to be a good deal down at hadley it wont last for long you know  bertram would not condescend to explain to mrs wilkinson that he had no intention of going near his uncle again and that he was sick of the very name of the old mans money so he hummed and hawed and changed the conversation by saying that he should be so glad to see arthur on his return  yes i am sure you will but youll find arthur much changedvery much and it was clear from the tone of mrs wilkinsons voice that she did not think that this change in her son was for the better  he is growing older i suppose like the rest of us said bertram attempting to laugh  oh yes hes growing older of course but people should grow better george and more contented particularly when they have everything about them that they can possibly want  is not arthur contented he should get married then look at adela gauntlet there  nonsense george pray dont put that into his head what has he to marry on and as for adela if she has fifteen hundred pounds it will be every farthing and whats that for a family  but arthur has a living  now george dont you be talking in that way to him in one sense he has a living for situated as things at present are of course i cannot hold it in my own hands but in real truth he has not a livingnot of his own lord stapledean whom i shall always regard as the very first nobleman in the land and a credit to the whole peerage expressly gave the living to me  to you aunt  yes expressly to me and now i fear arthur is discontented because he knows that i choose to remain mistress of my own house i have done everything i can to make the house pleasant to him he has the same study his dear father always had and he has his own separate horse in the stable which is more than his father had  but arthur has his fellowship  and where would his fellowship be if he married adela gauntlet i do hope youll say something to him to make him more contented i say nothing about his conduct to me i dont suppose he means to be undutiful  and then bertram did manage to escape and taking his hat he walked away along that same riverpath which led to west putfordthat same path which arthur wilkinson had used to take when he went fishing in those happy early days before promotion had come to him and the glories of manhood  but george was not thinking now of arthur or of adela he had enough of sorrow in his own breast to make his mind selfish for the presentcaroline waddington was to be married to be married so soon after getting quit of her former bondage to be married to henry harcourt there was no chance left now no hope no possibility that he might regain the rich prize which he had flung away  and did he wish to regain it was it not now clear enough that she had never loved him in may while the fruits were filling they had separated and now before they were well ripe she had given herself to another love him no indeed was it possible that she should love any manthat she who could so redeem herself and so bestow herself should have any heart any true feeling of what love is  and yet this was not the worst of it such love as she had to give had she not given it to this harcourt even before she had rescued herself from her former lover had she not given this man her preference such preference as she had to give then then when she was discussing with him how best to delay her nuptials with her acknowledged suitor this successful noisy pushing worldly man had won her by his success and his worldliness the glitter of the gold had caught her and so she had been unhappy and had pined and worn herself with grief till she could break away from her honest troth and bind herself to the horn of the golden calf  twas thus that he now thought of her thus that he spoke of her to himself out loud now that he could wander alone with no eye to watch him no ear to hear him and yet he loved her with a strong love with a mad passion such as he had never felt before much as he blamed her thoroughly as he despised her for being so venal yet he blamed nay scorned himself more vehemently in that he had let this plausible knave with his silken words rob from him the only treasure worth his having why had he not toiled why had he not made a name for himself why had he not built a throne on which his ladylove might sit and shine before the world     chapter xi  hurst staple   the next three or four days passed by heavily enough and then arthur wilkinson returned he returned on a saturday evening as clergymen always do so as to be ready for their great day of work there are no sabbathbreakers to be compared in the vehemence of their sabbathbreaking to hardworked parochial clergymenunless indeed it be sundayschool children who are forced on that day to learn long dark collects and stand in dread catechismal row before their spiritual pastors and masters  in the first evening there was that flow of friendship which always exists for the few first hours of meeting between men who are really fond of each other and these men were fond of each other the fonder perhaps because each of them had now cause for sorrow very little was said between arthur and adela there was not apparently much to alarm the widow in their mutual manner or to make her think that miss gauntlet was to be put in her place adela sat among the other girls taking even less share in the conversation than they did and arthur though he talked as became the master of the house talked but little to her  on the following morning they all went to church of course who has courage to remain away from church when staying at the clergymans house no one ever unless it be the clergymans wife or perhaps an independent selfwilled daughter at hurst staple however on this sunday they all attended adela was in deepest mourning her thick black veil was down so as to hide her tears the last sunday she had been at church her father had preached his last sermon  bertram as he entered the door could not but remember how long it was since he had joined in public worship months and months had passed over him since he had allowed himself to be told that the scriptures moved him in sundry places to acknowledge and confess his sins and yet there had been a time when he had earnestly poured forth his frequent prayers to heaven a time not long removed it was as yet hardly more than three years since he had sworn within himself on the brow of olivet to devote himself to the service of his saviour why had that oath been broken a girl had ridiculed it a young girl had dissipated all that by the sheen of her beauty by the sparkle of her eye by the laughter of her ruddy lip he had promised himself to his god but the rustling of silks had betrayed his heart at her instance at her first word that promise had been whistled down the wind  and to what had this brought him now as for the bright eyes and the flashing beauty and the ruddy lips they were made over in feesimple to another who was ready to go further than he had gone in seeking this worlds vanities even the price of his apostasy had vanished from him  but was this all was this nearly all was this as anything to that further misery which had come upon him where was his faith now his true youthful ardent faith the belief of his inner heart the conviction of a god and a saviour which had once been to him the source of joy had it all vanished when under the walls of jerusalem over against that very garden of gethsemane he had exchanged the aspirations of his soul for the pressure of a soft white hand  no one becomes an infidel at once a man who has really believed does not lose by a sudden blow the firm convictions of his soul but when the work has been once commenced when the first step has been taken the pace becomes frightfully fast three years since his belief had been like the ardour of young love and now what were his feelings men said that he was an infidel but he would himself deny it with a frigid precision with the stiffest accuracy of language and then argue that his acknowledgment of a superhuman creative power was not infidelity he had a god of his own a cold passionless prudent god the same god he said to whom others looked with this only difference that when others looked with fanatic enthusiasm he looked with wellbalanced reason but it was the same god he said and as to the saviour he had a good deal also to say on that subject a good deal which might show that he was not so far from others as others thought and so he would prove that he was no infidel  but could he thus satisfy himself now that he again heard the psalms of his youth and remembered as he listened that he had lost for ever that beauty which had cost him so dear did he not now begin to thinkto feel perhaps rather than to thinkthat after all the sound of the church bells was cheering that it was sweet to kneel there where others knelt sweet to hear the voices of those young children as they uttered together the responses of the service was he so much wiser than others that he could venture on his own judgment to set himself apart and to throw over as useless all that was to others so precious  such were his feelings as he sat and knelt and stood theremechanically as it were remembering the old habits and then he tried to pray but praying is by no means the easiest work to which a man can set himself kneeling is easy the repetition of the wellknown word is easy the putting on of some solemnity of mind is perhaps not difficult but to remember what you are asking why you are asking of whom you are asking to feel sure that you want what you do ask and that this asking is the best way to get itthat on the whole is not easy on this occasion bertram probably found it utterly beyond his capacity  he declined to go to afternoon church this is not held to be de rigueur even in a parsons house unless it be among certain of the strictly lowchurch clergymen a very high churchman may ask you to attend at four oclock of a winter morning but he will not be grievously offended if on a sunday afternoon you prefer your armchair and bookprobably of sermons but that is between you and your conscience  they dined early and in the evening bertram and his host walked out hitherto they had had but little opportunity of conversation and bertram longed to talk to some one of what was within his breast on this occasion however he failed conversation will not always go exactly as one would have it  i was glad to see you at church today said the parson to tell you the truth i did not expect it i hope it was not intended as a compliment to me  i rather fear it was arthur  you mean that you went because you did not like to displease us by staying away  something like it said bertram affecting to laugh i do not want your mother and sisters or you either to regard me as an ogre in england at any rate in the country in england one is an ogre if one doesnt go to church it does not much matter i believe what one does when one is there so long as one is quiet and lets the parson have his say  there is nothing so easy as ridicule especially in matters of religion  quite true but then it is again true that it is very hard to laugh at anything that is not in some point ridiculous  and gods worship is ridiculous  no but any pretence of worshipping god is so and as it is but a step from the ridiculous to the sublime and as the true worship of god is probably the highest sublimity to which man can reach so perhaps is he never so absolutely absurd in such a bathos of the ridiculous as when he pretends to do so  every effort must sometimes fall short of success  ill explain what i mean said bertram attending more to himself than his companion what idea of man can be so magnificent as that which represents him with his hands closed and his eyes turned to that heaven with which he holds communion but imagine the man so placed and holding no such communion you will at once have run down the whole gamut of humanity from st paul to pecksniff  but that has nothing to do with belief it is for the man to take care that he be if possible nearer to st paul than to pecksniff  no it has nothing to do with belief but it is a gauge the only gauge we have of what belief a man has how many of those who were sitting by silently while you preached really believed  all i hope all i trust i firmly trust that they are all believers all including yourself  i wonder whether there was one one believer in all that which you called on us to say that we believed one for instance who believes in the communion of saints one who believes in the resurrection of the body  and why should they not believe in the communion of saints whats the difficulty  very little certainly as their belief goeswhat they and you call belief rumtunshid gara shushabad gerostophat that is the shibboleth of some of the caucasian tribes do you believe in rumtunshid  if you will talk gibberish when talking on such a matter i had rather change the subject  now you are unreasonable and want to have all the gibberish to yourself that you should have it all to yourself in your own pulpit we accede to you but out here on the heath surely i may have my turn you do not believe in rumtunshid then why should farmer buttercup be called on to believe in the communion of the saints what does he believe about it or why should you make little flora buttercup tell such a huge fib as to say that she believes in the resurrection of the body  it is taught her as a necessary lesson and will be explained to her at the proper age  no there is no proper age for it it will never be explained to her neither flora nor her father will ever understand anything about it but they will always believe it am i old enough to understand it explain it to me no one yet has ever attempted to do so and yet my education was not neglected  wilkinson had too great a fear of his friends powers of ridicule to venture on an explanation so he again suggested that they should change the subject  that is always the way said bertram i never knew a clergyman who did not want to change the subject when that subject is the one on which he should be ever willing to speak  if there be anything that you deem holy you would not be willing to hear it ridiculed  there is much that i deem holy and for that i fear no laughter i am ready to defy ridicule but if i talk to you of the asceticism of stylites and tell you that i admire it and will imitate it will you not then laugh at me of course we ridicule what we think is false but ridicule will run off truth like water from a ducks back come explain to me this about the resurrection of the body  yet in my flesh shall i see god said arthur in a solemn tone  but i say no it is impossible  nothing is impossible with god  yes it is impossible that his own great laws should change it is impossible that they should remain and yet not remain your bodythat which we all call our bodythat which flora buttercup believes to be her body for in this matter she does believe will turn itself through the prolific chemistry of nature into various productive gases by which other bodies will be formed with which body will you see christ with that which you now carry or that you will carry when you die for of course every atom of your body changes  it little matters which it is sufficient for me to believe as the scriptures teach me  yes if one could believe a jew when he drags his dying limbs to the valley of jehoshaphat he can believe he in his darkness knows nothing of these laws of nature but we will go to people who are not in darkness if i ask your mother what she means when she saysnot by confusion of substance but by unity of person what will she answer me  it is a subject which it will take her some time to explain  yes i think so and me some time longer to understand  wilkinson was determined not to be led into argument and so he remained silent bertram was also silent for awhile and they walked on each content with his own thoughts but yet not content wilkinson would have been contented to be let alone to have his mind and faith and hopes left in the repose which nature and education had prepared for them but it was not so with bertram he was angry with himself for not believing and angry with others that they did believe they went on in this way for some ten minutes and then bertram began again  ah that i could believe if it were a thing to come at as a man wishes who would doubt but you you the priest the teacher of the people you who should make it all so easy you will make it so difficult so impossible belief at any rate should be easy though practice may be hard  you should look to the bible not to us  yes it is there that is our stumblingblock a book is given to us not over well translated from various languages part of which is history hyperbolically toldfor all eastern language is hyperbolical part of which is prophecy the very meaning of which is lost to us by the loss of those things which are intended to be imaged out and part of which is thanksgiving uttered in the language of men who knew nothing and could understand nothing of those rules by which we are to be governed  you are talking of the old testament  it is given to us as one whole then we have the story of a mystery which is above or at least beyond the utmost stretch of mans comprehension and the very purport of which is opposed to all our ideas of justice in the jurisprudence of heaven can that be just which here on earth is manifestly unjust  is your faith in god so weak then and your reliance on yourself so firm that you can believe nothing beyond your own comprehension  i believe much that i do not understand i believe the distance of the earth from the sun i believe that the seed of a man is carried in a woman and then brought forth to light a living being i do not understand the principle of this wondrous growth but yet i believe it and know that it is from god but i cannot believe that evil is good i cannot believe that man placed here by god shall receive or not receive future happiness as he may chance to agree or not to agree with certain doctors who somewhere about the fourth century or perhaps later had themselves so much difficulty in coming to any agreement on the disputed subject  i think bertram that you are going into matters which you know are not vital to faith in the christian religion  what is vital and what is not if i could only learn that but you always argue in a circle i am to have faith because of the bible but i am to take the bible through faith whence is the first spring of my faith to come where shall i find the fountainhead  in prayer to god  but can i pray without faith did any man ever kneel before a log and ask the log that he might believe in the log had he no faith in the log could it be possible that he should be seen there kneeling before it  has the bible then for you no intrinsic evidence of its truth  yes most irrefragable evidence evidence that no thinking man can possibly reject christs teaching the words that i have there as coming from his mouth are irresistible evidence of his fitness to teach but you will permit me to use no such evidence i must take it all from the beginning of my career before i can look into its intrinsic truth and it must be all true to me the sun standing still upon gibeon no less than the divine wisdom which showed that cæsars tribute should be paid to cæsar  if every man and every child is to select how shall we ever have a creed and if no creed how shall we have a church  and if no church how then parsons follow it on and it comes to that but in truth you require too much and so you getnothing your flocks do not believe do not pray do not listen to you they are not in earnest in earnest heavens if a man could believe all this could be in earnest about it how possibly could he care for other things but no you pride yourselves on faith but you have no faith there is no such thing left in these days men do not know what faith is  in the evening when the ladies had gone to their rooms they were again together and bertram thought that he would speak of caroline but he was again foiled there had been some little bickering on the part of mrs wilkinson she had been querulous and had not cared to hide it though george and adela were sitting there as guests this had made her son unhappy and he now spoke of it  i am sorry you should hear my mother speak in that way george i hope i am not harsh to her i try to refrain from answering her but unless i go back to my round jackets and take my food from her hand like a child i cannot please her  perhaps you are too careful to please her i think you should let her know that to a certain extent you must be master in your own house  ah i have given that up long since she has an idea that the house is hers i do not care to thwart her in that perhaps i should have done it at first but it is too late now tonight she was angry with me because i would not read a sermon  and why then didnt you  i have preached two today and the young clergyman yawned somewhat wearily she used to read them herself i did put a stop to that  why so why not let her read them  the girls used to go to sleep alwaysand then the servants slept also i dont think she has a good voice for sermons but i am sure of this georgeshe has never forgiven me  and never will  sometimes i almost think she would wish to take my place in the pulpit  the wish is not at all unnatural my dear fellow  the truth is that lord stapledeans message to her and his conduct about the living has quite upset her i cannot blame lord stapledean what he did was certainly kind but i do blame myself i never should have accepted the living on those termsnever never i knew it when i did it and i have never since ceased to repent it and so saying he got up and walked quickly about the room would you believe it now my mother takes upon herself to tell me in what way i should read the absolution and feels herself injured because i do not comply  i can tell you but of one remedy arthur but i can tell you of one  what remedy  take a wife to yourself one who will not mind in what way you read the absolution to her  a wife said wilkinson and he uttered a long sigh as he continued his walk  yes a wife why not people say that a country clergyman should never be without a wife and as for myself i firmly think that they are right  every curate is to marry then  but you are not a curate  i should only have the income of a curate and where should i put a wife the house is full of women already who would come to such a house as this  there is adela would not she come if you asked her  adela said the young vicar and now his walk had brought him to the further end of the table and there he remained for a minute or two adela  yes adela said bertram  what a life my mother would lead her she is fond of her now very but in that case i know that she would hate her  if i were you i would make my wife the mistress of my house not my mother  ah you do not understand george  but perhaps you do not like adelaperhaps you could not teach yourself to love her  perhaps not said wilkinson and perhaps she could not teach herself to like me but ah that is out of the question  there is nothing between you and adela then asked bertram  oh no nothing  on your honour nothing  nothing at all it is quite out of the question my marrying indeed  and then they took their bedroom candlesticks and went to their own rooms     chapter xii  the wounded doe   it was a weary melancholy household just then that of hurst staple and one may almost wonder that bertram should have remained there but still he did remain he had been there a fortnight when he learnt that in three days time adela was to go to littlebath she was to go down with miss baker and was to remain there with her or with miss todd if miss baker should go back to hadley till her own aunt should have returned  i dont know why you should be in such a hurry to get to littlebath said mrs wilkinson we have been very glad to have you and i hope we have shown it as arthur had evinced no symptoms of making love to miss gauntlet the good lady had been satisfied and now she felt somewhat slighted that her hospitality was not more valued  but adela explained in her own soft manner that it would be better for her to leave that neighbourhood that her heart was sore there that her sorrow for her father would be lighter if she were away what hypocrites women are even ophelia in her madness would pretend that she raved for her murdered father when it was patent to all the world that she was mad for love for hamlet and now adela must leave hurst staple because forsooth her poor old father lay buried at west putford would not ten words have quieted that ghost for ever but then what is the use of a ladys speech but to conceal her thoughts  bertram had spoken to arthur about carolines marriage but he had as yet said no word on the subject to any one else mrs wilkinson had tried him once or twice but in vain he could not bare his bosom to mrs wilkinson  so you are going adela he said the morning he had heard the news they had all called her adela in that house and he had learned to do as others did these intimacies will sometimes grow up in five days though an acquaintance of twenty years will often not produce them  yes mr bertram i have been a great trouble to them here and it is time that i should be gone  welcome the coming speed the parting guest had i a house i should endeavour to act on that principle i would never endeavour to keep a person who wished to go but we shall all regret you and then littlebath is not the place for you you will never be happy at littlebath  why not  oh it is a wretched place full of horsejockeys and hagsof cardtables and false hair  i shall have nothing to do with the cardtables and i hope not with the false hairnor yet much i suppose with the horsejockeys  there will still remain the worst of the four curses  mr bertram how can you be so evilminded i have had many happy days at littlebath and then she paused for she remembered that her happy days there had all been passed with caroline waddington  yes and i also have had happy days there said he very happy and i am sure of thisthat they would have been happy still but for the influence of that wretched place  adela could make no answer to this at the moment so she went on hemming at her collar then after a pause she said i hope it will have no evil influence on me  i hope noti hope not but you are beyond such influences it seems to me if i may say so that you are beyond all influences  yes as a fool is she said laughing  no but as a rock is i will not say as ice for ice will always melt  and do i never melt mr bertram has that which has made you so unhappy not moved me do you think that i can love caroline as i do and not grieve and weep and groan in the spirit i do grieve i have wept for it i am not stone  and in this also there had been some craft she had been as it were forced to guard the thoughts of her own heart and had therefore turned the river of the conversation right through the heart of her companion  for whom do you weep for which of us do you weep he asked  for both that having so much to enjoy you should between you have thrown it all away  she will be happy that at any rate is a consolation to me though you will hardly believe that  i hope she will i hope she will but oh mr bertram it is so fearful a risk whatwhat if she should not be what if she shall find when the time will be too late for finding anythingwhat if she shall then find that she cannot love him  love him said the other with a sneer you do not know her what need is there for love  ah do not be harsh to her do not you be harsh to her  harsh no i will not be harsh to her i will be all kindness and being kind i ask what need is there for love looking at it in any light of course she cannot love him  cannot love him why not  how is it possible had she loved me could she have shaken off one lover and taken up another in two months and if she never loved me if for three years she could go on never loving methen what reason is there to think she should want such excitement now  but youcould you love her and yet cast her from you  yes i could do it i did do itand were it to do again it should be done again i did love her if i know what love is if i can at all understand it i did love her with all my heart and yeti will not say i cast her off it would be unmanly as well as false but i let her go  ah you did more than that mr bertram  i gave her back her troth and she accepted itas it was her duty to do seeing that her wishes were then changed i did no more than that  women mr bertram well know that when married they must sometimes bear a sharp word but the sharp word before marriage that is very hard to be borne  i measure my words but why should i defend myself of course your verdict will be on your friends side i should hate you if it were not so but oh adela if i have sinned i have been punished i have been punished heavily indeed indeed i have been punished and sitting down he bowed himself on the table and hid his face within his hands  this was in the drawingroom and before adela could venture to speak to him again one of the girls came into the room  adela said she we are waiting for you to go down to the school  i am coming directly said adela jumping up and still hoping that mary would go on so as to leave her one moment alone with bertram but mary showed no sign of moving without her friend instead of doing so she asked her cousin whether he had a headache  not at all said he looking up but i am half asleep this hurst staple is a sleepy place i think wheres arthur  hes in the study  well ill go into the study also one can always sleep there without being disturbed  youre very civil master george and then adela followed her friend down to the school  but she could not rest while the matter stood in this way she felt that she had been both harsh and unjust to bertram she knew that the fault had been with caroline and yet she had allowed herself to speak of it as though he and he only had been to blame she felt moreover an expressible tenderness for his sorrow when he declared how cruel was his punishment she could willingly have given him the sympathy of her tears for were not their cases in many points the same  she was determined to see him again before she went and to tell him that she acquitted himthat she knew the greater fault was not with him this in itself would not comfort him but she would endeavour so to put it that he might draw comfort from it  i must see you for a moment alone before i go she said to him that evening in the drawingroom i go very early on thursday morning when can i speak to you you are never up early i know  but i will be tomorrow will you be afraid to come out with me before breakfast  oh no she would not be at all afraid she said and so the appointment was made  i know youll think me very foolish for giving this trouble she began in rather a confused way and making so much about nothing  no man thinks there is much ado about nothing when the ado is about himself said bertram laughing  well but i know it is foolish but i was unjust to you yesterday and i could not leave you without confessing it  how unjust adela  i said you had cast caroline off  ah no i certainly did not do that  she wrote to me and told me everything she wrote very truly i know and she did not say a wordnot a word against you  did she not wellnoi know she would not and remember this adela i do not say a word against her do tell her not from me you know but of your own observation that i do not say one word against her i only say she did not love me  ah mr bertram  that is all and that is true adela i have not much to give but i would give it allalleverything to have her backto have her back as i used to think her but if i could have her nowas i know her nowby raising this hand i would not take her but this imputes no blame to her she tried to love me but she could not  ah she did love you  never he almost shouted as he said this and as he did so he stood across his companions path never she never loved me i know it now what poor vile wretches we are it is this i think that most torments me  and then they walked on adela had come there expressly to speak to him but now she was almost afraid to speak her heart had been full of what it would utter but now all utterance seemed to have left her she had intended to console but she did not dare to attempt it there was a depth almost a sublimity about his grief which kept her silent  oh adela he said if you knew what it is to have an empty heartor rather a heart not emptythat would fain be empty that you might again refill it dear adela and he put out his hand to take her own she hardly knew why but she let him take her hand dear adela have you never sighed for the comfort of an empty heart you probe my wounds to the bottom may i not search your own  she did not answer him was it possible that she should answer such a question her eyes became suffused with tears and she was unable to raise them from the ground she could not recall her handnot at that moment she had come there to lecture him to talk to him to comfort him and now she was unable to say a word did he know the secret of her heart that secret which once and but once had involuntarily broken from out her lips had caroline told him had she been so false to friendshipas false to friendship as she had been to love  adela adela i would that we had met earlier in our lives yes you and i these last words he added after she had quickly rescued her hand from his grasp very quickly she withdrew it now as quickly she lifted up her face all covered as it was with tears and endured the full weight of his gaze what was it possible that he knew how she had loved and thought that her love had been for him  yes you and i he continued even though your eyes flash upon me so sternly you mean to say that had it been ever so early that prize would have been impossible for me speak out adela that is what you mean  yes it would have been impossible impossible every way impossible that is on both sides  then you have not that empty heart adela what else should make it impossible  mr bertram when i came here i had no wish no intention to talk about myself  why not of yourself as well as of me i say again i would we had both met earlier it might have been that i should have been saved from this shipwreck i will speak openly to you adela why not he added seeing that she shrunk from him and seemed as though she would move on quicklyaway from his words  mr bertram do not say that which it will be useless for you to have said  it shall not be useless you are my friend and friends should understand each other you know how i have loved caroline you believe that i have loved her do you not  oh yes i do believe that  well you may that at any rate is true i have loved her she will now be that mans property and i must love her no longer  no not with that sort of love  that sort are there two sorts on which a man may run the changes as he may from one room to another i must wipe her out of my mindout of my heartor burn her out i would not wish to love anything that he possesses  no said she not his wife  wife she will never be his wife she will never be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh as i would have made her it will be but a partnership between them to be dissolved when they have made the most of their worlds trading  if you love her mr bertram do not be so bitter in speaking of her  bitter i tell you that i think her quite right in what she does if a woman cannot love what better can she do than trade upon her beauty but there let her go i did not wish to speak of her  i was very wrong in asking you to walk with me this morning  no adela not wrong but very very right there well i will not ask you for your hand again though it was but in friendship  in friendship i will give it you and she stretched out her hand to him it was ungloved and very white and fair a prettier hand than even caroline could boast  i must not take it i must not lie to you adela i am brokenhearted i have loved i have loved that woman with all my heart with my very soul with the utmost strength of my whole beingand now it has come to this if i know what a broken heart means i have it here but yetyetyet oh adela i would fain try yet once again i can do nothing for myself nothing if the world were there at my feet wealth power glory to be had for the stooping i would not stoop to pick them if i could not share them witha friend adela it is so sad to be alone  yes it is sad is not sadness the lot of many of us  yes but nature bids us seek a cure when a cure is possible  i do not know what you wish me to understand mr bertram  yes adela you do i think you do i think i am honest and open at any rate i strive to be so i think you do understand me  if i do then the cure which you seek is impossible  ah  is impossible  you are not angry with me  angry no not angry  and do not be angry now if i speak openly again i thoughti thought but i fear that i shall pain you  i do not care for pain if any good can come of it  i thought that you also had been wounded in the woods the stricken harts lie down together and lick each others wounds while the herd roams far away from them  is it so why do we hear then of the poor sequestered stag left and abandoned of his velvet friend no mr bertram grief i fear must still be solitary  and so unendurable  god still tempers the wind to the shorn lamb now as he has ever done but there is no sudden cure for these evils the time will come when all this will be remembered not without sorrow but with a calm quiet mourning that will be endurable when your heart now not broken as you say but tortured will be able to receive other images but that time cannot come at once nor i think is it well that we should wish it those who have courage to love should have courage to suffer  yes yes yes but if the courage be wanting if one have it not one cannot have such courage for the asking  the first weight of the blow will stun the sufferer i know that mr bertram but that dull dead deathly feeling will wear off at last you have but to work to read to write to study in that respect you men are more fortunate than we are you have that which must occupy your thoughts  and you adela  do not speak of me if you are generous you will not do so if i have in any way seemed to speak of myself it is because you have made it unavoidable what god has given me to bear is bearablethough i would that he could have spared my poor father and so saying adela at last gave way to tears on that subject she might be allowed to weep  bertram said nothing to disturb her till they were near the house and then he again held out his hand to her as a true friend i hope as a dear friend is it not so said he  yes she answered in her lowest voice as a dear friend but remember that i expect a friends generosity and a friends forbearance and so she made her way back to her own room and appeared at breakfast in her usual sober guise but with eyes that told no tales  on the next morning she took her departure the nearest station on the railway by which she was to go to littlebath was distant about twelve miles and it was proposed that she should be sent thither in mrs wilkinsons phaëton this indeed except the farmyard cart was the only vehicle which belonged to the parsonage and was a low fourwheeled carriage not very well contrived for the accommodation of two moderatesized people in front and of two immoderatelysmall people on the hind seat mrs wilkinson habitually drove it herself with one of her daughters beside her and with two othersthose two whose legs had been found by measurement to be the shortestin durance vile behind but when so packed it was clear to all men that the capacity of the phaëton was exhausted now the first arrangement proposed was that arthur should drive the phaëton and that sophy should accompany adela to the station but sophy in so arranging had forgotten that her friend had a bag a trunk and a bonnetbox the presence of which at littlebath would be indispensable and therefore at the last moment when the phaëton came to the door with the luggage fastened on the hinder seat it was discovered for the first time that sophy must be left behind  arthur wilkinson would willingly have given up his position and george bertram would willingly have taken it adela also would have been well pleased at such a change but though all would have been pleased it could not be effected the vicar could not very well proclaim that as his sister was not to accompany him and shield him he would not act as charioteer to miss gauntlet nor could the lady object to be driven by her host so at last they started from the vicarage door with many farewell kisses and a large paper of sandwiches who is it that consumes the large packets of sandwiches with which parting guests are always laden i imagine that stationmasters dogs are mainly fed upon them  the first halfmile was occupied on wilkinsons part in little wouldbe efforts to make his companion more comfortable he shifted himself about into the furthest corner so as to give her more room he pulled his cloak out from under her and put it over her knees to guard her from the dust and recommended her three times to put up her parasol then he had a word or two to say to the neighbours but that only lasted as long as he was in his own parish then he came to a hill which gave him an opportunity of walking and on getting in again he occupied half a minute in taking out his watch and assuring adela that she would not be too late for the train  but when all this was done the necessity for conversation still remained they had hardly been togetherthrown for conversation on each other as they now weresince that day when arthur had walked over for the last time to west putford reader do you remember it hardly for have not all the fortunes and misfortunes of our more prominent hero intervened since that chapter was before you  i hope you will find yourself comfortable at littlebath he said at last  oh yes that is i shall be when my aunt comes home i shall be at home then you know  but that will be some time  i fear so and i dread greatly going to this miss todd whom i have never seen but you see dear miss baker must go back to hadley soon and miss todd has certainly been very goodnatured in offering to take me  then there was another silence which lasted for about half a mile  my mother would have been very glad if you would have stayed at the parsonage till your aunts return and so would my sistersand so should i  you are all very kindtoo kind said adela  then came another pause perhaps for a quarter of a mile but it was uphill work and the quarter of a mile passed by very slowly  it seems so odd that you should go away from us whom you have known so long to stay with miss todd whom you never have even seen  i think change of scene will be good for me mr wilkinson  well perhaps so and then the other quarter of a mile made away with itself come get along dumpling this was said to the fat steed for they had now risen to level ground  our house i know must be very stupid for you it is much changed from what it was is it not  oh i dont know  yes it is there is neither the same spirit nor the same goodwill we miss my father greatly  ah yes i can feel for you there it is a loss a great loss  i sometimes think it unfortunate that my mother should have remained at the vicarage after my fathers death  you have been very good to her i know  i have done my best adela it was the first time she had distinctly heard him call her by her christian name since she had come to stay with them but i have failed she is not happy there nor indeed for that matter am i  a man should be happy when he does his duty  we none of us do that so thoroughly as to require no other source of happiness go on dumpling and do your duty  i see that you are very careful in doing yours  perhaps you will hardly believe me but i wish lord stapledean had never given me the living  well it is difficult to believe that think what it has been for your sisters  i know we should have been very poor but we should not have starved i had my fellowship and i could have taken pupils i am sure we should have been happier and then  and thenwell said adela and as she spoke her heart was not quite at rest within her breast  then i should have been free since i took that living i have been a slave again he paused a moment and whipped the horse but it was only now for a moment that he was silent yes a slave do you not see what a life i live i could be content to sacrifice myself to my mother if the sacrifice were understood but you see how it is with her nothing that i can do will satisfy her and yet for her i have sacrificed everythingeverything  a sacrifice is no sacrifice if it be agreeable the sacrifice consists in its being painful  well i suppose so i say that to myself so often it is the only consolation i have  not that i think your home should be made uncomfortable to you there is no reason why it should be at least i should think not she spoke with little spasmodic efforts which however did not betray themselves to her companion who seemed to her to be almost more engaged with dumpling than with the conversation it certainly had been through no wish of hers that they were thus talking of his household concerns but as they were speaking of them she was forced into a certain amount of hypocrisy it was a subject on which she could not speak openly  there was then another hill to be walked up and adela thought there would be no more of it the matter had come up by accident and would now probably drop away but no whether by design or from chance or because no other topic presented itself arthur went back to the subject and did so now in a manner that was peculiarly startling to miss gauntlet  do you remember my calling once at west putford soon after i got the living it is a long time ago now and i dont suppose you do remember it  yes i do very well  and do you remember what i told you then  what was it said adela it clearly is the duty of a young lady on very many occasions to be somewhat hypocritical  if there be any man to whose happiness marriage is more necessary than to that of another it is a country clergyman  yes i can believe that that is if there be not ladies of his own family living with him  i do not know that that makes any difference  oh yes it must make a difference i think that a man must be very wretched who has no one to look after his house  and is that your idea of the excellence of a wife i should have expected something higher from you adela i suppose you think then that if a man have his linen looked after and his dinner cooked that is sufficient poor adela it must be acknowledged that this was hard on her  no i do not think that sufficient  it would seem so from what you say  then what i said belied my thoughts it seems to me mr wilkinson since you drive me to speak out that the matter is very much in your own hands you are certainly a free agent you know better than i can tell you what your duty to your mother and sisters requires circumstances have made them dependent on you and you certainly are not the man to disacknowledge the burden  certainly not  no certainly not but having made up my mind to that i would not were i you allow myself to be a slave  but what can i do  you mean that you would be a poor man were youwere you to give up your fellowship and at the same time take upon yourself other cares as well do as other poor men do  i know no other man situated as i am  but you know men who are much worse situated as regards their worldly means were you to give your mother the half of your income you would still i presume be richer than mr young mr young was the curate of a neighbouring parish who had lately married on his curacy  it will be said by my critics especially by my female critics that in saying this adela went a long way towards teaching mr wilkinson the way to woo indeed she brought that accusation against herself and not lightly but she was as she herself had expressed it driven in the cause of truth to say what she had said nor did she in her heart of hearts believe that mr wilkinson had any thought of her in saying what she did say her mind on that matter had been long made up she knew herself to be the poor sequestered stag left and abandoned by his velvet friend she had no feeling in the matter which amounted to the slightest hope he had asked her for her counsel and she had given him the only counsel which she honestly could give  therefore bear lightly on her oh my critics bear lightly on her especially my critics feminine to the worst of your wrath and scorn i willingly subject the other lovers with whom my tale is burthened  yes i should be better off than young said wilkinson as though he were speaking to himself but that is not the point i do not know that i have ever looked at it exactly in that light there is the house the parsonage i mean it is full of womentwas thus irreverently that he spoke of his mother and sisterswhat other woman would come among them  oh that is the treasure for which you have to searchthis she said laughingly the bitterness of the day was over with her or at least it then seemed so she was not even thinking of herself when she said this  would you come to such a house adela you you yourself  you mean to ask whether if as regards other circumstances i was minded to marry i would then be deterred by a motherinlaw and sisterinlaw  yes just so said wilkinson timidly  well that would depend much upon how well i might like the gentleman something also upon how much i might like the ladies  a mans wife should always be mistress in his own house  oh yes of course  and my mother is determined to be mistress in that house  well i will not recommend you to rebel against your mother is that the station mr wilkinson  yesthats the station dear me we have forty minutes to wait yet  dont mind me mr wilkinson i shall not in the least dislike waiting by myself  of course i shall see you off dumpling wont run away you may be sure of that there is very little of the runaway class to be found at hurst staple parsonage except you adela  you dont call me a runaway i hope  you run away from us just when we are beginning to feel the comfort of your being with us there he wont catch cold now and so having thrown a rug over dumplings back he followed adela into the station  i dont know anything so tedious as waiting at a secondclass station for a train there is the ladies waitingroom into which gentlemen may not go and the gentlemens waitingroom in which the porters generally smoke and the refreshment room with its dirty counter covered with dirtier cakes and there is the platform which you walk up and down till you are tired you go to the ticketwindow half a dozen times for your ticket having been warned by the companys bills that you must be prepared to start at least ten minutes before the train is due but the man inside knows better and does not open the little hole to which you have to stoop your head till two minutes before the time named for your departure then there are five fat farmers three old women and a butcher at the aperture and not finding yourself equal to struggling among them for a place you make up your mind to be left behind at last however you do get your ticket just as the train comes up but hearing that exciting sound you nervously cram your change into your pocket without counting it and afterwards feel quite convinced that you have lost a shilling in the transaction  twas somewhat in this way that the forty minutes were passed by wilkinson and adela nothing of any moment was spoken between them till he took her hand for the last time adela he then whispered to her i shall think much of what you have said to me very much i do so wish you were not leaving us i wonder whether you would be surprised if i were to write to you but the train was gone before she had time to answer  two days afterwards bertram also left them arthur he said as he took leave of the vicar if i who have made such a mess of it myself may give advice on such a subject i would not leave adela gauntlet long at littlebath if i were you     chapter xiii  the solicitorgeneral in love   caroline waddington was at hadley when she received and accepted the proposal made to her by sir henry harcourt it may be conceived that the affair was arranged without any very great amount of romance sir henry indeed was willing in a hurried manner to throw himself at the ladys feet to swear by her fair hand that he loved her as man never yet had loved and to go to work in the fashion usually most approved by young ladies in a hurried manner i say for just at this moment he was being made solicitorgeneral and had almost too many irons in the fire to permit of a prolonged dallying but caroline would have none of it either hurried or not hurried whatever might be the case with sir henry she had gone through that phase of life and now declared to herself that she did not want any more of it  sir henry did not find the task of gaining his bride very difficult he had succeeded in establishing a sort of intimacy with old mr bertram and it appeared that permission to run down to hadley and run back again had already been accorded to him before miss baker and caroline arrived there he never slept though he sometimes dined in the house but he had always something to talk about when an excuse for going to hadley was required mr bertram had asked him something about some investment and he had found out this something or he wanted to ask mr bertrams advice on some question as to his political career at this period he was or professed to be very much guided in his public life by mr bertrams opinion  and thus he fell in with caroline on the first occasion of his doing so he contrived to whisper to her his deep sympathy with her sorrow on his second visit he spoke more of himself and less of bertram on his third he alluded only to her own virtues on his fourth he asked her to be lady harcourt she told him that she would be lady harcourt and as far as she was concerned there was an end of it for the present  then sir henry proposed that the day should be named on this subject also he found her ready to accommodate him she had no coy scruples as to the time he suggested that it should be before christmas very well let it be before christmas christmas is a cold time for marrying but this was to be a cold marriage christmas however for the fortunate is made warm with pudding ale and spiced beef they intended to be among the fortunate the fortunate in place and money and rank and they would as best they might make themselves warm with the best pudding ale and spiced beef which the world could afford them  sir henry was alive to the delight of being the possessor of so many charms and was somewhat chagrined that for the present he was so cruelly debarred from any part of his legitimate enjoyment though he was a solicitorgeneral he could have been content to sit for ten minutes with his arm round carolines waist andin spite of the energy with which he was preparing a bill for the regulation of county courts as to which he knew that he should have that terrible demigod lord boanerges down upon his shouldersstill he would fain have stolen a kiss or two but carolines waist and carolines kisses were to be his only after christmas and to be his only as payment accorded for her new rank and for her fine new house in eaton square  how is it that girls are so potent to refuse such favours at one time and so impotent in preventing their exaction at another sir henry we may say had every right to demand some trifling payment in advance but he could not get a doit should we be violating secrecy too much if we suggested that george bertram had had some slight partial success even when he had no such positive claimsome success which had of course been in direct opposition to the ladys will  miss baker had now gone back to littlebath either to receive adela gauntlet or because she knew that she should be more comfortable in her own rooms than in her uncles dismal houseor perhaps because sir lionel was there she had however gone back and caroline remained mistress for the time of her grandfathers household  the old man now seemed to have dropped all mystery in the matter he generally indeed spoke of caroline as miss waddington but he heard her talked of as his granddaughter without expressing anger and with sir henry he himself so spoke of her he appeared to be quite reconciled to the marriage in spite of all his entreaties to george all his attempted bribery his brokenhearted sorrow when he failed he seemed to be now content indeed he had made no opposition to the match when caroline had freely spoken to him about it he made some little snappish remark as to the fickleness of women but he at the same time signified that he would not object  why should he sir henry harcourt was in every respect a good match for his granddaughter he had often been angry with george bertram because george had not prospered in the world sir henry had prospered signallywould probably prosper much more signally might it not be safely predicated of a man who was solicitorgeneral before he was thirty that he would be lordchancellor or lord chiefjustice or at any rate some very bigwig indeed before he was fifty so of course mr bertram did not object  but he had not signified his acquiescence in any very cordial way rich old men when they wish to be cordial on such occasions have but one way of evincing cordiality it is not by a pressure of the hand by a kind word by an approving glance their embrace conveys no satisfaction their warmest words if unsupported are very cold an old man if he intends to be cordial on such an occasion must speak of thousands of pounds my dear young fellow i approve altogether she shall have twenty thousand pounds the day she becomes yours then is the hand shaken with true fervour then is real cordiality expressed and felt what a dear old man grandpapa is is there any one like him dear old duck he is going to be so generous to harry  but mr bertram said nothing about twenty thousand pounds nothing about ten nothing about money at all till he was spoken to on the subject it was sir henrys special object not to be pressing on this point to show that he was marrying caroline without any sordid views and that his admiration for mr bertram had no bearing at all on that gentlemans cashbox he did certainly make little feints at mr pritchett but mr pritchett merely wheezed and said nothing mr pritchett was not fond of the harcourt interest and seemed to care but little for miss caroline now that she had transferred her affections  but it was essentially necessary that sir henry harcourt should know what was to be done if he were to have nothing it was necessary that he should know that he had certainly counted on having something and on having something immediately he was a thoroughly hardworking man of business but yet he was not an economical man a man who lives before the world in london and lives chiefly among men of fortune can hardly be economical he had not therefore any large sum of money in hand he was certainly in receipt of a large income but then his expenses were large he had taken and now had to furnish an expensive house in eaton square and a few thousand pounds in ready money were almost indispensable to him  one fridaythis was after his return to town from the ten days grouseshooting and occurred at the time when he was most busy with the county courtshe wrote to caroline to say that he would go down to hadley on saturday afternoon stay there over the sunday and return to town on the monday morning that is to say he would do so if perfectly agreeable to mr bertram  he went down and found everything prepared for him that was suitable for a solicitorgeneral they did not put before him merely roast mutton or boiled beef he was not put to sleep in the back bedroom without a carpet such treatment had been good enough for george bertram but for the solicitorgeneral all the glories of hadley were put forth he slept in the best bedroom which was damp enough no doubt seeing that it was not used above twice in the year and went through at dinner a whole course of entrées such as entrées usually are in the suburban districts this was naturally gratifying to him as a solicitorgeneral and fortified him for the struggle he was to make  he had some hope that he should have a têteàtête with caroline on the saturday evening but neither fate nor love would favour him he came down just before dinner and there was clearly no time then infirm as the old man was he sat at the dinnertable and though sir henry was solicitorgeneral there was no second room no withdrawingroom prepared for his reception  grandpapa does not like moving said caroline as she got up to leave the room after dinner so perhaps sir henry you will allow me to come down to tea here we always sit here of an evening  i never could bear to live in two rooms said the old man when one is just warm and comfortable one has to go out into all the draughts of the house thats the fashion i know but i hope youll excuse me sir henry for not liking it  sir henry of course did excuse him there was nothing he himself liked so much as sitting cosy over a diningroom fire  in about an hour caroline did come down again and in another hour before the old man went she again vanished for the night sir henry had made up his mind not to speak to mr bertram about money that evening so he also soon followed caroline and sat down to work upon the county courts in his own bedroom  on the next morning sir henry and caroline went to church all the hadleyians of course knew of the engagement and were delighted to have an opportunity of staring at the two turtledoves a solicitorgeneral in love is a sight to behold and the clergyman had certainly no right to be angry if the attention paid to his sermon was something less fixed than usual before dinner there was luncheon and then sir henry asked his betrothed if she would take a walk with him oh certainly she would be delighted her churchgoing bonnet was still on and she was quite ready sir henry also was ready but as he left the room he stooped over mr bertrams chair and whispered to him could i speak to you a few words before dinner sir on business i know i ought to apologize this being sunday  oh i dont care about sunday said the stubbornminded old man i shall be here till i go to bed i suppose if you want me  and then they started on their walk oh those lovers rambles a man as he grows old can perhaps teach himself to regret but few of the sweets which he is compelled to leave behind him he can learn to disregard most of his youths pleasures and to live contented though he has outlived them the polka and the waltz were once joyous but he sees now that the work was warm and that one was often compelled to perform it in company for which one did not care those picnics too were nice but it may be a question whether a good dinner at his own dinnertable is not nicer though fat and over forty he may still ride to hounds and as for boating and cricketing after all they were but boys play for those things ones soul does not sigh but ah those lovers walks those loving lovers rambles tom moore is usually somewhat sugary and mawkish but in so much he was right if there be an elysium on earth it is this they are done and over for us oh my compatriots never again unless we are destined to rejoin our houris in heaven and to saunter over fields of asphodel in another and a greener youthnever again shall those joys be ours and what can ever equal them twas then between sweet hedgerows under green oaks with our feet rustling on the crisp leaves that the worlds cold reserve was first thrown off and we found that those we loved were not goddesses made of buckram and brocade but human beings like ourselves with blood in their veins and hearts in their bosomsveritable children of adam like ourselves  gin a body meet a body comin through the rye ah how delicious were those meetings how convinced we were that there was no necessity for loud alarm how fervently we agreed with the poet my friends born together with me in the consulship of lord liverpool all that is done and over for us we shall never gang that gait again  there is a melancholy in this that will tinge our thoughts let us draw ever so strongly on our philosophy we can still walk with our wivesand that is pleasant too veryof course but there was more animation in it when we walked with the same ladies under other names nay sweet spouse mother of dear bairns who hast so well done thy duty but this was so let thy brows be knit never so angrily that lord of thine has been indifferently good to thee and thou to him has been more than good uphill together have ye walked peaceably labouring and now arminarm ye shall go down the gradual slope which ends below there in the green churchyard tis good and salutary to walk thus but for the full cup of joy for the brimming springtide of human bliss oh give me back give me back   well well well it is nonsense i know it but may not a man dream now and again in his evening nap and yet do no harm  vici puellis nuper idoneus et militavi how well horace knew all about it but that hanging up of the gittern one would fain have put it off had falling hairs and marriagevows and obesity have permitted it nay is it not so old friend of the grizzled beard dost thou not envy that smirk young knave with his five lustrums though it goes hard with him to purchase his kidgloves he dines for oneandtwopence at an eatinghouse but what cares maria where he dines he rambles through the rye with his empty pockets and at the turn of the fieldpath maria will be there to meet him envy him not thou hast had thy walk but lend him rather that thirty shillings that he asks of thee so shall marias heart be glad as she accepts his golden brooch  but for our friend sir henry every joy was present youth and wealth and love were all his and his all together he was but eightandtwenty was a member of parliament solicitorgeneral owner of a house in eaton square and possessor of as much welltrained beauty as was to be found at that time within the magic circle of any circumambient crinoline within the bills of mortality was it not sweet for him to wander through the rye had he not fallen upon an elysium a very paradise of earthly joys was not his springtide at the full flood  and so they started on their walk it was the first that they had ever taken together what sir henry may have done before in that line this history says not a man who is solicitorgeneral at eightandtwenty can hardly have had time for much but the practice which he perhaps wanted caroline had had there had been walks as well as rides at littlebath and walks also though perhaps of doubtful joy amidst those graves below the walls of jerusalem  and so they started there isor perhaps we should say was for time and railways and straggling new suburban villas may now have destroyed it all but there is or was a pretty woodland lane running from the back of hadley church through the last remnants of what once was enfield chase how many lovers feet have crushed the leaves that used to lie in autumn along that pretty lane well well there shall not be another word in that strain i speak solely now of the time here present to sir henry all former days and former roamings there shall be clean forgotten the solicitorgeneral now thither wends his way and love and beauty attend upon his feet see how he opens the gate that stands by the churchyard paling does it stand there yet i wonder well well we will say it does  it is a beautiful day for a walk said sir henry  yes very beautiful said caroline  there is nothing i am so fond of as a long walk said the gentleman  it is very nice said the lady but i do not know that i care for going very far today i am not quite strong at present  not strong and the solicitorgeneral put on a look of deep alarm  oh there is nothing the matter with me but i am not quite strong for walking i am out of practice and my boots are not quite of the right sort  they dont hurt you i hope  oh no they dont actually hurt me theyll do very well for today and then there was a short pause and they got on the green grass which runs away into the chase in front of the parsonage windows i wonder whether wickets are ever standing there now on the summer afternoons  they were soon as much aloneor nearly soas lovers might wish to be quite enough so for caroline some curious eyes were still peeping no doubt to see how the great lawyer looked when he was walking with the girl of his heart to see how the rich misers granddaughter looked when she was walking with the man of her heart and perhaps some voices were whispering that she had changed her lover for in these rural seclusions everything is known by everybody but neither the peepers nor the whisperers interfered with the contentment of the fortunate pair  i hope you are happy caroline said sir henry as he gently squeezed the hand that was so gently laid upon his arm  happy oh yesi am happy i dont believe you know in a great deal of very ecstatic happiness i never did  but i hope you are rationally happynot discontentedat any rate not regretful i hope you believe that i shall do my best my very best to make you happy  oh yes i quite believe that we must each think of the others comfort after all that i take it is the great thing in married life  i dont expect you to be passionately in love with menot as yet caroline  no let neither of us expect that sir henry passionate love i take it rarely lasts long and is very troublesome while it does last mutual esteem is very much more valuable  but caroline i would have you believe in my love  oh yes i do believe in it why else should you wish to marry me i think too well of myself to feel it strange that you should love me but love with you and with me also for the future will be subordinate to other passions  sir henry did not altogether like that reference to the past which was conveyed in the word future but however he bore it without wincing  you know so thoroughly the history of the last three years she continued that it would be impossible for me to deceive you if i could but if i know myself under no circumstances would i have done so i have loved once and no good has come of it it was contrary to my nature to do soto love in that mad passionate selfsacrificing manner but yet i did i think i may say with certainty that i never shall be so foolish again  you have suffered lately caroline and as the sore still smarts you hardly yet know what happiness may be in store for you  yes i have suffered and he felt from the touch on his arm that her whole body shuddered  he walked on in silence for awhile considering within himself why should he marry this girl rejected of her former lover who now hung upon his arm he was now at the very fullest tide of his prosperity he had everything to offer which mothers wish for their daughters and which daughters wish for themselves he had income rank name youth and talent why should he fling his rich treasures at the feet of a proud minx who in taking them swore that she could not love him would it not be better for him to recede a word he well knew would do it for her pride was true pride he felt in his heart that it was not assumed he had only to say that he was not contented with this cold lack of love and she would simply desire him to lead her back to her home and leave her there it would be easy enough for him to get his head from out the noose  but it was this very easiness perhaps which made him hesitate she knew her own price and was not at all anxious to dispose of herself a cheap bargain if you sir have a horse to sell never appear anxious for the sale that rule is well understood among those who deal in horses if you madam have a daughter to sell it will be well for you also to remember this or my young friend if you have yourself to sell the same rule holds good but it is hard to put an old head on young shoulders hard as the task is however it would seem to have been effected as regards caroline waddington  and then sir henry looked at her not exactly with his present eyesight as then at that moment existing for seeing that she was walking by his side he could not take the comprehensive view which his taste and mind required but he looked at her searchingly with the eyesight of his memory and found that she exactly tallied with what his judgment demanded that she was very beautiful no man had ever doubted that she was now in the full pride of her beauty was to him certain and then her beauty was of that goddess class which seems for so long a period to set years at defiance it was produced by no girlish softness by no perishable mixture of white and red it was not born of a sparkling eye and a ripe lip and a cherry cheek to her face belonged lines of contour severe lovely and of ineradicable grace it was not when she smiled and laughed that she most pleased she did not charm only when she spoke though indeed the expression of her speaking face was perfect but she had the beauty of a marble bust it would not be easy even for sir henry harcourt even for a young solicitorgeneral to find a face more beautiful with which to adorn his drawingroom  and then she had that air of fashion that look of being able to look down the unfashionable which was so much in the eyes of sir henry though in those of george bertram it had been almost a demerit with caroline as with many women this was an appearance rather than a reality she had not moved much among high people she had not taught herself to despise those of her own class the women of littlebath the todds and the adela gauntlets but she looked as though she would be able to do so and it was fitting she should have such a look if ever she were to be the wife of a solicitorgeneral  and then sir henry thought of mr bertrams coffers ah if he could only be let into that secret it might be easy to come to a decision that the old man had quarrelled with his nephew he was well aware that george in his pigheaded folly would make no overtures towards a reconciliation of that also he was sure was it not probable that at any rate a great portion of that almost fabulous wealth would go to the mans granddaughter there was doubtless risk but then one must run some risk in everything it might be if he could play his cards wisely that he would get it allthat he would be placed in a position to make even the solicitorgeneralship beneath his notice  and so in spite of carolines coldness he resolved to persevere  having thus made up him mind he turned the conversation to another subject  you liked the house on the whole did you caroline during the past week had been up to see the new house in eaton square  oh yes very much nothing could be nicer only i am afraid its expensive this was a subject on which caroline could talk to him  not particularly said sir henry of course one cant get a house in london for nothing i shall have rather a bargain of that if i can pay the money down the great thing is whether you like it  i was charmed with it i never saw prettier drawingroomsnever and the bedrooms for a london house are so large and airy  did you go into the diningroom  oh yes i went in  theres room for fourandtwenty is there not  well i dont know i cant give an opinion about that you could have three times that number at supper  im not thinking of suppers but im sure you could kitchens convenient eh  veryso at least aunt mary said  and now about the furniture you can give me two or three days in town cant you  oh yes if you require it but i would trust your taste in all those matters  my taste i have neither taste nor time if you wont mind going to   and so the conversation went on for another fifteen minutes and then they were at home carolines boots had begun to tease her and their walk therefore had not been prolonged to a great distance  ah me again i say how pleasant how delightful were those lovers walks  then caroline went up to her bedroom and sir henry sat himself down near mr bertrams chair in the diningroom  i wanted to speak to you sir said he rushing at once into the midst of his subject about carolines settlement it is time that all that should be arranged i would have made my lawyer see pritchett but i dont know that pritchett has any authority to act for you in such matters  act for me pritchett has no authority to actnor have i either this little renunciation of his granddaughters affairs was no more than sir henry expected he was therefore neither surprised nor disgusted  well i only want to know who has the authority i dont anticipate any great difficulty carolines fortune is not very large but of course it must be settled six thousand pounds i believe  four sir henry that is if i am rightly informed  four is it i was told sixi think by george bertram in former days i should of course prefer six but if it be only four why we must make the best of it  she has only four of her own said the old man somewhat mollified  have you any objection to my telling you what i would propose to do  no objection in life sir henry  my income is large but i want a little ready money at present to conclude the purchase of my house and to furnish it would you object to the four thousand pounds being paid into my hands if i insure my life for six for her benefit were her fortune larger i should of course propose that my insurance should be heavier  sir henry was so very reasonable that mr bertram by degrees thawed he would make his granddaughters fortune six thousand as he had always intended this should be settled on her the income of course going to her husband he should insure his life for four thousand more on her behalf and mr bertram would lend sir henry three thousand for his furniture  sir henry agreed to this saying to himself that such a loan from mr bertram was equal to a gift mr bertram himself seemed to look at it in a different light mind sir henry i shall expect the interest to the day i will only charge you four per cent and it must be made a bond debt  oh certainly said sir henry  and so the affair of the settlement was arranged     chapter xiv  mrs leake of rissbury   adela gauntlet reached littlebath without any adventures and at the station she met miss baker ready to take her and her boxes in charge she soon learned what was to be her fate for that autumn it was imperatively necessary that miss baker should go up to town in a week or two there are such hundreds of things to be done about furniture and all that you know said miss baker looking rather grand as she spoke of her nieces great match and yet doing so with the least possible amount of intentional pride or vanity adela of course acknowledged that there must be hundreds of things and expressed her deepest regret that she should be so much in the way perhaps she almost wished that she had remained at hurst staple  not at all in the way my dear said miss baker i shall be back again in a week at the furthest and miss todd will be delighted to have you for that time indeed she would be very much disappointed now and offended too if you did not go but all the same i would not leave you only that sir henry insists that caroline should choose all the things herself and of course he has not time to go with herand then the responsibility is so great why i suppose she will have to lay out about two thousand pounds  but what sort of a person is miss todd asked adela  oh an extremely nice person youll like her amazinglyso lively so goodnatured so generous and very clever too perhaps for her age shes a little too fond  too fond of what you were going to say dress i suppose  no indeed i cant say that theres anything to blame her for in that she dresses very handsomely but always plain no what i was going to say is that perhaps for a woman of her ageshe is a little too fond of gentlemens attention  caroline told me that she was the most confirmed old maid she knewan old maid who gloried in being an old maid  i dont know about that my dear but if a certain gentleman were to ask her i dont think shed glory in it much longer but shes a very nice person and youll like her very much  miss baker did go up to town leaving adela to miss todds hospitality she did go up but in doing so resolved to return as soon as possible sir lionel was now in the paragon nearly every other day to be sure he did generally call in montpellier terrace on the alternate days but then there was a reason for that they had to talk about george and caroline what possible reason could there be for his going to the paragon  adela was rather frightened when she found herself left at miss todds lodgings though that ladys manner to her was not such as need have inspired much awe  now my dear she said dont mind me in the least do just whatever you like if i only knew what you did like you should have it if i could get it what are you fond of now shall i ask some young people here tonight  oh no miss todd not for me i have never been much in society and certainly do not wish for it at present  well society is not a bad thing you dont play cards i suppose  i dont know one card from another  youd just suit mr ocallaghan then are you fond of young clergymen theres one here might just suit you all the young ladies are dying for him  then pray dont let me interfere with them miss todd  perhaps you like officers better there are heaps of them here i dont know where they come from and they never seem to have anything to do the young ladies howeverthose who dont run after mr ocallaghanseem to think them very nice  oh miss todd i dont want clergymen or officers  dont you well then well get some novels from the circulating library at three oclock i always drive out and well go to the pastrycooks oh i declare heres sir lionel bertram as usual you know sir lionel dont you  adela said that she had met sir lionel at miss bakers  what a pity that match should have gone off isnt it i mean dear miss waddington but though that match is off another may come on i for one should be very happy you dont know anything about it i see ill tell you some of these days how do sir lionel you mustnt stay long because miss gauntlet and i am going out or ill tell you what you shall take care of us its a beautiful day and if miss gauntlet likes well walk instead of having the fly miss todd never aped grandeur and always called her private carriage a fly because it had only one horse  sir lionel having made his salutations to miss gauntlet declared that he should be most happy to be trusted with their custody through the streets of littlebath  but we cant walk either miss gauntlet today because i must call on old mrs leake at rissbury i quite forgot mrs leake so you see sir lionel we shant want you after all  sir lionel declared that this last decision made him quite miserable  youll be recovered by dinnertime i dont doubt said miss todd and now ill go upstairs and put my bonnet on as miss gauntlet has got hers you can stay and talk to her  charming creature miss todd isnt she said sir lionel before the door was well closed such freshness of character so much bonhommiea little odd sometimes these last words were not added till miss todds footsteps heavier than camillas were heard well up the stairs  she seems to be a very goodnatured person i never saw her before today  did you not we knew her very intimately in the holy landas if any land ever was or could be holy to sir lionel and such as he that is george and i and caroline of course you know all about that miss waddington  adela signified to him that she did know the circumstances to which he alluded  it is very sad is it not and then the connection between them being so near and their being the jointheirs to such an enormous property i know the people here take carolines part and say that she has been hardly used but i cannot say that i blame george i cannot indeed  it is one of those cases in which no one should be blamed  exactlythat is just what i say my advice to george was this dont let money influence your conduct in any way thank god theres enough of that for all of us what you have to think of is her happiness and your own thats what i said and i do believe he took my advice i dont think he had any sordid views with reference to carolines fortune  i am sure he had not  oh no never what sir henrys views may be i dont pretend to know people here do say that he has been ingratiating himself with my brother for some time past he has my leave miss gauntlet i am an old man old enough to be your fatherthe wellpreserved old beau might have said grandfatherand my experience of life is this that money is never worth the trouble that men take to get it they say my brother is fond of it if so i think he has made a mistake in lifea great mistake  all this sounded very nice but even to adelas inexperienced ears it was not like the ring of genuine silver after all mock virtue imposes on but few people the man of the world is personally known for such as also are known the cruel the griping the avaricious the unjust that which enables the avaricious and the unjust to pass scatheless through the world is not the ignorance of the world as to their sins but the indifference of the world whether they be sinful or no  and now sir lionel you may just put us into the fly and then we wont keep you any longer said miss todd as she reentered the room with her bonnet and shawl  mrs leake who lived at rissbury was a deaf old lady not very popular among other old ladies at littlebath all the world of course knows that the village of rissbury is hardly more than a suburb of littlebath being distant from the high street not above a mile and a half it will be remembered that the second milestone on hinchcombe road is altogether beyond the village just as you begin to ascend the hill near the turnpike  mrs leake was not very popular seeing that though her ear was excessively dull her tongue was peculiarly acute she had the repute of saying the most biting things of any lady in littlebathand many of the ladies of littlebath were apt to say biting things then mrs leake did not play cards nor did she give suppers nor add much in any way to the happiness of the other ladies her compatriots but she lived in rather a grand house of her own whereas others lived in lodgings she kept a carriage with a pair of horses whereas others kept flies and she had some mysterious acquaintance with the countyocracy which went a long way with the ladies of littlebath though what good it even did to mrs leake herself was never very apparent  it is a terrible bore to have to talk to people who use speakingtrumpets and who are so fidgety themselves that they wont use their speakingtrumpets properly miss todd greatly dreaded the speakingtrumpet she did not usually care one straw for mrs leakes tongue nor much for her carriage and horses or county standing but the littlebath world called on mrs leake and miss todd being at rome did as romans do  ill take her for five minutes said miss todd as driving through the village of rissbury she finished her description of the lady and then do you take her up for five more and then ill go on again and then well go away adela agreed though with a heavy heart for what subject of conversation could she find on which to dilate to mrs leake through a speakingtrumpet for five minutes  miss who said mrs leake putting her trumpet down from her ear that she might stare the better at adela oh miss gauntvery welli hope youll like littlebath miss gaunt  miss gauntlet shouted miss todd with a voice that would have broken the trumpet into shivers had it not been made of the very best metal  never hollo my dear when you do that i cant hear at all it only makes a noise like a dog barking youll find the young men about littlebath very goodnatured miss gaunt they are rather emptyheadedbut i think young ladies generally like them all the better for that  adela felt herself called on to make no answer to this as it was not her turn at the trumpet  what news have you heard lately mrs leake asked miss todd the great thing was to make mrs leake talk instead of having to talk to her  amuse no i dont think they do amuse any one very much but then thats not their line i suppose they can dance most of them and those whove got any money may do for husbandsas the world goes we musnt be too particular must we miss gaunt  miss gauntlet whispered miss todd into the trumpet separating the sounds well so that they should not clash on the unsusceptible tympanum of her friends ear  let let let i think i can hear anybody almost better than i can you miss todd i dont know how it is but i never can hear the people out of the town as well as i can my own set its habit i take it  theyre used to deaf people in the country i suppose said miss todd who with all her good nature didnt choose to be over much put upon  ah i cant hear you said mrs leake she had however heard this but i want you to tell me something about this caroline waddington isnt it true shes got another lover already  oh quite true shes going to be married  wants to be married yes i dont doubt she wants to be married thats what they all want only some are not able to manage it ha ha ha i beg your pardon miss gaunt but we old women must have our joke about the young ones mustnt we miss todd mrs leake be it noticed was past seventy whereas our dear miss todd was only just fortyfour  miss gauntlet can tell you all about miss waddington said miss todd in her very plainest voice they are very great friends and correspond with each other so miss todd handed over the spout of the trumpet  she was corresponding with another i dare say she was with half a dozen at once do you know anything about it miss gaunt  poor adela what was she to say or do her hand absolutely trembled as she put it lightly to the instrument thrice she bent her head down before she was able to say anything and thrice she lifted it up in despair  is it the lady or the gentleman that is a friend of yours my dear or which of the gentlemen i hope she has not robbed you of a beau  miss waddington is a very dear friend of mine maam  oh she is is she  and i know mr bertram also  is he a dear friend too well i suppose hes disengaged now but they tell me hes got nothing eh  i really dont know  its very hard to know very i dont much admire such jilts myself but  miss waddington did not jilt him madam  then he jilted her thats just what i want to come at im very much obliged to you my dear i see you can tell me all about it it was about money wasnt it  no shouted adela with an energy that quite surprised herself money had nothing to do with it  i did not say you had anything to do with it but dont take up that habit of holloing from miss todd i suppose the truth was that he found out what he wasnt meant to find out men shouldnt be too inquisitive should they miss todd you are quite right miss gaunt dont have anything to do with it its a bad affair  i think you are very much mistaken madam said adela again shouting but it was all thrown away i cant hear a word when you hollo in that way not a word said mrs leake and then adela with an imploring look at miss todd relinquished her seat  miss todd rose with the usual little speech about leavetaking she had as we have seen intended to have gone in for a second innings herself but all hope of winning the game against mrs leake was over even her courage was nearly upset so making a little whisper to adela she held out her hand to the old lady and prepared to depart  dear me you are in a great hurry to go said mrs leake  yes we are rather in a hurry this morning said miss todd neglectful of the trumpet we have so many people to see  well goodbye im very much obliged to you for coming and miss toddand here mrs leake affected to whisper but her whisper would have been audible to a dozen had a dozen been therei mustnt forget to wish you joy about sir lionel good morning to you miss gaunt and then mrs leake dropt an oldfashioned gracious curtsy  to say that miss todd blushed would be to belie the general rosiness of that ladys complexion she was all blush always over her face colour of the highest was always flying it was not only that her cheeks carried a settled brilliant tint but at every smileand miss todd was ever smilingthis tint would suffuse her forehead and her neck at every peal of laughterand her peals of laughter were innumerableit would become brighter and brighter coming and going or rather ever coming fresh and never going till the reflection from her countenance would illumine the whole room and light up the faces of all around her but now she almost blushed black she had delighted hitherto in all the little bits of libellous tittle tattle to which her position as a young old maid had given rise and had affected always to assist their propagation but there was a poison about this old female snake a sting in the tongue of this old adder which reached even her  the old fool said miss todd by no means sotto voce  mrs leake heard her though the speaking trumpet was not in action no no no she said in her most goodnatured voice i dont think hes such a fool at all of course he is old and in want of an income no doubt but then hes a knight you know my dear and a colonel and then the two ladies waiting for no further courtesies went back to their fly  miss todd had quite regained her goodhumour by the time she was seated well said she what do you think of my friend mrs leake  what makes her so very spiteful asked adela  why you see my dear shed be nothing if she wasnt spiteful its her fate shes very old and she lives there by herself and she doesnt go out much and she has nothing to amuse her if she didnt do that she couldnt do anything i rather like it myself  well i cant say i like it said adela and then they sat silent for a time miss todd the while reflecting whether she would in any way defend herself from that imputation about sir lionel  but you see what sort of a woman she is miss gauntlet and of course you must not believe a word that she says  how very dreadful  oh it does not mean anything i call all those white lies nobody notices them but what she said about sir lionel you know  i really shall not think of anything she said  but i must explain to you said miss todd in whose mind in spite of her blushing a certain amount of pleasure was mixed with the displeasure which mrs leakes scandal had caused her for at this moment sir lionel was not a little thought of at littlebath and among the lucretias there assembled there was many a one who would have felt but small regret in abandoning her maiden meditations at the instance of sir lionel bertram  but i must explain to you sir lionel does come to see me very often and i should think there was something in itor rather i shouldnt be surprised at others thinking soonly that i am quite sure that hes thinking of somebody else  is he asked adela perhaps not with a great deal of animation  yes and ill tell you who that somebody else is mind i shouldnt say anything about it if i wasnt sure that is almost sure for one never can be quite sure about anything  then i dont think one ought to talk about people  oh thats all very well but then at such a place as littlebath one would have to hold ones tongue altogether i let people talk of me and so i talk about them one cant live without it my dear but i dont say things like mrs leake  im sure you dont  but now about sir lionel cant you guess who it is  how should i miss todd i dont know a person in littlebath except you and miss baker  there now you have guessed it i knew you would dont say i told you  miss baker marry sir lionel  yes miss baker marry sir lionel and why not why shouldnt she and why shouldnt he i think it would be very wise i think those sort of marriages often make people very happy  do you think he loves her said adela whose ideas of marriage were of very primitive description  well i dont see why he shouldnt that is in a sort of a way he wont write poetry about her eyebrows if you mean that but i think hed like her to keep his house for him and now that caroline is going away i think shed like to have some one to live with shes not born to be a solitary wild beast as i am  adela was surprised but she had nothing to say she was aware of no reason which it suited her to allege why miss baker should not marry sir lionel bertram had she been asked before she would have said that miss baker seemed settled in her maiden life and that she was but little likely to be moved by the civil speeches of an old military beau but silence was perhaps the more prudent and therefore she said nothing  her fortnight with miss todd passed without much inconvenience to her she had to sit out one or two cardparties and to resist at last with peremptory decision her hosts attempts to take her elsewhere but miss todd was so truly kind so generous so fond of making others happy that she won upon adela at last and they parted excellent friends  i am so fond of miss baker miss todd said on the last morning and i do so truly hope shell be happy but dont you say a word about what i was saying only you watch if it isnt true youll see quite as much of sir lionel there as you have here and so they parted and adela was transferred over to montpellier terrace  there had been some probability that caroline would return to littlebath with her aunt but such was not the case the autumn was advancing to its close it was now november and hardly a month remained before thatmay we say happy dayon which miss waddington was to become lady harcourt there was as miss baker said so much to do and so little time to do it it had therefore been decided that caroline should not return to littlebath  and you have come back only on my account said adela  not at all i should have come back any way for many reasons i like to see mr bertram from time to time especially now that he has acknowledged caroline but it would kill me to stay long at that house did you see much of sir lionel while you were at miss todds  yes a good deal said adela who could hardly keep from smiling as she answered the question  he is always there i believe my idea is that they mean to make a match of it it is indeed  oh no i dont think that  dont you now well you have been in the house and must have seen a great deal but what else can bring him there so much  miss todd says hes always talking about you  about me what nonsense and miss baker went up to her room rather better pleased than she had been  caroline as will be remembered had written to adela with the tidings of her new engagement adela had answered that letter affectionately but shortly wishing her friend every happiness and saying what little in the cheerful vein she could allow herself to say on such an occasion the very shortness of her letter had conveyed condemnation but that adela could not help  caroline had expected condemnation she knew that she would be condemned either by words or by the lack of them it was nearly equal to her by which her mind was in that state that having half condemned herself she would have given anything for a cordial acquittal from one she loved and valued but she did not expect it from adela and she did not receive it  she carried herself with a brave face however to her grandfather to miss baker and to her betrothed she showed no sign of sorrow no sign of repentance but though there was perhaps no repentance in her heart there was much sorrow and much remorse and she could not keep herself wholly silent  she wrote again to adela almost imploring her for pity we need not give the whole letter but a portion of it will show how the poor girls mind was at work i know you have judged me and found me guilty she said i can tell that from the tone of your letter though you were generous enough to endeavour to deceive me but you have condemned me because you do not know me i feel sure that what i am doing is prudent and i think i may say right had i refused sir henrys offer or some other such offerand any offer to me would have been and must have been open to the same objectionswhat should i have done what would have been my career i am not now speaking of happiness but of what use could i have been to any one  you will say that i do not love sir henry i have told him that in the usual acceptation of the word i do not love him but i esteem his high qualities and i shall marry him with the full intention of doing my duty of sacrificing myself to him if needs be of being useful in the position in which he will place me what better can i do than this you can do better adela i know you will do better to have loved and married for love the poorest gentleman on gods earth would be to have done better but i cannot do that now the power of doing that has been taken from me the question with me was whether i should be useful as a wife or useless as an unmarried woman for useless i should have been and petulant and wretched employment work duty will now save me from that dear adela try to look at it in this way if it be possible do not throw me over without an attempt do not be unmerciful        at any rate she ended her letter by sayingat any rate you will come to me in london in the early early spring say that you will do so or i shall think that you mean to abandon me altogether  adela answered this as sweetly and as delicately as she could natures she said were different and it would be presumptuous in her to set herself up as judge on her friends conduct she would abstain from doing so and would pray to god that caroline and sir henry might be happy together and as to going to london in the spring she would do so if her aunt penelopes plans would allow of it she must of course be governed by her aunt penelope who was now hurrying home from italy on purpose to give her a home  nothing further occurred this year at littlebath sufficiently memorable to need relation unless it be necessary further to relate miss bakers nervous apprehensions respecting sir lionel she was in truth so innocent that she would have revealed every day to her young friend the inmost secrets of her heart if she had had secrets but in truth she had none she was desperately jealous of miss todd but she herself knew not why she asked all manner of questions as to his going and coming but she never asked herself why she was so anxious about it she was in a twitter of sentimental restlessness but she did not understand the cause of her own uneasiness on the days that sir lionel came to her she was happy and in good spirits when however he went to miss todd she was fretful sometimes she would rally him on his admiration for her rival but she did it with a bad grace wit repartee and sarcasm were by no means her forte she could not have stood up for five minutes against deaf old mrs leake and when she tried her hand on sir lionel her failure was piteous it merely amounted to a gentle rebuke to him for going to the paragon instead of coming to montpellier terrace adela saw it all and saw also that sir lionel was in no way sincere but what could she do or what could she say  i hope miss todd was quite well yesterday sir lionel miss baker would say  i dont think there was much the matter with her sir lionel would answer she was talking a great deal about you while i was with her  about me he he he im sure you had something better than me to talk of  there could be nothing better the gallant colonel would say  oh couldnt there and when is it to be adela here is most anxious to know  how can you say so miss baker you know i am not anxious at all  well if youre not i am i hope we shall be askedha ha ha  and why did not sir lionel make up his mind and put an end in one way or the other to the torment of this poor lady many reasons guided him in his high policy in the first place he could not make himself certain whether miss todd would accept him or refuse him her money was by far the safer her fortune was assured what she possessed sir lionel already knew to a fraction  but miss baker he was sure would accept him and having accepted him would be amenable to all his little reasons in life obedient conformable and in money matters manageable miss todd on the other hand might nay certainly would have a will of her own he would sooner have taken miss baker with half the money  but then would miss baker have half the money if that stupid old man at hadley would only go and tell the only tale with which it was now possible that he should interest the world then sir lionel would know how to act at any rate he would wait till after the solicitorgenerals marriage it might appear on that occasion whether or no sir henry was to be regarded as the old mans heir in all things if so sir lionel would be prepared to run all matrimonial risks and present miss todd to the world as lady bertram     chapter xv  marriagebells   and now came the day of execution a long day my lord a long day screams the unfortunate culprit from the dock when about to undergo the heaviest sentence of the law but the convicted wretch is a coward by his profession caroline waddington was no coward having made up her mind to a long martyrdom she would not condescend to ask for one short month of grace  i dont like to press you unfairly sir henry had said but you know how i am situated with regard to business  it shall be as you wish caroline had said and so the day had been settled a day hardly more than six months distant from that on which she had half permitted the last embrace from her now forfeited but not forgotten lover  duty was now her watchword to herself for the last six weeks she had been employednay more than employedhard at workdoing the best she could for her future husbands happiness and welfare she had given orders with as much composure as a woman might do who had been the mistress of her lords purse and bosom for the last six years tradesmen conscious of the coming event had had their little delicacies and made their little hints but she had thrown all these to the wind she had spoken of sir henry as sir henry and of herself as being now miss waddington but soon about to be lady harcourt with a studied openness she had looked to carriages and broughamsand horses also under sir henrys protectionas though these things were dear to her soul but they were not dear though in her heart she tried to teach herself that they were so for many a long yearmany at least in her still scanty list of yearsshe had been telling herself that these things were dear that these were the prizes for which men strive and women too that the wise and prudent gained them and that she too would be wise and prudent that she too would gain them she had gained them and before she had essayed to enjoy them they turned into dust before her eyes into ashes between her teeth  gilding and tinsel were no longer bright to her silks and velvet were no longer soft the splendour of her drawingroom the richness of her draperies the luxurious comfort of the chamber that was prepared for her gave her no delight she acquiesced in these things because her lord desired that they should be there and she intended that her lord should be among the rich ones of the earth but not for one moment did she feel even that trumpery joy which comes from an elated spirit  her lord there was the misery there was the great rock against which she feared that the timbers of her bark would go in pieces if she could only have the three first years done and over if she could only jump at once to that time in which habit would have made her fate endurable her lord who was her lord truly had she not in her heart another lord whom her whole soul would worship despite her bodys efforts  and then she began to fear for her beauty not for her own sake not with that sort of sorrow which must attend the waning roses of those ladies who in early years have trusted too much to their loveliness no it was for the sake of him to whom she had sold her beauty she would fain perform her part of that bargain she would fain give him on his marriageday all that had been intended in his purchase if having accepted him she allowed herself to pine and fade away because she was to be his would she not in fact be robbing him would not that be unjust all that she could give him he should have  but neither did sir henry see any change nor did mr bertram nor those others who were round her indeed hers was not a beauty that would fade in such manner when she saw her own eyes heavy with suppressed wretchedness she feared for herself but her power over herself was great and that look was gone as soon as others were with her  but her worst sufferings were at night she would wake from her short slumbers and see him him always before her that him who in the essence of things was still her lord the master of her womans mind the lord of her womans soul to screen her eyes from that sight she would turn her moistened face to the pillow but her eyeballs would flash in the darkness and she would still see him there there before her she would see him as he stood beside her with manly bashfulness when on the side of olivet he first told her that he loved her she would see him as he had sometimes sat in his sweetest moods in that drawingroom at littlebath talking to her with rapid utterance with sweet but energetic utterance saying words which she did not always fully understand but which she felt to be full of wit full of learning full of truth ah how proud she had been of him thenso proud of him though she would never say so and then she would see him as he came to her on that fatal day boiling in his wrath speaking such words as had never before reached her ears words however of which so many had been tinged by an inexpressible tenderness  then she would turn herself in her bed and by a strong effort of her will she would for a while throw off such thoughts she would count over to herself the chairs and tables she had ordered the cups and china bowls which were to decorate her room till sleep would come againbut in sleep she would still dream of him ah that there might have been no waking from such dreams  but in the morning she would come down to breakfast with no trouble on her outward brow she was minutely particular in her dress even when no one but her grandfather was to see the effects of her toilet her hair was scrupulously neat her dresses were rich and in the newest fashion her future career was to be that of lady harcourt a leader of ton and she was determined to commence her new duties with a good grace  and so from week to week and day to day she prepared herself for the sacrifice  miss baker of course returned to hadley a day or two before the ceremony the recent death of old mr gauntlet was adelas excuse for not being present had there been no such excuse she would have been forced to act a bridesmaids part it was much better for both of them that she had not to perform the task  bridesmaids were chosen in londoneight of them these were not special friends of carolines indeed it had not been her instinct to attach to herself special friends circumstances had created friendship between her and adela unlike in all things as they were to each other but other bosomfriends caroline had not nor had she felt the want of them  this was perhaps well for her now it would have driven her to madness if among the bevy of attendant nymphs there had been any to whom it would have been necessary for her to open her heartto open it or to pretend to open it much she could do much she was now doing much she was prepared to do but she could not have spoken with missish rapture of her coming happiness nor could she to any ears have laid bare the secrets of her bosom  so eight young ladies were had from london two were secondcousins by her fathers side one who was very full of the universal joy that was to follow this happy event was a sister of sir henrys a fourth was the daughter of an old crony of miss bakers and the other four were got to orderthere being no doubt a repertory for articles so useful and so ornamental  old mr bertram behaved well on the occasion he told miss baker that nothing was to be sparedin moderation and he left her to be sole judge of what moderation meant she poor woman knew well enough that she would have at some future day to fight over with him the battle of the bills but for the moment he affected generosity and so a fitting breakfast was prepared  and then the bells were rung the hadley bells the merry marriagebells   i know full well the tone with which they toll when the soul is ushered to its last long rest i have stood in that green churchyard when earth has been laid to earth ashes to ashes dust to dustthe ashes and the dust that were loved so well   but now the scene was of another sort how merrily they rang those joyous marriagebells youth was now to know the full delight of matured happiness soul should be joined to soul heart to heart hand to hand manly strength and vigour to all the grace and beauty of womanhood the world was pleasant with its most joyous smile as it opened its embraces to the young pairabout to be two no longernow to become one bone and one flesh out rung the hadley bells the happy marriagebells  and when should bells ring so joyously do they not give promise of all that this world knows of happiness what is love sweet pure love but the anticipation of this the natural longing for this the consummation of our loving here to neither man nor woman does the world fairly begin till seated together in their first mutual home they bethink themselves that the excitement of their honeymoon is over it would seem that the full meaning of the word marriage can never be known by those who at their first outspring into life are surrounded by all that money can give it requires the single sittingroom the single fire the necessary little efforts of selfdevotion the inward declaration that some struggle shall be made for that other one some worlds struggle of which wealth can know nothing one would almost wish to be poor that one might work for ones wife almost wish to be ill used that one might fight for her  he as he goes forth to his labour swears within his heart that by gods help on his endeavours all shall go well with her and she as she stands musing alone in her young home with a soft happy tear in her bright eye she also swears in her heart that by gods help his home shall be to him the sweetest spot on the earths surface then should not marriagebells ring joyously ah my friends do not count too exactly your three hundreds a yearyour four hundreds try the world but try it with industry and truth not with idleness and falsehood  and now sir henry and lady harcourt were to try the world in sweet communion together one may say that as to doubt about the trial there was need of none he had more than won his spurs he was already a practised knight in the highest flight of the worlds tourneys and for her too there was little cause of fear they who saw her arrayed in that bright frosty marriage morning and watched the majesty of her brow the brilliancy of her eye the grace and dignity of her step all swore that the young lawyer had done well he had found for himself a meet companion for his high career a proper bride for his coming greatness and so the marriagebells rang on with all their merriness with all their joy  and now the words have been said the vows have been plighted the magic circlet of pure gold has done its wondrous work the priest smiles and grasps their hands as he gives them his parting friendly blessing laughing bridesmaids press in to sign the book and all observe that no signature was ever written with more decision than that of caroline waddington  caroline waddington now no longer yes the deed had in truth been done the vows had been plighted she had taken this man to be her wedded husband to live together with him after gods ordinance she had sworn to obey him and serve him and ah ah ah how had she lived while that word was uttered to her how had she lived to swear that falsest oath  but it was not then while standing at the altar that the struggle had been made then she did but act her part as some stagequeen acts hers she acted it well that was all there was no meaning in her words then though her lips moved she swore no oath her oath had been sworn before that  no educated woman we may suppose stands at the altar as a bride without having read and reread those words till they are closely fixed on her memory it is a great oath and a woman should know well what that is to which she is about to pledge herself caroline waddington had studied them well she would live with him after gods ordinance that is as his wife yes she was prepared for that she would obey him yes if obedience were required she would give it serve him oh yes certainly to the best of her power of mind and body love him no she was bold at least if not righteous no she could not love him but then how few who were married complied with all those behests how many were undutiful disobedient careless might not she except for herself one point be false on one article if she were true in so many she would honour him for honour was possible to her she would keep him in sickness and health and forsaking all otheryes all other in body certainly in heart too if god would give her easeand keep herself only to him her husband and so she swore to it all before she went thereall with the one exception  and sir henry swore toowith a light indifferent oath which however he had no intention of breaking in any part he would live with her and love her and comfort her and all that sort of thingand very well she would look at the top of his table in black velvet  and the merry bells went on ringing as they trooped back to the old mans house they went in gay carriages though the distance was but some hundred yards but brides and bridegrooms cannot walk on their weddingdays in all their gala garments though it be but a few hundred yards  and then as they entered the breakfastroom the old man met them and blessed them he was too infirm to go to church and had seen none of them before the ceremony but now that the deed was done he also was there dressed in his best his last new coat not more than twelve years old his dress waistcoat sent home before the reform bill his newest shoes which creaked twice worse than any of their older brethren but when a man can shower thousands on a wedded pair what do they or even the bridesmaids care about his clothes  and then after this fashion he blessed themnot holding each a hand as he might otherwise have done for his infirmities compelled him to use two crutches  i wish you joy sir henryof your bridewith all my heart and a bonny bride she is and well able to take her place in the world though youll be rich and well to do youll not find her overextravagant and though her fortunes not much for a man like you perhaps she might have had less mightnt she ha ha ha little as it is it will helpit will help and youll not find debts coming home after her im sure of that shell keep your house well together and your money toobut i guess youll not leave that to her keeping  and i wish you joy with all my heart my lady harcourt youve done very wellmuch better doubtless than we were thinking of you and me too and as for me i was an old fool mr bertram was doubtless thinking of that interview with his nephew much better much better your husbands a rising man and hell live to be a rich man i have always thought a lawyers profession very good for a man who would know how to make money at it sir henry knows how to do that well so i wish you joy with all my heart lady bertramharcourt i mean and now well sit down and have a bit of something to eat such was the marriageblessing of this old man who knew and understood the world so well to be lady harcourt and have the spending of three or four thousand a year what a destiny was that for his granddaughter and to have achieved that without any large call upon his own purse  it was not intended that sir henry and his bride were to sit down to the breakfast that is i believe now voted to be a boreand always should have been so voted they had done or were now to do their necessary eating in private and the company was to see no more of them an effort had been made to explain this to mr bertram but it had not been successful so when caroline kissed him and bade him adieu after his little speech he expressed himself surprised  what off before the breakfast whats the good of the breakfast then his idea in his extravagance had been that he would give a last feed to the solicitorgeneral but he had another piece of extravagance in his mind which he had been unable to bring himself to perpetrate till the last moment but which now he did perpetrate  sir henry sir henry and he toddled to a window here youll be spending a lot of money on her in foreign parts and i think you have behaved well here and he slipped a bit of paper into his hands but remember it will be the last and sir henry remember the interest of the three thousandpunctuallyeh sir henry  sir henry noddedthanked himslipped the bit of paper into his pocket and followed his bride to the carriage  your grandfather has just given me five hundred pounds was his first word in private to his wife  has he said lady harcourt im very glad of it very and so she was what else had she to be glad of now except hundredsand hundredsand hundreds of pounds  and so they were whisked away to london to dover to paris to nice      sed post equitem sedet atra cura   the care was very black that sat behind that female knight but we will not

all the joys of that honeymoon shall be left to the imagination of the reader their first conversation as it took place in the carriage which bore them from mr bertrams door has been given those which followed were probably more or less of the same nature sir henry no doubt did strive to give some touch of romance to the occasion but in no such attempt would his wife assist him to every material proposition that he made she gave a ready assent in everything she acceded to his views she would dine at two or at eight as he pleased she was ready to stay two weeks or only two days in paris as best suited him she would adapt herself to pictures or to architecture or to theatres or to society or to going on and seeing nothing exactly as he adapted himself she never frowned or looked black or had headaches or couldnt go on or wouldnt stay still or turned herself into a niobean deluge as some ladies and very nice ladies too will sometimes do on their travels but she would not talk of love or hold his hand or turn her cheek to his she had made her bargain and would keep to it of that which she had promised him she would give him full measure of that which she had not promised himof which she had explained to him that she had nothing to giveof that she would make no attempt to give anything  so they spent their christmas and opened the new year at nice and made an excursion along the cornice road to genoa during which lady harcourt learned for the first time that the people of italy are not so free from cold winds as is generally imagined and then early in february they returned to their house in eaton square how she soon became immersed in society and he in parliament and the county courts we may also leave to the imagination of the reader in a month or two from that time when the rigours of a london may shall have commenced we will return to them again in the meantime we must go back to hadleythe two old bertrams and dear miss baker  the marriagefeast prepared by miss baker for the wedding guests did not occupy very long nor was there any great inducement for those assembled to remain with mr bertram he and miss baker soon found themselves again alone and were no sooner alone than the business of life recommenced  its a very splendid match for her said mr bertram  yes i suppose it is said miss baker miss baker in her heart of hearts had never quite approved of the marriage  and now mary what do you mean to do  oh ill see and get these things taken away said she  yes yes stop a minute thats of course but what i mean is what do you mean to do with yourself you cant go back and live at littlebath all alone  if i were to use the word flabbergasted as expressing miss bakers immediate state of mind i should draw down on myself the just anger of the critics in that i had condescended to the use of slang but what other word will so well express what is meant she had fully intended to go back to littlebath and had intended to do so at the earliest moment that would be possible was not sir lionel still at littlebath and moreover she fully intended to live there that she would have some little difficulty in the matter she had anticipated her own incomethat which was indefeasibly her ownwas very small by far too small to admit of her permanently keeping on those rooms in montpellier terrace hitherto their income her own and carolines put together had been very comfortable for mr bertram had annually paid to her a sum which of itself would have been sufficient for her own living but she had not known what difference carolines marriage might make in this allowance it had been given to herself without any specification that it had been so given for any purpose but yet it had been an understood thing that caroline was to live with her and be supported and though carolines income had also been used it had gone rather in luxurious enjoyments than in necessary expenses in the keep of a horse for instance in a journey to jerusalem in a new grand piano and such like now there might naturally be a doubt whether under altered circumstances this allowance from mr bertram would remain unaltered  but it had never occurred to her that she would be asked to live at hadley that idea did now occur to her and therefore she stood before her uncle hesitating in her answer andmay my inability to select any better word be taken in excuseflabbergasted in her mind and feelings  but her doom followed quickly on her hesitation because said mr bertram there is plenty of room here there can be no need of two houses and two establishments now you had better send for your things and fix yourself here at once  but i couldnt leave the rooms at littlebath without a quarters noticethe cowards plea a long day my lord a long daythat was particularly understood when i got them so cheap  there will be no difficulty in reletting them at this time of the year growled mr bertram  oh no i suppose not one would have to pay something of course but dear me one can hardly leave the place where one has lived so long all of a moment  why not demanded the tyrant  well i dont know i can hardly say why not but one has so many people to see and so many things to do and so much to pack up  it may be easily conceived that in such an encounter miss baker would not achieve victory she had neither spirit for the fight nor power to use it even had the spirit been there but she effected a compromise by the very dint of her own weakness yes certainly she said as mr bertram thought it best she would be very happy to live with him at hadleymost happy of course but mightnt she go down and pack up her things and settle with everybody and say goodbye to her friends oh those friends that horrible miss todd  and thus she got a month of grace she was to go down immediately after christmasday and be up again at hadley and fixed there permanently before the end of january  she wrote to caroline on the subject rather plaintively but owning that it was of course her duty to stay by her uncle now that he was so infirm it would be very dull of course she said but any place would be dull now that she caroline was gone and it would be sad giving up her old friends she named one or two and among them sir lionel it would be a great pleasure to me she went on to say if i could be the means of reconciling the two brothersnot but what sir henry harcourt will always be mr bertrams favourite i am sure of that i dont think i shall mind leaving miss todd though she does pretend to be so friendly i was never quite sure she was sincere and then she does talk so very loud and in spite of all she says i am not sure shes not looking out for a husband  and then she went back to littlebath intent on enjoying her short reprieve something might happen she did not ask herself what the old gentleman might not last long but she certainly did not speculate on his death orshe had a sort of an idea that there might be an or though she never allowed herself to dwell on it as a reality but on one point she did make up her mind that if it should be her destiny to keep house for either of those two gentlemen she would much rather keep house for sir lionel than for his brother  her absolute moneydealings had always been with mr pritchett and as she passed through town mr pritchett came to her and made her the usual quarterly payment  but mr pritchett said she i am going to live with mr bertram after another month or so  oh maam yes maam that will be very proper maam i always supposed it would be so when miss caroline was gone said pritchett in a melancholy tone  but will it be proper for me to have this money now  oh yes maam it wouldnt be my duty to stop any payments till i get orders mr bertram never forgets anything maam if hed meant me to stop it he wouldnt have forgot to say so  oh very well mr pritchett and miss baker was going away  but one word if you please maam i dont detain you maam do i and you might have guessed by pritchetts voice that he was quite willing to let her go if she wished even though his own death on the spot might be the instant result  oh dear no mr pritchett said miss baker  we all see how things have gone maam nowabout miss caroline i mean  yes she is lady harcourt now  oh yes i know that maam and mr pritchett here sank to the lowest bathos of misery i know shes lady harcourt very well i didnt mean her ladyship any disrespect  oh dear no of course not mr pritchett who would think such a thing of you whos known her from a baby  yes i have knowd her from a babby maam thats just it and ive knowd you from amost a babby too maam  that was a very long time ago mr pritchett  yes it is some years now certainly miss baker im not so young as i was i know that mr pritchetts voice at this juncture would have softened the heart of any stone that had one but this is what it is maam youre going to live with the old gentleman now  yes i believe i am  well now about mr george maam  mr george  yes mr george miss baker it aint of course for me to say anything of what goes on between young ladies and young gentlemen i dont know anything about it and never did and i dont suppose i never shall now but they two was to have been one and now theyre two mr pritchett could not get on any further without pausing for breath  the match was broken off you know  it was broke off i say nothing about that nor about them who did it i know nothing and therefore i say nothing but this i do say that it will be very hardvery hard and very cruel if so that the old gentleman is set against mr george because sir henry harcourt has got a handle to his name for himself  the conference ended in a promise on miss bakers part that she at least would say nothing against mr george but with an assurance also that it was impossible for her to say anything in his favour  you may be sure of this mr pritchett that my uncle will never consult me about his money  hell never consult any human being maam he wouldnt consult solomon if solomon were to go to hadley o purpose but you might slip in a word that mr george was not in fault mightnt you maam  miss baker reiterated her promise that she would not at any rate say anything evil of george bertram  he is such a foolish young man maam so like a baby about money its thats why i feel for him because he is so foolish  and then miss baker prosecuted her journey and reached littlebath in safety  she had not been long there before sir lionel had heard all the news miss baker without knowing that a process of pumping had been applied to her soon made him understand that for the present sir harcourt had certainly not been received into the place of heir it was clear that but a very moderate amount of the old gentlemans wealthhe was usually now called the old gentleman by them all sir lionel miss baker mr pritchett and othershad been bestowed on the rising lawyer and that as far as that point was concerned the game was still open but then if it was open to him sir lionel through miss baker it was also open to his son george and it appeared from miss bakers testimony that during the whole period of these wedding doings no word had escaped the mouth of the old gentleman in vituperation or anger against george perhaps george after all might be the best card oh what an excellent card might he be if he would only consent to guide himself by the commonest rules of decent prudence but then as mr pritchett had truly observed mr george was so foolish moreover sir lionel was not blind to the reflection that the old gentleman would never countenance his marriage with miss baker whatever mr bertrams good intentions miss bakerwards might be they would undoubtedly be frustrated by such a marriage if sir lionel decided on miss baker things must be so arranged that the marriage should be postponed till that tedious old gentleman should move himself off the scene and the tedious old gentleman moreover must not be allowed to know anything about it  but with miss todd there need be no secrecy no drawback no delayno drawback but that of doubtful reception and after reception of doubtful masterdom  on thorough review of all the circumstances much balancing them in his high mind sir lionel at last thus resolved he would throw himself his heart and his fortune at the feet of miss todd if there accepted he would struggle with every muscle of the manhood which was yet within him for that supremacy in purse and power which of law and of right belongs to the man he thought he knew himself and that it would not be easy for a woman to get the better of him but if there rejectedand he could not confess but what there was a doubthe would immediately fall back upon miss baker whatever he did must be done immediately for in less than a months time miss baker would be out of his reach altogether as to seeking miss baker at hadley that would be above even his courage all must be done within the next month if on miss baker was to fall the honour of being lady bertram she must not only receive him within the month but having done so must also agree to wear her vestal zone yet a little longer till that troublesome old gentleman should have departed  such being his months workhe had not quite four weeks left when he came to this resolutionhe wisely resolved to commence it at once  so on one monday morning he sallied out to the paragon about two oclock at that hour he knew miss todd would be surely at home for at halfpast one she ate her lunch in the regularity of her eatings and her drinkings miss todd might have been taken as an example by all the ladies of littlebath sir lionels personal appearance has been already described considering his age he was very well preserved he was still straight did not fumble much in his walk and had that decent look of military decorum which since the days of cæsar and the duke has been always held to accompany a hooknose he had considered much about his toilet indeed he did that habitually but on this occasion he had come to the conclusion that he had better make no unusual sacrifice to the graces a touch of the curlingiron to his whiskers or a surtout that should be absolutely fresh from the tailors hands might have an effect with miss baker but if any impression was to be made on miss todd it would not be done by curled whiskers or a new coat she must be won if won at all by the unsophisticated man  so the unsophisticated man knocked at the door in the paragon yes miss todd was at home up he went and found not only miss todd but also with miss todd the venerable mrs shortpointz settling all the details for a coming rubber of whist for that evening  ah sir lionel how do sit down very well my dearmiss todd called everybody my dear even sir lionel himself sometimes but on the present occasion she was addressing mrs shortpointzill be there at eight but mind this i wont sit down with lady ruth nor yet with miss ruff so spoke miss todd who by dint of her suppers and voice was becoming rather autocratic at littlebath  you shant miss todd lady ruth  very well thats all i bargain for and now heres sir lionel how lucky sir lionel you can be so civil and so useful do give mrs shortpointz your arm home her niece was to call but theres been some mistake and mrs shortpointz does not like walking alone come sir lionel  sir lionel strove against the order but it was in vain he had to yield and walked away with old mrs shortpointz on his arm it was hard we must acknowledge that a man of sir lionels age and standing should be so employed at such a moment because that flirt maria shortpointz had gone out to see young mr garded ride by in his pink coat and spattered boots he would have let her fall and break her leg only that by doing so he would have prolonged the time of his own attendance on her she lived half across littlebath and her step ordinarily slow was slower then usual now that she was leaning on a knights arm at last she was deposited at home and the gallant colonel having scornfully repudiated her offer of cake and sherry flew back to the paragon on the wings of lovein a street cab for which he had to pay eighteenpence  but he was all too late miss todd had gone out in her fly just three minutes since and thus a whole day was lost  on the tuesday in proper course he was due at miss bakers but for this turn miss baker must be neglected at the same hour he again knocked at the door of the paragon and was again admitted and now miss todd was all alone she was rarely left so very long and the precious moments must be seized at once sir lionel with that military genius which was so peculiarly his own determined to use his yesterdays defeat in aid of todays victory he would make even mrs shortpointz serviceable  when gentlemen past sixty make love to ladies past forty it may be supposed that they are not so dilatory in their proceedings as younger swains and younger maidens time is then behind them not before them and urges them on to quick decisions it may be presumed moreover that this pair knew their own minds  how cruel you were to me yesterday said sir lionel seating himself not very close to hernor yet very far from her  what about poor mrs shortpointz ha ha ha poor old lady she didnt think so i am sure one ought to be of use sometimes you know sir lionel  true true miss todd quite true but i was particularly unfortunate yesterday i wished that mrs shortpointz was hanginganywhere except on my arm i did indeed  ha ha ha poor mrs shortpointz and she was so full of you last night the beau ideal of manly beauty that was what she called you she did indeed ha ha ha  she was very kind  and then we all quizzed her about you and miss finesse called her lady bertram you cant think how funny we old women are when we get together there wasnt a gentleman in the roomexcept mr fuzzybell and he never seems to make any difference but i tell you what sir lionel a certain friend of yours didnt seem to like it when we called mrs shortpointz lady bertram  and were you that friend miss todd  i ha ha ha no not i but miss baker and ill tell you what sir lionel said miss todd intending to do a kinder act for miss baker than miss baker would have done for her and ill tell you what miss baker is the nicestlooking woman of her time of life in littlebath i dont care who the other is i never saw her look better than she did last night never this was goodnatured on the part of miss todd but it sounded in sir lionels ears as though it did not augur well for his hopes  yes shes very nice very nice indeed but i know one miss todd thats much nicer and sir lionel drew his chair a little nearer  what mrs shortpointz i suppose ha ha ha well every man to his taste  i wonder whether i may speak to you seriously miss todd for five minutes  oh laws yes why not but dont tell me any secrets sir lionel for i shant keep them  i hope what i may say need not be kept a secret long you joke with me about miss baker but you cannot really believe that my affections are placed there you must i think have guessed by this time  i am the worst hand in the world at guessing anything  i am not a young man miss todd  no and she isnt a young woman shes fifty it would all be very proper in that respect  im not thinking of miss baker miss todd  dear well now i really thought you were thinking of her and ill tell you this sir lionel if you want a wife to look after you you couldnt do better than think of hera nice goodtempered cheerful easy goodlooking woman with none of the littlebath nastiness about herand a little money too ive no doubt how could you do better than think of her would it not have softened miss bakers heart towards her friend if she could have heard all this  ah you say this to try me i know you do  try you no but i want you to try miss baker  well i am going to make an attempt of that kind certainly certainly i am but it is not with miss baker as i cannot but think you know and then he paused to collect his ideas and take in at a coup doeil the weak point to which his attack should be turned meanwhile miss todd sat silent she knew by this time what was coming and knew also that in courtesy the gentleman should be allowed to have his say sir lionel drew his chair again nearerit was now very nearand thus began  dear sarah how he had found out that miss todds name was sarah it might be difficult to say her signature was s todd and sir lionel had certainly never heard her called by her christian name but facts were with him she undoubtedly had been christened sarah  dear sarah  ha ha ha ha ha ha laughed miss todd with terrible loudness with a shaking of her sides throwing herself backwards and forwards in the corner of her sofa it was not civil and so sir lionel felt when you first call your ladylove by her christian name you do not like to have the little liberty made a subject of ridiculeyou feel it by far less if the matter be taken up seriously against you as a crime on your part  ha ha ha continued miss todd roaring in her laughter louder than ever i dont think sir lionel i was ever called sarah before since the day i was born and it does sound so funny sarah ha ha ha  sir lionel was struck dumb what could he say when his little tenderness was met in such a manner  call me sally if you like sir lionel my brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts and all those sort of people always called me sally but sarah ha ha ha suppose you call me sally sir lionel  sir lionel tried but he could not call her sally his lips at that moment would not form the sound  but the subject had now been introduced if he should ever be able to claim her as his own he might then call her sarah or sally or use any other term of endearment which the tenderness of the moment might suggest when that day should come perhaps he might have his own little joke but in the meantime the plunge had been taken and he could now swim on  miss todd you now know what my feelings are and i hope that you will at any rate not disapprove of them we have known each other for some time and have i hope enjoyed and valued each others society miss todd here made a little bow but she said nothing she had a just perception that sir lionel should be permitted to have his say and that as matters had become serious it would be well for her to wait till he had done and then she might have her say so she merely bowed by way of giving a civil acquiescence in sir lionels last little suggestion  i have hoped so dear miss toddhe had taken a moment to consider and thought that he had better drop the sarah altogether for the present in myself i can safely say that it has been so with you i feel that i am happy and at my ease your modes of thought and way of life are all such as i admire and approvemiss todd again bowedandandwhat i mean is that i think we both live very much after the same fashion  miss todd who knew everything that went on in littlebath and was au fait at every bit of scandal and tittletattle in the place had probably heard more of the fashion of sir lionels life than he was aware in places such as littlebath ladies such as miss todd do have sources of information which are almost miraculous but still she said nothing she merely thought that sir lionel was a good deal mistaken in the opinion which he had last expressed  i am not a young man continued sir lionel my brother you know is a very old man and there are but fifteen years difference between us this was a mistake of sir lionels the real difference being ten years and you i know are hardly yet past your youth  i was fortyfive last guy fawkes day said miss todd  then there are fifteen years difference between us the reader will please to read twenty can you look over that difference and take me old as i am for your companion for life shall we not both be happier if we have such a companion as to money  oh sir lionel dont trouble about that nor yet about your age if i wanted to marry id as lief have an old man as a young one perhaps liefer and as to money ive got enough for myself and i have no doubt you have toonevertheless miss todd did know of that heavy overdue bill at the livery stables and had heard that the very natty groom who never left sir lionels phaëton for a moment was a sworn bailiff sworn to bring the carriage and horses back to the liverystable yardbut the fact is i dont want to marry  do you mean miss todd that you will prefer to live in solitude for ever  oh as for solitude im not much of a robinson crusoe nor yet an alexander selkirk i never found any of its charms but lord bless you sir lionel people never leave me in solitude im never alone my sister patty has fifteen children i could have half of them to live with me if i liked it this view of the case did throw some cold water on sir lionels ardour  and you are quite resolved on this he said with a dash of expiring sentiment in his tone  what to have pattys children no i find it more convenient to pay for their schooling  but you are quite resolved tototo give me no other no more favourable answer  oh about marrying on that subject sir lionel my mind is altogether made up miss todd i am and miss todd i mean to remain to tell the truth plainly i like to be number one in my own house lady bertram i am quite sure will be a fortunate and happy woman but then shell be number two i take it eh sir lionel  sir lionel smiled and laughed and looked at the ground and then looked up again but he did not deny the imputation well said he i trust we shall still remain friends  oh certainly why not replied miss todd  and so they parted sir lionel took his hat and stick and went his way     chapter ii  he tries his hand again   miss todd shook hands with him as he went and then putting on her bonnet and cloak got into her fly  she felt some little triumph at her heart in thinking that sir lionel had wished to marry her had she not she would hardly have been a woman but by far her strongest feeling was one of dislike to him for not having wished to marry miss baker she had watched the gallant soldier closely for the last year and well knew how tenderly he had been used to squeeze miss bakers hand he had squeezed her own hand too but what was that she made others the subject of jokes and was prepared to be joked upon herself whatever oliver sir lionel or other person might give her she would give back to him or to heralways excepting mrs leakea rowland that should be quite as good but miss baker was no subject for a joke and sir lionel was in duty bound to have proposed to her  it is perhaps almost true that no one can touch pitch and not be defiled miss todd had been touching pitch for many years past and was undoubtedly defiled to a certain extent but the grime with her had never gone deep it was not ingrained it had not become an ineradicable stain it was dirt on which soapandwater might yet operate may we not say that her truth and goodnature and love of her fellowcreatures would furnish her at last with the means whereby she might be cleansed  she was of the world worldly it in no way disgusted her that sir lionel was an old rip and that she knew him to be so there were a great many old male rips at littlebath and elsewhere miss todds path in life had brought her across more than one or two such she encountered them without horror welcomed them without shame and spoke of them with a laugh rather than a shudder her idea was that such a rip as sir lionel would best mend his manners by marriage by marriage but not with her she knew better than trust herself to any sir lionel  and she had encountered old female rips that is if dishonesty in moneydealings selfishness coarseness vanity absence of religion and false pretences when joined to age may be held as constituting an old female rip many such had been around her frequently she would laugh with them feed them call on them lose her money to them and feel herself no whit degraded such company brought on her no conviction of shame but yet she was not of them coarse she was but neither dishonest nor selfish nor vain nor irreligious nor false  such being the nature of the woman she had not found it necessary to display any indignation when sir lionel made his offer but she did feel angry with him on miss bakers behalf why had he deceived that woman and made an ass of himself had he had any wit any knowledge of character he would have known what sort of an answer he was likely to get if he brought his vows and offers to the paragon there he had been received with no special favour no lures had been there displayed to catch him he had not been turned out of the house when he came there and that was all so now as she put on her bonnet she determined to punish sir lionel  but in accusing her suitor of want of judgment she was quite in the dark as to his real course of action she little knew with how profound a judgment he was managing his affairs had she known she would hardly have interfered as she now did as she put her foot on the step of the fly she desired her servant to drive to montpellier terrace  she was shown into the drawingroom and there she found miss baker and miss gauntlet not our friend adela but miss penelope gauntlet who was now again settled in littlebath  well ladies said miss todd walking up the room with wellassured foot and full comfortable presence ive news to tell you  they both of them saw at a glance that she had news between miss p gauntlet and miss todd there had never been cordiality miss todd was as we have said of the world worldly whereas miss gauntlet was of dr snort godly she belonged plainly to the third set of which we have spoken miss todd was an amalgamation of the two first miss baker however was a point of union a connecting rod there was about her a savouring of the fragrance of ebenezer but accompanied it must be owned by a whiff of brimstone thus these three ladies were brought together and as it was manifest that miss todd had news to tell the other two were prepared to listen  what do you think ladies and she sat herself down filling an armchair with her goodly person what do you think has happened to me today  perhaps the doctor has been with you said miss p gauntlet not alluding to the littlebath galen but meaning to insinuate that miss todd might have come thither to tell them of her conversion from the world  better than ten doctors my dearmiss penelope drew herself up very stifflyor twenty ive had an offer of marriage what do you think of that  miss p gauntlet looked as though she thought a great deal of it she certainly did think that had such an accident happened to her she would not have spoken of it with such a voice or before such an audience but now her face which was always long and thin became longer and thinner and she sat with her mouth open expecting further news  miss baker became rather red then rather pale and then red again she put out her hand and took hold of the side of the chair in which she sat but she said nothing her heart told her that that offer had been made by sir lionel  you dont wish me joy ladies said miss todd  but you have not told us whether you accepted it said miss penelope  ha ha ha no thats the worst of it no i didnt accept it but upon my word it was made  then it was not sir lionel thought miss baker releasing her hold of the chair and feeling that the blood about her heart was again circulating  and is that all that we are to know asked miss penelope  oh my dears you shall know it all i told my lover that i should keep no secrets but come you shall guess who was it miss baker  i couldnt say at all said miss baker in a faint voice  perhaps mr ocallaghan suggested miss penelope conscious probably that an ardent young evangelical clergyman is generally in want of an income  mr ocallaghan shouted miss todd throwing up her head with scorn pho the gentleman i speak of would have made me a lady lady now who do you think it was miss baker  oh i couldnt guess at all said poor miss baker but she now knew that it was sir lionel it might have been worse however and that she feltmuch worse  was it sir lionel bertram asked the other  ah miss gauntlet you know all about the gentlemen of littlebath i can see that it was sir lionel wasnt that a triumph  and you refused him asked miss penelope  of course i did you dont mean to say that you think i would have accepted him  to this miss penelope made no answer her opinions were of a mixed sort she partly misbelieved miss toddpartly wondered at her unmarried ladies of a certain age whatever may be their own feelings in regard to matrimony on their own behalf seem always impressed with a conviction that other ladies in the same condition would certainly marry if they got an opportunity miss penelope could not believe that miss todd had rejected sir lionel but at the same time she could not but be startled also by the great fact of such a rejection at any rate her course of duty was open littlebath should be enlightened on the subject before the drawingroom candles were lit that evening or at any rate that set in littlebath to which she belonged so she rose from her chair and declaring that she had sat an unconscionable time with miss baker departed diligent about her work  well what do you think of that my dear said miss todd as soon as the two of them were left alone  it was strange that miss todd who was ordinarily so goodnatured who was so especially intent on being goodnatured to miss baker should have thus roughly communicated to her friend tidings which were sure to wound but she had omitted to look at it in this light her intention had been to punish sir lionel for having been so grossly false and grossly foolish she had seen through himat least hardly through him had seen at least that he must have been doubting between the two ladies and that he had given up the one whom he believed to be the poorer she did not imagine it possible that after having offered to her he should then go with a similar offer to miss baker had such an idea arisen in her mind she would certainly have allowed miss baker to take her chance of promotion unmolested  miss baker gave a long sigh now that miss gauntlet was gone she felt herself better able to speak but nevertheless any speech on the subject was difficult to her her kind heart at once forgave miss todd there could now be no marriage between that false one and her friend and therefore if the ice would only get itself broken she would not be unwilling to converse upon the subject but how to break the ice  i always thought he would at last she said  did you said miss todd well he certainly used to come there but i never knew why sometimes i thought it was to talk about you  oh no said miss baker plaintively  i gave him no encouragementnone whateverused to send him here and thereanything to get rid of him sometimes i thought and then miss todd hesitated  thought what asked miss baker  well i dont want to be illnatured but sometimes i thought that he wanted to borrow money and didnt exactly know how to begin  to borrow money he had once borrowed money from miss baker  well i dont know i only say i thought so he never did  miss baker sighed again and then there was a slight pause in the conversation  but miss todd  well my dear  do you think that  think what speak out my dear you may before me if youve got any secret ill keep it  oh ive got no secret only this do you think that sir lionel isis poorthat he should want to borrow money  well poor i hardly know what you call poor but we all know that he is a distressed man i suppose he has a good income and a little ready money would perhaps set him up but theres no doubt about his being over head and ears in debt i suppose  this seemed to throw a new and unexpected light on miss bakers mind i thought he was always so very respectable said she  hummm said miss todd who knew the world  eh said miss baker who did not  it depends on what one means by respectable said miss todd  i really thought he was so very  hummmm repeated miss todd shaking her head  and then there was a little conversation carried on between these ladies so entirely sotto voce that the reporter of this scene was unable to hear a word of it but this he could see that miss todd bore by far the greater part in it  at the end of it miss baker gave another and a longer and a deeper sigh but you know my dear said miss todd in her most consolatory voice and these words were distinctly audible nothing does a man of that sort so much good as marrying  does it asked miss baker  certainly if his wife knows how to manage him  and then miss todd departed leaving miss baker with much work for her thoughts her female friend miss baker had quite forgiven but she felt that she could never quite forgive him to have deceived me so she said to herself recurring to her old idea of his great respectability but nevertheless it was probably his other sin that rankled deepest in her mind  of miss baker it may be said that she had hardly touched the pitch at any rate that it had not defiled her  sir lionel was somewhat ill at ease as he walked from the paragon to his livery stables he had certainly looked upon success with miss todd as by no means sure but nevertheless he was disappointed let any of us in any attempt that we may make convince ourselves with ever so much firmness that we shall fail yet we are hardly the less downhearted when the failure comes we assure ourselves that we are not sanguine but we assure ourselves falsely it is mans nature to be sanguine his nature and perhaps his greatest privilege  and sir lionel as he walked along began to fear that his own scruples would now stand in the way of that other marriageof that second string to his bow when in making his little private arrangements within his own mind he had decided that if miss todd rejected him he would forthwith walk off to miss baker it never occurred to him that his own feelings would militate against such a proceeding but such was now absolutely the fact having talked about dear sarah he found that even he would have a difficulty in bringing himself to the utterance of dear mary  he went to bed however that night with the comfortable reflection that any such nonsense would be dissipated by the morning but when the morning camehis morning one pmhis feeling he found was the same he could not see miss baker that day  he was disgusted and disappointed with himself he had flattered himself that he was gifted with greater firmness and now that he found himself so wanting in strength of character he fretted and fumed as men will do even at their own faults he swore to himself that he would go tomorrow and that evening went to bed early trying to persuade himself that indigestion had weakened him he did great injustice however to as fine a set of internal organs as ever blessed a man of sixty  at two oclock next day he dressed himself for the campaign in montpellier terrace but when dressed he was again disorganised he found that he could not do it he told himself over and over again that with miss baker there need be no doubt she at least would accept him he had only to smile there and she would smile again he had only to say dear mary and those soft eyes would be turned to the ground and the battle would be won  but still he could not do it he was sick he was ill he could not eat his breakfast he looked in the glass and found himself to be yellow and wrinkled and wizened he was not half himself there were yet three weeks before miss baker would leave littlebath it was on the whole better that his little arrangement should be made immediately previous to her departure he would leave littlebath for ten days and return a new man so he went up to london and bestowed his time upon his son  at the end of the ten days much of his repugnance had worn off but still the sound of that word sarah and the peal of laughter which followed rang in his ears that utterance of the verbiage of love is a disagreeable task for a gentleman of his years he had tried it and found it very disagreeable he would save himself a repetition of the nuisance and write to her  he did so his letter was not very long he said nothing about mary in it but contented himself with calling her his dearest friend a few words were sufficient to make her understand what he meant and those few words were there he merely added a caution that for both their sakes the matter had better not at present be mentioned to anybody  miss baker when she received this letter had almost recovered her equanimity hers had been a soft and gentle sorrow she had had no fits of bursting grief her wailings had been neither loud nor hysterical a gentle soft faint tinge of melancholy had come upon her so that she had sighed much as she sat at her solitary tea and had allowed her novel to fall uncared for to the ground would it not be well for her she said to herself more than once to go to hadley would not any change be well for her she felt now that carolines absence was a heavy blow to her and that it would be well that she should leave littlebath it was astonishing how this affair of miss todds reconciled her to her future home  and then when she was thus tranquil thus resigned thus all but happy came this tremendous letter upsetting her peace of mind and throwing her into a new maze of difficulties  she had never said to herself at any time that if sir lionel did propose she would accept him she had never questioned herself as to the probability of such an event that she would have accepted him a fortnight ago there can be no doubt but what was she to do now  it was not only that sir lionel had made another tender of his hand to another lady ten or twelve days since but to this must be added the fact that all littlebath knew that he had done so miss todd after the first ebullition of her comic spleen had not said much about it but miss p gauntlets tongue had not been idle she perhaps had told it only to the godly but the godly let them be ever so exclusive must have some intercourse with the wicked world and thus every lady in littlebath now knew all about it and then there were other difficulties that whispered conversation still rang in her ears she was not quite sure how far it might be her mission to reclaim such a man as sir lionelthis new sir lionel whom miss todd had described and then too he was in want of money why she was in want of money herself  but was there not something also to be said on the other side it is reported that unmarried ladies such as miss baker generally regret the forlornness of their own condition if so the fault is not their own but must be attributed to the social system to which they belong the english world is pleased to say that an unmarried lady past forty has missed her hit in lifehas omitted to take her tide at the ebb and what can unmarried ladies do but yield to the worlds dictum that the english world may become better informed and learn as speedily as may be to speak with more sense on the subject let us all pray  but in the meantime the worlds dictum was strong at littlebath and did influence this dear lady she would prefer the name of lady bertram to that of miss baker for the remainder of the term of years allotted to her it would please her to walk into a room as a married woman and to quit herself of that disgrace which injustice and prejudice and the folly of her own sex rather than of the other had so cruelly attached to her present position and then to be lady bertram there were but few angels at this time in littlebath and miss baker was not one of them she had a taint of vanity in her composition but we doubt if such female vanity could exist in any human breast in a more pardonable form than it did in hers  and then perhaps this plan of marrying might have the wishedfor effect on sir lionels way of livingand how desirable was this would it not be a splendid work for her to reclaim a lost colonel might it not be her duty to marry him with this special object  there certainly did appear to be some difficulty as to money if as miss todd assured her sir lionel were really in difficulties her own present annuityall that she could absolutely call her ownher one hundred and eightynine pounds seventeen shillings and threepence per annumwould not help them much sir lionel was at any rate disinterested in his offer that at least was clear to her  and then a sudden light broke in upon her meditations sir lionel and the old gentleman were at variance we allude to the old gentleman at hadley with the other old gentleman of whom we wot it may be presumed that sir lionel was on tolerably favourable terms might not she be the means of bringing the two brothers together if she were lady bertram would not the old gentleman receive sir lionel back to his bosom for her saketo his bosom and also to his purse but before she took any step in the dark she resolved to ask the old gentleman the question  it is true that sir lionel had desired her to speak to no person on the subject but that injunction of course referred to strangers it could not but be expected that on such a matter she should consult her best friends sir lionel had also enjoined a speedy answer and in order that she might not disappoint him in this matter she resolved to put the question at once to mr bertram great measures require great means she would herself go to hadley on the morrowand so she wrote a letter that night to beg that her uncle would expect her  so you got tired of littlebath before the month was out said he  oh but i am going back again  going back again then why the d have you come up now alas it was too clear that the old gentleman was not in one of his more pacific moods  as these words were spoken miss baker was still standing in the passage that she might see her box brought in from the fly she of course had on her bonnet and thickest shawl and cloak she had thick boots on also and an umbrella in her hand the maid was in the passage and so was the man who had driven her she was very cold and her nose was blue and her teeth chattered she could not tell her tale of love in such guise or to such audience  what the d has brought you up repeated the old gentleman standing with his two sticks at the sittingroom door he did not care who heard him or how cold it was or of what nature might be her present mission he knew that an extra journey from littlebath to london and back flys and porters included would cost two pounds ten shillings he knew or thought that he knew that this might have been avoided he also knew that his rheumatism plagued him that his old bones were sore that he could not sleep at night that he could not get into the city to see how things went and that the game was coming to an end with him and that the grave was claiming him it was not surprising that the old gentleman should be cross  ill tell you if youll let me come into the room said miss baker take the box upstairs mary half a crown oh no two shillings will be quite enough this economy was assumed to pacify the old gentleman but it did not have the desired effect one and sixpence he holloed out from his crutches dont give him a halfpenny more  please sir the luggage sir said the fly driver  luggage shouted the old man his limbs were impotent but his voice was not and the flydriver shook in his shoes  there said miss baker insidiously giving the man two and threepence i shall not give you a farthing more it is to be feared that she intended her uncle to think that his limit had not been exceeded  and then she was alone with mr bertram her nose was still blue and her toes still cold but at any rate she was alone with him it was hard for her to tell her tale and she thoroughly wished herself back at littlebath but nevertheless she did tell it the courage of women in some conditions of life surpasses anything that man can do  i want to consult you about that said she producing sir lionels letter  the old gentleman took it and looked at it and turned it what its from that swindler is it said he  its from sir lionel said miss baker trembling there were as yet no promising auspices for the fraternal reconciliation  yes i see who its fromand what is it all about i shant read it you can tell me i suppose whats in it  i had hoped that perhaps sir you and he might  might what  be brought together as brothers and friends  brothers and friends one cant choose ones brother but who would choose to be the friend of a swindler is that what the letter is about  not exactly that mr bertram  then what the d is it  sir lionel sir has made me  made you what put your name to a bill i suppose  no indeed he has not nothing of that kind  then what has he made you do  he has not made me do anything but he has sent meanan offer of marriage and poor miss baker with her blue nose looked up so innocently so imploringly so trustingly that any one but mr bertram would have comforted her  an offer of marriage from sir lionel said he  yes said miss baker timidly here it is and i have come up to consult you about the answer mr bertram now did take the letter and did read it through  well he said closing his eyes and shaking his head gently well  i thought it better to do nothing without seeing you and that is what has brought me to hadley in such a hurry  the audacious impudent scoundrel  you think then that i should refuse him  you are a fool an ass a downright old softheaded fool such was the old gentlemans answer to her question  but i didnt know what to say without consulting you said miss baker with her handkerchief to her face  not know dont you know that hes a swindler a reprobate a penniless adventurer good heavens and you are such a fool as that its well that you are not to be left at littlebath by yourself  miss baker made no attempt to defend herself but bursting into tears assured her uncle that she would be guided by him under his absolute dictation she wrote the enclosed short answer to sir lionel      hadley january  184     dear sir     mr bertram says that it will be sufficient to let you    know that he would not give me a penny during his life    or leave me a penny at his death if i were to become your    wife     yours truly     mary baker   that was all that the old gentleman would allow but as she folded the letter she surreptitiously added the slightest imaginable postscript to explain the mattersuch words as occurred to her at the spur of the moment  he is so angry about it all  after that miss baker was not allowed back to littlebath even to pack up or pay her bills or say goodbye to those she left behind the servant had to do it all reflecting on the danger which had been surmounted mr bertram determined that she should not again be put in the way of temptation  and this was the end of sir lionels wooing     chapter iii  a quiet little dinner   sir henry harcourt was married and took his bride to paris and nice and sir lionel bertram tried to get married but his bridebride as he hoped her to have beenran away by herself to hadley in the meantime george bertram lived alone in his dark dull chambers in london  he would fain have been all alone but at what was perhaps the worst moment of his misery his father came to him it may be remembered how anxiously he had longed to know his father when he first commenced that journey to jerusalem how soon he became attached to him how fascinated he had been by sir lionels manners how easily he forgave the first little traits of unpaternal conduct on his fathers part how gradually the truth forced itself upon his mind but now at this time the truth had forced itself on his mind he knew his father for what he was  and his mind was not one which could reject such knowledge or alter the nature of it because the man was his father there are those to whom a fathers sins or a husbands sins or a brothers sins are no sins at all and of such one may say that though we must of compulsion find their judgment to be in some sort delinquent that their hearts more than make up for such delinquency one knows that they are wrong but can hardly wish them to be less so  but george bertram was not one of them he had been in no hurry to condemn his father but having seen his sins he knew them for sins and did condemn them he found that his uncle had been right and that sir lionel was a man whom he could in no wise respect and could hardly love money he perceived was his fathers desire he would therefore give him what money he could spare but he would not give him his society  when therefore sir lionel announced his arrival in town and his intention to remain there some little time george bertram was by no means solaced in his misery in those days he was very miserable it was only now that he knew how thoroughly he loved this womannow that she was so utterly beyond his reach weak and wavering as he was in many things he was not weak enough to abandon himself altogether to unavailing sorrow he knew that work alone could preserve him from sinkinghard constant unflinching work that one great cure for all our sorrow that only means of adapting ourselves to gods providences  so he set himself to worknot a lazy listless reading of counted pages not history at two volumes a week or science at a treatise a day but to such true work as he found it in him to do working with all his mind and all his strength he had already written and was known as a writer but he had written under impulse carelessly without due regard to his words or due thought as to his conclusions he had written things of which he was already ashamed and had put forth with the ex cathedra air of an established master ideas which had already ceased to be his own but all that should be altered now then he had wanted a quick return for his writing it had piqued him to think that the names of others his contemporaries were bruited about the world but that the world knew nothing of his own harcourt was already a noted man while he himself had done no more than attempted and abandoned a profession harcourts early success had made him an early author but he already felt that his authorship was unavailing harcourts success had been solid stable such as men delight in his had as yet resulted only in his all but forced withdrawal from the only respectable position which he had achieved  and now harcourts success was again before him harcourt had now as his own that which he had looked to as the goal of all his success the worldly reward for which he had been willing to work and yet what was harcourt as compared with him he knew himself to be of a higher temperament of a brighter genius of greater powers he would not condescend even to compare himself to this man who had so thoroughly distanced him in the worlds race  thinking and feeling and suffering thus he had begun to work with all the vehemence of which he was master he would ask for no speedy return now his first object was to deaden the present misery of his mind and then if it might be so to vindicate his claim to be regarded as one of englands worthy children letting such vindication come in its own time  such being the state of his mind his fathers arrival did not contribute much to his comfort sir lionel was rather petulant when he was with him objected to him that he had played his cards badly would talk about caroline and which was almost worse about the solicitorgeneral constantly urged him to make overtures of reconciliation to his uncle and wanted one day five pounds on another ten pounds and again on a third fifteen pounds at this moment georges fixed income was but two hundred pounds a year and any other wealth of which he was possessed was the remainder of his uncles thousand pounds when that was gone he must either live on his income small as it was or write for the booksellers such being the case he felt himself obliged to decline when the fifteen pounds was mentioned  you can let me have it for a couple of months said sir lionel  not conveniently said his son  i will send it you back immediately on my return to littlebath said the father so if you have got it by you pray oblige me  i certainly have got it said the sonand he handed him the desired check but i think you should remember sir how very small my income is and that there is no prospect of its being increased  it must be altogether your own fault then said the colonel pocketing the money i never knew a young man who had a finer hand of cards put into his handnever if you have played it badly it is your own fault altogether your own fault in truth sir lionel did really feel that his son had used him badly and owed him some amends had george but done his duty he might now have been the actual recognized heir of his uncles wealth and the actual possessor of as much as would have been allowed to a dutiful obedient son to a man of sir lionels temperament it was annoying that there should be so much wealth so near him and yet absolutely and alas probably for ever out of his reach  sir lionel had resolved to wait in london for his answer and there he received it short as was poor miss bakers letter it was quite sufficiently explicit she had betrayed him to the old gentleman and after that all hopes of money from that source were over it might still be possible for him to talk over miss baker but such triumph would be but barren miss baker with a transferred allegiancetransferred from the old gentleman to himwould be but a very indifferent helpmate he learnt however from littlebath that she was still away and would probably not return then he went back in fancied security and found himself the centre of all those amatory ovations which miss todd and miss gauntlet had prepared for him  it was about two months after this that george bertram saw sir henry harcourt for the first time after the marriage he had heard that sir henry was in town had heard of the blaze of their new house in eaton square had seen in the papers how magnificently lady harcourt had appeared at court how well she graced her brilliant home how fortunate the world esteemed that young lawyer who having genius industry and position of his own had now taken to himself in marriage beauty wealth and social charms all this george bertram heard and read and hearing it and reading it had kept himself from the paths in which such petted children of fortune might probably be met  twice in the course of these two months did sir henry call at bertrams chambers but bertram was now at home to no one he lived in a great desert in which was no living being but himselfin a huge desert without water and without grass in which there was no green thing he was alone to one person only had he spoken of his misery once only had he thought of escaping from it that thought had been in vain that companion was beyond his reach and therefore living there in his london chambers he had been all alone  but at last they did meet sir henry determined not to be beaten in his attempt to effect a reconciliation wrote to him saying that he would call and naming an hour caroline and you he said are cousins there can be no reason why you should be enemies for her sake if not for mine do oblige me in this  bertram sat for hours with that note beneath his eyes before he could bring himself to answer it could it really be that she desired to see him again that she in her splendour and first glow of prosperous joy would wish to encounter him in his dreary sad deserted misery and why could she wish it and ah how could she wish it  and then he asked himself whether he also would wish to see her that he still loved her loved her as he never had done while she was yet his own he had often told himself that he could never be at rest till he had ceased to make her the first object of his thoughts he had said as often that he ought not to see her he knew full well the controversy within his own bosom was carried on for two hours and then he wrote to sir henry saying that he would be at his chambers at the hour named from that moment the salutary effort was discontinued the work was put aside and the good that had been done was all revoked  sir henry came true to his appointment whatever might be his object he was energetic in it he was now a man of many concernments hours were scanty with him and a day much too short the calls of clients and the calls of party joined to those other calls which society makes upon men in such brilliant stations hardly left him time for sleeping but not the less urgent was he in his resolve to see his beaten rival who would so willingly have left him to his brilliant joy but was not all this explained long even before christianity was in vogue quos deus vult perdere prius dementat whom god will confound those he first maddens  nothing could exceed the bland friendship the winning manners and the frank courtesy of sir henry he said but little about what was past but that little went to show that he had been blessed with the hand of caroline waddington only because bertram had rejected that blessing as not worthy his acceptance great man as he was he almost humbled himself before bertrams talent he spoke of their mutual connection at hadley as though they two were his heirs of right and as though their rights were equal and then he ended by begging that they might still be friends  our careers must be widely different said bertram somewhat touched by his tone yours will be in the light mine must be in the dark  most men who do any good live in the dark for some period of their lives said harcourt i too have had my dark days and doubtless shall have them again but neither with you nor with me will they endure long  bertram thought that harcourt knew nothing about it and sneered when the successful man talked of his dark days what darkness had his mental eyesight ever known we are all apt to think when our days are dark that there is no darkness so dark as our own  i know what your feelings are continued sir henry and i hope you will forgive me if i speak openly you have resolved not to meet caroline my object is to make you put aside that resolve it is my object and hers also it is out of the question that you should continue to avoid the world your walk in life will be that of a literary man but nowadays literary men become senators and statesmen they have high rank are well paid and hold their own boldly against men of meaner capacities this is the career that we both foresee for you and in that career we both hope to be your friends  so spoke the great advocate with suasive eloquencewith eloquence dangerously suasive as regarded his own happiness but in truth this man knew not what love meantnot that love which those two wretched lovers understood so well that his own wife was cold to him cold as icethat he well knew that bertram had flung her from him because she had been cold to himthat he believed that he himself could live without any passionate lovethat he acknowledged his wife was graceful and very beautifulall the world confessed that and thus sir henry was contented those honeymoon days had indeed been rather dreary once or twice before that labour was over he had been almost tempted to tell her that he had paid too high for the privilege of pressing such an icicle to his bosom but he had restrained himself and now in the blaze of the london season passing his mornings in courts of law and his evenings in the house of parliament he flattered himself that he was a happy man  come and dine with us in a quiet way the day after tomorrow said sir henry and then the ice will be broken george bertram said that he would and from that moment his studies were at an end  this occurred on the monday the invitation was for the following wednesday sir henry explained that from some special cause he would be relieved from parliamentary attendance at any rate till ten oclock that at the quiet dinner there would be no other guests except mr and mrs stistick and baron brawl whose wife and family were not yet in town  youll like the baron said harcourt hes loud and arrogant no doubt but hes not loud and arrogant about nothing as some men are stistick is a bore of course you know him hes member for peterloo and goes with us on condition that somebody listens to him about once a week but the baron will put him down  and mrs stistick said george  i never heard of her till yesterday and caroline has gone to call on her today its rather a bore for her for they live somewhere halfway to harrow i believe halfpast seven goodbye old fellow i ought to have been before baron brawl at westminster twenty minutes since and so the solicitorgeneral rushing out from the temple threw himself into a cab and as the wheels rattled along the strand he made himself acquainted with the contents of his brief  why should caroline have expressed a wish to see him that was the thought that chiefly rested in bertrams mind when sir henry left him why should it be an object to her to force a meeting between her and him would it not be better for them both that they should be far as the poles asunder  well he said to himself if it be no difficulty to her neither shall it be a difficulty to me she is strongminded and i will be so no less i will go and meet her it is but the first plunge that gives the shock  and thus he closed his work and sat moodily thinking he was angry with her in that she could endure to see him but alas halfpleased also that she should wish to do so he had no thought no most distant thought that she could ever now be more to him than the wife of an acquaintance whom he did not love too well but yet there was in his heart some fragment of halfsatisfied vanity at hearing that she did look forward to see him once again  and how shall we speak of such a wish on her part caroline her husband had said to her at breakfast it will be all nonsense for you and george bertram to keep up any kind of quarrel i hate nonsense of that sort  there is no quarrel between us she replied  there ought to be none and i shall get him to come here  the colour of her face became slightly heightened as she answered if you wish it sir henry and he wishes it also i shall not object  i do wish it certainly i think it absolutely necessary as regards my position with your grandfather  do just as you think best said his wife twas thus that lady harcourt had expressed her desire to see george bertram at her house had he known the truth that fragment of halfsatisfied vanity would have been but small  in those early days of her marriage lady harcourt bore her triumphs very placidly she showed no great elation at the change that had come over her life her aunt from hadley was frequently with her and wondered to find her so little altered or rather in some respects so much altered for she was more considerate in her manner more sparing of her speech much less inclined to domineer now as lady harcourt than in former days she had ever been as caroline waddington she went constantly into society and was always much considered but her triumphs were mainly of that quiet nature which one sometimes sees to be achieved with so little effort by beautiful women it seemed but necessary that she should sit still and sometimes smile and the world was ready to throw itself at her feet nay the smile was but too often omitted and yet the world was there  at home though more employed she was hardly more energetic her husband told her that he wished his house to be noted for the pleasantness of his dinnerparties and therefore she studied the subject as a good child would study a lesson she taught herself what the material of a dinner should be she satisfied herself that her cook was good she looked to the brilliancy of her appointments and did her best to make the house shine brightly the house did shine and on the whole sir henry was contented it was true that his wife did not talk much but what little she did say was said with a sweet manner and with perfect grace she was always dressed with care was always beautiful was always ladylike had not sir henry reason to be contented as for talking he could do that himself  and now that she was told that george bertram was to come to her house she did not show much more excitement at the tidings than at the promised advent of mr baron brawl she took the matter with such indifference that sir henry at least had no cause for jealousy but then she was indifferent about everything nothing seemed to wake her either to joy or sorrow sir henry perhaps was contented but lovely ladylike attractive as she was he sometimes did feel almost curious to know whether it were possible to rouse this doll of his to any sense of life or animation he had thought nay almost wished that the name of her old lover would have moved her that the idea of seeing him would have disturbed her but no one name was the same to her as another she had been told to go and call on mrs stistick and she had gone she was told to receive mr bertram and she was quite ready to do so angels from heaven or spirits from below could sir henry have summoned such to his table would have been received by her with equal equanimity this was dutiful on her part and naturally satisfactory to a husband inclined to be somewhat exigeant but even duty may pall on an exigeant husband and a man may be brought to wish that his wife would cross him  but on this occasion sir henry had no such pleasure i saw bertram this morning he said when he went home for five minutes before taking his seat in the house for the night hes to be here on wednesday  oh very well there will be six then she said no more it was clear that the dinner and that only was on her mind he had told her to be careful about his dinners and therefore could not complain but nevertheless he was almost vexed dont let any wife think that she will satisfy her husband by perfect obedience overmuch virtue in ones neighbours is never satisfactory to us sinners  but there were moments in which lady harcourt could think of her present life when no eye was by to watch herno master there to wonder at her perfections moments nay but there were hours and hours and hours there were crowds of hours slow dull lingering hours in which she had no choice but to think of it a woman may see to her husbands dinners and her own toilet and yet have too much time for thinking it would almost have been a comfort to lady harcourt if sir henry could have had a dinnerparty every day  how should she bear herself what should she say how should she look when george bertram came there as a guest to her house how could he be so cruel so heartless so inhuman as to come there her path was difficult enough for her poor weary feet he must know thatshould at any rate have known it how could he be so cruel as to add this great stumblingblock to her other perils  the wednesday came and at halfpast seven she was in her drawingroom as beautiful and as dignified as ever she had a peculiar place of her own in the corner of a peculiar sofa and there she lived it was her goddess shrine and her worshippers came and did reverence before her none came and sat beside her hers was not that gentle fascination which entices men and women too to a near proximity her bow was very gracious and said much but noli me tangere was part of its eloquence and so baron brawl found when on entering her drawingroom he told her that the fame of her charms had reached his ears and that he was delighted to have an opportunity of making her acquaintance  mr and mrs stistick were the next comers mrs stistick sat herself down on an opposite sofa and seemed to think that she did her duty to society by sitting there and so she did only permit her so to sit and there was no further labour in entertaining mrs stistick she was a large heavy woman with a square forehead and a square chin and she had brought up seven children most successfully now in these days of her husbands parliamentary prosperity she was carried about to dinners and in her way she enjoyed them she was not too shy to eat and had no wish whatever either to be talked to or to talk to sit easily on a sofa and listen to the buzz of voices was life and society to her perhaps in those long hours she was meditating on her childrens frocks or her husbands linen but they never seemed to be long to her  mr stistick was standing on the rug before the fire preparing for his first onslaught on baron brawl when the servant announced mr bertram  ah bertram im delighted to see you said sir henrydoubly so as dinner is ready judge you know my friend bertram by name at any rate and some sort of halfintroduction was performed he who moved all oxford from its propriety said the baron but bertram neither saw him nor heard him neither his eyes nor his ears were at his command  as he took his hosts proffered hand he glanced his eyes for a moment round the room there she sat and he had to speak to her as best he might at his last interview with her he had spoken freely enough and it all rushed now upon his mind then how little he had made of her how lightly he had esteemed her now as she sat there before him his spirit acknowledged her as a goddess and he all but feared to address her his face he knew was hot and red his manner he felt was awkward he was not master of himself and when such is the case with a man the fact always betrays itself  but he did speak to her how do you do lady harcourt he said and he put his hand out and he felt the ends of her fingers once more within his own  and she spoke too probably but pretty women can say almost as much as is necessary on such occasions as this without opening their lips whether she spoke or whether she did not it was the same to him he certainly did not hear her but her fingers did touch his hand her eyes did rest upon his face and then in that moment of time he thought of jerusalem of the mount of olives of those rides at littlebath and of that last meeting when all all had been shattered to pieces  there are five hundred and fiftyfive thousand male children between the ages of nine and twelve said mr stistick pursuing some wondrous line of argument as bertram turned himself towards the fire  what a fine national family said the baron and how ashamed i feel when i bethink myself that only one of them is mine  dinner is served said the butler  mrs stistick will you allow me said sir henry and then in half a minute bertram found himself walking down to dinner with the member of parliament and we have school accommodation for just one hundred and fourteen continued that gentleman on the stairs now will you tell me what becomes of the other four hundred and fortyone  bertram was not at that moment in a condition to give him any information on the subject  i can tell you about the one said the baron as sir henry began his grace  an odd thousand is nothing said mr stistick pausing for a second till the grace was over  the judge and mr stistick sat at lady harcourts right and left so that bertram was not called upon to say much to her during dinner the judge talked incessantly and so did the member of parliament and so also did the solicitorgeneral a party of six is always a talking party men and women are not formed into pairs and do not therefore become dumb each persons voice makes another person emulous and the difficulty felt is not as to what one shall say but how one shall get it in ten and twelve and fourteen are the silent numbers  every now and again harcourt endeavoured to make bertram join in the conversation and bertram did make some faint attempts he essayed to answer some of mr stisticks very difficult inquiries and was even roused to parry some raillery from the judge but he was not himself and caroline who could not but watch him narrowly as she sat there in her silent beauty saw that he was not so she arraigned him in her mind for want of courage but had he been happy and noisy and light of heart she would probably have arraigned him for some deeper sin  as long as the matter is left in the hands of the parents nothing on earth will be done said mr stistick  thats what i have always said to lady brawl said the judge  and its what i have said to lord john and what i intend to say to him again lord john is all very well  thank you stistick i am glad at any rate to get as much as that from you said the solicitor  lord john is all very well continued the member not altogether liking the interruption but there is only one man in the country who thoroughly understands the subject and who is able  and i dont see the slightest probability of finding a second said the judge  and who is able to make himself heard  what do you say lady harcourt asked the baron as to the management of a school withhow many millions of them mr stistick  five hundred and fiftyfive thousand male children  suppose we say boys said the judge  boys asked mr stistick not quite understanding him but rather disconcerted by the familiarity of the word  well i suppose they must be boysat least the most of them  they are all from nine to twelve i say continued mr stistick completely bewildered  oh that alters the question said the judge  not at all said mr stistick there is accommodation for only  well well ask lady harcourt what do you say lady harcourt  lady harcourt felt herself by no means inclined to enter into the joke on either side so she said with her gravest smile im sure mr stistick understands very well what hes talking about  what do you say maam said the judge turning round to the lady on his left  mr stistick is always right on such matters said the lady  see what it is to have a character it absolutely enables one to upset the laws of human nature but still i do say mr solicitor that the majority of them were probably boys  boys exclaimed the member of parliament boys i dont think you can have understood a word that we have been saying  i dont think i have said the baron  there are five hundred and fiftyfive thousand male children between  ohhh male children ahhh now i see the difference i beg your pardon mr stistick but i really was very stupid and you mean to explain all this to lord john in the present session  but stistick who is the one man said sir henry  the one man is lord boanerges he i believe is the only man living who really understands the social wants of this kingdom  and everything else also sneered the baron the baron always sneered at cleverness that was external to his own profession especially when exhibited by one who like the noble lord named should have confined his efforts to that profession  so boanerges is to take in hand these male children and very fitting too he was made to be a schoolmaster  he is the first man of the age dont you think so sir henry  he was certainly when he was on the woolsack said sir henry that is the normal position always assumed by the first man of his age in this country  though some of them when there do hide their lights under a bushel said the judge  he is the first law reformer that perhaps ever lived said mr stistick enthusiastically  and i hope will be the last in my time said his enemy  i hope he will live to complete his work said the politician  then methuselah will be a child to him and jared and lamech little babies said the judge  in such case he has got his work before him certainly said mr solicitor  and so the battle was kept up between them and george bertram and lady harcourt sat by and listened or more probably perhaps sat by and did not listen  but when her ladyship and mrs stistick had retreatedoh my readers fancy what that next hour must have been to caroline harcourthow gothic how barbarous are we still in our habits in that we devote our wives to such wretchedness as that o lady has it ever been your lot to sit out such hour as that with some mrs stistick who would neither talk nor read nor sleep in whose company you could neither talk nor read nor yet sleep and if such has been your lot have you not asked yourself why in this civilized country in this civilized century you should be doomed to such a senseless sleepless purgatorybut when they were gone and when the judge radiant with fun and happiness hastened to fill his claret beaker then bertram by degrees thawed and began to feel that after all the world was perhaps not yet dead around him  well mr stistick said the baron if sir henry will allow us well drink lord boanerges  with all my heart said mr stistick he is a man of whom it may be said  that no man knew better on which side his bread was buttered  he is buttering the bread of millions upon millions said mr stistick  or doing better still said bertram enabling them to butter their own lord boanerges is probably the only public man of this day who will be greater in a hundred years than he is now  let us at any rate hope said the baron that he will at that time be less truculent  i cant agree with you bertram said sir henry i consider we are fertile in statesmen do you think that peel will be forgotten in a hundred years this was said with the usual candour of a modern turncoat for sir henry had now deserted peel  almost i should hope by that time said bertram he will have a sort of a niche in history no doubt as has mr perceval who did so much to assist us in the war and lord castlereagh who carried the union they also were heavensent ministers whom acheron has not as yet altogether swallowed up  and boanerges you think will escape libitina  if the spirit of the age will allow immortality to any man of these days i think he will but i doubt whether public opinion as now existing will admit of heroworship  public opinion is the best safeguard for a great mans great name said mr stistick with intense reliance on the civilization of his own era  quite true sir quite true said the baronfor the space of twentyfour hours  then followed a calm and then coffee after that the solicitorgeneral looking at his watch marched off impetuous to the house judge he said i know you will excuse me for you too have been a slave in your time but you will go up to lady harcourt bertram you will not be forgiven if you do not go upstairs  bertram did go upstairs that he might not appear to be unmanly as he said to himself in slinking out of the house he did go upstairs for one quarter of an hour  but the baron did not for him it may be presumed his club had charms mr stistick however did do so he had to hand mrs stistick down from that elysium which she had so exquisitely graced he did hand her down and then for five minutes george bertram found himself once more alone with caroline waddington  goodnight lady harcourt he said again essaying to take her hand this and his other customary greeting was all that he had yet spoken to her  goodnight mr bertram at last her voice faltered at last her eye fell to the ground at last her hand trembled had she stood firm through this trial all might have been well but though she could bear herself right manfully before stranger eyes she could not alone support his gaze one touch of tenderness one sign of weakness was enoughand that touch was there that sign she gave  we are cousins still are we not said he  yes we are cousinsi suppose so  and as cousins we need not hate each other  hate each other and she shuddered as she spoke oh no i hope there is no hatred  he stood there silent for a moment looking not at her but at the costly ornaments which stood at the foot of the huge pierglass over the fireplace why did he not go now why did he stand there silent and thoughtful whywhy was he so cruel to her  i hope you are happy lady harcourt at last he said  there was almost a savage sternness in her face as she made an effort to suppress her feelings thank youyes she said and then she added i never was a believer in much happiness  and yet he did not go we have met now he said after another pause  yes we have met now and she even attempted to smile as she answered him  and we need not be strangers then there was again a pause for at first she had no answer ready is it needful that we should be strangers he asked  i suppose not no not if sir henry wishes it otherwise  and then he put out his hand and wishing her goodnight a second time he went  for the next hour lady harcourt sat there looking at the smouldering fire quos deus vult perdere prius dementat not in such language but with some such thought did she pass judgment on the wretched folly of her husband     chapter iv  mrs maddens ball   two days after the dinner george bertram called in eaton square and saw lady harcourt but as it happened she was not alone their interview on this occasion was not in any great degree embarrassing to either of them he did not stay long and as strangers were present he was able to talk freely on indifferent subjects lady harcourt probably did not talk much but she looked as though she did  and then adela gauntlet came up to town for a month and george though he was on three or four occasions in eaton square never saw caroline alone but he became used to seeing her and being with her the strangeness of their meeting wore itself away he could speak to her without reserve on the common matters of life and found that he had intense delight in doing so  adela gauntlet was present at all these interviews and in her heart of hearts condemned them bitterly but she could say nothing to caroline they had been friendsreal friends but caroline was now almost like stone to her this visit of adelas had been a long promiseyes very long for the visit when first promised was to have been made to mrs bertram one knows how these promises still live on caroline had pressed it even when she felt that adelas presence could no longer be of comfort to her and adela would not now refuse lest in doing so she might seem to condemn but she felt that caroline harcourt could never be to her what caroline bertram would have been  lady harcourt did whatever in her lay to amuse her guest but adela was one who did not require much amusing had there been friendship between her and her friend the month would have run by all too quickly but as it was before it was over she wished herself again even at littlebath  bertram dined there twice and once went with them to some concert he met them in the park and called and then there was a great evening gathering in eaton square and he was there caroline was careful on all occasions to let her husband know when she met bertram and he as often in some shape expressed his satisfaction  hell marry adela gauntlet youll see if he does not he said to her after one of their dinners in eaton square she is very pretty very and it will be all very nice only i wish that one of them had a little money to go on with  caroline answered nothing to this she never did make him any answers but she felt quite sure in her own heart that he would not marry adela gauntlet and had she confessed the truth to herself would she have wished him to do so  adela saw and disapproved she saw much and could not but disapprove of all she saw that there was very little sympathy between the husband and wife and that that little was not on the increasevery little nay but was there any caroline did not say much of her lot in life but the few words that did fall from her seemed to be full of scorn for all that she had around her and for him who had given it all she seemed to say therethis is that for which i have striventhese ashes on which i now step and sleep and feed which are gritty between my teeth and foul to my touch see here is my reward do you not honour me for having won it  and then it appeared that sir henry harcourt had already learned how to assume the cross brow of a captious husband that the sharp word was already spoken on light occasionsspoken without cause and listened to with apparent indifference even before adela such words were spoken and then caroline would smile bitterly and turn her face towards her friend as though she would say see see what it is to be the wife of so fine a man so great a man what a grand match have i not made for myself but though her looks spoke thus no word of complaint fell from her lipsand no word of confidence  we have said that sir henry seemed to encourage these visits which bertram made to eaton square and for a time he did soup to the time of that large eveningparty which was given just before adelas return to littlebath but on that evening adela thought she saw a deeper frown than usual on the brows of the solicitorgeneral as he turned his eyes to a couch on which his lovely wife was sitting and behind which george bertram was standing but so standing that he could speak and she could hear  and then adela bethought herself that though she could say nothing to caroline it might not be equally impossible to say something to bertram there had been between them a sort of confidence and if there was any one to whom adela could now speak freely it was to him they each knew something of each others secrets and each of them at least trusted the other  but this if it be done at all must be done on that evening there was no probability that they would meet again before her departure this was the only house in which they did meet and here adela had no wish to see him more  i am come to say goodbye to you she said the first moment she was able to speak to him alone  to say goodbye is your visit over so soon  i go on thursday  well i shall see you again for i shall come on purpose to make my adieux  no mr bertram do not do that  but i certainly shall  no and she put out her little hand and gentlyoh so gentlytouched his arm  and why not why should i not come to see you i have not so many friends that i can afford to lose you  you shall not lose me nor would i willingly lose you but mr bertram  well miss gauntlet  are you right to be here at all  the whole tone and temper and character of his face altered as he answered her quickly and sharplyif not the fault lies with sir henry harcourt who with some pertinacity induced me to come here but why is it wrong that i should be herefoolish it may be  that is what i mean i did not say wrong did i do not think that i imagine evil  it may be foolish continued bertram as though he had not heard her last words but if so the folly has been his  if he is foolish is that reason why you should not be wise  and what is it you fear adela what is the injury that will come will it be to me or to her or to harcourt  no injury no real injuryi am sure of that but may not unhappiness come of it does it seem to you that she is happy  happy which of us is happy which of us is not utterly wretched she is as happy as you are and sir henry i have no doubt is as happy as i am  in what you say mr bertram you do me injustice i am not unhappy  are you not then i congratulate you on getting over the troubles consequent on a true heart  i did not mean in any way to speak of myself i have cares regrets and sorrows as have most of us but i have no cause of misery which i cannot assuage  well you are fortunate that is all i can say  but caroline i can see is not happy and mr bertram i fear that your coming here will not make her more so  she had said her little word meaning it so well but perhaps she had done more harm than good he did not come again to eaton square till after she was gone but very shortly after that he did so  adela had seen that short whispered conversation between lady harcourt and bertramthat moment as it were of confidence and so also had sir henry and yet it had been but for a moment  lady harcourt bertram had said how well you do this sort of thing  do i she answered well one ought to do something well  do you mean to say that your excellence is restricted to this  pretty nearly such excellence as there is  i should have thought and then he paused  you are not coming to reproach me i hope she said  reproach you lady harcourt no my reproaches silent or expressed never fall on your head  then you must be much altered and as she said these last words in what was hardly more than a whisper she saw some lady in a distant part of the room to whom some attention might be considered to be due and rising from her seat she walked away across the room it was very shortly after that adela had spoken to him  for many a long and bitter day bertram had persuaded himself that she had not really loved him he had doubted it when she had first told him so calmly that it was necessary that their marriage should be postponed for years he had doubted it much when he found her if not happy at least contented under that postponement doubt had become almost certainty when he learnt that she discussed his merits with such a one as henry harcourt but on that day at richmond when he discovered that the very secrets of his heart were made subject of confidential conversation with this man he had doubted it no longer then he had gone to her and his reception proved to him that his doubts had been too well foundedhis certainty only too sure and so he had parted with heras we all know  but now he began to doubt his doubtsto be less certain of his certainty that she did not much love sir henry that was very apparent that she could not listen to his slightest word without emotionthat too he could perceive that adela conceived that she still loved him and that his presence there was therefore dangerousthat also had been told to him was it then possible that he loving this woman as he didhaving never ceased in his love for one moment having still loved her with his whole heart his whole strengththat he had flung her from him while her heart was still his own could it be that she during their courtship should have seemed so cold and yet had loved him  a thousand times he had reproached her in his heart for being worldly but now the world seemed to have no charms for her a thousand times he had declared that she cared only for the outward show of things but these outward shows were now wholly indifferent to her that they in no degree contributed to her happiness or even to her contentment that was made manifest enough to him  and then these thoughts drove him wild and he began to ask himself whether there could be yet any comfort in the fact that she had loved him and perhaps loved him still the motives by which men are actuated in their conduct are not only various but mixed as bertram thought in this way concerning lady harcourtthe caroline waddington that had once belonged to himselfhe proposed to himself no scheme of infamy no indulgence of a disastrous love no ruin for her whom the world now called so fortunate but he did think that if she still loved him it would be pleasant to sit and talk with her pleasant to feel some warmth in her hand pleasant that there should be some confidence in her voice and so he resolvedbut no there was no resolve but he allowed it to come to pass that his intimacy in eaton square should not be dropped  and then he bethought himself of the part which his friend harcourt had played in this matter and speculated as to how that pleasant fellow had cheated him out of his wife what adela had said might be very true but why should he regard sir henrys happiness why regard any mans happiness or any womans who had regarded him so he hired a horse and rode in the park when he knew lady harcourt would be there dined with baron brawl because lady harcourt was to dine there and went to a ball at mrs maddens for the same reason all which the solicitorgeneral now saw and did not press his friend to take a part at any more of his little dinners  what may have passed on the subject between sir henry and his wife cannot be said a man does not willingly accuse his wife of even the first germ of infidelity does not willingly suggest to her that any one is of more moment to her than himself it is probable that his brow became blacker than it had been that his words were less courteous and his manner less kind but of bertram himself it may be presumed that he said nothing it might however have been easy for caroline to perceive that he no longer wished to have his old friend at his house  at mrs maddens ball bertram asked her to dance with him and she did stand up for a quadrille mr madden was a rich young man in parliament and an intimate friend both of sir henrys and of bertrams caroline had danced with himbeing her first performance of that nature since her marriage and having done so she could not as she said to herself refuse mr bertram so they stood up and the busy solicitorgeneral who showed himself for five minutes in the room saw them moving handinhand together in the figure of the dance and as he so moved bertram himself could hardly believe in the reality of his position what if any one had prophesied to him three months since that he would be dancing with caroline harcourt  adela did not stay with you long said he as they were standing still  no not very long i do not think she is fond of london and then they were again silent till their turn for dancing was over  no i dont think she is said bertram nor am i i should not care if i were to leave it for ever do you like london lady harcourt  oh yes as well as any other place i dont think it much signifieslondon or littlebath or new zealand  they were then both silent for a moment till bertram again spoke with an effort that was evident in his voice  you used not to be so indifferent in such matters  used  has all the world so changed that nothing is any longer of any interest  the world has changed certainlywith me  and with me also lady harcourt the world has changed with both of us but fortune while she has been crushing me has been very kind to you  has she well perhaps she hasas kind at any rate as i deserve but you may be sure of thisi do not complain of her and then they were again silent  i wonder whether you ever think of old days he said after a pause  at any rate i never talk of them mr bertram  no i suppose not one should not talk of them but out of a full heart the mouth will speak constant thoughts will break forth in words there is nothing else left to me of which i can think  any one looking at her face as she answered him would have little dreamed how much was passing through her mind how much was weighing on her heart she commanded not only her features but even her colour and the motion of her eyes no anger flashed from them there was no blush of indignation as she answered him in that crowded room and yet her words were indignant enough and there was anger too in that low tone which reached his ear so plainly but which reached no further  and whose doing has this been why is it that i may not think of past times why is it that all thought all memories are denied to me who was it that broke the cup at the very fountain  was it i  did you ever think of your prayers forgive us our trespasses but you in your prideyou could forgive nothing and now you dare to twit me with my fortune  lady harcourt  i will sit down if you please now i do not know why i speak thus and then without further words she caused herself to be led away and sitting down between two old dowagers debarred him absolutely from the power of another word  immediately after this he left the house but she remained for another hourremained and danced with young lord echo who was a whig lordling and with mr twisleton whose father was a treasury secretary they both talked to her about harcourt and the great speech he was making at that moment and she smiled and looked so beautiful that when they got together at one end of the suppertable they declared that harcourt was outandout the luckiest dog of his day and questioned his right to monopolize such a treasure  and had he been cruel had he been unforgiving had he denied to her that pardon which it behoved him so often to ask for himself this was the question which bertram was now forced to put to himself and that other question which he could now answer but in one way had he then been the cause of his own shipwreck had he driven his own bark on the rocks while the open channel was there clear before him had she not now assured him of her love though no word of tenderness had passed her lips and whose doing had it been yes certainly it had been his own doing  the conviction which thus came upon him did not add much to his comfort there was but little consolation to him now in the assurance that she had loved and did love him he had hitherto felt himself to be an injured man but now he had to feel that he himself had committed the injury whose doing has it been youyou in your pride could forgive nothing these words rang in his ears his memory repeated to him hourly the tone in which they had been spoken she had accused him of destroying all her hopes for this worldand he had answered not a word to the accusation  on the morning after that ball at mrs maddens sir henry came into his wifes room while she was still dressing bytheby said he i saw you at mrs maddens last night  yes i perceived that you were there for a moment caroline answered  you were dancing i dont know that i ever saw you dancing before  i have not done so since i was married in former days i used to be fond of it  ah yes when you were at littlebath it did not much matter then what you did in that way but  does it matter more now sir henry  well if it would entail no great regret i would rather that you did not dance it is all very nice for girls  you do not mean to say that married women  i do not mean to say anything of the kind one man has one idea and another another some women also are not placed in so conspicuous a position as you are  why did you not tell me your wishes before  it did not occur to me i did not think it probable that you would dance may i understand that you will give it up  as you direct me to do so of course i shall  direct i do not direct i only request  it is the same thing exactly i will not dance again i should have felt the prohibition less had i been aware of your wishes before i had offended  well if you choose to take it in that light i cannot help it goodmorning i shall not dine at home today  and so the solicitorgeneral went his way and his wife remained sitting motionless at her dressingtable they had both of them already become aware that the bargain they had made was not a wise one     chapter v  can i escape   had not george bertram been of all men the most infirm of purpose he would have quitted london immediately after that ballat any rate for many months but he was lamentably infirm of purpose he said to himself over and over again that it behoved him to go what had either of them done for him that he should regard them that had hitherto been the question within his own breast but now it was changed had he not greatly injured her had she not herself told him that his want of mercy had caused all her misery ought he not at any rate to spare her now but yet he remained he must ask her pardon before he went he would do that and then he would go  his object was to see her without going to eaton square his instinct told him that sir henry no longer wished to see him there and he was unwilling to enter the house of any one who did not wish his presence for two weeks he failed in his object he certainly did see lady harcourt but not in such a way as to allow of conversation but at last fortune was propitiousor the reverse and he found himself alone with her  she was seated quite alone turning over the engravings which lay in a portfolio before her when he came up to her  do not be angry he said if i ask you to listen to me for a few moments  she still continued to move the engravings before her but with a slower motion than before and though her eye still rested on the plates he might have seen had he dared to look at her that her mind was far away from them he might have seen also that there was no flash of anger now in her countenance her spirit was softer than on that evening when she had reproached him for she had remembered that he also had been deeply injured but she answered nothing to the request which he thus made  you told me that i was unforgiving he continued i now come to beg that you will not be unforgiving also that is if i have done anything that has caused youcaused you to be less happy than you might have been  less happy she said but not with that scorn with which she had before repeated his words  you believe i hope that i would wish you to be happy that i would do anything in my power to make you so  there can be nothing now in your power mr bertram and as she spoke she involuntarily put an emphasis on the now which made her words convey much more than she had intended  no he said no what can such a one as i do what could i ever have done but say that you forgive me lady harcourt  let us both forgive she whispered and as she did so she put out her hand to him let us both forgive it is all that we can do for each other  oh caroline caroline he said speaking hardly above his breath and with his eyes averted but still holding her hand or attempting to hold it for as he spoke she withdrew it  i was unjust to you the other night it is so hard to be just when one is so wretched we have been like two children who have quarrelled over their plaything and broken it in pieces while it was yet new we cannot put the wheels again together or made the broken reed produce sweet sounds  no he said no no no no sounds are any longer sweet there is no music now  but as we have both sinned mr bertram so should we both forgive  but ii have nothing to forgive  alas yes and mine was the first fault i knew that you really loved me and  loved you oh caroline  hush mr bertram not so do not speak so i know that you would not wrong me i know you would not lead me into troublenot into further trouble into worse misery  and i that might have led youno that might have been led to such happiness lady harcourt when i think of what i have thrown away  think of it not at all mr bertram  and you can you command your thoughts  sometimes and by practice i hope always at any rate i make an effort and now goodbye it will be sweet to me to hear that you have forgiven me you were very angry you know when you parted from me last at littlebath  if there be anything for me to forgive i do forgive it with all my heart with all my heart  and now god bless you mr bertram the thing that would most tend to make me contented would be to see you married to some one you could love a weight would then be off my soul which now weighs on it very heavily and so saying she rose from her seat and left him standing over the engravings he had thrown his pearl away a pearl richer than all his tribe there was nothing for him now but to bear the loss  there were other sources of unpleasantness between sir henry and his wife besides her inclination for dancing sir henry had now paid one halfyears interest on the sum of money which had been lent to him by the old gentleman at hadley and had been rather disgusted at finding that it was taken as a matter of course he was not at the present moment by any means overburdened with money his constant devotion to politics interfered considerably with his practice he was also perhaps better known as a party lawyer than as a practical or practising one and thus though his present career was very brilliant it was not quite so profitable as he had hoped most lawyers when they begin to devote themselves to politics have secured if not fortune at least the means of making it and even at his age sir henry might have been said to have done this had his aspirations been in any way moderate but they were not moderate he wished to shine with extreme brilliancy to live up to the character for wealth which the world gave him and to give it out as a fact to be understood by all men that he was to be the heir of the hadley croesus  there was perhaps a certain wisdom in this a wisdom of a dashing chancy nature fortune favours the brave and the world certainly gives the most credit to those who are able to give an unlimited credit to themselves but there was certainly risk in the life he led the giving of elegant little dinners two or three times a week in london is an expensive amusementand so he began to be very anxious about the old gentleman  but what was he to do that he might get near those moneybags there was the game what best sportsmans dodge might he use so as to get it into his bag perhaps to do nothing to use no sportsmans dodge would have been the best but then it is so hard to do nothing when so much might be gained by doing something very well  sir henry duly instructed as to the weaknesses customary to old men thought his wife would be his best weaponhis surest dodge if she could be got to be attentive and affectionate to her grandfather to visit him and flatter him and hover about him much might be done so thought sir henry but do what he might lady harcourt would not assist him it was not part of her bargain that she should toady an old man who had never shown any special regard for her  i think you ought to go down to hadley sir henry said to her one morning  what to stay there said caroline  yes for a fortnight or so parliament will be up now in three weeks and i shall go to scotland for a few days could not you make it out with the old gentleman till you go to the grimsdales  i would much rather remain at home sir henry  ah yes that is just like you and i would much rather that you went  if you wish to shut the house up i shall not object to go to littlebath  very probably not but i should object to you going thereexceedingly object to it of all places it is the most vulgar the most  you forget that i have dear friends living there  dear friends yes miss todd i suppose i think we may as well leave miss todd alone at the present moment i am particularly anxious that you should be attentive to your grandfather  but i have never been in the habit of staying at hadley  then the sooner you get into the habit the better  i cannot think why you should wish me to trouble an old man who would not have the slightest pleasure in seeing me  that is all nonsense if you behaved well to him he would have pleasure do you ever write to him  never  write to him today then and ask whether he would be glad to have you  caroline did not answer her husband immediately but went on buttering her toast and sipping her tea she had never yet disobeyed any positive order that he had given and she was now thinking whether she could obey this order or if not how she would explain to him that she could not do so  well said he why do you not answer me will you write to him today  i had much rather not  does that mean that you wont  i fear sir henry that it must mean it i have not been on terms with my grandfather which would admit of my doing so  nonsense said her lord and master  you are not very civil to me this morning  how can a man be civil when he hears such trash as that you know how i am situatedhow great the stake is and you will do nothing to help me win it to this she made no answer of what use would it be for her to answer she also had thrown away her pearl and taken in exchange this piece of brass there was nothing for her too but to bear her misery  upon my word you take it all very coolly he continued you seem to think that houses and furniture and carriages and horses are to grow up all round you without any effort on your own part does it ever strike you that these things cost money  i will give them all up tomorrow if you wish it  that you know is nonsense  it was your doing to surround me with these things and your reproach is not just nay it is not manly  a womans idea of manliness is very extended you expect to get everything and to do nothing you talk of justice do you not know that when i married you i looked to your uncles fortune  certainly not had i known it i should have told you how vain i believed any such hope to be  then why on earth but he refrained from finishing his question even he could not bring himself to tell her that he had married her with no other view he merely slammed the door behind him as he left the room yes she had certainly thrown her pearl away what a life was this to which she had doomed herself what treatment was this for that caroline waddington who had determined to win the world and wear it she had given herself to a brute who had taken her only because she might perhaps be the heiress of a rich old man  and then she thought of that lost pearl how could she do other than think of it she thought of what her life would have been had she bravely committed herself to his hands fearing nothing trusting everything she remembered his energy during those happy days in which he had looked forward to an early marriage she remembered his tenderness of manner the natural gallantry of his heart the loving look of his bold eye and then she thought of her husband  yes she thought of him long and wildly and as she did so the indifference with which she had regarded him grew into hatred she shuddered as her imagination made that frightful contrast between the picture which her eyes would have so loved to look on if it were only lawful and that other picture to look on which was her legal doom her brow grew wildly black as she thought of his caresses his love which were more hateful to her even than his coarse illhumour she thought of all this and as she did so she asked herself that question which comes first to the mind of all creatures when in misery is there no means of release no way of escape was her bark utterly ruined and for ever  that marriage without love is a perilous step for any woman who has a heart within her bosom for those who have noneor only so much as may be necessary for the ordinary bloodcirculating departmentsuch an arrangement may be convenient enough caroline waddington had once flattered herself that that heart of hers was merely a bloodcirculating instrument but she had discovered her mistake and learned the truth before it was too late she had known what it was to loveand yet she had married henry harcourt seldom indeed will punishment be so lame of foot as to fail in catching such a criminal as she had been  punishmentbitter cruel remorseless punishmenthad caught her now and held her tight within its grasp he too had said that he was wretched but what could his wretchedness be to hers he was not married to a creature that he hated he was not bound in a foul mezentian embrace to a being against whom all his human gorge rose in violent disgust oh if she could only be alone as he was alone if it could be granted to her to think of her love to think of him in solitude and silencein a solitude which no beast with a front of brass and feet of clay had a right to break both by night and day ah if her wretchedness might only be as his wretchedness how blessed would she not think herself  and then she again asked herself whether there might not be some escape that women had separated themselves from their husbands she well knew that pleas of illusage of neglect of harshness of temper had been put forward and accepted by the world to the partial enfranchisement of the unhappy wife she had often heard but she had also heard that in such cases cruelty must be proved a hasty word a cross look a black brow would not suffice nor could she plead that she hated the man that she had never loved him that she had married him in wounded pique because her loverhe whom she did lovehad thrown her off there was no ground none as yet on which she could claim her freedom she had sold herself as a slave and she must abide her slavery she had given herself to this beast with the face of brass and the feet of clay and she must endure the cold misery of his den separationsolitudesilence hethat he whom her heart worshippedhe might enjoy such things but for herthere was no such relief within her reach  she had gone up into her room when sir henry left her in order that no one might see her wretchedness and there she remained for hours no at last she said aloud lifting her head from the pillow on which her face had been all but hid and standing erect in the room no i will not bear it i will not endure it he cannot make me and with quick steps she walked across and along the room stretching forth her arms as though seeking aid from some one ay and as though she were prepared to fight the battle herself if no one would come to aid her  at this moment there was a knock at her chamberdoor and her maid came in  mr bertram is in the drawingroom my lady  mr bertram which mr bertram  mr bertram my lady the gentleman that comes here sir henrys friend  oh very well why did john say that i was at home  oh my lady i cant say that only he told me to tell your ladyship that mr bertram was in the drawingroom  lady harcourt paused for a moment then she said i will be down directly and the abigail retired during that moment she had decided that as he was there she would meet him yet once again  it has been said that bertram was unwilling to go to sir henrys house as long as he had thought of remaining in town he was so but now he had resolved to fly and had resolved also that before he did so he would call in the ordinary way and say one last farewell john the servant admitted him at once though he had on that same morning sent bootless away a score of other suppliants for the honour of being admitted to lady harcourts presence  bertram was standing with his back to the door looking into a small conservatory that opened from the drawingroom when the mistress of the house entered she walked straight up to him after having carefully closed the door and just touching his hand she said mr bertram why are you here you should be thousands and thousands of miles away if that were possible why are you here  lady harcourt i will divide myself from you by any distance you may demand but may i not come to you to tell you that i am going  to tell me that you are going  yes i shall not trouble you much longer i have become sure of this that to remain near you and not to love you to remain near you and not to say that i love you is impossible and therefore i am going and he held out his hand which she had as yet hardly takenhad barely touched  he was going but she was to remain he would escape but her prison bars could not be broken ah that she could have gone with him how little now would wealth have weighed with her or high worldly hopes or dreams of ambition to have gone with him anywherehonestly to have gone with himtrusting to honest love and a true heart ah how much joy is there in this mortal moribund world if one will but open ones arms to take it  ah young ladies sweet young ladies dear embryo mothers of our england as it will be think not overmuch of your lovers incomes he that is true and honest will not have to beg his breadneither his nor yours the true and honest do not beg their bread though it may be that for awhile they eat it without much butter but what then if a wholesome loaf on your tables and a strong arm round your waists and a warm heart to lean on cannot make you happy you are not the girls for whom i take you  carolines bread was buttered certainly but the butter had been mixed with gall and she could not bring herself to swallow it and now he had come to tell her that he was going he whose loaf and arm and heart she might have shared what would the world say of her if she were to share his flight  goodbye she said as she took his proffered hand  and is that all  what would you have mr bertram  what would i have ah me i would have that which is utterlyutterlyutterly beyond my reach  yes utterlyutterly she repeated and as she said so she thought again what would the world say of her if she were to share his flight  i suppose that now for the last time i may speak trulyas a man should speak lady harcourt i have never ceased to love you never for one moment never since that day when we walked together among those strange tombs my love for you has been the dream of my life  but whywhywhy she could not speak further for her voice was choked with tears  i know what you would say why was i so stern to you  why did you go away why did you not come to us  because you distrusted me not as your lover but as a man but i did not come here to blame you caroline  nor to be blamed  no nor to be blamed what good can come of reproaches we now know each others faults if we never did before and we know also each others truth he paused a moment and then added for caroline your heart has been true  she sat herself down upon a chair and wept with her face hidden within her hands yes her heart had been true enough if only her words her deeds her mind could have been true also  he came up to her and lightly put his hand upon her shoulder his touch was very light but yet she felt that there was love in itillicit dishonest love there was treason in it to her lords rights her lord yes he was her lord and it was treason but it was very sweet that touch it was as though a thrill of love passed across her and embraced her whole body treason to such a creature as that a brute with a face of brass and feet of clay who had got hold of her with a false idea that by her aid he could turn his base brass into gold as base could there be treason to such a one as he ah what would the world say of her were she to share that flight  caroline he murmured in her ear caroline dearest caroline thus he murmured soft words into her ear while his hand still rested gently on her shoulderoh so gently and still she answered nothing but the gurgling of her sobs was audible to him enough caroline he repeated dearest dearest caroline and then he was on his knees beside her and the hand which had touched her shoulder was now pressed upon her arm  caroline speak to mesay one word i will go if you bid me yes even alone i will go alone if you have the heart to say so speak caroline  what would you have me say and she looked at him through her tears so haggard so wild so changed that he was almost frightened at her countenance what would you have me say what would you have me do  i will be your slave if you will let me said he  no georgeyou mean that i might be your slavefor awhile till you thought me too base even for that  ah you little know me  i should but little know you if i thought you could esteem me in that guise there gods mercy has not deserted me it is over now go georgegogo thou only love of my heart my darling mine that might have been mine that never can be nownevernevernever go george it is over now i have been base and vile and cowardlyunworthy of your dear memory but it shall not be so again you shall not blush that you have loved me  but ah that i have lost your love  you shall not blush that you have loved me nor will i blush that i too have loved you go george and remember this the farther the longer the more entirely we are apart the better the safer it will be there there go now i can bear it now dearest dearest george  he took her outstretched hands in his and stood for awhile gazing into her face then with the strong motion of his arms he drew her close to his breast pressed her to his heart and imprinted one warm kiss upon her brow then he left her and got to the drawingroom door with his fleetest step  i beg your pardon sir said john who met him exactly on the landing but i think my lady rang  lady bertram did not ring she is not well and you had better not disturb her said bertram trying to look as though he were no whit disconcerted  oh very well sir then ill go down again and so saying john followed george bertram into the hall and opened the door for him very politely     chapter vi  a matrimonial dialogue   sir henry had said also on this day that he would not dine at home but he came home before dinner and after being for a few minutes in his own study he sent for his wife abigail coming up to her brought her sir henrys love and would she be good enough to step downstairs for five minutes this was very civil so she did step down and found sir henry alone in his study  george bertram has been here today were the first words which the husband spoke when he saw that the door had been fairly closed behind his wife  what communication there may have been between sir henry and his servant john is oh my reader a matter too low for you and me that there had been some communication we must both fear not that sir henry wished to find his wife guilty not that he at all suspected that he should find her guilty but he did wish to have her entirely in his power and he wished also that bertram should be altogether banished from his house  george bertram has been here today he did not look cruel or violent or threatening as he spoke but yet there was that in his eye which was intended to make caroline tremble caroline however did not tremble but looking up into his face with calm dignity replied that mr bertram had called that morning  and would you object to telling me what passed between you  caroline still looked him full in the face he was sitting but she had not sat down she was standing before him faultless in demeanour in posture and in dress if it had been his aim to confound her he certainly had so far missed his object  would i object to telling you what passed between us the question is a very singular one and then she paused a moment yes sir henry i should object  i thought as much said he  she still stood before him perfectly silent and he sat there silent also he hardly knew how to go on with the interview he wanted her to defend herself but this was the very thing which she did not intend to do may i go now she asked after awhile  no not quite yet sit down caroline sit down i wish to speak to you george bertram has been here and there has been that between you of which you are ashamed to speak  i never said so sir henrynor will i allow you to say so there has been that between us today which i would rather bury in silence but if you command me i will tell you all  command you are always talking of commands  i have to do so very often in such marriages as ours they must be spoken ofmust be thought of if you command me i will tell you if you do not i will be silent  sir henry hardly knew what answer to make to this his object was to frighten his wife that there had been words between her and george bertram of which she as his wife would be afraid to tell he had been thoroughly convinced yet she now offered to repeat to him everything if he would only desire her to do so and in making this offer she seemed to be anything but afraid  sit down caroline she then sat down just opposite to him i should have thought that you would have felt that circumstanced as he and you and i are the intercourse between you and him should have been of the most restrained kindshould have had in it nothing of the old familiarity  who brought us again together  i did so trusting to your judgment and good taste  i did not wish to see him i did not ask him here i would have remained at home month after month rather than have met him had i been allowed my own way  nonsense why should you have been so afraid to meet him  because i love him  as she said this she still looked into his face fearlesslywe may almost say boldly so much so that sir henrys eyes almost quailed before hers on this she had at any rate resolved that she would never quail before him  but by degrees there came across his brow a cloud that might have made her quail had she not been bold he had come there determined not to quarrel with her an absolute quarrel with her would not suit himwould not further his plans as they were connected with mr bertram at hadley but it might be that he could not fail to quarrel with her he was not a man without blood in his veinswithout feelings at his heart he could have loved her in his way could she have been content to love him nay he had loved her and while she was the acknowledged possession of another he had thought that to obtain her he would have been willing to give up many worldly goods now he had obtained her and there she sat avowing to him that she still loved his unsuccessful rival it was no wonder that his brow grew black despite his own policy  and he has been here today in order that you might tell him so  he has been here today and i did tell him so said caroline looking still full up into her husbands eyes what brought him here i cannot say  and you tell me this to my face  well would you have me tell you a lie did i not tell you the same when you first asked me to marry you did i not repeat it to you again but a week before we were married do you think that a few months could make the difference do you think that such months as these have been could have effaced his memory  and you mean then to entertain him as your lover  i mean to entertain him not at all i mean that he shall never again enter any house in which i may be doomed to live you brought him here and ithough i knew that the trial would be hardi thought that i could bear it i find that i cannot my memory is too clear my thoughts of other days too vivid my remorse  go on madam pray go on  no i shall not go on i have said enough  ah you said more than that to him when he was here  not half so much  was he not kneeling at your feet  yes sir he did kneel at my feet and as she answered the question she rose up as though it were impossible for her any longer to sit in the presence of a man who so evidently had set a spy upon her actions  well and what then since you are so little ashamed of the truth tell it all  i am not at all ashamed of the truth he came to tell me that he was goingand i bade him go  and you allowed him to embrace youto hold you in his armsto kiss you  ah me yesfor the last time he did kiss me i feel his lips now upon my brow and then i told him that i loved him loved none but him could love none other then i bade him begone and he went now sir i think you know it all you seem to have had two accounts of the interview i hope they do not disagree  such audacious effrontery i never witnessed in my lifenever heard of before  what sir did you think that i should lie to you  i thought there was some sense of shame left in you  too high a sense of shame for that i wish you could know it all i wish i could tell you the tone of his voice and the look of his eye i wish i could tell you how my heart drooped and all but fainted as i felt that he must leave me for ever i am a married woman and it was needful that he should go after this there was a slight pause and then she added now sir henry i think you know it all now may i go  he rose from his chair and began walking the length of the room backwards and forwards with quick step as we have before said he had a heart in his bosom he had blood in his veins he had those feelings of a man which make the scorn of a beautiful woman so intolerable and then she was his wife his property his dependent his own for a moment he forgot the hadley moneybags sorely as he wanted them and the true man spoke out with full unabated anger  brazenfaced harlot he exclaimed as he passed her in his walk unmitigated harlot  yes sir she answered in a low tone coming up to him as she spoke laying her hand upon his arm and looking still full into his facelooking into it with such a gaze that even he cowered before her yes sir i was the thing you say when i came to you and sold my womans purity for a name a house a place before the worldwhen i gave you my hand but could not give my heart i waswhat you have said  and were doubly so when he stood here slobbering on your neck  no sir henry no false to him i have been false to my own sex false very false to my own inner self but never false to you  madam you have forgotten my honour  i have at any rate been able to remember my own  they were now standing face to face and as she said these last words it struck sir henry that it might be well to take them as a sign of grace and to commence from them that halfforgiveness which would be necessary to his projects  you have forgotten yourself caroline  stop a moment sir henry and let me finish since you will not allow me to remain silent i have never been false to you i say and by gods help i never will be  well well  stop sir and let me speak i have told you often that i did not love you i tell you so now again i have never loved younever shall love you you have called me now by a base name and in that i have lived with you and have not loved you i dare not say that you have called me falsely but i will sin no more  what is it you mean  i will not deserve the name againeven from you  nonsense i do not understand you you do not know what you are saying  yes sir henry i do know well what i am saying it may be that i have done you some injury if so i regret it god knows that you have done me much we can neither of us now add to each others comfort and it will be well that we should part  do you mean me to understand that you intend to leave me  that is what i intend you to understand  nonsense you will do no such thing  what would you have us remain together hating each other vilifying each other calling each other base names as you just now called me and do you think that we could still be man and wife no sir henry i have made one great mistakecommitted one wretched fatal error i have so placed myself that i must hear myself so called and bear it quietly but i will not continue to be so used do you think he would have called me so  damn him  that will not hurt him your words are impotent against him though they may make me shudder  do not speak of him then  no i will not i will only think of him  by heavens caroline your only wish is to make me angry  i may go now i suppose  goyes you may go i will speak to you tomorrow when you will be more cool  tomorrow sir henry i will not speak to you nor the day afterwards nor the day after that what you may wish to say now i will hear but remember thisafter what has passed today no consideration on earth shall induce me to live with you again in any other respect i will obey your ordersif i find it possible  she stayed yet a little while longer leaning against the table waiting to hear whether or no he would answer her but as he sat silent looking before him but not at her with his hands thrust deep into his pockets she without further words withdrew and quietly closed the door after her as she did so the faithful john was seen moving away to the top of the kitchen stairs she would hardly have cared had the faithful john been present during the whole interview  sir henry sat silent for a quarter of an hour meditating how he would now play his game as regarded merely personal considerations he was beginning to hate caroline almost as much as she hated him a man does not like to be told by a beautiful woman that every hair of his head is odious to her while the very footsteps of another are music in her ears perhaps it does not mend the matter when the hated man is the husband  but still sir henry wished to keep his wife it has been quite clear that caroline had thrown up her game she had flattered herself that she could play it but the very moment the cards went against her she discovered her own weakness and threw them away sir henry was of a stronger mind and not so easily disgusted he would try yet another deal indeed his stakes were too high to allow of his abandoning them  so arousing himself with some exertion he dressed himself went out to dine hurried down to the house and before the evening was over was again the happy fortunate solicitorgeneral fortunes pet the crichton of the hour the rising man of his day     chapter vii  the return to hadley   we must now return for awhile to hadley since the day on which miss baker had written that letter to sir lionel she had expressed no wish to leave her uncles house littlebath had no charms for her now the colonel was still there and so was the colonels first lovemiss todd let them forgive and forget and marry each other at last if they so pleased miss bakers fit of ambition was over and she was content to keep her uncles house at hadley and to see caroline whenever she could spare a day and get up to london for that purpose  and the old gentleman was less bearish than she thought he would have been he occasionally became rusty about shillings and sixpences and scolded because his niece would have a second fire lighted but by degrees he forgot even this grievance and did not make himself more disagreeable or exacting than old age wealth and suffering generally are when they come together  and then when adela left london miss baker was allowed to ask her to stop with them at hadleyand adela did as she was asked she went direct from eaton square to mr bertrams house and was still there at the time alluded to in the last chapter  it was on the second morning after sir henrys visit to his wife that the postman brought to miss baker a letter from lady harcourt the two ladies were sitting at the time over the breakfasttable and old mr bertram propped up with pillows with his crutches close to his hand was sitting over the fire in his accustomed armchair he did not often get out of it now except when he was taken away to bed but yet both his eye and his voice were as sharp as ever when he so pleased and though he sat there paralyzed and all but motionless he was still master of his house and master also of his money  good heavens exclaimed miss baker with startled voice before her letter had been half read through  whats the matter demanded mr bertram sharply  oh miss baker what is it asked adela  goodness gracious oh dear oh dear oh dear and miss baker with her handkerchief to her eyes began to weep most bitterly  what ails you who is the letter from said mr bertram  oh dear oh dear read it adela oh mr bertram here is such a misfortune  what is it miss gauntlet that fool will never tell me  adela took the letter and read it through  oh sir she said it is indeed a misfortune  devil take it what misfortune  caroline has quarrelled with sir henry said miss baker  oh is that all said mr bertram  ah sir i fear this quarrel will prove serious said adela  serious nonsense how serious you never thought did you that he and she would live together like turtle doves he married for money and she for ambition of course theyll quarrel such was the wisdom of mr bertram and at any rate he had experience on his side  but uncle she wishes to leave him and hopes that youll let her come here  come herefiddlestick what should i do here with the wife of such a man as him  she declares most positively that nothing shall induce her to live with him again  fiddlestick  but uncle  why what on earth did she expect she didnt think to have it all sunshine did she when she married the man she knew she didnt care for him and now she determines to leave him because he wont pick up her pockethandkerchief if she wanted that kind of thing why did not she marry my nephew  this was the first time that mr bertram had been heard to speak of george in a tone of affection and both miss baker and miss gauntlet were not a little surprised they had never heard him speak of caroline as his granddaughter  during the whole of that day mr bertram was obdurate and he positively refused to receive lady harcourt at his house unless she came there with the full permission of her husband miss baker therefore was obliged to write by the first post asking for a days delay before she sent her final answer but on the next morning a letter reached the old gentleman himself from sir henry sir henry suggested that the loving grandchild should take the occasion of the season being so nearly over to pay a muchdesired visit to her loving grandsire he did not drop the quarrel altogether but just alluded to it as a passing cloudan unfortunate cloud certainly but one that without doubt would soon pass away and leave the horizon more bright than ever  the matter was at last arranged by mr bertram giving the desired permission he took no notice himself of sir henrys letter but desired his niece to tell caroline that she might come there if she liked so caroline did come and sir henry gave it out that the london season had been too much for her and that she to her deep regret had been forced to leave town before it was over  sir omicron was quite imperative said sir henry speaking confidentially to his intimate parliamentary friend mr madden and as she was to go it was as well to do the civil to grandpapa croesus i have no time myself so i must do it by deputy  now sir omicron in those days was a great physician  and so caroline returned to hadley but no bells rang now to greet her coming little more than six months had passed since those breakfast speeches had been spoken in which so much golden prosperity had been promised to bride and bridegroom and now that vision of gold was at an end that solid substantial prosperity had melted away the bridal dresses of the maids had hardly lost their gloss and yet all that wellgrounded happiness was gone  so you are come back said mr bertram  yes sir said caroline in a low voice i have made a mistake in life and i must hope that you will forgive me  such mistakes are very foolish the sooner you unmake it the better  there will be no unmaking this mistake sir nevernevernever but i blame no one but myself  nonsense you will of course go back to your husband  never mr bertramnever i will obey him or you or both if that be possible in all things but in that but in that i can obey no one  psha said mr bertram such was lady harcourts first greeting on her return to hadley  neither miss baker nor adela said much to her on the matter on the first day of her arrival her aunt indeed never spoke openly to her on the subject it seemed to be understood between them that it should be dropped and there was occasionally a weight of melancholy about lady harcourt amounting in appearance almost to savage sternness which kept all inquiry aloof even her grandfather hesitated to speak to her about her husband and allowed her to live unmolested in the quiet still selfcontrolling mood which she seemed to have adopted with a determined purpose  for the first fortnight she did not leave the house at the expiration of that time on one fine sunny sunday morning she came down dressed for church miss baker remarked that the very clothes she wore were things that had belonged to her before her marriage and were all of them of the simplest that a woman can wear without making herself conspicuous before the world all her jewelry she had laid aside and every brooch and every ring that had come to her as a married woman or as a girl about to be marriedexcept that one ring from which an iron fate would not allow her to be parted ah if she could but have laid aside that also  and then she went to church there were the same persons there to stare at her now in her quiet wretchedness who were there before staring at her in hertriumph may i say no there had been no triumph little even then except wretchedness but that misery had not been so open to the public eye  she went through it very well and seemed to suffer even less than did her aunt she had done nothing to spread abroad among the public of hadley that fiction as to sir omicrons opinion which her lord had been sedulous to disseminate in london she had said very little about herself but she had at any rate said nothing false nor had she acted falsely or so as to give false impressions all that little world now around her knew that she had separated herself from her grand husband and most of them had heard that she had no intention of returning to him  she had something therefore to bear as she sat out that service and she bore it well she said her prayers or seemed to say them as though unconscious that she were in any way a mark for other womens eyes and when the sermon was over she walked home with a steady even step whereas miss baker trembled at every greeting she received and at every step she heard  on that afternoon caroline opened her heart to adela hitherto little had passed between them but those pressings of the hand those mute marks of sympathy which we all know so well how to give when we long to lighten the sorrows which are too deep to be probed by words but on this evening after their dinner caroline called adela into her room and then there was once more confidence between them  no no adela i will never go back to him caroline went on protesting you will not ask me to do that  those whom god has joined together let not man put asunder said adela solemnly  ah yes those whom god has joined but did god join us  oh caroline do not speak so  but adela do not misunderstand me do not think that i want to excuse what i have done or even to escape the penalty i have destroyed myself as regards this world all is over for me here when i brought myself to stand at that altar with a man i never loved whom i knew i never could lovewhom i never tried and never would try to lovewhen i did that i put myself beyond the pale of all happines do not think that i hope for any release and lady harcourt looked stern enough in her resolution to bear all that fate could bring on her  caroline god will temper the wind to the shorn lamb now as always if you will ask him  i hope so i hope so adela  say that you trust so  i do trust i trust in thisthat he will do what is best oh adela if you could know what the last month has been since he came to the house  ah why did he ever come  why indeed did a man ever behave so madly  the man she here alluded was sir henry harcourt not mr bertram  but i am glad of it dearest very glad is it not better so the truth has been spoken now i have told him all  you mean sir henry  yes i told him all before i left but it was nothing new adela he knew it before he never dreamed that i loved him he knew he must have known that i hated him  oh caroline caroline do not speak like that  and would not you have hated him had you been tied to him now that sin will be over i shall hate him no longer now  such hatred is a crime say what you will he is still your husband  i deny it what when he called me by that name was he my husband then was that a husbands usage i must carry his name and wearily walk with that burden to the grave such is my penalty for that days sin i must abandon all hope of living as other women live i shall have no shoulder on which to lean hear no words of love when i am sick have no child to comfort me i shall be alone and yet not master of myself this i must bear because i was false to my own heart but yet he is not my husband listen to me adela sooner than return to him again i would put an end to all this worlds misery at once that would be sinful but the sin would be lighter than that other sin  when she spoke in this way adela no longer dared to suggest to her that she and sir henry might even yet again live together in adelas own mind that course and that alone would have been the right one she looked on such unions as being literally for better or for worse and failing to reach the better she would have done her best with gods assistance to bear the worst but then adela gauntlet could never have placed herself in the position which lady harcourt now filled  but greatly as they differed still there was confidence between them caroline could talk to her and to her only to her grandfather she was all submission to her aunt she was gentle and affectionate but she never spoke of her fate with either of them and so they went on till adela left them in july and then the three that were left behind lived together as quiet a household as might have been found in the parish of hadley or perhaps in the county of middlesex  during this time lady harcourt had received two letters from her husband in both of which he urged her to return to him in answer to the first she assured him in the civilest words which she knew how to use that such a step was impossible but at the same time she signified her willingness to obey him in any other particular and suggested that as they must live apart her present home with her grandfather would probably be thought to be the one most suitable for her in answer to the second she had simply told him that she must decline any further correspondence with him as to the possibility of her return  his next letter was addressed to mr bertram in this he did not go into the matter of their difference at all but merely suggested that he should be allowed to call at hadleywith the object of having an interview with mr bertram himself  there said the old man when he found himself alone with his granddaughter read that and caroline did read it what am i to say to that  what do you think you ought to say sir  i suppose i must see him hell bring an action against me else for keeping his wife from him mind i tell you youll have to go back to him  no sir i shall not do that said caroline very quietly with something almost like a smile on her face and then she left him and he wrote his answer to sir henry  and then sir henry came down to hadley a day had been named and caroline was sore put to it to know how she might best keep out of the way at last she persuaded her aunt to go up to london with her for the day this they did both of them fearing as they got out of the train and returned to it that they might unfortunately meet the man they so much dreaded but fortune was not so malicious to them and when they returned to hadley they found that sir henry had also returned to london  he speaks very fair said mr bertram who sent for caroline to come to him alone in the diningroom  does he sir  he is very anxious that you should go back  ah sir i cannot do that  he says you shall have the house in eaton square to yourself for the next three months  i shall never go back to eaton square sir  or he will take a small place for you anywhere at the seaside that you may choose  i shall want no place if you will allow me to remain here  but he has all your money you knowyour fortune is now his  well sir  and what do you mean to do  i will do what you bid meexcept going back to him  the old man sat silent for awhile and then again he spoke  well i dont suppose you know your own mind as yet  oh sir indeed i do  i say i suppose you dont dont interrupt mei have suggested this that you should remain here six months and that then he should come again and see  you sir  wellsee me if im alive at the end of that time youll have to go back to him now goodnight  and so it was settled and for the next six months the same dull dreary life went on in the old house at hadley     chapter viii  cairo   men and women or i should rather say ladies and gentlemen used long ago when they gave signs of weakness about the chest to be sent to the south of devonshire after that madeira came into fashion but now they are all despatched to grand cairo cairo has grown to be so near home that it will soon cease to be beneficial and then the only air capable of revigorating the english lungs will be that of labuan or jeddo  but at the present moment grand cairo has the vogue now it had so happened during the last winter and especially in the trying month of march that arthur wilkinsons voice had become weak and he had a suspicious cough and was occasionally feverish and perspired onights and on these accounts the sir omicron of the hurst staple district ordered him off to grand cairo  this order was given in october with reference to the coming winter and in the latter end of november arthur wilkinson started for the east two articles he had first to seekthe one being a necessary and the other a luxuryand both he found these were a curate and a companion the reverend gabriel gilliflower was his curate and of him we need only hope that he prospered well and lived happily under the somewhat stern surveillance of his clerical superior mrs wilkinson his companion was george bertram  about the end of november they started through france and got on board the p and o companys vessel at marseilles it is possible that there may be young ladies so ignorant as not to know that the p and o is the peninsular and oriental steam navigation company and therefore the matter is now explained in france they did not stop long enough to do more than observe how much better the railway carriages are there than in england how much dearer the hotels are in paris than in london and how much worse they are in marseilles than in any other known town in the world  nor need much be said of their journey thence to alexandria of malta i should like to write a book and may perhaps do so some day but i shall hardly have time to discuss its sunlight and fortifications and hospitality and old magnificence in the fagend of a third volume so we will pass on to alexandria  oh alexandria mother of sciences once the favoured seat of the earths learning oh alexandria beloved by the kings it is of no use no man who has seen the alexandria of the present day can keep a seat on a high horse when he speaks of that most detestable of cities how may it fitly be described may we not say that it has all the filth of the east without any of that picturesque beauty with which the east abounds and that it has also the eternal grasping solemn love of lucre which pervades our western marts but wholly unredeemed by the society the science and civilization of the west  alexandria is fast becoming a european city but its europeans are from greece and the levant auri sacra fames is the motto of modern greece of alexandria it should be auri fames sacrissima poor arabs poor turks giving way on all sides to wretches so much viler than yourselves what a destiny is before you  what income i asked a resident in alexandria what income should an englishman have to live here comfortably to live here comfortably you should say ten thousand a year and then let him cut his throat first such was my friends reply  but god is good and alexandria will become a place less detestable than at present fate and circumstances must anglicize it in spite of the huge french consulate in spite of legions of greedy greeks in spite even of sand musquitos bugs and dirt of winds from india and of thieves from cyprus  the p and o company will yet be the lords of egypt either that or some other company or set of men banded together to make egypt a highway it is one stage on our road to the east and the time will soon come when of all the stages it will neither be the slowest nor the least comfortable the railway from alexandria to suez is now all opened within ten miles will be all opened before these pages can be printed this railway belongs to the viceroy of egypt but his passengers are the englishmen of india and his paymaster is an english company  but for all that i do not recommend any of my friends to make a long sojourn at alexandria  bertram and wilkinson did not do so but passed on speedily to cairo they went to the pharos and to pompeys pillar inspected cleopatras needle and the newly excavated socalled greek church watched the high spirits of one set of passengers going out to indiayoung men free of all encumbrances and pretty girls full of lifes brightest hopesand watched also the morose discontented faces of another set returning home burdened with babies and tawnycoloured nurses with silver rings in their toesand then they went off to cairo  there is no romance now gentle readers in this journey from alexandria to cairo nor was there much when it was taken by our two friends men now go by railway and then they went by the canal boat it is very much like english travelling with this exception that men dismount from their seats and cross the nile in a ferryboat and that they pay five shillings for their luncheon instead of sixpence this ferry does perhaps afford some remote chance of adventure as was found the other day when a carriage was allowed to run down the bank in which was sitting a native prince the heir to the pashas throne on that occasion the adventure was important and the prince was drowned but even this opportunity for incident will soon disappear for mr brunel or mr stephenson or mr locke or some other british engineering celebrity is building a railway bridge over the nile and then the modern travellers heart will be contented for he will be able to sleep all the way from alexandria to cairo  mr shepheards hotel at cairo is to an englishman the centre of egypt and there our two friends stopped and certainly our countrymen have made this spot more english than england itself if ever john bull reigned triumphant anywhere if he ever shows his nature plainly marked by rough plenty coarseness and good intention he does so at shepheards hotel if there be anywhere a genuine oldfashioned john bull landlord now living the landlord of the hotel at cairo is the man so much for the strange new faces and outlandish characters which one meets with in ones travels  i will not trouble my readers by a journey up the nile nor will i even take them up a pyramid for do not fitting books for such purposes abound at mr mudies wilkinson and bertram made both the large tour and the little one in proper style they got as least as far as thebes and slept a night under the shade of king cheops  one little episode on their road from cairo to the pyramids i will tell they had joined a party of which the conducting spirit was a missionary clergyman who had been living in the country for some years and therefore knew its ways no better conducting spirit for such a journey could have been found for he joined economy to enterprise and was intent that everything should be seen and that everything should be seen cheaply  old cairo is a village some three miles from the city higher up the river and here close to the nilometer by which the golden increase of the river is measured tourists going to the pyramids are ferried over the river the tourists are ferried over as also are the donkeys on which the tourists ride now here arose a great financial question the reis or master of the ferryboat to which the clerical guide applied was a mighty man some six feet high graced with a turban as arabs are erect in his bearing with bold eye and fine free supple limbsa noble reis for that nile ferryboat but noble as he was he wanted too many piastrestwopencehalfpenny a head too much for each donkey with its rider  and then there arose a great hubbub the ordinary hubbub at this spot is worse than the worst confusion of any other babel for the traffic over the nile is great and for every man woman and child for every horse and every ass for every bundle of grass for every cock and for every hen a din of twenty tongues is put in motion and a perpetual fury rages as the fury of a hurricane but the hubbub about the missionarys piastres rose higher than all the other hubbubs indeed those who were quarrelling before about their own affairs came and stood round in a huge circle anxious to know how the noble reis and his clerical opponent would ultimately settle this stiff financial difficulty  in half an hour neither side would yield one point but then at last the egyptian began to show that noble as he looked he was made of stuff compressible he gradually gave up para by para till he allowed donkeys men and women to clamber over the sides of his boat at the exact price named by him of the black coat never did the church have a more perfect success  but the battle was not yet over no sooner was the vessel pushed off into the stream than the noble reis declared that necessity compelled him to demand the number of piastres originally named by him he regretted it but he assured the clergyman that he had no other alternative  and now how did it behove an ardent missionary to act in such a contest with a subtle egyptian how should the eloquence of the church prevail over this eastern mammon it did prevail very signally the soldier of peace scorning further argument in words with such a crafty reis mindful of the lessons of his youth raised his right hand and with one blow between the eyes laid the arab captain prostrate on his own deck  there said he turning to wilkinson that is what we call a pastoral visitation in this country we can do nothing without it  the poor reis picked himself up and picked up also his turban which had been knocked off and said not a word more about the piastres all the crew worked with double diligence at their oars and the party as they disembarked from the boat were treated with especial deference even the donkeys were respected in egypt the donkeys of a man are respected ay and even his donkeyboys when he shows himself able and willing to knock down all those around him  a great man there a native killed his cook one morning in a rage and a dragoman learned in languages thus told the story to an englishmande sahib him vera respecble man him kill him cook solyman this morning oh de sahib particklar respecble after all it may be questioned whether this be not a truer criterion of respectability than that other one of keeping a gig  oh those pyramid guides foul false cowardly bullying thieves a man who goes to cairo must see the pyramids convention and the laws of society as arranged on that point of course require it but let no man and above all no woman assume that the excursion will be in any way pleasurable i have promised that i will not describe such a visit but i must enter a loud a screeching protest against the arab brutesthe schieks being the very worst of the bruteswho have these monuments in their hands their numbers the filthiness of their dressor one might almost say no dresstheir stench their obscene indecency their clattering noise their rapacity exercised without a moments intercession their abuse as in this wise very bad englishman dam bad dam dam dam him want to take all him money to the grave but no no no devil hab him and money too this be it remembered from a ferocious almost blackened arab with his face within an inch of your own and then their flattery as in this wise good englishmanvery goodand then a tawny hand pats your face and your back and the calves of your leghim gib poor arab one shilling for himselfyes yes yes and then arab no let him tumble down and break all him legsyes yes break all him legs and then the patting goes on again these things i say put together make a visit to the pyramids no delightful recreation my advice to my countrymen who are so unfortunate as to visit them is this let the ladies remain belownot that they ever will do so if the gentlemen who are with them ascendand let the men go armed with stout sticks and mercilessly belabour any arab who attempts either to bully or to wheedle  let every englishman remember this also that the ascent is not difficult though so much noise is made about the difficulty as naturally to make a man think that it is so and let this also be remembered that nothing is to be gained by entering the pyramid except dirt noise stench vermin abuse and want of air nothing is to be seen therenothing to be heard a man may sprain his ankle and certainly will knock his head he will encounter no other delights but these  but he certainly will come out a wiser man than he went in he will then be wise enough to know how wretched a place is the interior of a pyramidan amount of wisdom with which no teaching of mine will imbue him  bertram and wilkinson were sitting beneath the pyramid with their faces toward the desert enjoying the cool night air when they first began to speak of adela gauntlet hitherto arthur had hardly mentioned her name they had spoken much of his mother much of the house at hurst staple and much also of lady harcourt of whose separation from her husband they were of course aware but arthur had been shy of mentioning adelas name  they had been speaking of mrs wilkinson and the disagreeable position in which the vicar found himself in his own house when after sitting silent for a moment he said after all george i sometimes think that it would have been better for me to have married  of course it wouldor rather i should say will be better it is what you will do when you return  i dont know about my health now  your health will be right enough after this winter i dont see much the matter with it  i am better certainly and then there was another pause  arthur continued bertram i only wish that i had open before me the same chance in life that you havethe same chance of happiness  do not despair george a short time cures all our wounds  yes a short time does cure them alland then comes chaos  i meant a short time in this world  well all things are possible but i do not understand how mine are to be cured they have come too clearly from my own folly  from such folly said arthur as always impedes the working of human prudence  do you remember arthur my coming to you the morning after the degrees came downwhen you were so low in spirits because you had broken downwhen i was so full of triumph  i remember the morning well but i do not remember any triumph on your part  ah i was triumphanttriumphant in my innermost heart i thought then that all the world must give way to me because i had taken a doublefirst and nowi have given way before all the world what have i done with all the jewels of my youth thrown them before swine  come george you are hardly sevenandtwenty yet  no hardly and i have no profession no fortune no pursuit and no purpose i am here sitting on the broken stone of an old tomb merely because it is as well for me to be here as elsewhere i have made myself to be one as to whose whereabouts no man need make inquiryand no woman if that black oneeyed brute whom i thrashed atop of the pyramid had stuck his knife in me who would have been the worse for it you perhapsfor six weeks or so  you know there are many would have wept for you  i know but one she would have wept while it would be ten times better that she should rejoice yes she would weep for i have marred her happiness as i have marred my own but who cares for me of whose care i can be proud who is anxious for me whom i can dare to thank whom i may dare to love  do we not love you at hurst staple  i do not know but i know this that you ought to be ashamed of me i think adela gauntlet is my friend that is if in our pigheaded country a modest girl may love a man who is neither her brother nor her lover  i am sure she is said arthur and then there was another pause do you know he continued i once thought  thought what  that you were fond of adela  so i am heartily fond of her  but i mean more than that  you once thought that i would have married her if i could that is what you mean  yes said wilkinson blushing to his eyes but it did not matter for no one could see him  well i will make a clean breast of it arthur men can talk here sitting in the desert who would be as mute as death at home in england yes there was once a moment once one moment in which i would have married hera moment in which i flattered myself that i could forget caroline waddington ah if i could tell you how adela behaved  how did she behave tell mewhat did she say said arthur with almost feverish anxiety  she bade me remember that those who dare to love must dare to suffer she told me that the wounded stag that from the hunters aim has taen a hurt must endure to live left and abandoned of his velvet friendsand she told me true i have not all her courage but i will take a lesson from her and learn to sufferquietly without a word if that be possible  then you did propose to her  no hardly that i cannot tell what i said myself but twas thus she answered me  but what do you mean by taking a lesson from her has she any such suffering  nay you may ask her i did not  but you said so just now at any rate you left me to infer it is there any one whom adela gauntlet really loves  george bertram did not answer the question at once he had plighted his word to her as her friend that he would keep her secret and then moreover that secret had become known to him by mere guesses he had no right by any law to say it as a fact that adela gauntlet was not heartwhole but still he thought that he would say so why should he not do something towards making these two people happy  do you believe that adela is really in love with any one repeated arthur  if i tell you that will you tell me thisare you in love with any oneyou yourself  the young clergyman was again ruby red up to his forehead he could dare to talk about adela but hardly about himself  i in love he said at last you know that i have been obliged to keep out of that kind of thing circumstanced as i have been i could not marry  but that does not keep a man from falling in love  does not it said arthur rather innocently  that has not preserved menor i presume has it preserved you come arthur be honest if a man with thirtynine articles round his neck can be honest out with the truth at once do you love adela or do you not  but the truth would not come out so easily whether it was the thirtynine articles or the natural modesty of the mans disposition i will not say but he did not find himself at the moment able to give a downright answer to this downright question he would have been well pleased that bertram should know the whole truth but the task of telling it went against the grain with him  if you do and do not tell her so continued bertram when he found that he got no immediate reply i shall think you but no a man must be his own judge in such matters and of all men i am the least fit to be a judge of others but i would that it might be so for both your sakes  why you say yourself that she likes some one else  i have never said so i have said nothing like it there when you get home do you yourself ask her whom she loves but remember thisif it should chance that she should say that it is you you must be prepared to bear the burden whatever may be urged to the contrary at the vicarage and now we will retire to roost in this hole of ours  arthur had as yet made no reply to bertrams question but as he crept along the base of the pyramid feeling his steps among the sand and loose stones he did manage to say a word or two of the truth  god bless you george i do love hervery dearly and then the two cousins understood each other  it has been said that alexandria has nothing of an eastern town but its filth this cannot at all be said of cairo it may be doubted whether bagdad itself is more absolutely oriental in its appurtenances when once the englishman has removed himself five hundred yards from shepheards hotel he begins to feel that he is really in the east within that circle although it contains one of the numerous huge buildings appropriated to the viceroys own purposes he is still in great britain the donkeyboys curse in english instead of arabic the men you meet sauntering about though they do wear red caps have cheeks as red and the road is broad and macadamized and britannic but anywhere beyond that circle lewis might begin to paint  cairo is a beautiful old city so old in the realities of age that it is crumbling into dust on every side from time to time the houses are patched up but only patched and except on the britannic soil above alluded to no new houses are built it is full of romance of picturesque oriental wonders of strange sights strange noises and strange smells when one is well in the town every little narrow lane every turnand the turns are incessantevery mosque and every shop creates fresh surprise but i cannot allow myself to write a description of cairo  how the dervishes there spun and shook going through their holy exercises with admirable perseverance that i must tell this occurred towards the latter end of the winter when wilkinson and bertram had nearly completed their sojourn in cairo not but what the dervishes had roared out their monotonous prayer to allah duly every friday at 1 pm with as much precision as a service in one of your own cathedrals but our friends had put the thing off as hardly being of much interest and at last went there when they had only one friday left for the performance  i believe that as a rule a mahomedan hates a christian regarding him merely as christian he certainly does so had any tidings of confirmed success on the part of the rebels in india reached the furthermost parts of the turkish empire no christian life would have been safe there the horrid outrage perpetrated at jaffa and the massacre at jeddah sufficiently show us what we might have expected in syria no christian is admitted within a mosque for his foot and touch are considered to carry pollution  but in egypt we have caused ourselves to be better respected we thrash the arabs and pay them and therefore they are very glad to see us anywhere and even the dervishes welcome us to their most sacred rites with excellent coffee and a loan of rushbottomed chairs now when it is remembered that a mahomedan never uses a chair it must be confessed that this is very civil moreover let it be said to their immortal praise that the dervishes of cairo never ask for backsheish they are the only people in the country that do not  so bertram and wilkinson had their coffee with sundry other travelling britons who were there and then each with his chair in his hand went into the dervishes hall this was a large lofty round room the roof of which was in the shape of a cupola on one side that which pointed towards mecca and therefore nearly due east there was an empty throne or tribune in which the head of the college or dean of the chapter of dervishes located himself on his haunches he was a handsome powerful man of about forty with a fine black beard dressed in a flowing gown and covered by a flattopped black cap  by degrees and slowly in came the college of the dervishes and seated themselves as their dean was seated but they sat on the floor in a circle which spread away from the tribune getting larger and larger in its dimensions as fresh dervishes came in there was not much attention to regularity in their arrival for some appeared barely in time for the closing scene  the commencement was tame enough still seated they shouted out a short prayer to allah a certain number of times the number was said to be ninetynine but they did not say the whole prayer at once though it consisted of only three words they took the first word ninetynine times and then the second and then the third the only sound to be recognized was that of allah but the deep guttural tone in which this was groaned out by all the voices together made even that anything but a distinct word  and so this was completed the circle getting ever larger and larger and it was remarked that men came in as dervishes who belonged to various ordinary pursuits and trades there were soldiers in the circle and apparently common labourers indeed any one may join though i presume he would do so with some danger were it discovered that he were not a mahomedan  those who specially belonged to the college had peculiar gowns and caps and herded together on one side of the circle and it appeared to our friends that throughout the entertainment they were by far the least enthusiastic of the performers  when this round of groaning had been completedand it occupied probably half an houra young lad perhaps of seventeen years very handsome and handsomely dressed in a pucecoloured cloak or rather petticoat with a purple hat on his head in shape like an inverted flowerpot slipped forth from near the tribune into the middle of the circle and began to twirl after about five or six minutes two other younger boys somewhat similarly dressed did the same and twirled also so that there were three twirling together  but the twirling of the elder boy was by far the more graceful let any young lady put out both her hands so as to bring the one to the level of her waist and the other with the crown of her head and then go round and round as nearly as possible on the same spot let her do this so that no raising of either foot shall ever be visible and let her continue it for fifteen minutes without any variation in the attitude of her arms or any sign of fatigueand then she may go in for a twirling dervish it is absurd to suppose that any male creature in england could perform the feat during this twirling a little black boy marked the time by beating with two sticks on a rude gong  this dance was kept up at first for fifteen minutes then there was another short spell of howling then another dance or twirl and then the real game began  the circle had now become so large as to occupy the greater part of the hall and was especially swelled by sundry new arrivals at this moment in particular there came one swarthy tall wretchedlooking creature with wild eyes wan face and black hair of extraordinary length who took up his position standing immediately opposite to the tribune other new comers also stood near him all of whom were remarkable for the length of their hair some of them had it tied up behind like women and now proceeded to unloose it  but at this period considerable toilet preparations were made for the coming work all those in the circle who had not come in from the college with gowns and caps and one or two even of them deliberately took off their outer clothing and tied it up in bundles these bundles they removed to various corners so that each might again find his own clothes one or two put on calico dressinggowns which appeared to have been placed ready for the purpose and among these was the cadaverous man of the black hair  and then they all stood up the dean standing also before his tribune and a deeptoned murmur went round the circle this also was the word allah as was duly explained to bertram by his dragoman but without such explanation it would have been impossible to detect that any word was pronounced indeed the sound was of such nature as to make it altogether doubtful from whence it came it was like no human voice or amalgamation of voices but appeared as though it came from the very bowels of the earth at first it was exceedingly low but it increased gradually till at last one might have fancied that the legions of lucifer were groaning within the very bowels of pandemonium  and also by slow degrees a motion was seen to pervade the circle the men instead of standing fixedly on their legs leaned over first to the right and then to the left all swaying backwards and forwards together in the same direction so that both sound and motion were as though they came from one compact body  and then as the groan became louder so did the motion become more violent till the whole body heaved backwards and forwards with the regularity of a pendulum and the voice of a steamengine as the excitement became strong the head of the dervishes walked along the inner circle exciting those to more violence who already seemed the most violent this he did standing for a few minutes before each such man bowing his own head rapidly and groaning deeply and as he did so the man before whom he stood would groan and swing himself with terrible energy and the men with the long hair were especially selected  and by degrees the lateral motion was abandoned and the dervishes bowed their heads forwards instead of sideways no one who has not seen the operation can conceive what men may achieve in the way of bowing and groaning they bowed till they swept the floor with their long hair bending themselves double and after each motion bringing themselves up again to an erect posture and the dean went backwards and forwards from one to another urging them on  by this time the sight was terrible to behold the perspiration streamed down them the sounds came forth as though their very hearts were bursting their faces were hidden by their dishevelled locks whatever clothes they wore were reeking wet but still they flung themselves about the motion becoming faster and faster and still the sounds came forth as though from the very depths of tartarus and still the venerable dean went backwards and forwards slowly before them urging them on and still urging them on  but at last nature with the greater number of them had made her last effort the dean retired to his tribune and the circle was broken up but those men with the long hair still persevered it appeared both to bertram and wilkinson that with them the effort was now involuntary they were carried on by an ecstatic frenzy either that or they were the best of actors the circle had broken up the dervishes were lying listlessly along the walls panting with heat and nearly lifeless with their exertions but some four remaining with their feet fixed in the old place still bowed and still howled they will die said bertram  will they not be stopped said wilkinson to their dragoman  five minutes five minutes said the dragoman look at himlook at him with the black hair and they did look  three of them had now fallen and the one remained still at his task he swept the ground with his hair absolutely striking it with his head and the sounds came forth from him loudly wildly with broken gasps with terrible exertion as though each would be his last and yet they did nothing to repress him  at last it seemed as though the power of fully raising his head had left him and also that of lowering it to the ground but still he made as it were a quartercircle his hands were clutched behind his back and with this singular motion and in this singular attitude he began to move his feet and still groaning and half bowing he made a shuffling progress across the hall  the dervishes themselves appeared to take no notice of him the dean stood tranquil under his tribune those who had recovered from their exertions were dressing themselves the others lay about collecting their breath but the eyes of every stranger were on the still moving blackhaired devotee  on he went still howling and still swinging his head right towards the wall of the temple his pace was not fast but it seemed as though he would inevitably knock his own brains out by the motion of his own head and yet nobody stopped him  hell kill himself said wilkinson  no no no said the dragoman him no killhim head berry hard  bertram rushed forward as though to stay the infuriate fanatic but one or two of the dervishes who stood around gently prevented him without speaking a word  and then the finale came crack he went against the wall rebounded off and went at it again and then again they were no mock blows but serious heavy raps as from a small batteringram but yet both bertram and wilkinson were able to observe that he did not strike the wall as he would naturally have done had there been no precaution had he struck it with his head in motion as was intended to be believed the blow would have come upon his forehead and temples and must probably have killed him but instead of this just as he approached the wall he butted at it like a ram and saved his forehead at the expense of his pole it may probably be surmised therefore that he knew what he was about  after these three raps the man stood still doubled up but looking as though he were staggered and then he went again with his head towards the wall but the dean satisfied with what had been done now interposed and this best of dervishes was gently laid on his back upon the floor while his long matted hair was drawn from off his face as he so lay the sight was not agreeable to christian eyes whatever a true mahomedan might think of it  twas thus the dervishes practised their religious rites at cairo i wonder how much that black fellow gets paid every friday said bertram as he mounted his donkey it ought to be something very handsome     chapter ix  the two widows   the winter was now nearly over and the travellers had determined to return to england whatever other good purpose the city of cairo might or might not serve it had restored wilkinson to health bertram was sufficiently weary of living in a country in which the women go about with their faces hidden by long dirty stripes of calico which they call veils and in which that little which is seen of the ladies by no means creates a wish to see more and wilkinson since the conversation which they had had at the pyramids was anxious to assume his own rights in the vicaragehouse at hurst staple so they decided on returning about the middle of march but they decided also on visiting suez before doing so  in these days men go from cairo to suez as they do from london to birminghamby railway in those dayssome ten or twelve years back that isthey went in wooden boxes and were dragged by mules through the desert  we cannot stay long at suez nor should i carry my reader there even for a day seeing how triste and dull the place is had not our hero made an acquaintance there which for some time was likely to have a considerable effect on his future life  suez is indeed a triste unhappy wretched place it is a small oriental town now much beeuropeanized and in the process of being beanglicized it is not so beelzebubridden a spot as alexandria nor falling to pieces like cairo but it has neither water air nor verdure no trees grow there no rivers flow there men drink brine and eat goats and the thermometer stands at eighty in the shade in winter the oranges are the only luxury there is a huge hotel which contains long rows of hot cells and a vast cave in which people eat the interest of the place consists in pharoahs passage over the red sea but its future prosperity will be caused by a transit of a different naturethe passage of the english to and from india will turn even suez into an important town  here the two travellers encountered a flood of indians on their return home the boat from calcutta came in while they were there and suddenly all the cells were tenanted and the cave was full of spoiled children tawny nurses pale languid mothers and dyspeptic fathers these were to be fellowtravellers homewards with bertram and wilkinson  neither of our friends regarded with favour the crowd which made them even more uncomfortable than they had been before as englishmen in such positions generally do they kept themselves aloof and scowled frowned at the children who whined in the nearest neighbourhood to them and listened in disgust to the continuous chatter about punkahs tiffins and bungalows  but close to them at the end of the long table at the common dinner sat two ladies on whom it was almost impossible for them to frown for be it known that at these hotels in egypt a man cannot order his dinner when he pleases he must breakfast at nine and dine at six as others door go without and whether he dine or whether he do not he must pay the medes and persians were lax and pliable in their laws in comparison with these publicans  both george and arthur would have frowned if they could have done so but on these two ladies it was impossible to frown they were both young and both pretty georges neighbour was uncommonly prettywas indeed one of the prettiest women that he had ever seenthat any man could see anywhere she was full of smiles too and her smile was heavenlywas full of words and her words were witty she who sat next arthur was perhaps less attractive but she had large soft eyes which ever and anon she would raise to his face and then let fall again to her plate in a manner which made sparks fly round the heart even of our somewhat sombre young hampshire vicar  the four were soon in full conversation apparently much to the disgust of two militarylooking gentlemen who sat on the other side of the ladies and it was evident that the military gentlemen and the ladies were or ought to be on terms of intimacy for proffers of soup and mutton and wine were whispered low and little attempts at confidential intercourse were made but the proffers were rejected and the attempts were in vain the ladies preferred to have their plates and glasses filled by the strangers turned their shoulders on their old friends with but scant courtesy and were quite indifferent to the frowns which at last clouded those two military brows  and the brows of major biffin and captain mgramm were clouded they had been filling the plates and glasses of these two ladies all the way from calcutta they had walked with them every day on deck had fetched their chairs picked up their handkerchiefs and looked after their bottled beer at tiffintime with an assiduity which is more than commendable in such warm latitudes and now to be thrown on one side for two travelling englishmen one in a brown coat and the other in a black onefor two muffs who had never drunk sangaree or sat under a punkah  this was unpleasant to major biffin and captain mgramm but then why had the major and the captain boasted of the favours they had daily received to that softlooking superannuated judge and to their bilious friend dr oshaughnessy the judge and the doctor had of course their female allies and had of course repeated to them all the boasts of the fortunate major and of the fortunate captain and was it not equally of course that these ladies should again repeat the same to mrs cox and mrs price for she who was so divinely perfect was mrs cox and she of the soft lustrous eyes was mrs price those who think that such a course was not natural know little of voyages home from calcutta to southampton  but the major who had been the admirer of mrs cox had done more than thishad done worse we may say the world of the good ship lahore which was bringing them all home had declared ever since they had left point de galle that the major and mrs cox were engaged  now had the major in boasting of his favours boasted also of his engagement no harm perhaps might have come of it the sweet goodnature of the widow might have overlooked that offence but he had boasted of the favours and poohpoohed the engagement hinc illæ lacrymæ and who shall say that the widow was wrong and as to the other widow mrs price she was tired of captain mgramm a little fact had transpired about captain mgramm namely that he was going home to his wife and therefore the two ladies who had conspired together to be civil to the two warriors now conspired together to be uncivil to them in england such things are done as it were behind the scenes there these little quarrels are managed in private but a passage home from india admits of but little privacy there is no behind the scenes the two widows were used to this and quarrelled with their military admirers in public without any compunction  hinc illæ lacrymæ but the major was not inclined to shed his tears without an effort he had poohpoohed the idea of marrying mrs cox but like many another man in similar circumstances he was probably willing enough to enter into such an arrangement now that the facility of doing so was taken from him it is possible that mrs cox when she turned her pretty shoulder on major biffin may herself have understood this phasis of human nature  the major was a handsome man with wellbrushed hair welltrimmed whiskers a forehead rather low but very symmetrical a wellshaped nose and a small pursy mouth the worst of his face was that you could by no means remember it but he knew himself to be a handsome man and he could not understand how he could be laid aside for so ugly a lout as this stranger from england captain mgramm was not a handsome man and he was aware that he fought his battle under the disadvantage of a wife but he had impudence enough to compensate him for this double drawback  during this first dinner arthur wilkinson was not more than coldly civil to mrs price but bertram became after a while warmly civil to mrs cox it is so very nice to be smiled on by the prettiest woman in the room and it was long since he had seen the smile of any pretty woman indeed for the last eighteen months he had had but little to do with such smiles  before dinner was over mrs cox had explained to bertram that both she and her friend mrs price were in deep affliction they had recently lost their husbandsthe one by cholera that was poor dear cox who had been collector of the honourable companys taxes at panjabee whereas lieutenant price of the 71st native bengal infantry had succumbed tohere mrs cox shook her head and whispered and pointed to the champagneglass which bertram was in the act of filling for her poor cox had gone just eight months but price had taken his last glass within six and so bertram knew all about it  and then there was a great fuss in packing the travellers into the wooden boxes it seems that they had all made up their own parties by sixes that being the number of which one box was supposed to be capable but pretty women are capricious and neither mrs price nor mrs cox were willing to abide by any such arrangement when the time came for handing them in they both objected to the box pointed out to them by major biffinrefused to be lifted in by the arms of captain mgrammgot at last into another vacant box with the assistance of our friendssummoned their dingy nurses and babies into the same box for each was so providedand then very prettily made way for mr bertram and mr wilkinson and so they went across the desert  then they all stayed a night at cairo and then they went on to alexandria and by the time that they were embarked in a boat together on their way to that gallant firstclass steamer the cagliari they were as intimate as though they had travelled round the world together and had been as long about it as captain cook  what will you take with you mrs cox said bertram as he stood up in the boat with the baby on one arm while with the other he handed the lady towards the ships ladder  a good ducking said mrs cox with a cheery laugh as at the moment a dashing wave covered them with its spray and ive got it too with a vengeance ha ha take care of the baby whatever you do and if she falls over mind you go after her and with another little peal of silver ringing laughter she tripped up the side of the ship and bertram with the baby followed after her  she is such a giddy thing said mrs price turning her soft eyes on poor arthur wilkinson oh laws i know i shall be drowned do hold me and arthur wilkinson did hold her and nearly carried her up into the ship as he did so his mind would fly off to adela gauntlet but his arms and legs were not the less at the service of mrs price  and now look after the places said mrs cox you havent a moment to lose and look here mr bertram mind i wont sit next to major biffin and for heavens sake dont let us be near that fellow mgramm and so bertram descended into the salon to place their cards in the places at which they were to sit for dinner two and two opposite to each other sang out mrs cox as he went there was a sweetness in her voice a low mellow cheeriness in her tone which combined with her beauty went far to atone for the nature of what she said and bertram not unwillingly obeyed her behests  oh my blessed baby said mrs price as the nurse handed her the childwhich however she immediately handed back how can i thank you enough mr wilkinson what should we have done without you i wonder whether its near tiffin i am so faint  shall i fetch you anything said he  if you could get me a glass of porter but i dont think theyll give it you they are so uncivil  arthur went for the beer but went in vain the steward said that lunch would be ready at twelve oclock  they are such brutes said mrs price well i suppose i must wait and she again turned her eyes upon arthur and he again thought of adela gauntlet  and then there was the ordinary confusion of a starting ship men and women were hurrying about after their luggage asking all manner of unreasonable questions ladies were complaining of their berths and servants asking where on hearth they were to sleep gentlemen were swearing that they had been shamefully doubled upthat is made to lie with two or three men in the same cabin and friends were contriving to get commodious seats for dinner the officers of the ship were all busy treating with apparent indifference the thousand questions that were asked them on every side and all was bustle confusion hurry and noise  and then they were off the pistons of the engine moved slowly up and down the huge cranks revolved and the waters under the bow rippled and gave way they were off and the business of the voyage commenced the younger people prepared for their flirtations the mothers unpacked their childrens clothes and the elderly gentlemen lighted their cigars  what very queer women they are said arthur walking the deck with his cousin  but very pretty and very agreeable i like them both  dont you think them too free and easy  ah you must not judge of them by women who have lived in england who have always had the comfort of wellarranged homes they have been knocked about ill used and forced to bear hardships as men bear them but still there is about them so much that is charming they are so frank  yes very frank said arthur  it is well to see the world on all sides said george for myself i think that we are lucky to have come across themthat is if major biffin does not cut my throat  i hope captain mgramm wont cut mine he looked as though he would  did you ever see such an ass as that biffin i dont wonder that she has become sick of him and then he has behaved so very badly to her i really do pity her she has told me all about it  and so has mrs price told me all about captain mgramm  has she well it seems that he biffin has taken advantage of her frank easy manner and talked of her to every man in the ship i think she has been quite right to cut him and so they discussed the two ladies  and at last mrs price got her porter and mrs cox got her pale ale i do like pale ale said she i suppose its vulgar but i cant help that what amuses me is that so many ladies drink it who are quite ashamed to say they like it  they take it for their healths sake said bertram  oh yes of course they do mrs bangster takes her halfpint of brandy every night for her healths sake no doubt would you believe it mr bertram the doctor absolutely had to take her out of the saloon one night in the lahore didnt he mrs price  indeed he did i never was so shockedjust a little drop more to freshen it and mr wilkinson gave her another glass of porter  before they reached malta all the passengers from india had agreed that mrs cox and bertram would certainly make a match of it and that wilkinson was also in danger  did you ever see such flirts said mrs bangster to dr oshaughnessey what an escape biffin has had  she is a deuced pretty woman mrs bangster and ill tell you what biffin would give one of his eyes to get her back again if he could  laws doctor you dont mean to tell me that he ever meant to marry that thing  i dont know what he meant before but he would mean it now if he got the opportunity  here captain mgramm joined them well mac said the doctor what news with the widow  widow theyd all be widows if they could i believe  indeed i wouldnt for one said mrs bangster b is a deal too well off where he is ha ha ha  but what about mrs priceeh mac continued the doctor  there she is youd better go and ask her yourself you dont suppose i ever cared about such a woman as that only i do say this if she goes on behaving herself in that way some one ought to speak to the captain  but mrs cox and mrs price went on their own way heeding such menaces not at all and by the time they had reached malta they had told the whole history of their lives to the two gentlemenand perhaps something more  at malta they remained about six hours and the four dined on shore together bertram bought for them maltese veils and bad cameos and wilkinson misled by such an example was forced to do the same these treasures were not hidden under a bushel when they returned to the ship and dr oshaughnessey mrs bangster the fat judge and a host of others were more sure than ever that both the widows were reengaged  and arthur wilkinson was becoming frightened in his mind upon my word said he as he and george were walking the deck at sunrise the next morning upon my word i am getting very tired of this woman and i really think we are making a show of ourselves  making a show of ourselves what do you mean  why walking with them every day and always sitting next to them  as to sitting next to them we cant help that everybody always sits in the same place and one must sit next some one and it wouldnt be kind to leave them to walk alone  i think we may overdo it you know  ah well said george you have some one else to think about i have no one unless it be this widow she is kind to me and as to what the world says i care nothing about it  on that day wilkinson was busy with his books and did not walk with mrs pricea piece of neglect which sat uneasily on that ladys mind but at ten oclock as usual bertram was pacing the deck with mrs cox  what is the matter with your friend said she  oh nothing he is homesick i suppose  i hope he has not quarrelled with minnie for the two ladies had come to call each other by their christian names when they were in company with the gentlemen and bertram had once or twice used that of mrs cox not exactly in speaking to her but in speaking of her in her presence  oh dear no said bertram  because it is so odd he should not give her his arm as usual i suppose you will be treating me so as we draw nearer to southampton and she looked up at him with a bewitching smile and pressed gently on his arm and then let her eyes fall upon the deck  my brother when you see these tricks played upon other men the gall rises black within your breast and you loudly condemn wiles which are so womanly but which are so unworthy of women but how do you feel when they are played upon yourself the gall is not so black the condemnation less loud your own merit seems to excuse the preference which is shown you your heart first forgives and then applauds is it not so my brother with you so it was at least with george bertram  what treating you with neglect because we are soon to part  yes exactly so just that because we are soon to part that is what makes it so bitter we have been such good friends havent we  and why should we not remain so why should we talk of parting we are both going to england  england yes but england is a large place come let us lean on the taffrail and look at the dolphins there is that horrid fellow eyeing me as he always does major biffin i mean is he not exactly like a barbers block i do so hate him  but he doesnt hate you mrs cox  doesnt he well then he may if he likes but dont lets talk of him talk to me about england mr bertram sometimes i do so long to be thereand then sometimes i dont  you dontwhy not  do you  no i do not i tell you frankly id sooner be here with you to talk to with you to look at  psha mr bertram what nonsense i cant conceive that any woman can ever be worth looking at on board a shipmuch less such a one as i i know youre dying to get home  i might be if i had a home  is your home with that uncle of yours she had heard so much of his family but he had as yet spoken to her no word about caroline i wonder what he would say if he could see you now leaning here and talking to me  if he has any knowledge of human nature he would say that i was a very happy fellow  and are you as she asked him she looked up into his face with such an arch smile that he could not find it in his heart to condemn her  what will you think of my gallantry if i say no  i hate gallantry it is all bosh i wish i were a man and that i could call you bertram and that you would call me cox  i would sooner call you annie  would you but that wouldnt be right would it and her hand which was still within his arm was pressed upon it with ever so light a pressure  i dont know why it should be wrong to call people by their christian names should you be angry if i called you annie  that might depend tell me this mr bertram how many other ladies do you call by their christian names  a dozen or two  ill be bound you do  and may i add you to the number  no mr bertram certainly not  may i not so intimate as we have become i thought  i will not be one of a dozen or two and as she answered him she dropped her tone of raillery and spoke in a low soft sweet voice it sounded so sweet on bertrams ear  but if there be not onenot one other not one other nowwhat then annie  not one other nowdid you say now then there has been one  yes there has been one  and shewhat of her  it is a tale i cannot tell  not to me i should not like you the less for telling me do tell me and she pressed her hand again upon his arm i have known there was something that made you unhappy  have you  oh yes i have long known that and i have so wished to be a comfort to youif i could i too have had great suffering  i am sure you have  ah yes i did not suffer less because he had been unkind to me and she put her handkerchief to her eyes and then brought her hand again upon his arm but tell me of heryour one she is not your one nowis she mr bertram  no annie not now  is she and she hesitated to ask whether the lady were dead or married to some one else it might after all only be a lovers quarrel  i drove her from meand now she is a wife  drove her from you alas alas said mrs cox with the sweetest emphasis of sympathy but the result of her inquiries was not unsatisfactory to her  i dont know why i should have told you this said he  i am so glad you have she replied  but now that i have told you  well  now may i call you annie  you have done so two or three times  but may i  if it please you you may and the words though whispered very low fell clearly upon his ear  dearest annie  but i did not say you might call me that  but you are  am i  dearestall but she will that make you angry with me  no not angry but  but what  she looked up at him pouting with her lip there was a halfsmile on her mouth and half a tear in her eyes and her shoulder leant against him and her heart palpitated she had never been so beautiful never so attractive  but what what would you say annie  i would say thisbut i know you will think me very bold  i shall not think you too bold if you will say the truth  then i would say thisthat if i loved a man i could love him quite as fondly as she loved you  could you annie  i could but he should not drive me from him as you say you did her nevernevernever he might kill me if he would but if i once had told him that i loved him i would never leave him afterwards  tell me so annie  no mr bertram we have not known each other long enough and now she took her hand from his arm and let it drop by her side  tell me so dear annie he repeated and he tried to regain her hand  there is the luncheonbell and since mr wilkinson wont go to mrs price i must do so  shall i go said he  do i will go down by myself  but you love me anniesay that you love me  nonsense here is that fellow biffin do you go for mrs priceleave me to myself  dont go down stairs with him  you may be sure i wontnor with you either this morning i am half inclined to be angry with you and so saying she moved away  ah me what have i done said bertram to himself as he went upon his mission but she is a sweet creature as beautiful as hebe and why should i be wretched for ever  she had moved towards the companionladder and as she did so major biffin followed her  will you not allow me to give you an arm down stairs said he  thank you major biffin it is rather crowded and i can go better alone  you did not find the stairs in the lahore too crowded  oh yes i did very often and the lahore and the cagliari are different things  very different it seems but the sea itself is not so fickle as a woman and major biffin became a picture of injured innocence  and the land is not so dry as a man major biffin that is some men ha ha ha goodmorning major biffin and so saying she went down by herself  on the next day arthur still preferred his book to walking with mrs price and that lady was once again seen with her arm in that of captain mgramms this made a considerable consternation in the ship and in the afternoon there was a slight quarrel between the two ladies  and so minnie you are going to take up with that fellow again  no i am not but i dont choose to be left altogether to myself  i never would have anything to say to a married man that drops his wife as he does  i dont care two straws for him or his wife but i dont want to make myself conspicuous by a quarrel  im sure wilkinson will be annoyed said mrs cox  hes a muff said mrs price and if i am not mistaken i know some one else who is another  who do you mean mrs price  i mean mr bertram mrs cox  oh i dare say he is a muff thats because hes attentive to me instead of leaving me to myself as somebody does to somebody else i understand all about that my dear  you understand a great deal i have no doubt said mrs price i always heard as much  it seems to me you understand nothing or you wouldnt be walking about with captain mgramm said mrs cox and then they parted before blood was absolutely drawn between them  at dinner that day they were not very comfortable together mrs price accepted mr wilkinsons ordinary courtesies in a stately way thanking him for filling her glass and looking after her plate in a tone and with a look which made it plain to all that things were not progressing well between them george and his annie did get on somewhat better but even they were not quite at their ease mrs cox had said before luncheon that she had not known mr bertram long enough to declare her love for him but the hours between luncheon and dinner might have been a sufficient prolongation of the period of their acquaintance george however had not repeated the question and had indeed not been alone with her for five minutes during the afternoon  that evening wilkinson again warned his friend that he might be going too far with mrs cox that he might say that which he could neither fulfil nor retract for wilkinson clearly conceived it to be impossible that bertram should really intend to marry this widow  and why should i not marry her said george  she would not suit you nor make you happy  what right have i to think that any woman will suit me or what chance is there that any woman will make me happy is it not all leather and prunella she is pretty and clever soft and feminine where shall i find a nicer toy to play with you forget arthur that i have had my daydreams and been roused from them somewhat roughly with you the pleasure is still to come  after this they turned in and went to bed     chapter x  reaching home   early in their journeyings together mrs cox had learned from george that he was possessed of an eccentric old uncle and not long afterwards she had learned from arthur that this uncle was very rich that he was also childless and that he was supposed to be very fond of his nephew putting all these things together knowing that bertram had no profession and thinking that therefore he must be a rich man she had considered herself to be acting with becoming prudence in dropping major biffin for his sake  but on the day after the love scene recorded in the last chapter a strange change came over the spirit of her dream i am a very poor man bertram had said to her after making some allusion to what had taken place  if that were all that would make no difference with me said mrs cox magnanimously  if that were all annie what does that mean  if i really loved a man i should not care about his being poor but your poverty is what i should call riches i take it  no indeed my poverty is absolute poverty my own present income is about two hundred a year  oh i dont understand the least about money myself i never did i was such a child when i was married to cox but i thought mr bertram your uncle was very rich  so he is as rich as a goldmine but we are not very good friendsat any rate not such friends as to make it probable that he will leave me a farthing he has a granddaughter of his own  this and a little more of the same kind taught mrs cox that it behoved her to be cautious that major biffin had a snug little income over and above that derived from his profession was a fact that had been very well ascertained that he was very dry as dry as a barbers block might be true that george bertram was an amusing fellow and made love in much better style than the major certainly was true but little as she might know about money mrs cox did know thisthat when poverty comes in at the door love flies out at the window that eating and drinking are stern necessities that love in a cottage is supposed to be what she would call bosh and that her own old home used to be very unpleasant when cox was in debt and those eastern jewish harpies would come down upon him with his overdue bills considering all this mrs cox thought it might be well not to ratify her engagement with mr bertram till after they should reach southampton what if biffinthe respectable biffinshould again come forward  and so they went on for a few days longer bertram when they were together called her annie and once again asked her whether she loved him whether i do or whether i do not i shall give you no answer now she had said half laughing we have both been very foolish already and it is time that we should begin to have our senses isnt it but still she sat next him at dinner and still she walked with him once indeed he found her saying a word to major biffin as that gentleman stood opposite to her chair upon the deck but as soon as the majors back was turned she said to bertram i think the barbers block wants to be new curled doesnt it i declare the barbers man has forgotten to comb out its whiskers so that bertram had no ground for jealousy of the major  somewhere about this time mrs price deserted them at dinner she was going to sit she said with mrs bangster and dr shaughnessey and the judge mrs bangster had made a promise to old mr price in england to look after her and therefore she thought it better to go back to mrs bangster before they reached southampton they were now past gibraltar so on that day mrs prices usual chair at dinner was vacant and wilkinson looking down the tables saw that room had been made for her next to dr shaughnessey and on her other side sat captain mgramm in despite of mrs bangsters motherly care and of his own wife at home on the following morning mrs price and captain mgramm were walking the deck together just as they had been used to do on the other side of suez  and so things went on till the day before their arrival at southampton mrs cox still kept her seat next to bertram and opposite to wilkinson though no other lady remained to countenance her she and bertram still walked the deck arm in arm but their whisperings were not so low as they had been nor were their words so soft nor indeed was the temper of the lady so sweet what if she should have thrown away all the advantages of the voyage what if she had fallen between two stools she began to think that it would be better to close with one or with the otherwith the one despite his poverty or with the other despite his head  and now it was the evening of the last day they had sighted the coast of devonshire and the following morning would see them within the southampton waters ladies had packed their luggage subscriptions had been made for the band the captains health had been drunk at the last dinner and the mail boxes were being piled between the decks  well it is nearly over said mrs cox as she came upon deck after dinner warmly cloaked how cold we all are  yes it is nearly over answered bertram what an odd life of itself one of these voyages is how intimate people are who will never see each other again  yes that is the way i suppose oh mr bertram  well what would you have  ah me i hardly know fate has ever been against me and i know that it will be so to the last  is it not cold said bertram buttoning up a greatcoat as he spoke  very cold very cold said mrs cox but there is something much colder than the weathervery much colder  you are severe mrs cox  yes it is mrs cox here it was annie when we were off gibraltar that comes of being near home but i knew that it would be so i hate the very idea of home and she put her handkerchief to her eyes  she had had her chance as far as bertram was concerned and had let it pass from her he did not renew his protestations but in lieu of doing so lit a cigar and walked away into the forepart of the vessel after all arthur is right said he to himself marriage is too serious a thing to be arranged in a voyage from alexandria to southampton  but luckily for mrs cox everybody did not think as he did he had gone from her ruthlessly cruelly falsely with steps which sounded as though there were triumph in his escape and left her seated alone near the skylights but she was not long alone as she looked after him along the deck the head of major biffin appeared to her emerging from the saloon stairs she said nothing to herself now about barbers blocks or uncurled whiskers  well mrs cox said the major accosting her  well major biffin and the major thought that he saw in her eye some glimpse of the smile as of old  we are very near home now mrs cox said the major  very near indeed said mrs cox and then there was a slight pause during which major biffin took an opportunity of sitting down not very far from his companion  i hope you have enjoyed your voyage said he  which voyage she asked  oh your voyage home from alexandriayour voyage since you made the acquaintance of mrwhats his name the parsons cousin  mr whatshisname as you call him is nothing to me i can assure you major biffin his real name however is bertram he has been very civil when some other people were not inclined to be so that is all  is that all the people here do say  then i tell you what major biffin i do not care one straw what the people saynot one straw you know whose fault it has been if i have been thrown with this stranger nobody knows it as well and mind this major biffin i shall always do as i like in such matters without reference to you or to any one else i am my own mistress  and do you mean to remain so  ask no questions and then youll be told no stories  thats civil  if you dont like it you had better go for theres more to follow of the same sort  you are very sharp tonight  not a bit sharper than i shall be tomorrow  one is afraid even to speak to you now  then one had better hold ones tongue  mrs cox was receiving her suitor rather sharply but she probably knew his disposition he did not answer her immediately but sat biting the top of his cane ill tell you what it is mrs cox he said at last i dont like this kind of thing  dont you mr biffin and what kind of thing do you like  i like you  psha tell me something new if you must tell me anything  come annie do be serious for a moment there isnt much time left now and ive come to you in order that i may get a plain answer  if you want a plain answer youd better ask a plain question i dont know what you mean  will you have me thats a plain question or the deuce is in it  and what should i do with you  why be mrs biffin of course  ha ha ha and it has come to that has it what was it you said to dr oshaughnessey when we were off point de galle  well what did i say  i know what you said well enough and so do you too if i served you right i should never speak to you again  a man doesnt like to be humbugged you know before a whole shipful of people said the major defending himself  and a woman likes it just as little major biffin please to remember that  well im sure youve been down upon me long enough  not a bit longer than you deserved you told oshaughnessey that it was all very well to amuse yourself going home i hope you like your amusement now i have liked mine very well i can assure you  i dont think so bad of you as to believe you care for that fellow  there are worse fellows than he is major biffin but there i have had my revenge and now if you have anything to say ill give you an answer  ive only to say annie that i love you better than any woman in the world  i may believe as much of that as i like  you may believe it all come theres my hand  well i suppose i must forgive you theres mine will that please you  major biffin was the happiest man in the world and mrs cox went to her berth that night not altogether dissatisfied before she did so she had the majors offer in writing in her pocket and had shown it to mrs price with whom she was now altogether reconciled  i only wish minnie that there was no mrs mgramm said she  he wouldnt be the man for me at all my dear so dont let that fret you  theres as good fish in the sea as ever were caught yet eh minnie  of course there are though of course you think there never was such a fish as biffin  hell do well enough for me minnie and when you catch a bigger and a better i wont begrudge him you  that night mrs cox took her evening modicum of creaturecomforts sitting next to her lover the major and our two friends were left alone by themselves the news had soon spread about the ship and to those ladies who spoke to her on the subject mrs cox made no secret of the fact men in this world catch their fish by various devices and it is necessary that these schemes should be much studied before a man can call himself a fisherman it is the same with women and mrs cox was an izaak walton among her own sex had she not tied her fly with skill and thrown her line with a steady hand she would not have had her trout in her basket there was a certain amount of honour due to her for her skill and she was not ashamed to accept it  goodnight mrs cox bertram said to her that evening with a goodhumoured tone i hear that i am to congratulate you  goodnight said she giving him her hand and ill say goodbye too for we shall all be in such a flurry tomorrow morning im sure you think ive done the right thingdont you and mind this i shall hope to see you some day and so saying she gave him a kindly grasp and they parted done right said bertram yes i suppose she has right enough at least as far as i am concerned after all what husband is so convenient as a barbers block  on the following morning they steamed up the southampton river and at nine oclock they were alongside the quay all manner of people had come on board in boats and the breakfast was eaten in great confusion but few of the ladies were to be seen they had tea and rolls in their own cabins and did not appear till the last moment among these were mrs cox and mrs price  these ladies during their journey home had certainly not been woebegone either in personal appearance or in manner and who would have the heart to wish that they should be so they had been dressed as young ladies on board ship usually do dress so that their widowhood had been forgotten and but for their babies their wifehood might have been forgotten also  but now they were to be met by family friendsby friends who were thinking of nothing but their bereavements old mr price came to meet them on board and mrs coxs uncle old gentlemen with faces prepared for sadness and young ladies with sympathetic handkerchiefs how signally surprised the sad old gentlemen and the sympathetic young ladies must have been  not a whit just as our friends were about to leave the ship that morning with all their luggage collected round them they were startled by the apparition of two sombre female figures buried in most sombre tokens of affliction under the deep crape of their heavy black bonnets were to be seen that chiefest sign of heavy female woea widows cap what signal of sorrow that grief holds out ever moves so much as this their eyes were red with weeping as could be seen when for a moment their deep bordered handkerchiefs were allowed to fall from their faces their eyes were red with weeping and the agonizing grief of domestic bereavement sat chiselled on every feature if you stood near enough your heart would melt at the sound of their sobs  alas that forms so light that creatures so young should need to be shrouded in such vestments they were all crape that dull weeping widows crape from the deck up to their shoulders there they stood monuments of death living tombs whose only sign of life was in their tears there they stood till they might fall vanquished by the pangs of memory into the arms of their respective relations  they were mrs cox and mrs price bertram and wilkinson as they passed them lifted their hats and bowed and the two ladies observing them returned their salutation with the coldest propriety     chapter xi  i could put a codicil   on their journey up from southampton george and arthur parted from each other george went on direct to london whereas arthur turned off from basingstoke towards his own home  take my advice now if you never do again said bertram as they parted make yourself master of your own house and as soon after as possible make her the mistress of it  thats easily said old fellow repeated the other  make the attempt at any rate if i am anything of a prophet it wont be in vain and so they parted  at southampton they had learnt that there had been a partial crash in the government the prime minister had not absolutely walked forth followed by all his satellites as is the case when a successful turn in the wheel gives the outs a full whiphand over the ins but it had become necessary to throw overboard a brace or two of jonahs so that the ship might be lightened to meet a coming storm and among those so thrown over had been our unfortunate friend sir henry harcourt  and this as regards him had hardly been the worst of it we all know that bigwigs are never dismissed when it becomes necessary to get rid of them they resign now resignation is clearly a voluntary act and it seemed that sir henry having no wish that way had not at first performed this act of volition his own particular friends in the cabinet those to whom he had individually attached himself were gone but nevertheless he made no sign he was still ready to support the government and as the attorneygeneral was among those who had shaken the dust from their feet and gone out sir henry expected that he would as a matter of course walk into that gentlemans shoes  but another learned gentleman was appointed and then at last sir henry knew that he must go he had resigned but no resignation had ever appeared to have less of volition in it and how could it be otherwise political success was everything to him and alas he had so played his cards that it was necessary to him that that success should be immediate he was not as those are who in losing power lose a costly plaything which they love indeed over well but the loss of which hurts only their pride place to him was everything and feeling this he had committed that most grievous of political sinshe had endeavoured to hold his place longer than he was wanted now however he was out so much in some sort of way bertram had learnt before he left southampton  his first business in london was to call on mr pritchett  oh master george oh master george began that worthy man as soon as he saw him his tone had never been so lachrymose nor his face so full of woe oh master george  bertram in his kindest way asked after his uncle  oh master george you shouldnt be going to them furren partsindeed you shouldnt and he in such a state  is he worse than when i last saw him mr pritchett  gentlemen at his time of life dont get much better master georgenor yet at mine its half a million of money halfamillionofmoney but its no use talking to you sirit never was  by degrees bertram gathered from him that his uncle was much weaker that he had had a second and a much more severe attack of paralysis and that according to all the doctors the old gentleman was not much longer for this world sir omicron himself had been there miss baker had insisted on it much in opposition to her uncles wishes but sir omicron had shaken his head and declared that the fiat had gone forth  death had given his order the heavy burden of the halfmillion must be left behind and the soul must walk forth free from all its toils to meet such æthereal welcome as it could find  mr bertram had been told and had answered that he supposed as much a man when he was too old to live must die he had said though all the sir omicrons in europe should cluster round his bed it was only throwing money away what twenty pounds and being too weak to scold he had turned his face to the wall in sheer vexation of spirit death he could encounter like a man but why should he be robbed in his last moments  youll go down to him master george wheezed out poor pritchett though its too late for any good its all arranged now of course  bertram said that he would go down immediately irrespective of any such arrangements and then remembering of whom that hadley household had consisted when he left england in the early winter he asked as to the two ladies  miss baker is there of course  oh yes miss baker is there she doesnt go to any furren parts master george  andand  yes shes in the house toopoor creaturepoor creature  then how am i to go there said george speaking rather to himself than to mr pritchett  what you wouldnt stay away from him now because of that you ought to go to him master george though there were ten lady harcourts thereor twenty this was said in a tone that was not only serious but full of melancholy mr pritchett had probably never joked in his life and had certainly never been less inclined to do so than now when his patron was dying and all his patrons money was to go into other and into unknown hands  some other information bertram received from his most faithful ally sir henry had been three times to hadley but he had only once succeeded in seeing mr bertram and then the interview had been short and as mr pritchett surmised not very satisfactory his last visit had been since that paid by sir omicron and on that occasion the sick man had sent out to say that he could not see strangers all this mr pritchett had learnt from miss baker sir henry had not seen his wife since that daynow nearly twelve months sinceon which she had separated herself from him he had made a formal application to her to return to him but nothing had come of it and mr pritchett took upon himself to surmise again that sir henry was too anxious about the old gentlemans money to take any steps that could be considered severe until and then mr pritchett wheezed so grievously that what he said was not audible  george immediately wrote to miss baker announcing his return and expressing his wish to see his uncle he did not mention lady harcourts name but he suggested that perhaps it would be better under existing circumstances that he should not remain at hadley he hoped however that his uncle would not refuse to see him and that his coming to the house for an hour or so might not be felt to be an inconvenience by return of post he got an answer from miss baker in which she assured him that his uncle was most anxious for his presence and had appeared to be more cheerful since he had heard of his nephews return than he had been for the last two months as for staying at hadley george could do as he liked miss baker said but it was but a sad household and perhaps it would be more comfortable for him to go backwards and forwards by the railway  this correspondence caused a delay of two days and on one of them bertram received a visit which he certainly did not expect he was sitting in his chamber alone and was sad enough thinking now of mrs cox and his near escape then of adela and his cousins possible happiness and then of caroline and the shipwreck of her hopes when the door opened and sir henry harcourt was standing before him  how dye do bertram said the late solicitorgeneral putting out his hand the attitude and the words were those of friendship but his countenance was anything but friendly a great change had come over him his look of youth had deserted him and he might have been taken for a careworn middleaged man he was thin and haggard and wan and there was a stern harsh frown upon his brow as though he would wish to fight if he only dared this was the successful manfortunes pet who had married the heiress of the millionaire and risen to the top of his profession with unexampled rapidity  how are you harcourt said bertram taking the proffered hand i had no idea that you had heard of my return  oh yes i heard of it i supposed youd be back quick enough when you knew that the old man was dying  i am glad at any rate to be here in time to see him said george disdaining to defend himself against the innuendo  when are you going down  tomorrow i suppose but i expect to have a line from miss baker in the morning  sir henry who had not sat down began walking up and down the room while bertram stood with his back to the fire watching him the lawyers brow became blacker and blacker and as he rattled his halfcrowns in his trouserspockets and kept his eyes fixed upon the floor bertram began to feel that the interview did not promise to be one of a very friendly character  i was sorry to hear harcourt that you are among the lot that have left the government said bertram hardly knowing what else to say  d the government but i didnt come here to talk about the government that old man down there will be gone in less than a weeks time do you know that  i hear that in all probability he has not long to live  not a week i have it from sir omicron himself now i think you will admit bertram that i have been very badly used  upon my word my dear fellow i know nothing about it  nonsense  but it isnt nonsense i tell you that i know nothing about it i suppose you are alluding to my uncles money and i tell you that i know nothingand care nothing  psha i hate to hear a man talk in that way i hate such humbug  harcourt my dear fellow  it is humbug i am not in a humour now to stand picking my words i have been infernally badly usedbadly used on every side  by me among others  sir henry in his present moody mind would have delighted to say yes by him bertram worse perhaps than by any other but it did not suit him at the present moment to come to an open rupture with the man whom he had been in such a hurry to visit  i treated that old man with the most unbounded confidence when i married his granddaughter  but how does that concern me she was not my granddaughter i at least had nothing to do with it excuse me harcourt if i say that i of all men am the last to whom you should address yourself on such a subject  i think differently you are his nearest relativenext to her next to her mind  well what matter is it whether i am near or distant lady harcourt is staying with him did it suit her to do so she could fight your battle or her own battle or any battle that she pleases  yours for instance  no sir henry that she could not do from doing that she is utterly debarred but i tell you once for all that i have no battle you shall know moreif the knowledge will do you any good not very long since my uncle offered to settle on me half his fortune if i would oblige him in one particular but i could not do the thing he wanted and when we parted i had his positive assurance that he would leave me nothing that was the last time i saw him and as bertram remembered what that request was to which he had refused to accede his brow also grew black  tell me honestly then if you can be honest in the matter who is to have his money  i can be very honest for i know nothing my belief is that neither you nor i will have a shilling of it  well then ill tell you what of course you know that lady harcourt is down there  yes i know that she is at hadley  ill not submit to be treated in this way i have been a deuced sight too quiet because i have not chosen to disturb him in his illness now i will have an answer from him i will know what he means to do and if i do not know by tomorrow night i will go down and will at any rate bring my wife away with me i wish you to tell him that i want to know what his intentions are i have a right to demand as much  be that as it may you have no right to demand anything through me  i have ruined myselfor nearly so for that woman  i wonder harcourt that you do not see that i am not the man you should select to speak to on such a subject  you are the man because you are her cousin i went to enormous expense to give her a splendid home knowing of course that his wealth would entitle her to it i bought a house for her and furnished it as though she were a duchess  good heavens harcourt is this anything to me did i bid you buy the house if you had not given her a chair to sit on should i have complained i tell you fairly i will have nothing to do with it  then it will be the worse for herthats all  may god help her she must bear her lot as must i mine and you yours  and you refuse to take my message to your uncle  certainly whether i shall see him or not i do not yet know if i do i certainly shall not speak to him about money unless he begins nor shall i speak about you unless he shall seem to wish it if he asks about you i will tell him that you have been with me  after some further discussion harcourt left him george bertram found it difficult to understand what motive could have brought him there but drowning men catch at straws sir henry was painfully alive to the consideration that if anything was to be done about the rich mans money if any useful step could be taken it must be done at once the step must be taken now in another week perhaps in another day mr bertram would be beyond the power of willmaking no bargain could then be driven in which it should be stipulated that after his death his grandchild should be left unmolestedfor a consideration the bargain if made at all must be made nownow at once  it will be thought that sir henry would have played his game better by remaining quiet that his chance of being remembered in that will would be greater if he did not now make himself disagreeable probably so but men running hither and thither in distress do not well calculate their chances they are too nervous too excited to play their game with judgment sir henry harcourt had now great trouble on his shoulders he was in debt was pressed for money on every side had brought his professional bark into great disastersnearly to utter shipwreckand was known to have been abandoned by his wife the world was not smiling on him his great hope his once strong hope was now buried in those hadley coffers and it was not surprising that he did not take the safest way in his endeavours to reach those treasures which he so coveted  on the following morning george received miss bakers letter and very shortly afterwards he started for hadley of course he could not but remember that lady harcourt was staying there that she would naturally be attending upon her grandfather and that it was all but impossible that he should not see her how were they to meet now when last they had been together he had held her in his arms had kissed her forehead had heard the assurance of her undying love how were they to meet now  george was informed by the servant who came to the door that his uncle was very ill weaker today the girl said than ever he had been where was miss baker george asked the girl said that miss baker was in the diningroom he did not dare to ask any further question and her ladyship is with her grandfather the girl added upon hearing which george walked with quicker steps to the parlour door  miss baker met him as though there had been no breach in their former intimacy with her for the moment lady harcourt and her troubles were forgotten and she thought only of the dying man upstairs  i am so glad you have come she said he does not say much about it you remember he never did talk about such things but i know that he will be delighted to see you sometimes he has said that he thought you had been in egypt quite long enough  is he so very ill then  indeed he is very ill youll be shocked when you see him youll find him so much altered he knows that it cannot last long and he is quite reconciled  will you send up to let him know that i am here  yes nowimmediately caroline is with him and then miss baker left the room  caroline is with him it was so singular to hear her mentioned as one of the same family with himself to have to meet her as one sharing the same interests with him bound by the same bonds anxious to relieve the same suffering she had said that they ought to be as far as the poles asunder and yet fortune unkind fortune would bring them together as he was thinking of this the door opened gently and she was in the room with him  she too was greatly altered not that her beauty had faded or that the lines of her face were changed but her gait and manners were more composed her dress was so much more simple that though not less lovely she certainly looked older than when he had last seen her she was thinner too and in the lightgray silk which she wore seemed to be taller and to be paler too  she walked up to him and putting out her hand said some word or two which he did not hear and he uttered something which was quite as much lost on her and so their greeting was over thus passed their first interview of which he had thought so much in looking forward to it for the last few hours that his mind had been estranged from his uncle  does he know i am here  yes you are to go up to him you know the room  the same he always had  oh yes the same and then creeping on tiptoe as men do in such houses to the infinite annoyance of the invalids whom they wish to spare he went upstairs and stood by his uncles bed  miss baker was on the other side and the sick mans face was turned towards her you had better come round here george said she it would trouble mr bertram to move  she means that i cant stir said the old man whose voice was still sharp though no longer loud i cant turn round that way come here and so george walked round the bed  he literally would not have known his uncle so completely changed was the face it was not only that it was haggard thin unshorn and gray with coming death but the very position of the features had altered his cheeks had fallen away his nose was contracted his mouth which he could hardly close was on one side miss baker told george afterwards that the left side was altogether motionless george certainly would not have known his unclenot at the first glance but yet there was a spark left in those eyes of the old fire such a spark as had never gleamed upon him from any other human head that look of sharpness which nothing could quench was still there it was not the love of lucre which was to be read in those eyes so much as the possessors power of acquiring it it was as though they said look well to all you have put lock and bar to your stores set dragons to watch your choice gardens fix what mantraps you will for your own protection in spite of everything i will have it all when i go forth to rob no one can stay me so had he looked upon men through all his long life and so now did he look upon his nephew and his niece as they stood by to comfort him in his extremity  i am sorry to see you in this state said george putting his hand on to that of his uncles which was resting on the bed  thankee george thankee when men get to be as old as i am they have nothing for it but to die so youve been to egypt have you what do you think about egypt  it is not a country i should like to live in sir  nor i to die in from all that i hear of it well youre just in time to be in at the last gaspthats all my boy  i hope it has not come to that yet sir  ah but it has how long a time did that man give me maryhe that got the twenty pounds they gave a fellow twenty pounds to come and tell me that i was dying as if i didnt know that without him  we thought it right to get the best advice we could george said poor miss baker  nonsense said the old man almost in his olden voice youll find byandby that twenty pounds are not so easy to come by george as you are here i might as well tell you about my money  george begged him not to trouble himself about such a matter at present but this was by no means the way in which to propitiate his uncle  and if i dont talk of it now when am i to do it go away maryand look herecome up again in about twenty minutes what i have got to say wont take me long and so miss baker left the room  george said his uncle i wonder whether you really care about money sometimes i have almost thought that you dont  i dont think i do very much sir  then you must be a great fool  i have often thought i am lately  a very great fool people preach against it and talk against it and write against it and tell lies against it but dont you see that everybody is fighting for it the parsons all abuse it but did you ever know one who wouldnt go to law for his tithes did you ever hear of a bishop who didnt take his dues  i am quite fond enough of it sir to take all that i can earn  that does not seem to be much george you havent played your cards wellhave you my boy  no uncle not very well i might have done better  no man is respected without moneyno man a poor man is always thrust to the wallalways now you will be a poor man i fear all your life  then i must put up with the wall sir  but why were you so harsh with me when i wanted you to marry her do you see now what you have done look at her and what she might have been look at yourself and what you might have been had you done that you might have been my heir in everything  well sir i have made my bed and i must lie upon it i have cause enough for regretthough to tell the truth it is not about your money  ah i knew you would be stiff to the last said mr bertram angry that he could not move his nephew to express some sorrow about the halfmillion  am i stiff sir indeed i do not mean it  no its your nature but we will not quarrel at the last will we george  i hope not sir i am not aware that we have ever quarrelled you once asked me to do a thing which had i done it would have made me a happy man  and a rich man also  and i fairly tell you now that i would i had done as you would have had me that is not being stiff sir  it is too late now george  oh yes it is too late now indeed it is  not but that i could put a codicil  ah sir you can put no codicil that can do me a service no codicil can make her a free woman there are sorrows sir which no codicil can cure  psha said his uncle trying in his anger to turn himself on his bed but failing utterly psha then you may live a pauper  george remained standing at the bedside but he knew not what to do or what answer to make to this ebullition of anger  i have nothing further to say continued his uncle  but we shall part in friendship shall we not said george i have so much to thank you for that i cannot bear that you should be angry with me now  you are an assa fool  you should look on that as my misfortune sir and then he paused a moment i will leave you now shall i  yes and send mary up  but i may come down again tomorrow  what havent they a bed for you in the house  bertram hummed and hawed and said he did not know but the conference ended in his promising to stay there so he went up to town and returned again bringing down his carpet bag and preparing to remain till all should be over  that was a strange household which was now collected together in the house at hadley the old man was lying upstairs daily expecting his death and he was attended as it was seemly that he should be by his nearest relatives his brothers presence he would not have admitted but his grandchild was there and his nephew and her whom he had always regarded as his niece nothing could be more fitting than this but not the less did caroline and george feel that it was not fitting that they should be together  and yet the absolute awkwardness of the meeting was soon over they soon found themselves able to sit in the same room conversing on the one subject of interest which the circumstances of the moment gave without any allusion to past times they spoke only of the dying man and asked each other questions only about him though they were frequently alone together while miss baker was with mr bertram they never repeated the maddening folly of that last scene in eaton square  she has got over it now said bertram to himself and he thought that he rejoiced that it was so but yet it made his heart sad  it has passed away like a dream thought lady harcourt and now he will be happy again and she too strove to comfort herself in thinking so but the comfort was very cold  and now george was constantly with his uncle for the first two days nothing further was said about money mr bertram seemed to be content that matters should rest as they were then settled and his nephew certainly had no intention of recurring to the subject on his own behalf the old man however had become much kinder in his manner to himkinder to him than to any one else in the house and exacted from him various little promises of things to be doneof last wishes to be fulfilled  perhaps it is better as it is george he said as bertram was sitting by his bedside late one night  i am sure it is sir said george not at all however knowing what was the state of things which his uncle described as being better  all men cant be made alike continued the uncle  no uncle there must be rich men and there must be poor men  and you prefer the latter  now george had never said this and the assertion coming from his uncle at such a moment when he could not contradict it was rather hard on him he had tried to prove to mr bertram not so much then as in their former intercourse that he would in no way subject his feelings to the moneybags of any man that he would make no sacrifice of his aspirations for the sake of wealth that he would not in fact sell himself for gold but he had never said or intended to say that money was indifferent to him much as his uncle understood he had failed to understand his nephews mind but george could not explain it to him nowso he merely smiled and let the assertion pass  well be it so said mr bertram but you will see at any rate that i have trusted you why father and son should be so much unlike god only can understand and from that time he said little or nothing more about his will  but sir omicron had been wrong mr bertram overlived the week and overlived the fortnight we must now leave him and his relatives in the house of sickness and return to arthur wilkinson     chapter xii  mrs wilkinsons troubles   arthur wilkinson was received at home with open arms and warm embraces he was an only son an only brother the head and stay of his family and of course he was beloved his mother wept for joy as she saw the renewed plumpness of his cheeks and declared that egypt must indeed be a land of fatness and his sisters surrounded him smiling and kissing him and asking questions as though he were another livingstone this was very delightful but a cloud was soon to come across all this sunshine  mrs wilkinson always excepting what care she may have had for her sons ill health had not been unhappy during his absence she had reigned the female vicaress without a drawback praying daily and in her heart almost hourly for the continuance in the land of such excellent noblemen as lord stapledean the curate who had taken arthurs duty had been a very mild young man and had been quite contented that mrs wilkinson should leave to him the pulpit and the readingdesk in all other matters he had been satisfied not to interfere with her power or to contradict her edicts  mr gilliflower has behaved excellently she said to her son soon after his return and has quite understood my position here i only wish we could keep him in the parish but that of course is impossible  i shouldnt want him at all mother arthur had replied i am as strong as a horse now  all the same i should like to have him here said mrs wilkinson in a tone which was the beginning of the battle how sweet it would have been to her if arthur could have gone to some good neighbouring parish leaving her with gabriel gilliflower as her assistant to manage the souls of hurst staple and why as she almost asked herselfwhy should she not be addressed as the reverend mrs wilkinson  but the battle had to be fought and there was to be an end to these sweet dreams her son had been meek enough but he was not as meek as mr gilliflower and now he was sharpening his arrows and looking to his bow and preparing for the war  is adela at littlebath he asked of one of his sisters on the third or fourth day after his arrival  yes said mary she is with her aunt i had a letter from her yesterday  i wonder whether she would come here if you were to ask her  oh that she would said mary  i doubt it very much said the more prudent sophia  mrs wilkinson heard the conversation and pondered over it at the moment she said nothing pressing down her grief in her deep heart but that evening in the bookroom she found arthur alone and then she began  you were not in earnest just now about adela were you arthur  indeed i was mother quite in earnest  she has been very much away from littlebath since her aunt came back from italy to make a home for her she was with us and with the harcourts in london and since the breakup there she was at hadley it would not be right to miss gauntlet to ask her away so soon  i dont think miss gauntlet would mind her coming here and even if she does  and then my time is so much taken upwhat with the schools and what with the parish visiting  adela will do the visiting with you  i really had rather not have her just at present that is unless you have some very particular reason  well mother i have a particular reason but if you had rather that she did not come here i will go to littlebath instead  there was nothing more said on this occasion but that was the beginning of the battle mrs wilkinson could not but know what her son meant and she now knew that all that she dreaded was to come upon her it was not that she did not wish to see her son happy or that she did not think that his being married and settled would tend to his happiness but she was angry as other mothers are angry when their foolish calflike boys will go and marry without any incomes on which to support a wife she said to herself over and over again that night i cannot have a second family here in the parsonage thats certain and where on earth theyre to live i dont know and how theyre to live when his fellowship is gone i cant think and then she shook her head clothed as it was in her nightcap and reposing as it was on her pillow two thousand pounds is every shilling she hasevery shilling and then she shook her head again she knew that the ecclesiastical income was her own for had not the good lord stapledean given it to her but she had sad thoughts and feared that even on this point there might be a contest between her and her son  two mornings after this the blow came very suddenly it was now her habit to go into the bookroom after breakfast and set herself down to workas her husband the former vicar had done in his timeand as arthur since his return usually did the same they naturally found themselves alone together on the morning in question she had no sooner seated herself with her papers before her than arthur began and alas he had to tell her not what he was going to do but what he had done  i spoke to you mother of going to littlebath the other day  yes arthur said she taking her spectacles off and laying them beside her  i have written to her instead  and you have made her an offer of marriage  exactly so i was sure you must have known how my heart stood towards her it is many years now since i first thought of this but i was deterred because i feared that my incomeour income that iswas insufficient  oh arthur and so it is what will you do how will you live adela has got just two thousand poundsabout seventy or eighty pounds a year and your fellowship will be gone oh arthur how will all the mouths be fed when you have six or seven children round you  ill tell you what my plans are if adela should accept me  oh accept you shell accept you fast enough said mrs wilkinson with the venom with which mothers will sometimes speak of the girls to whom their sons are attached  it makes me very happy to hear you say so but i dont know when i did hint at the matter once before i got no encouragement  psha said mrs wilkinson  this sound was music to her sons ears so he went on with the more cheerfulness to describe his plans  you see mother situated as i am i have no right to expect any increase of income or to hope that i shall ever be better able to marry than i am now  but you might marry a girl who had something to help there is miss glunter  but it so happens that i am attached to adela and not to miss glunter  attached but of course you must have your own way you are of age and i cannot prevent your marrying the cookmaid if you like what i want to know is where do you mean to live  here certainly  what in this house  certainly i am bound to live here as the clergyman of the parish  mrs wilkinson drew herself up to her full height put her spectacles on and looked at the papers before her then put them off again and fixed her eyes on her son do you think there will be room in the house she said i fear you would be preparing great discomfort for adela where on earth would she find room for a nursery but arthur you have not thought of these things  arthur however had thought of them very often he knew where to find the nursery and the room for adela his difficulty was as to the rooms for his mother and sisters it was necessary now that this difference of opinion should be explained  i suppose that my children if i have any  clergymen always have large families said mrs wilkinson  well i suppose theyll have the same nursery that we had  what and turn sophy and mary out of it and then she paused and began to rearrange her papers that will not do at all arthur she continued it would be unjust in me to allow that much as i think of your interests i must of course think of theirs as well  how was he to tell her that the house was his own it was essentially necessary that he should do so and that he should do so now if he gave up the point at the present moment he might give it up for ever his resolve was that his mother and sisters should go elsewhere but in what words could he explain this resolution to her  dear mother i think we should understand each other  certainly said mrs wilkinson laying her hands across each other on the table and preparing for the onslaught  it is clearly my duty as clergyman to live in this parish and to live in this house  and it is my duty also as was excellently explained by lord stapledean after your poor fathers death  my idea is this and then he paused for his heart misgave him when he attempted to tell his mother that she must pack up and turn out his courage all but failed him he felt that he was right and yet he hardly knew how to explain that he was right without appearing to be unnatural  i do not know that lord stapledean said anything about the house but if he did it could make no difference  not the least i should think said the lady when he appointed me to the income of the parish it could hardly be necessary that he should explain that i was to have the house also  mother when i accepted the living i promised him that i would give you three hundred and fifty pounds out of the proceeds and so i will adela and i will be very poor but i shall endeavour to eke out our income that is of course if she consents to marry me  psha  to eke out our income by taking pupils to do that i must have the house at my own disposal  and you mean to tell me said the female vicaress rising to her feet in her wrath that ithat iam to go away  i think it will be better mother  and the poor girls  for one or two of them there would be room here said arthur trying to palliate the matter  one or two of them is that the way you would treat your sisters i say nothing about myself for i have long seen that you are tired of me i know how jealous you are because lord stapledean has thought proper to she could not exactly remember what phrase would best suit her purposetototo place me here as he placed your poor father before i have seen it all arthur but i have my duty to do and i shall do it what i have undertaken in this parish i shall go through with and if you oppose me i shall apply to his lordship  i think you have misunderstood lord stapledean  i have not misunderstood him at all i know very well what he meant and i quite appreciate his motives i have endeavoured to act up to them and shall continue to do so i had thought that i had made the house as comfortable to you as any young man could wish  and so you have  and yet you want to turn me out of itout of my own house  not to turn you out mother if it suits you to remain here for another year  it will suit me to remain here for another ten years if i am spared so long little viper i suppose this comes from her after warming her in my bosom when her father died  it can hardly have come from her seeing that there has never yet been a word spoken between us on the subject i fear that you greatly mistake the footing on which we stand together i have no reasonable ground for hoping for a favourable answer  psha viper exclaimed mrs wilkinson in dire wrath mothers are so angry when other girls not their own will get offers so doubly angry when their own sons make them  you will make me very unhappy if you speak ill of her said arthur  has it ever come into your head to think where your mother and sisters are to live when you turn them out said she  littlebath suggested arthur  littlebath said mrs wilkinson with all the scorn that she could muster to the service littlebath i am to put up with the aunt i suppose when you take the niece but i shall not go to littlebath at your bidding sir and so saying she gathered up her spectacles and stalked out of the room  arthur was by no means satisfied with the interview and yet had he been wise he might have been the subject had been broached and that in itself was a great deal and the victory had by no means been with mrs wilkinson she had threatened indeed to appeal to lord stapledean but that very threat showed how conscious she was that she had no power of her own to hold her place where she was he ought to have been satisfied but he was not so  and now he had to wait for his answer from adela gentlemen who make offers by letter must have a weary time of it waiting for the return of post or for the return of two posts as was the case in this instance and arthur had a weary time of it two evenings he had to pass after the conversation above recounted before he got his letter and dreadful evenings they were his mother was majestic glum and cross his sisters were silent and dignified it was clear to him that they had all been told and so told as to be leagued in enmity against him what account their mother may have given to them of their future poverty he knew not but he felt certain that she had explained to them how cruelly he meant to turn them out on the wide world unnatural ogre that he was  mary was his favourite and to her he did say a few words mamma has told you what i have done hasnt she  yes arthur said mary demurely  and what do you think about it  think about it  yes do you think shell accept me  oh shell accept you i dont doubt about that how cheap girls do make themselves when talking of each other  and will it not be an excellent thing for me said he  but about the house arthur and mary looked very glum so he said nothing further to any of them  on the day after this he got his answer and now we will give the two letters arthurs was not written without much trouble and various copies but adelas had come straight from her heart at once      hurst staple april 184     my dear adela     you will be surprised to receive a letter from me and    more so i am sure when you read its contents you have    heard i know from mary of my return home thank god    i am quite strong again i enjoyed my trip very much i    had feared that it would be very dull before i knew that    george bertram would go with me     i wonder whether you recollect the day when i drove you to    ripley station it is eighteen months ago now i believe    and indeed the time seems much longer i had thought then    to have said to you what i have to say now but i did not    years ago i thought to do the same and then also i did    not you will know what i mean i did not like to ask you    to share such poverty such a troubled house as mine will    be     but i have loved you adela for years and years do you    remember how you used to comfort me at that grievous time    when i disappointed them all so much about my degree i    remember it so well it used to lie on my tongue then to    tell you that i loved you but that would have been folly    then came my poor fathers death and the living which i    had to take under such circumstances i made up my mind    then that it was my duty to live single i think i told    you though i am sure you forget that     i am not richer now but i am older i seem to care less    about poverty on my own behalf andthough i dont    know whether you will forgive me for thisi feel less    compunction in asking you to be poor with me do not    imagine from this that i feel confident as to your answer    i am very far from that but i know that you used to love    me as a friendand i now venture to ask you to love me as    my wife     dearest adela i feel that i may call you so now even    if i am never to call you so again if you will share    the world with me i will give you whatever love can    givethough i can give but little more i need not tell    you how we should be circumstanced my mother must have    three hundred and fifty pounds out of the living as long    as she lives and should i survive her i must of course    maintain the girls but i mean to explain to my mother    that she had better live elsewhere there will be trouble    about this but i am sure that it is right i shall tell    her of this letter tomorrow i think she knows what my    intention is though i have not exactly told it to her     i need not say how anxious i shall be till i hear from    you i shall not expect a letter till thursday morning    but if possible do let me have it then should it be    favourablethough i do not allow myself to have any    confidencebut should it be favourable i shall be at    littlebath on monday evening believe me that i love you    dearly     yours dear adela     arthur wilkinson   aunt penelope was a lady addicted to very early habits and consequently she and adela had usually left the breakfasttable before the postman had visited them from this it resulted that adela received her letter by herself the first words told her what it contained and her eyes immediately became suffused with tears after all then her patience was to be rewarded but it had not been patience so much as love love that admitted of no change love on which absence had had no effect love which had existed without any hope which had been acknowledged by herself and acknowledged as a sad misfortune but now she took the letter up but she could not read it she turned it over and at the end through her tears she saw those wordsbelieve me that i love you dearly they were not like the burning words the sweet violent protestations of a passionate lover but coming from him they were enough at last she was to be rewarded  and then at length she read it ah yes she recollected the day well when he had driven her to ripley station and asked her those questions as he was persuading dumpling to mount the hill the very words were still in her ears would you come to such a house adela ay indeed would sheif only she were duly asked but he had it not seemed then as if he almost wished that the proffer should come from her not to that would she stoop but as for sharing such a house as hisany house with him what did true love mean if she were not ready to do that  and she remembered too that comforting of which he spoke that had been the beginning of it all when he took those walks along the river to west putford when she had learned to look for his figure coming through the little wicket at the bottom of their lawn then she had taxed her young heart with imprudencebut in doing so she had found that it was too late she had soon told the truthto herself that is and throughout she had been true now she had her reward there in her hands pressing it to her heart he had loved her for years and years he said yes and so had she loved him and now he should know it but not quite at oncein some sweet hour of fullest confidence she would whisper it all to him  i think i told you though i am sure you have forgotten that  forget it no not a word not one of his tones not a glance of his eyes as he sat there in her fathers drawingroom that morning all but unable to express his sorrows she could never forget the effort with which she had prevented the telltale blood from burning in her cheeks or the difficulty with which she had endured his confidence but she had endured it and now had come her reward then he had come to tell her that he was too poor to marry much as she loved him she had then almost despised him but the world had told him to be wiser the world which makes so many niggards had taught him to be freer of heart now he was worthy of her now that he cared nothing for poverty yes now she had her reward  he had allowed her till the second post for her reply that was so kind of him as it was necessary that she should tell her aunt as to the nature of her replyas to that she never doubted for a moment she would consult her aunt but she would do so with her mind fully made up as to the future no aunt no mrs wilkinson should rob her of her happiness now that he had spoken no one should rob him of the comfort of her love  in the evening after thinking of it for hours she told her aunt or rather handed to her arthurs letter that she might read it miss penelopes face grew very long as she did read it and she made this remarkthree hundred and fifty pounds why my dear there will be only one hundred and fifty left  we cant keep our carriage certainly aunt  then you mean to accept him  yes aunt  oh dear oh dear what will you do when the children come  we must make the best of it aunt  oh dear oh dear and you will have his mother with you always  if so then we should not be so very poor but i do not think that that is what arthur means  there was not much more said about it between them and at last in the seclusion of her own bedroom adela wrote her letter      littlebath tuesday night     dear arthur     i received your letter this morning but as you were so    kind as to give me a day to answer it i have put off    doing so till i could be quite alone it will be a very    simple answer i value your love more than anything in    the world you have my whole heart i hope for your sake    that the troubles which you speak of will not be many but    whatever they may be i will share them if i can i will    lessen them     i hope it is not unmaidenly to say that i have received    your dear letter with true delight i do not know why    it should be we have known each other so long that it    is almost natural that i should love you i do love you    dearly dearest arthur and with a heart thankful for    gods goodness to me i will put my hand in yours with    perfect trustfearing nothing then as far as this world    is concerned     i do not regard the poverty of which you speak at least    not for my own sake what i have of my own is i know    very little i wish now that i could make it more for you    but no i will wish for nothing more seeing that so much    has been given to me everything has been given to me when    i have your love     i hope that this will not interfere with your mothers    comfort if anything now could make me unhappy it would    be that she should not be pleased at our prospects give    her my kindest kindest love and tell her that i hope she    will let me look on her as a mother     i will write to mary very soon but bid her write to me    first i cannot tell her how happy how very happy i    really am till she has first wished me joy     i have of course told aunt penelope she too says    something about poverty i tell her it is croaking the    honest do not beg their bread do they arthur but in    spite of her croaking she will be very happy to see you    on monday if it shall suit you to come if so let me    have one other little line but i am so contented now    that i shall hardly be more so even to have you here     god bless you my own own own dearest     ever yours with truest affection     adela   and i also hope that adelas letter will not be considered unmaidenly but i have my fears there will be those who will say that it is sadly deficient in reserve ah had she not been reserved enough for the last four or five years reserve is beautiful in a maiden if it be rightly timed sometimes one would fain have more of it but when the heart is full and when it may speak out when time and circumstances and the world permitthen we should say that honesty is better than reserve adelas letter was honest on the spur of the moment her reserve had been the work of years  arthur at any rate was satisfied her letter seemed to him to be the very perfection of words armed with that he would face his mother though she appeared armed from head to foot in the stapledean panoply while he was reading his letter he was at breakfast with them all and when he had finished it for the second time he handed it across the table to his mother  oh i suppose so was her only answer as she gave it him back  the curiosity of the girls was too great now for the composure of their silent dignity it is from adela said mary what does she say  you may read it said arthur again handing the letter across the table  well i do wish you joy said mary though there will be so very little money  seeing that arthur since his fathers death had in fact supported his mother and sisters out of his own income this reception of his news was rather hard upon him and so he felt it  you will not have to share the hardships he said as he left the room and so you need not complain  there was nothing more said about it that morning but in the evening when they were alone he spoke to his sister again you will write to her mary i hope  yes i will write to her said mary half ashamed of herself  perhaps it is not surprising that my mother should be vexed seeing the false position in which both she and i have been placed partly by my fault for i should not have accepted the living under such conditions  oh arthur you would not have refused it  i ought to have done so but mary you and the girls should be ready to receive adela with open arms what other sister could i have given you that you would have loved better  oh no one not for her own sakeno one half so well  then tell her so and do not cloud her prospects by writing about the house you have all had shelter and comfort hitherto and be trustful that it will be continued to you  this did very well with his sister but the affair with his mother was much more serious he began by telling her that he should go to littlebath on monday and be back on wednesday  then i shall go to bowes on wednesday said mrs wilkinson now we all know that bowes is a long way from staplehurst the journey has already been made once in these pages but mrs wilkinson was as good as her word  to bowes said arthur  yes to bowes sir to lord stapledean that is if you hold to your scheme of turning me out of my own house  i think it would be better mother that we should have two establishments  and therefore i am to make way for you and that viper she was going to say again but looking into her sons face she became somewhat more mercifulfor you she said and that chit  as clergyman of the parish i think that i ought to live in the parsonage you mother will have so much the larger portion of the income  very well there need be no more words about it i shall start for bowes on next wednesday and so she did  arthur wrote his one other little line as it was three times as long as his first letter it shall not be printed and he did make his visit to littlebath how happy adela was as she leant trustingly on his arm and felt that it was her own he stayed however but one night and was back at staplehurst before his mother started for bowes     chapter xiii  another journey to bowes   mrs wilkinson did not leave her home for her long and tedious journey without considerable parade her best new black silk dress was packed up in order that due honour might be done to lord stapledeans hospitality and so large a box was needed that dumpling and the fourwheeled carriage were hardly able to take her to the railwaystation then there arose the question who should drive her arthur offered to do so but she was going on a journey of decided hostility as regarded him and under such circumstances she could not bring herself to use his services even over a portion of the road so the stableboy was her charioteer  she talked about lord stapledean the whole evening before she went arthur would have explained to her something of that noblemans character if she would have permitted it but she would not when he hinted that she would find lord stapledean austere in his manner she answered that his lordship no doubt had had his reasons for being austere with so very young a man as arthur had been when he told her about the bowes hotel she merely shook her head significantly a nobleman who had been so generous to her and hers as lord stapledean would hardly allow her to remain at the inn  i am very sorry that the journey is forced upon me she said to arthur as she sat with her bonnet on waiting for the vehicle  i am sorry that you are going mother certainly he had answered because i know that it will lead to disappointment  but i have no other course left open to me she continued i cannot see my poor girls turned out houseless on the world and then refusing even to lean on her sons arm she stepped up heavily into the carriage and seated herself beside the boy  when shall we expect you mamma said sophia  it will be impossible for me to say but i shall be sure to write as soon as i have seen his lordship goodbye to you girls and then she was driven away  it is a very foolish journey said arthur  mamma feels that she is driven to it said sophia  mrs wilkinson had written to lord stapledean two days before she started informing his lordship that it had become very necessary that she should wait upon him on business connected with the living and therefore she was aware that her coming would not be wholly unexpected in due process of time she arrived at bowes very tired and not a little disgusted at the great expense of her journey she had travelled but little alone and knew nothing as to the cost of hotels and not a great deal as to that of railways coaches and postchaises but at last she found herself in the same little inn which had previously received arthur when he made the same journey  the lady can have a postchaise of course said the landlady speaking from the bar oh yes lord stapledean is at home safe enough hes never very far away from it to the best of my belief  its only a mile or so is it said mrs wilkinson  seven long miles maam said the landlady  seven miles dear dear i declare i never was so tired in my life you can put the box somewhere behind in the postchaise cant you  yes maam we can do that be you agoing to stay at his lordships then  to this question mrs wilkinson made an ambiguous answer her confidence was waning now that she drew near to the centre of her aspirations but at last she did exactly as her son had done before her she said she would take her box but that it was possible she might want a bed that evening very possible the landlady said to herself  and youll take a bite of something before you start maam she said out loud but no it was only now twelve oclock and she would be at bowes lodge a very little after one she had still sufficient confidence in lord stapledean to feel sure of her lunch when people reached hurst staple vicarage about that hour there was always something for them to eat and so she started  it was april now but even in april that bleak northern fell was very cold nothing more inhospitable than that road could be seen it was unsheltered swept by every blast very steep and mercilessly oppressed by turnpikes twice in those seven miles oneandsixpence was inexorably demanded from her  but i know one gate always clears the other when they are so near she argued  noa they doant was all the answer she received from the turnpike woman who held a baby under each arm  i am sure the woman is robbing me said poor mrs wilkinson  no she beant said the postboy they are good hearty people in that part of the world but they do not brook suspicion and the courtesies of life are somewhat neglected and then she arrived at lord stapledeans gate  be you she what sent the letter said the woman at the lodge holding it only half open  yes my good woman yes said mrs wilkinson thinking that her troubles were now nearly over i am the lady i am mrs wilkinson  then my lord says as how youre to send up word what youve got to say and the woman still stood in the gateway  send up word said mrs wilkinson  yees just send up word heres jock can rin up  but jock cant tell his lordship what i have to say to him i have to see his lordship on most important business said she in her dismay  im telling you no more that what my lord said his ain sell he just crawled down here his ain sell if a woman comes said he dont let her through the gate till she sends up word what shes got to say to me and the portress looked as though she were resolved to obey her masters orders  good heavens there must be some mistake in this im sure i am the clergyman of staplehursti mean his widow staplehurst you know his lordships property  i didna know nothing aboot it  oh drive on postboy there must be some mistake the woman must be making some dreadful mistake  at last the courage of the lodgekeeper gave way before the importance of the postchaise and she did permit mrs wilkinson to proceed  mither said the womans eldest hope youll cotch it noo  eh lad weel hell no hang me and so the woman consoled herself  the house called bowes lodge looked damper and greener more dull silent and melancholy even than it had done when arthur made his visit the gravel sweep before the door was covered by weeds and the shrubs looked as though they had known no gardeners care for years the door itself did not even appear to be for purposes of ingress and egress and the postboy had to search among the boughs and foliage with which the place was overgrown before he could find the bell when found it sounded with a hoarse rusty jangling noise as though angry at being disturbed in so unusual a manner  but rusty and angry as it was it did evoke a servantthough not without considerable delay a cross old man did come at last and the door was slowly opened yes said the man the marquis was at home no doubt he was in the study but that was no rule why he should see folk and then he looked very suspiciously at the big trunk and muttered something to the postboy which mrs wilkinson could not hear  will you oblige me by giving my card to his lordshipmrs wilkinson i want to see him on very particular business i wrote to his lordship to say that i should be here  wrote to his lordship did you then its my opinion he wont see you at all  yes he will if youll take him my card i know hell see me will you oblige me sir by taking it into his lordship and she put on her most imperious look  the man went and mrs wilkinson sat silent in the postchaise for a quarter of an hour then the servant returned informing her that she was to send in her message his lordship had given directions at the lodge that she was not to come up and could not understand how it had come to pass that the lady had forced her way to the halldoor at any rate he would not see her till he knew what it was about  now it was impossible for mrs wilkinson to explain the exact nature of her very intricate case to lord stapledeans butler and yet she could not bring herself to give up the battle without making some further effort it is about the vicarage at hurst staple said she the vicarage at hurst staple she repeated impressing the words on the mans memory dont forget now the man gave a look of ineffable scorn and then walked away leaving mrs wilkinson still in the postchaise  and now came on an april shower such as april showers are on the borders of westmoreland it rained and blew and after a while the rain turned to sleet the postboy buttoned up his coat and got under the shelter of the portico the horses drooped their heads and shivered mrs wilkinson wished herself back at hurst stapleor even comfortably settled at littlebath as her son had once suggested  his lordship dont know nothing about the vicarage bellowed out the butler opening the halldoor only half way so that his face just appeared above the lock  oh dear oh dear said mrs wilkinson just let me down into the hall and then i will explain it to you  them orses ll be foundered as sure as heggs said the postboy  mrs wilkinson at last succeeded in making her way into the hall and the horses were allowed to go round to the yard and then at last after half a dozen more messages to and fro she was informed that lord stapledean would see her so dreadful had been the contest hitherto that this amount of success was very grateful her feeling latterly had been one of intense hostility to the butler rather than to her son now that she had conquered that most savage cerberus all would be pleasant with her but alas she soon found that in passing cerberus she had made good her footing in a region as little desirable as might be  she was ushered into the same bookroom in which arthur had been received and soon found herself seated in the same chair and on the same spot lord stapledean was thinner now even than he had been then he had a stoop in his shoulders and his face and hair were more gray his eyes seemed to his visitor to be as sharp and almost as red as those of ferrets as she entered he just rose from his seat and pointed to the chair on which she was to sit  well maam said he whats all this about the clergymans house at hurst staple i dont understand it at all  no my lord im sure your lordship cant understand thats why i have thought it my duty to come all this way to explain it  all what way  all the way from hurst staple in hampshire my lord when your lordship was so considerate as to settle what my position in the parish was to be  settle your position in the parish  yes my lordas to my having the income and the house  what does the woman mean said he looking down towards the rug beneath his feet but speaking quite out loud settle her position in the parish why maam i dont know who you are and what your position is or anything about you  i am the widow of the late vicar lord stapledean and when he died  i was fool enough to give the living to his son i remember all about it he was an imprudent man and lived beyond his means and there was nothing left for any of youwasnt that it  yes my lord said mrs wilkinson who was so troubled in spirit that she hardly knew what to say that is we never lived beyond our means at all my lord there were seven children and they were all educated most respectably the only boy was sent to college and i dont think there was any imprudenceindeed i dont my lord and there was something saved and the insurance was always regularly paid and  the marquis absolutely glared at her as she went on with her domestic defence the household at hurst staple had been creditably managed considering the income and it was natural that she should wish to set her patron right but every word that she said carried her further away from her present object  and what on earth have you come to me for said lord stapledean  ill tell your lordship if youll only allow me five minutes your lordship remembers when poor mr wilkinson died  i dont remember anything about it  your lordship was good enough to send for arthur  arthur  yes my lord  whos arthur  my boy my lord dont you remember he was just in orders then and so you were good enough to put him into the livingthat is to say not exactly into the living but to make him curate as it were and you allocated the income to me and  allocated the income said lord stapledean putting up his hands in token of unlimited surprise  yes my lord your lordship saw just how it was and as i could not exactly hold the living myself  hold the living yourself why are you not a woman maam  yes my lord of course that was the reason so you put arthur into the living and you allocated the income to me that is all settled but now the question is about the house  the womans mad said lord stapledean looking again to the carpet but speaking quite out loud stark mad i think youd better go home maam a great deal better  my lord if youd only give yourself the trouble to understand me  i dont understand a word you say i have nothing to do with the income or the house or with you or with your son  oh yes my lord indeed you have  i tell you i havent maam and whats more i wont  hes going to marry my lord continued mrs wilkinson beginning to whimper and we are to be turned out of the house unless you will interfere to prevent it and he wants me to go and live at littlebath and im sure your lordship meant me to have the house when you allocated the income  and youve come all the way to bowes have you because your son wants to enjoy his own income  no my lord he doesnt interfere about that he knows he cant touch that because your lordship allocated it to meand to do him justice i dont think he would if he could and hes not a bad boy my lord only mistaken about this  oh he wants his own house does he  but it isnt his own house you know it has been my house ever since his father died and if your lordship will remember  i tell you what mrs wilkinson it seems to me that your son should not let you come out so far by yourself  my lord  and if youll take my advice youll go home as fast as you can and live wherever he bids you  but my lord  at any rate i must beg you not to trouble me any more about the matter when i was a young man your husband read with me for a few months and i really think that two presentations to the living have been a sufficient payment for that i know nothing about your son and i dont want to know anything i dare say hes as good as most other clergymen  oh yes he is my lord  but i dont care a straw who lives in the house  dont you my lord said mrs wilkinson very despondently  not one straw i never heard such a proposition from a woman in my lifenever and now if youll allow me ill wish you goodmorning maam goodmorning to you and the marquis made a slight feint as though to raise himself from his chair  mrs wilkinson got up and stood upright before him with her handkerchief to her eyes it was very grievous to her to have failed so utterly she still felt sure that if lord stapledean would only be made to understand the facts of the case he would even yet take her part she had come so far to fight her battle that she could not bring herself to leave the ground as long as a chance of victory remained to her how could she put the matter in the fewest words so as to make the marquis understand the veryvery truth  if your lordship would only allow me to recall to your memory the circumstances of the casehow you yourself allocated  lord stapledean turned suddenly at the bellrope and gave it a tremendous pullthen anotherand then a third harder than the others down came the rope about his ears and the peal was heard ringing through the house  thompson he said to the man as he entered show that lady the door  yes my lord  show her the door immediately  yes my lord said thompson standing irresolute now maam the postchaise is waiting  mrs wilkinson had still strength enough to prevent collapse and to gather herself together with some little feminine dignity i think i have been very badly treated she said as she prepared to move  thompson shrieked the marquis in his passion show that lady the door  yes my lord and thompson gracefully waved his hand pointing down the passage it was the only way in which he could show mrs wilkinson the way out  and then obedient to necessity she walked forth never had she held her head so high or tossed her bonnet with so proud a shake as she did in getting into that postchaise thompson held the handle of the carriagedoor he also offered her his arm but she despised any such aid she climbed in unassisted the postboy mounted his jade and so she was driven forth not without titters from the woman at the lodgegate with heavy heart she reached the inn and sat herself down to weep alone in her bedroom  so youve come back said the landlady  ugh exclaimed mrs wilkinson  we will not dwell long on her painful journey back to hurst staple nor on the wretched reflections with which her mind was laden she sent on a line by post to her eldest daughter so that she was expected and dumpling and the phaëton and the stableboy were there to meet her she had feared that arthur would come but arthur had dreaded the meeting also and having talked the matter over with his sisters had remained at home he was in the bookroom and hearing the wheels as the carriage drew up to the door he went out to greet his mother on the steps  at the first moment of meeting there was nothing said but she warmly pressed the hand which he held out to her  what sort of a journey have you had said sophia  oh it is a dreadful place said mrs wilkinson  it is not a nice country said arthur  by this time they were in the drawingroom and the mother was seated on a sofa with one of her girls on each side of her  sophy she said get up for a moment i want arthur to come here so sophy did get up and her son immediately taking her place put his arm round his mothers waist  arthur she whispered to him i fear i have been foolish about this  that was all that was ever said to him about the journey to bowes he was not the man to triumph over his mothers failure he merely kissed her when her little confession was made and pressed her slightly with his arm from that time it was understood that adela was to be brought thither as soon as might be to reign the mistress of the vicarage and that then what further arrangements might be necessary were to be made by them all at their perfect leisure that question of the nursery might at any rate remain in abeyance for twelve months  soon after that it was decided in full conclave that if adela would consent the marriage should take place in the summer very frequent letters passed between hurst staple and littlebath and mrs wilkinson no longer alluded to them with severity or even with dislike lord stapledean had at any rate thoroughly convinced her that the vicaragehouse belonged to the vicarto the vicar male and not to the vicar female and now that her eyes had been opened on this point she found herself obliged to confess that adela gauntlet would not make a bad wife  of course we shall be poor mother but we expect that  i hope you will at least be happy said mrs wilkinson not liking at present to dwell on the subject of their poverty as her conscience began to admonish her with reference to the three hundred and fifty pounds per annum  i should think i might be able to get pupils continued arthur if i had two at one hundred and fifty pounds each we might be comfortable enough  perhaps adela would not like to have lads in the house  ah mother you dont know adela she will not object to anything because she does not herself like it and in this manner that affair was so far settled  and then adela was invited to hurst staple and she accepted the invitation she was not coy in declaring the pleasure with which she did so nor was she bashful or shamefaced in the matter she loved the man that she was to marryhad long loved him and now it was permitted to her to declare her love now it was her duty to declare it and to assure him with all the pretty protestations in her power that her best efforts should be given to sweeten his cup and smooth his path her duty now was to seek his happiness to share his troubles to be one with him in her mind it was not less her duty now than it would be when by gods ordinance they should be one bone and one flesh  while their mother had held her seat on her high horse with reference to that question of the house sophia and mary had almost professed hostility to adela they had given in no cordial adherence to their brothers marriage but now they were able to talk of their coming sister with interest and affection i know that adela would like this arthur and im sure that adela would prefer that and when were gone you know adela will do so and so arthur received all this with brotherly love and the kindest smiles and thanked god in his heart that his mother had taken that blessed journey to bowes lodge  adela he once said to her as they were walking together one lonely spring evening along the reedy bank of that river adela had i had your courage all this would have been settled long since  i dont know she said but i am sure of this that it is much better as it is now we may fairly trust that we do know our own minds love should be tried perhaps before it is trusted  i should have trusted yours at the first word you could have spoken the first look you would have given me  and i should have done so too and then we might have been wrong is it not well as it is arthur  and then he declared that it was very well very well indeed ah yes how could it have been better with him he thought too of his past sorrows his deep woes his great disappointments of that bitter day at oxford when the lists came down of the halfbroken heart with which he had returned from bowes of the wretchedness of that visit to west putford he thought of the sad hours he had passed seated idle and melancholy in the vicarage bookroom meditating on his forlorn condition he had so often wailed over his own lot droning out a dirge a melancholy væ victis for himself and now for the first time he could change the note now his song was io triumphe as he walked along he shouted out a joyful pæan with the voice of his heart had he taken the most double of all firsts what more could fate have given to him or at any rate what better could fate have done for him  and to speak sooth fate had certainly given to him quite as much as he had deserved  and then it was settled that they should be married early in the ensuing june on the first said arthur no the thirtieth said adela laughing and then as women always give more than they claim it was settled that they should be married on the eleventh let us trust that the day may always be regarded as propitious     chapter xiv  mr bertrams death   sir henry harcourt had certainly played his hand badly considering the number of trumps that he had held and that he had turned up an honour in becoming solicitorgeneral he was not now in a happy condition he was living alone in his fine house in eaton square he was out of office he was looked on with an evil eye by his former friends in that he had endeavoured to stick to office too long he was deeply in debt and his once golden hopes with reference to mr bertram were becoming fainter and fainter every day nor was this all not only did he himself fear that he should get but little of the hadley money but his creditors had begun to have the same fears they had heard that he was not to be the heir and were importunate accordingly it might be easy to stave them off till mr bertram should be under the ground but thenwhat then his professional income might still be large though not increasing as it should have done and what lawyer can work well if his mind be encumbered by deep troubles of his own  he had told george bertram that he would go down to hadley and claim his wife if he did not receive a favourable message from his wifes grandfather and he now determined to take some such step he felt himself driven to do something to bring about some arrangement to make some use of the few remaining grains of sand which were still to run through the glass that was measuring out the lees of life for that old man  so thinking but not quite resolved as to what he would do when he reached the house he started for hadley he knew that george was still there that his wife was there and that mr bertram was there and he trusted that he should not fail at any rate in seeing them he was not by nature a timid man and had certainly not become so by education but nevertheless his heart did not beat quite equably within his bosom when he knocked at the rich mans door  of course he was well known to the servant at first he asked after mr bertram and was told that he was much the samegoing very fast the maid did not think that sir henry could see him the poor girl knowing that the gentleman before her was not a welcome visitor stood in the doorway as though to guard the ladies who were in the drawingroom  who is here now said sir henry who is staying here  mr george said the girl thinking that she would be safest in mentioning his name and miss baker sir  lady harcourt is here i suppose  yes sir her ladyship is in the drawingroom and she shook in her shoes before him as she made the announcement  for a moment sir henry was inclined to force his way by the trembling young woman and appear before the ladies but then what would he get by it angry as he was with all the hadley people he was still able to ask himself that question supposing that he were there standing before his wife supposing even that he were able to bring her to his feet by a glance how much richer would that make him what bills would that pay he had loved his wife once with a sort of love but that day was gone when she had been at such pains to express her contempt for him all tenderness had deserted him it might be wise to make use of hernot to molest her as long as her grandfather lived when the old miser should have gone it would be time for him to have his revenge in the meantime he could gain nothing by provoking her so he told the servant that he wished to see mr george bertram  as it happened george and lady harcourt were together and miss baker was keeping watch with the sick man upstairs the drawingroom was close to the hall and carolines eager ear caught the tones of her husbands voice  it is sir henry she said becoming suddenly pale and rising to her feet as though prepared to retreat to some protection bertrams duller ear could not hear him but he also rose from his chair are you sure it is he  i heard his voice plainly said caroline in a tremulous whisper do not leave me george whatever happens do not leave me they called each other now by their christian names as cousins should do and their intercourse with each other had never been other than cousinly since that parting in eaton square  and then the door was opened and the maidservant in the glummest of voices announced that sir henry wanted to see mr george  show him into the diningroom said george and then following the girl after a minutes interval he found himself once more in the presence of his old friend  sir henry was even darker looking and his brow still more forbidding than at that last interview at georges chambers he was worn and caremarked and appeared to be ten years older than was really the case he did not wait till george should address him but began at once  bertram said he with a voice intended to be stern there are two persons here i want to see your uncle and my wife  i make no objection to your seeing either if they are willing to see you  yes but that wont do for me my duty compels me to look after them both and i mean to do so before i leave hadley  i will send your name to them at once said george but it must depend on them whether they will see you and so saying he rang the bell and sent a message up to his uncle  nothing was said till the girl returned sir henry paced the room backward and forward and george stood leaning with his back against the chimneypiece mr bertram says that hell see sir henry if hell step up stairs said the girl  very well am i to go up now  if you please sir  bertram followed sir henry to the door to show him the room but the latter turned round on the stairs and said that he would prefer to have no one present at the interview  i will only open the door for you said the other this he did and was preparing to return when his uncle called him do not go away george said he sir henry will want you to show him down again and so they stood together at the bedside  well sir henry this is kind of you said he putting his thin bony hand out upon the coverlid by way of making an attempt at an englishmans usual greeting  sir henry took it gently in his and found it cold and clammy it is nearly all over now sir henry said the old man  i hope not said the visitor with the tone usual on such occasions you may rally yet mr bertram  rally and there was something in the old mans voice that faintly recalled the bitter railing sound of other days no i dont suppose i shall ever rally much more  well we can only hope for the best thats what i do i can assure you  that is true we do hope for the bestall of us i can still do that if i do nothing else  of course said sir henry and then he stood still for a while meditating how best he might make use of his present opportunity what could he say to secure some fraction of the hundreds of thousands which belonged to the dying man that he had a right to at least a moiety of them his inmost bosom told him but how should he now plead his rights perhaps after all it would have been as well for him to have remained in london  mr bertram at last he said i hope you wont think it unbecoming in me if i say one word about business in your present state  nonono said the old man i cant do much as you see but ill endeavour to listen  you cant be surprised that i should be anxious about my wife  umph said mr bertram you havent treated her very well it seems  who says so  a woman wouldnt leave a fine house in london to shut herself up with a sick old man here if she were well treated i dont want any one to tell me that  i can hardly explain all this to you now sir particularly  particularly as i am dying no you cannot george give me a glass of that stuff i am very weak sir henry and cant say much more to you  may i ask you this one question sir have you provided for your granddaughter  provided for her and the old man made a sadly futile attempt to utter the words with that ominous shriek which a few years since would have been sure to frighten any man who would have asked such a question what sort of man can he be george to come to me now with such a question and so saying he pulled the clothes over him as though resolved to hold no further conversation  he is very weak said george i think you had better leave him  a hellish expression came across the lawyers face yes he said to himself go away that i may leave you here to reap the harvest by yourself go away and know myself to be a beggar he had married this mans grandchild and yet he was to be driven from his bedside like a stranger  tell him to go said mr bertram he will know it all in a day or two  you hear what he says whispered george  i do hear muttered the other and i will remember  he hardly thinks i would alter my will now does he perhaps he has pen and ink in his pocket ready to do it  i have only spoken in anxiety about my wife said sir henry and i thought you would remember that she was your childs daughter  i do remember it george why doesnt he leave me  harcourt it will be better that you should go said bertram you can have no idea how weak my uncle is and he gently opened the door  goodbye mr bertram i had not intended to disturb you and so saying sir henry slunk away  you know what his will is of course said sir henry when they were again in the diningroom  i have not the slightest idea on the subject said the other not the remotest conception he never speaks to me about it  well and now for lady harcourt where shall i find her  to this question george gave no answer nor was he able to give any caroline was no longer in the drawingroom sir henry insisted that he would see her and declared his intention of staying in the house till he did so but miss baker at last persuaded him that all his efforts would be useless nothing but force would induce lady harcourt to meet him  then force shall be used said sir henry  at any rate not now said george  what sir do you set yourself up as her protector is she base enough to allow you to interfere between her and her husband  i am her protector at the present moment sir henry what passed between us long since has been now forgotten but we are still cousins and while she wants protection i shall give it to her  oh you will will you  certainly i look upon her as though she were my sister she has no other brother  thats very kind of you and very complaisant of her but what if i say that i dont choose that she should have any such brother perhaps you think that as i am only her husband i ought not to have any voice in the matter  i do not suppose that you can care for her much after the word you once used to her  and what the devil is it to you what word i used to her thats the tack you go on is it now ill tell you fairly what i shall do i will wait till the breath is out of that old mans body and then i shall take my wife out of this houseby force if force be necessary and so saying sir henry turned to the front door and took his departure without making any further adieu  what dreadful trouble we shall have whimpered miss baker almost in tears  things went on at hadley for three days longer without any change except that mr bertram became weaker and less inclined to speak on the third morning he did say a few wordsgeorge i begin to think i have done wrong about you but i fear it is too late  his nephew declared that he was sure that things would turn out well muttering any platitude which might quiet the dying man  but it is too late isnt it  for any change in your will sir yes it is too late do not think of it  ah yes it would be very troublesomevery troublesome oh me it has nearly come now george very nearly  it had very nearly come he did not again speak intelligibly to any of them in his last hours he suffered considerably and his own thoughts seemed to irritate him but when he did mutter a few words they seemed to refer to trivial matterslittle plagues which dying men feel as keenly as those who are full of life to the last he preferred george either to his niece or to his granddaughter and was always best pleased when his nephew was by him once or twice he mentioned mr pritchetts name but he showed his dissent when they proposed to send for his man of business  on the afternoon of that day he breathed his last in the presence of his three relatives his nearest relative indeed was not there nor did they dare to send for him he had latterly expressed so strong a disgust at the very name of sir lionel that they had ceased by common consent to mention bertrams father he seemed to be aware that his last moments were approaching for he would every now and then raise his withered hand from off the bed as though to give them warning and so he died and the eyes of the rich man were closed  he died full of years and perhaps in one and that the most usual acceptation of the word full of honour he owed no man a shilling had been true to all his engagements had been kind to his relatives with a rough kindness he had loved honesty and industry and had hated falsehood and fraud to him the herd born only to consume the fruits had ever been odious that he could be generous his conduct in his nephews earliest years had plainly shown he had carried too in his bosom a heart not altogether hardened against his kind for he had loved his nephew and to a certain extent his niece also and his granddaughter  but in spite of all this he had been a bad man he had opened his heart to that which should never find admittance to the heart of man the iron of his wealth had entered into his very soul he had made half a million of money and that halfmillion had been his godhis only godand indeed men have but one god the true worship of the one loved shrine prevents all other worship the records of his money had been his deity there in his solitude at hadley he had sat and counted them as they grew mortgages and bonds deeds and scrip shares in this and shares in that thousands in these funds and tens of thousands in those to the last he had gone on buying and selling buying in the cheap market and selling in the dear and everything had gone well with him  everything had gone well with him such was the city report of old mr bertram but let the reader say how much or rather how little had gone well faustuslike he had sold himself to a golden mephistopheles and his margaret had turned to stone within his embrace  how many of us make fausts bargain the bodily attendance of the devil may be mythical but in the spirit he is always with us and how rarely have we the power to break the contract the london merchant had so sold himself he had given himself body and soul to a devil the devil had promised him wealth and had kept his word and now the end had come though the day of his happiness had not yet arrived  but the end had not come all this was but the beginning if we may believe that a future life is to be fitted to the desires and appetites as they are engendered here what shall we think of the future of a man whose desire has been simply for riches whose appetite has been for heaps of money how miserably is such a poor wretch cheated how he gropes about making his bargain with blind eyes thinking that he sees beyond his neighbours who is so green so soft so foolishly the victim of the sorriest sharper as this man weigh out all his past and what has it been weigh out his futureif you canand think what it must be poor dull faustus what thou hast lost everything among the thimbleriggers poor dull stupid wretch  mr bertram had not been a good man nor had he been a wise man but he had been highly respectable and his memory is embalmed in tons of marble and heaps of monumental urns epitaphs believed to be true testify to his worth and deeds which are sometimes as false as epitaphs do the same he is a man of whom the world has agreed to say good things to whom fame that rich city fame which speaks with a cornetapiston made of gold instead of a brazen trumpet has been very kindbut nevertheless he was not a good man as regards him it will only remain for us to declare what was his will and that shall be done in the next chapter  it was settled that he should be buried on the sixth day after his death and that his will should be read after his funeral george had now to manage everything and to decide who should be summoned to the reading there were two whom he felt bound to call thither though to them the reading he knew would be a bitter grief there was in the first place his father sir lionel whose calls for money had not of late decreased in urgency it would be seemly that he should come but the opening of the will would not be a pleasant hour for him then there would be sir henry he also was of course summoned painful as it was to his wife to have to leave the house at such a time nor indeed did he wait to be invited for he had written to say that he should be there before he received george bertrams note mr pritchett also was sent for and the old mans attorney  and then when these arrangements had been made the thoughts of the living reverted from the dead to themselves how should those three persons who now occupied that house so lovingly provide for themselves and where should they fix their residence georges brotherly love for his cousin was very well in theory it was well to say that the past had been forgotten but there are things for which no memory can lose its hold he and caroline had loved each other with other love than that of a brother and a sister and each knew that they two might not dwell under the same roof it was necessary to talk over these matters and in doing so it was very hard not to touch on forbidden subjects  caroline had made up her mind to live again with her aunthad made up her mind to do so providing that her husbands power was not sufficient to prevent it miss baker would often tell her that the law would compel her to return to her lord that she would be forced to be again the mistress of the house in eaton square and again live as the prosperous wife of the prosperous politician to this caroline had answered but little but that little had been in a manner that had thoroughly frightened miss baker nothing lady harcourt had said nothing should induce her to do so  but if you cannot help yourself caroline  i will help myself i will find a way to prevent at any rate that so much she had said but nothing further and so much miss baker had repeated to george bertram fearing the worst  it was not till the day before the funeral that caroline spoke to her cousin on the subject  george she said to him shall we be able to live hereto keep on this house  you and miss baker you mean  yes aunt and i we should be as quiet here as anywhereand i am used to these people now  it must depend on the will the house was his own property but doubtless miss baker could rent it  we should have money enough for that i suppose  i should hope so but we none of us know anything yet all your own moneythe income at least coming from itis in sir henrys hands  i will never condescend to ask for that she said and then there was a pause in their conversation  george she continued after a minute or two you will not let me fall into his hands  he could not help remembering that his own mad anger had already thrown her into the hands which she now dreaded so terribly oh if those two last years might but pass away as a dream and leave him free to clasp her to his bosom as his own but the errors of past years will not turn themselves to dreams there is no more solid stuff in this material world than they are they never melt away or vanish into thin air  not if it can be avoided he replied  ah but it can be avoided can it not say that you know it can do not make me despair it cannot be that he has a right to imprison me  i hardly know what he has a right to do but he is a stern man and will not easily be set aside  but you will not desert me  no i will not desert you but  but what  for your sake caroline we must regard what people will say our names have been mixed together but not as cousins  i know i know but george you do not suppose i intended you should live here i was not thinking of that i know that that may not be  for myself i shall keep my chambers in london i shall just be able to starve on there and then i shall make one more attempt at the bar  and i know you will succeed you are made for success at last i have always felt that  a man must live somehow he must have some pursuit and that is more within my reach than any other otherwise i am not very anxious for success what is the use of it all of what use will it be to me now  oh george  well is it not true  do not tell me that i have made shipwreck of all your fortune  no i do not say that you have done it it was i that drove the bark upon the rocks i myself but the timbers on that account are not the less shattered  you should strive to throw off that feeling you have so much before you in the world  i have striven i have thought that i could love other women i have told others that i did love them but my words were false and they and i knew that they were false i have endeavoured to think of other thingsof money ambition politics but i can care for none of them if ever a man cut his own throat i have done so  she could not answer him at once because she was now sobbing and the tears were streaming from her eyes and what have i done she said at last if your happiness is shattered what must mine be i sometimes think that i cannot live and bear it with him she added after another pause i will not live and bear it if it comes to that i will die george and rising from her chair she walked across the room and took him sharply by the arm george she said you will protect me from that i say that you will save me from that  protect you said he repeating her words and hardly daring to look into her face how could he protect her how save her from the lord she had chosen for herself it might be easy enough for him to comfort her now with promises but he could not find it in his heart to hold out promises which he could not fulfil if after the reading of the will sir henry harcourt should insist on taking his wife back with him how could he protect herhe of all men in the world  you will not give me up to him she said wildly if you do my blood will lie upon your head george george say that you will save me from that to whom can i look now but to you  i do not think he will force you away with him  but if he does will you stand by and see me so used  certainly not but caroline  well  it will be better that i should not be driven to interfere the world will forget that i am your cousin but will remember that i was once to have been your husband  the world i am past caring for the world it is nothing to me now if all london knows how it is with me i have loved and thrown away my love and tied myself to a brute i have loved and do love but my love can only be a sorrow to me i do not fear the world but god and my conscience i do fear once for one moment george i thought that i would fear nothing once for one moment i was still willing to be yours but i remembered what you would think of me if i should so fall and i repented my baseness may god preserve me from such sin but for the worldwhy should you or i fear the world  it is for you that i fear it it would grieve me to hear men speak lightly of your name  let them say what they please the wretched are always trodden on let them say what they please i deserved it all when i stood before the altar with that man when i forbade my feet to run or my mouth to speak though i knew that i hated him and owned it to my heart what shall i do george to rid me of that sin  she had risen and taken hold of his arm when first she asked him to protect her and she was still standing beside the chair on which he sat he now rose also and said a few gentle words such as he thought might soothe her  yes she continued as though she did not heed him i said to myself almost twenty times during that last night that i hated him in my very soul that i was bound in honour even yet to leave himin honour and in truth and in justice but my pride forbade itmy pride and my anger against you  it is useless to think of it now dear  ah yes quite useless would that i had done it thenthen at the last moment they asked me whether i would love that man i whispered inwardly to myself that i loathed him but my tongue said yes out loud can such a lie as that told in gods holy temple sworn before his own altarcan such perjury as that ever be forgiven me  but i shall sin worse still if i go back to him she continued after a while i have no right george to ask anything from your kindness as a cousin but for your loves sake your old love which you cannot forget i do ask you to save me from this but it is this rather that i ask that you will save me from the need of saving myself  that evening george sat up late alone preparing for the morrows work and trying to realize the position in which he found himself mr pritchett had he been there would have whispered into his ears again and again those ominous and allimportant words half a million of money mr george half a million of money and indeed though mr pritchett was not there the remembrance of those overflowing coffers did force themselves upon his mind who can say that he if placed as bertram then was would not think of them  he did think of themnot over deeply nor with much sadness he knew that they were not to be his neither the whole of them nor any part of them so much his uncle had told him with sufficient plainness he knew also that they might all have been his and then he thought of that interview in which mr bertram had endeavoured to beg from him a promise to do that for which his own heart so strongly yearned yes he might have had the bride and the money too he might have been sitting at that moment with the wife of his bosom laying out in gorgeous plans the splendour of their future life it would be vain to say that there was no disappointment at his heart  but yet there was within his breast a feeling of gratified independence which sufficed to support him at least he might boast that he had not sold himself not aloud but with that inward boasting which is so common with most of us there was a spirit within him endowed with a greater wealth than any which mr pritchett might be able to enumerate and an inward love the loss of which could hardly have been atoned for even by the possession of her whom he had lost nor was this the passion which men call selflove it was rather a vigorous knowledge of his own worth as a man a strong will which taught him that no price was sufficient to buy his assent that black should be reckoned white or white be reckoned black  his uncle he knew had misunderstood him in rejecting the old mans offers he had expressed his contempt for richesfor riches that is as any counterbalance to independence mr bertram had taken what he said for more than it was worth and had supposed that his nephew afflicted with some singular lunacy disliked money for its own sake george had never cared to disabuse his uncles mind let him act as he will he had said to himself it is not for me to dictate to him either on the one side or the other and so the error had gone on  tomorrow morning the will would be read and george would have to listen to the reading of it he knew well enough that the world looked on him as his uncles probable heir and that he should have to bear mr pritchetts hardly expressed pity sir henrys malignant pleasure and sir lionels loud disgust all this was nearly as bad to him as the remembrance of what he had lost but by degrees he screwed his courage up to the necessary point of endurance  what is pritchett to me with his kind but burdensome solicitude what sir henrys mad anger how can they affect my soul or what even is my father let him rave i care not to have compassion on myself why should his grief assail megrief which is so vile so base so unworthy of compassion  and thus schooling himself for the morrow he betook himself to bed     chapter xv  the will   the only attendants at old mr bertrams funeral were his nephew mr pritchett and the hadley doctor the other gentlemen were to be present only at the more interesting ceremony of reading the will sir lionel had written to say that he was rather unwell that he certainly would come up from littlebath so as to be present at the latter performance but that the very precarious state of his health and the very inconvenient hours of the trains unhappily prevented him from paying the other last sad duty to his brothers remains sir henry harcourt had plainly demanded at what hour the will would be read and mr stickatit juniormr george stickatitof the firm of dry and stickatit had promised to be at hadley punctually at two pm and he kept his word  mr pritchett came down by an early train and as was fit on such an occasion was more melancholy than usual he was very melancholy and very sad for he felt that that halfmillion of money was in a great jeopardy and perhaps even the death of his old friend of forty years standing may have had some effect on him it was a mingled feeling that pervaded him oh mr george he said just before they went to the churchyard we are grass of the field just grass of the field here today and gone tomorrow flourishing in the morning and cast into the oven before night it behoves such frail impotent creatures to look close after their interestshalf a million of money im afraid you didnt think enough about it mr george  and then the hadley bells were rung again but they were not rung loudly it seemed to bertram that no one noticed that anything more than usually sad was going on he could hardly realise it to himself that he was going to put under the ground almost his nearest relative the bells rang out a dirge but they did it hardly above their breath there were but three boys gathered at the little gate before the door to see the body of the rich man carried to his last home george stood with his back to the empty diningroom fireplace on one side stood mr pritchett and on the other the barnet doctor very few words passed between them but they were not in their nature peculiarly lugubrious and then there was a scuffling heard on the stairsa subdued decent undertakers scufflingas some hour or two before had been heard the muffled click of a hammer feet scuffled down the stairs outside the diningroom door and along the passage and then the door was opened and in low decent undertakers voice rednosed sombre wellfed mr mortmain told them that they were ready  these are yours sir and he handed a pair of black gloves to george and these are yours sir and he gave another pair to the doctor but the doctor held them instead of putting them on otherwise mr mortmain could not be expected to change them after the ceremony for a pair of lighter colour they understood each other and what could a country doctor do with twenty or thirty pairs of black gloves a year and these yours mr pritchett  oh mr george sighed pritchett to think it should come to this but he was a good gentleman and very successfulvery successful  there were not ten people in the church or in the churchyard during the whole time of the funeral to think that a man with half a million of money could die and be got rid of with so little parade what money could doin a moderate waywas done the coffin was as heavy as lead could make it the cloth of the best the plate upon it was of silver or looked like it there was no room for an equipage of hearses and black coaches the house was so unfortunately near to the churchyard it was all done in a decent sombre useful moneymaking way as beseemed the remains of such a man  but it was on change that he was truly buried in capel court that his funeral sermon was duly preached these were the souls that knew him the ears to which his name loomed large he had been true and honest in all his dealingsthere at least he had hurt nobody by word or deedexcepting in the way of trade and had kept his hands from picking and stealingfrom all picking that is not warranted by city usage and from all stealing that the law regards as such therefore there on change they preached his funeral sermon loudly and buried him with all due honours  two had been named for the reading of the will seeing that a train arrived at 145 pm and therefore when the ceremony was over george and mr pritchett had to sit together in the diningroom till that time arrived the doctor who did not expect much from the will had gone away perhaps to prepare other friends for similar occupation it was a tedious hour that they so passed certainly but at last it did make itself away lunch was brought in and the sherry which had been handed round with biscuits before the funeral was again put on the table mr pritchett liked a glass of sherry though it never seemed to have other effect on him than to make his sadness of a deeper dye but at last between this occupation and the muttering of a few scraps of a somewhat worldly morality the hour did wear itself away and the hand of the old clock pointed to two  the three gentlemen had come down by the same train and arrived in a fly together mr george stickatit junior paid for the accommodation which was no more than right for he could put it in the bill and sir lionel could not the mind of sir henry was too much intent on other things to enable him to think about the fly  well george said sir lionel so its all over at last my poor brother i wish i could have been with you at the funeral but it was impossible the ladies are not herethis he added in a whisper he could not well talk about lady harcourt and he was not at the present moment anxious to see miss baker  they are not here today said george as he pressed his fathers hand he did not think it necessary to explain that they were staying at good old mrs joness on the other side of the green  i should have been down for the funeral said mr stickatit but i have been kept going about the property ever since the death up to this moment i may say theres the document gentlemen and the will was laid on the table the personalty will be sworn under five the real will be about two more well pritchett and how are you this morning  sir henry said but little to anybody bertram put out his hand to him as he entered and he just took it muttering something and then having done so he sat himself down at the table his face was not pleasant to be seen his manner was ungracious nay more than that uncourteousalmost brutal and it seemed as though he were prepared to declare himself the enemy of all who were there assembled to sir lionel he was known and it may be presumed that some words had passed between them in the fly but there in the room he said no word to any one but sat leaning back in an armchair with his hands in his pockets scowling at the table before him  a beautiful day is it not mr pritchett said sir lionel essaying to make things pleasant after his fashion  a beautiful dayoutwardly sir lionel sighed mr pritchett but the occasion is not comfortable we must all die though all of us mr george  but we shall not all of us leave such a will as that behind us said mr stickatit come gentlemen are we ready shall we sit down  george got a chair for his father and put it down opposite to that of sir henrys mr pritchett humbly kept himself in one corner the lawyer took the head of the table and broke open the envelope which contained the will with a degree of gusto which showed that the occupation was not disagreeable to him mr bertram said he will you not take a chair  thank you no ill stand here if you please said george and so he kept his position with his back to the empty fireplace  all of them then were somewhat afraid of having their disappointment read in their faces and commented upon by the others they were all of them schooling themselves to bear with an appearance of indifference the tidings which they dreaded to hear all of them that is except the attorney he hoped nothing and feared nothing  mr pritchett nearly closed his eyes and almost opened his mouth and sat with his hands resting on his stomach before him as though he were much too humble to have any hopes of his own  sir lionel was all smiles what did he care not he if that boy of his should get anything he as an affectionate father would of course be glad if not why then his dear boy could do without it that was the intended interpretation of his look and judging of it altogether he did not do it badly only he deceived nobody on such occasions ones face which is made up for deceit never does deceive any one but in truth sir lionel still entertained a higher hope than any other of the listeners there he did not certainly expect a legacy himself but he did think that george might still be the heir as sir henry was not to be whose name was so likely and then if his son his dear son george should be lord of two nay say only one of those many hundred thousand pounds what might not a fond father expect  sir henry was all frowns and yet he was not quite hopeless the granddaughter the only lineal descendant of the dead man was still his wife anything left to her must in some sort be left to him let it be tied up with ever so much care it might still be probable that she might be named the heiressperhaps the sole heiress it might still be probable that the old man had made no new will since caroline had left his home in eaton square at any rate there would still be a ground on which to fight within his reach if lady harcourt should be in any way enriched under the will and if so no tenderness on his part should hinder him from fighting out that fight as long as he had an inch on which to stand  bertram neither hoped anything nor feared anything except thisthat they would look at him as a disappointed man he knew that he was to have nothing and although now that the moment had come he felt that wealth might possibly have elated him still the absence of it did not make him in any degree unhappy but it did make him uncomfortable to think that he should be commiserated by mr pritchett sneered at by harcourt and taunted by his father  well gentlemen are we ready said mr stickatit again they were all ready and so mr stickatit began  i will not give an acute critic any opportunity for telling me that the will as detailed by me was all illegal i have not by me the ipsissima verba nor can i get them now as i am very far from doctors commons so i will give no verbal details at all  the will moreover was very longno less than fifteen folios and that amount though it might not be amiss in a threevolume edition would be inconvenient when the book comes to be published for eighteenpence but the gist of the will was as follows  it was dated in the october last gone by at the time when george was about to start for egypt and when lady harcourt had already left her husband it stated that he george bertram senior of hadley being in full use of all his mental faculties made this as his last will and testament and then he willed and devised  firstly that george stickatit junior of the firm of day and stickatit and george bertram junior his nephew should be his executors and that a thousand pounds each should be given to them provided they were pleased to act in that capacity  when sir lionel heard that george was named as one of the executors he looked up at his son triumphantly but when the thousand pounds were named his face became rather long and less pleasant than usual a man feels no need to leave a thousand pounds to an executor if he means to give him the bulk of his fortune  secondly he left three hundred pounds a year for life to his dear old trusty servant samuel pritchett mr pritchett put his handkerchief up to his face and sobbed audibly but he would sooner have had two or three thousand pounds for he also had an ambition to leave money behind him  thirdly he bequeathed five hundred pounds a year for life to mary baker late of littlebath and now of hadley and the use of the house at hadley if she chose to occupy it otherwise the house was to be sold and the proceeds were to go to his estate  sir lionel when he heard this made a short calculation in his mind whether it would now be worth his while to marry miss baker and he decided that it would not be worth his while  fourthly he gave to his executors abovenamed a sum of four thousand pounds to be invested by them in the three per cent consols for the sole use and benefit of his granddaughter caroline harcourt and the will went on to say that he did this although he was aware that sufficient provision had already been made for his granddaughter because he feared that untoward events might make it expedient that she should have some income exclusively her own  sir henry when this paragraph was readthis paragraph from which his own name was carefully excludeddashed his fist down upon the table so that the ink leaped up out of the inkstand that stood before the lawyer and fell in sundry blots upon the document but no one said anything there was blottingpaper at hand and mr stickatit soon proceeded  in its fifth proviso the old man mentioned his nephew george i wish it to be understood he said that i love my nephew george bertram and appreciate his honour honesty and truth sir lionel once more took heart of grace and thought that it might still be all right and george himself felt pleased more pleased than he had thought it possible that he should have been at the reading of that will but continued the will i am not minded as he is himself aware to put my money into his hands for his own purposes it then went on to say that a further sum of four thousand pounds was given to him as a token of affection  sir lionel drew a long breath after all five thousand pounds was the whole sum total that was rescued out of the fire what was five thousand pounds how much could he expect to get from such a sum as that perhaps after all he had better take miss baker but then her pittance was only for her life how he did hate his departed brother at that moment  poor pritchett wheezed and sighed again ah said he to himself half a million of money gone clean gone but he never would take my advice  but george felt now that he did not care who looked at him who commiserated him the will was all right he did not at that moment wish it to be other than that the old man had made it after all their quarrels all their hot words and perverse thoughts towards each other it was clear to him now that his uncle had at any rate appreciated him he could hear the remainder of it quite unmoved  there were some other legacies to various people in the city none of them being considerable in amount five hundred pounds to one one thousand pounds to another fifty pounds to a third and so on and then came the body of the willthe very will indeed  and so mr george bertram willed that after the payment of all his just debts and of the legacies above recapitulated his whole property should be given to his executors and by them expended in building and endowing a college and almshouse to be called the bertram college for the education of the children of london fishmongers and for the maintenance of the widows of such fishmongers as had died in want now mr bertram had been a member of the honourable company of fishmongers  and that was the end of the will and mr stickatit having completed the reading folded it up and put it back into the envelope sir henry the moment the reading was over again dashed his fist upon the table as heiratlaw said he i shall oppose that document  i think youll find it all correct said mr stickatit with a little smile  and i think otherwise sir said the late solicitorgeneral in a voice that made them all start very much otherwise that document is not worth the paper on which it is written and now i warn you two who have been named as executors that such is the fact  sir lionel began to consider whether it would be better for him that the will should be a will or should not be a will till he had done so he could not determine with which party he would side if that were no will there might be a previous one and if so bertram might according to that be the heir it is a very singular document said he very singular  but sir henry wanted no allieswanted no one in that room to side with him hostility to them all was his present desire to them and to one otherthat other one who had brought upon him all this misfortune that wife of his bosom who had betrayed his interests and shattered his hopes  i believe there is nothing further to detain us at the present moment said mr stickatit mr bertram perhaps you can allow me to speak to you somewhere for five minutes  i shall act said george  oh of course thats of course said stickatit and i also  stop one moment gentlemen shouted harcourt again i hereby give you both warning that you have no power to act  perhaps sir suggested stickatit your lawyer will take any steps he may think necessary  my lawyer sir will do as i bid him and will require no suggestion from you and now i have another matter to treat of mr bertram where is lady harcourt  bertram did not answer at once but stood with his back still against the chimneypiece thinking what answer he would give  where i say is lady harcourt let us have no juggling if you please you will find that i am in earnest  i am not lady harcourts keeper said george in a very low tone of voice  no by g nor shall you be where is she if you do not answer my question i shall have recourse to the police at once  sir lionel meaning to make things pleasant now got up and went over to his son he did not know on what footing with reference to each other his son and lady harcourt now stood but he did know that they had loved each other and been betrothed for years he did know also that she had left her husband and that that husband and his son had been the closest friends it was a great opportunity for him to make things pleasant he had not the slightest scruple as to sacrificing that dear caroline whom he had so loved as his future daughterinlaw  george said he if you know where lady harcourt is it will be better that you should tell sir henry no properlythinking man will countenance a wife in disobeying her husband  father said george lady harcourt is not in my custody she is the judge of her own actions in this matter  is she said sir henry she must learn to know that she is not and that very shortly do you mean to tell me where she is  i mean to tell you nothing about her sir henry  george you are wrong said sir lionel if you know where lady harcourt is you are bound to tell him i really think you are  i am bound to tell him nothing father nor will i i will have no conversation with him about his wife it is his affair and hersand that perhaps of a hundred other people but it certainly is not mine nor will i make it so  then you insist on concealing her said sir henry  i have nothing to do with her i do not know that she is concealed at all  you know where she is  i do but believing as i do that she would rather not be disturbed i shall not say where you would find her  i think you ought george  father you do not understand this matter  you will not escape in that way sir here you are named as her trustee in this will  i am glad that you acknowledge the will at any rate said mr stickatit  who says that i acknowledge it i acknowledge nothing in the will but it is clear from that document that she presumes herself to be under his protection it is manifest that that silly fool intended that she should be so now i am not the man to put up with this i ask you once more mr bertram will you tell me where i shall find lady harcourt  no i will not  very well then i shall know how to act gentlemen goodmorning mr stickatit i caution you not to dispose under that will of anything of which mr bertram may have died possessed and so saying he took up his hat and left the house  and what would he have done had bertram told him that lady harcourt was staying at mr joness in the red brick house on the other side of the green what can any man do with a recusant wife we have often been told that we should build a golden bridge for a flying enemy and if any one can be regarded as a mans enemy it is a wife who is not his friend  after a little while sir lionel went away with mr pritchett bertram asked them both to stay for dinner but the invitation was not given in a very cordial manner at any rate it was not accepted  goodbye then george said sir lionel i suppose i shall see you before i leave town i must say you have made a bad affair of this will  goodbye mr george goodbye said mr pritchett make my dutiful compliments to miss bakerand to the other lady  yes i will mr pritchett  ah dear well you might have had it all instead of the fishmongers children if you had chosen mr george  and we also will say goodbye to the two gentlemen as we shall not see them again in these pages that mr pritchett will live for the remainder of his days decently if not happily on his annuity may be surmised that sir lionel without any annuity but with a fair income paid from the countrys taxes and with such extra pecuniary aid as he may be able to extract from his son will continue to live indecently at littlebathfor he never again returned to active servicethat also may be surmised and thus we will make our bows to these old gentlemenentertaining however very different feelings for them  and soon afterwards mr stickatit also went some slight necessary legal information as to the executorship was first imparted sir henrys threats were ridiculed the good fortune of the fishmongers was wondered at and then mr stickatit took his hat the four gentlemen no doubt went up to london by the same train  in the evening miss baker and lady harcourt came back to their own house it was miss bakers own house now when she heard what her old friend had done for her she was bewildered by his generosity she at any rate had received more than she had expected  and what does he mean to do said caroline  he says that he will dispute the will but that i take it is nonsense  but aboutyou know what i mean george  he means to insist on your return that at least is what he threatens  he shall insist in vain no law that man ever made shall force me to live with him again  whether or no the husband was in earnest it might clearly be judged from the wifes face and tone that she was so on the next morning george went up to london and the two women were left alone in their dull house at hadley     chapter xvi  eaton square   sir henry harcourt had walked forth first from that room in which the will had been read and he had walked forth with a threat in his mouth but he knew when making it that that threat was an empty bravado the will was as valid as care and law could make it and the exsolicitorgeneral knew very well that it was valid  he knew moreover that the assistance of no ordinary policeman would suffice to enable him to obtain possession of his wifes person and he knew also that if he had such possession it would avail him nothing he could not pay his debts with her nor could he make his home happy with her nor could he compel her to be in any way of service to him it had all been bravado but when men are driven into cornerswhen they are hemmed in on all sides so that they have no escape to what else than bravado can they have recourse with sir henry the game was up and no one knew this better than himself  he was walking up and down the platform with his hat over his brows and his hands in his trouserspockets when mr stickatit came up we shall have a little rain this afternoon said mr stickatit anxious to show that he had dropped the shop and that having done so he was ready for any of the worlds ordinary converse  sir henry scowled at him from under the penthouse lid of his hat and passed on in his walk without answering a word the thing had gone too far with him for affectation he did not care to make sacrifice now to any of the worlds graces his inner mind was hostile to that attorney of bucklersbury and he could dare to show that it was so after that mr stickatit made no further remark to him  yes he could afford now to be forgetful of the worlds graces for the worlds heaviest cares were pressing very heavily on him when a man finds himself compelled to wade through miles of mud in which he sinks at every step up to his knees he becomes forgetful of the blacking on his boots whether or no his very skin will hold out is then his thought and so it was now with sir henry or we may perhaps say that he had advanced a step beyond that he was pretty well convinced now that his skin would not hold out  he still owned his fine house in eaton square and still kept his seat for the battersea hamlets but baron brawl and such like men no longer came willingly to his call and his voice was no longer musical to the occupants of the treasury bench his reign had been sweet but it had been very short prosperity he had known how to enjoy but adversity had been too much for him  since the day when he had hesitated to resign his high office his popularity had gone down like a leaden plummet in the salt water he had become crossgrained illtempered and morose the world had spoken evil of him regarding his wife and he had given the world the lie in a manner that had been petulant and injudicious the world had rejoined and sir henry had in every sense got the worst of it attorneys did not worship him as they had done nor did vicechancellors and lordsjustices listen to him with such bland attention no legal luminary in the memory of man had risen so quickly and fallen so suddenly it had not been given to him to preserve an even mind when adversity came upon him  but the worst of his immediate troubles were his debts he had boldly resolved to take a high position in london and he had taken it it now remained that the piper should be paid and the piper required payment not in the softest language while that old man was still living or rather still dying he had had an answer to give to all pipers but that answer would suffice him no longer every clause in that will would be in the daily jupiter of the day after tomorrowthe daily jupiter which had already given a wonderfully correct biography of the deceased great man  as soon as he reached the london station he jumped into a cab and was quickly whirled to eaton square the house felt dull and cold and wretched to him it was still the london season and parliament was sitting after walking up and down his own diningroom for half an hour he got into another cab and was whirled down to the house of commons but there it seemed as though all the men round him already knew of his disappointmentas though mr bertrams will had been read in a committee of the whole house men spoke coldly to him and looked coldly at him or at any rate he thought that they did so some debate was going on about the ballot at which members were repeating their last years speeches with new emphasis sir henry twice attempted to get upon his legs but the speaker would not have his eye caught men right and left of him who were minnows to him in success found opportunities for delivering themselves but the world of parliament did not wish at present to hear anything further from sir henry so he returned to his house in eaton square  as soon as he found himself again in his own diningroom he called for brandy and drank off a brimming glass he drank off one and then another the world and solitude together were too much for him and he could not bear them without aid then having done this he threw himself into his armchair and stared at the fireplace how tenfold sorrowful are our sorrows when borne in solitude some one has said that grief is half removed when it is shared how little that some one knew about it half removed when it is duly shared between two loving hearts does not love fly off with eighttenths of it there is but a small remainder left for the two to bear between them  but there was no loving heart here all alone he had to endure the crushing weight of his misfortunes how often has a man said when evil times have come upon him that he could have borne it all without complaint but for his wife and children the truth however has been that but for them he could not have borne it at all why does any man suffer with patience the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or put up with the whips and scorns of time but that he does so for others not for himself it is not that we should all be ready each to make his own quietus with a bare bodkin but that we should run from wretchedness when it comes in our path who fights for himself alone who would not be a coward if none but himself saw the battleif none others were concerned in it  with sir henry there was none other to see the battle none to take concern in it if solitude be bad in times of misery what shall we say of unoccupied solitude of solitude too without employment for the man who has been used to labour  such was the case with him his whole mind was out of tune there was nothing now that he could do no work to which he could turn himself he sat there gazing at the empty fireplace till the moments became unendurably long to him at last his chief suffering arose not from his shattered hopes and lost fortunes but from the leaden weight of the existing hour  what could he do to shake this off how could he conquer the depression that was upon him he reached his hand to the paper that was lying near him and tried to read but his mind would not answer to the call he could not think of the right honourable gentlemans speech or of the very able leading article in which it was discussed though the words were before his eyes he still was harping back on the injustice of that will or the iniquity of his wife on the imperturbable serenity of george bertram or the false fleeting friends who had fawned on him in his prosperity and now threw him over as a jonah with so little remorse  he dropped the paper on the ground and then again the feeling of solitude and of motionless time oppressed him with a weight as of tons of lead he jumped from his chair and paced up and down the room but the room was too confined he took his hat and pressing it on his brow walked out into the open air it was a beautiful spring evening in may and the twilight still lingered though the hour was late he paced three times round the square regardless of the noise of carriages and the lights which flashed forth from the revelries of his neighbours he went on and on not thinking how he would stem the current that was running against him so strongly hardly trying to think but thinking that it would be well for him if he could make the endeavour alas he could not make it  and then again he returned to the house and once more sat himself down in the same armchair was it come to this that the world was hopeless for him one would have said not he was in debt it is true had fallen somewhat from a high position had lost the dearest treasure which a man can have not only the treasure but the power of obtaining such treasure for the possession of a loving wife was no longer a possibility to him but still he had much his acknowledged capacity for law pleadings his right to take high place among law pleaders the trick of earning money in that fashion of life all these were still his he had his gown and wig and forensic browbeating brazen scowl nay he still had his seat in parliament why should he have despaired  but he did despairas men do when they have none to whom they can turn trustingly in their miseries this man had had friends by hundreds good serviceable parliamentary dinnereating dinnergiving friends fine pleasant friends as such friends go he had such friends by hundreds but he had failed to prepare for stormy times a leash or so of true hearts on which in stress of weather he could throw himself with undoubting confidence one such friend he may have had once but he now was among his bitterest enemies the horizon round him was all black and he did despair  how many a man lives and dies without giving any sign whether he be an arrant coward or a truehearted brave hero one would have said of this man a year since that he was brave enough he would stand up before a bench of judges with the bar of england round him and shout forth with brazen trumpet things that were true or things that were not true striking down a foe here to the right and slaughtering another there to the left in a manner which for so young a man filled beholders with admiration he could talk by the hour among the commons of england and no touch of modesty would ever encumber his speech he could make himself great by making others little with a glance but for all that he was a coward misfortune had come upon him and he was conquered at once  misfortune had come upon him and he found it unendurableyes utterly unendurable the grit and substance of the man within were not sufficient to bear the load which fate had put upon them as does a dealtable in similar case they were crushed down collapsed and fell in the stuff there was not good mahogany or sufficient hard wood but an unseasoned soft porous dealboard utterly unfit to sustain such pressure an unblushing wordy barrister may be very full of brass and words and yet be no better than an unseasoned porous dealboard even though he have a seat in parliament  he rose from his chair and again took a glass of brandy how impossible it is to describe the workings of a mind in such a state of misery as that he then endured whatwhat was there no release for him no way spite of this black fit to some sort of restto composure of the most ordinary kind was there nothing that he could do which would produce for him if not gratification then at least quiescence to the generality of men of his age there are resources in misfortune men go to billiardtables or to cards or they seek relief in womans society from the smiles of beauty or a laughtermoving tongue but sir henry very early in life had thrown those things from him he had discarded pleasure and wedded himself to hard work at a very early age if at the same time he had wedded himself to honesty also and had not discarded his heart it might have been well with him  he again sat down and then he remained all but motionless for some twenty minutes it had now become dark but he would have no lights lit the room was very gloomy with its red embossed paper and dark ruby curtains as his eye glanced round during the last few moments of the dusk he remembered how he had inquired of his caroline how many festive guests might sit at their ease in that room and eat the dainties which he with liberal hand would put before them where was his caroline now where were his guests what anxiety now had he that they should have room enough what cared he now for their dainties  it was not to be borne he clasped his hand to his brow and rising from his chair he went upstairs to his dressingroom for what purpose he had not even asked himself of bed and rest and sleep he had had no thought when there he again sat down and mechanically dressed himselfdressed himself as though he were going out to some gay eveningpartywas even more than ordinarily particular about his toilet one white handkerchief he threw aside as spoiled in the tying he looked specially to his boots and with scrupulous care brushed the specks of dust from the sleeve of his coat it was a blessing at any rate to have something to do he did this and then  when he commenced his work he had perhaps some remote intention of going somewhere if so he had quickly changed his mind for having finished his dressing he again sat himself down in an armchair the gas in his dressingroom had been lighted and here he was able to look around him and see what resources he had to his hand one resource he did see  ah me yes he saw it and his mind approvedsuch amount of mind as he had then left to him but he waited patiently awhilewith greater patience than he had hitherto exhibited that day he waited patiently sitting in his chair for some hour or so nay it may have been for two hours for the house was still and the servants were in bed then rising from his chair he turned the lock of his dressingroom door it was a futile precaution if it meant anything for the room had another door which opened to his wifes chamber and the access on that side was free and open  early on the following morning george bertram went up to town and was driven directly from the station to his dull dingy dirty chambers in the temple his chambers were not as those of practising lawyers he kept no desk there and no servant peculiar to himself it had suited him to have some restingplace for his foot that he could call his home and when he was there he was waited upon by the old woman who called herself the laundressprobably from the fact of her never washing herself or anything else  when he reached this sweet home on the morning in question he was told by the old woman that a very express messenger had been there that morning and that failing to find him the express messenger had gone down to hadley they had therefore passed each other upon the road the express messenger had left no message but the woman had learned that he had come from eaton square  and he left no letter  no sir no letter he had no letter but he was very eager about it it was something of importance surely  it might have been natural that under such circumstances george should go off to eaton square but it struck him as very probable that sir henry might desire to have some communication with him but that he when he should know what that communication was would in no degree reciprocate that desire the less that he had to say to sir henry harcourt at present perhaps the better so he made up his mind that he would not go to eaton square  after he had been in his rooms for about half an hour he was preparing to leave them and had risen with that object when he heard a knock at his door and quickly following the knock the young attorney who had read the will was in his room  you have heard the news mr bertram said he  no indeed what news i have just come up  sir henry harcourt has destroyed himself he shot himself in his own house yesterday late at night after the servants had gone to bed  george bertram fell back speechless on to the sofa behind him and stared almost unconsciously at the lawyer  it is too true sir that will of mr bertrams was too much for him his reason must have failed him and now he is no more and so was made clear what were the tidings with which that express messenger had been laden  there was little or nothing more to be said on the matter between george bertram and mr stickatit the latter declared that the fact had been communicated to him on authority which admitted of no doubt and the other when he did believe was but little inclined to share his speculations on it with the lawyer  nor was there much for bertram to donot at once the story had already gone down to hadleyhad already been told there to her to whom it most belonged and bertram felt that it was not at present his province to say kind things to her or seek to soften the violence of the shock no not at present     chapter xvii  conclusion   methinks it is almost unnecessary to write this last chapter the story as i have had to tell it is all told the object has been made plainor if not can certainly not be made plainer in these last six or seven pages the results of weakness and follyof such weakness and such folly as is too customary among ushave been declared what further fortune fate had in store for those whose names have been familiar to us might be guessed by all but nevertheless custom and the desire of making an end of the undertaken work and in some sort completing it compel me to this concluding chapter  within six weeks after the death of sir henry harcourt the vicar of hurst staple was married to adela gauntlet every critic who weighs the demerits of these pagesnay every reader indulgent or otherwise who skims through them will declare that the gentleman was not worthy of the lady i hope so with all my heart i do sincerely trust that they will think so if not my labour has been in vain  mr arthur wilkinson was not worthy of the wife with whom a kind providence had blessed himwas not worthy of her in the usual acceptation of the word he was not a bad man as men go but she was i must not trust myself to praise her or i shall be told not altogether truly that she was of my own creating  he was not worthy of her that is the amount of wealth of character which he brought into that life partnership was when counted up much less than her contribution but that she was fully satisfied with her bargainthat she was so then and so continuedwas a part of her worthiness if ever she weighed herself against him the scale in which he was placed never in her eyes showed itself to be light she took him for her lord and with a leal heart and a loving bosom she ever recognized him as her head and master as the polestar to which she must turn compelled by laws of adamant worthy or unworthy he was all that she expected all that she desired bone of her bone flesh of her flesh the father of her bairns the lord of her bosom the staff of her maintenance the prop of her house  and what man was ever worthy perfectly worthy of a pure true and honest girl mans life admits not of such purity and honesty rarely of such truth but one would not choose that such flowers should remain unplucked because no hands are fit to touch them  as to the future life of the vicar of hurst staple and his wife it is surely unnecessary to say muchor perhaps anything it cannot be told that they became suddenly rich no prime minister won by her beauty or virtue placed him upon the bench or even offered him a deanery vicar of hurst staple he is still and he still pays the old allowance out of his wellearned income to his mother who lives with her daughters at littlebath one young lad after another or generally two at a time share the frugal meals at the parsonage and our friend is sometimes heard to boast that none of these guests of his have as yet been plucked of the good things of the world there is quite enough for her and we may perhaps say nearly enough for him who then shall croak that they are poor  and now and then they walk along the river to west putford for among their choicest blessings is that of having a good neighbour in the old rectory and walking there how can they but think of old sorrows and present joys  ah she whispered to him one day as they crept along the reedy margin in the summer evening not long after their marriage ah dearest it is better now than it was when you came here once  is it love  is it not but you misbehaved thenyou know you did you would not trust me then  i could not trust myself  i should have trusted you in all things in everything as i do now  and then he cut at the rushes with his walkingstick as he had done before and bethought himself that in those days he had been an ass  and so we will leave them may they walk in those quiet paths for long days yet to come and may he learn to know that god has given him an angel to watch at his side  of the rosy miss todd there is nothing to be said but this that she is still miss todd and still rosy whether she be now at littlebath or baden or dieppe or harrogate at new york jerusalem or frazers river matters but little where she was last year there she is not now where she is now there she will not be next year but she still increases the circle of her dearlyloved friends and go where she will she at any rate does more good to others than others do to her and so we will make our last bow before her feet  we have only now to speak of george bertram and of lady harcourtof them and of miss baker who need hardly now be considered a personage apart from her niece no sooner was the first shock of sir henry harcourts death past than bertram felt that it was impossible for him at the present moment to see the widow it was but a few days since she had declared her abhorrence of the man to whom her fate was linked apparently for life and who was now gone and that declaration had implied also that her heart still belonged to himto him george bertramhim to whom it had first been givento him rather who had first made himself master of it almost without gift on her part now as regarded gods laws her hand was free again and might follow her heart  but death closes many a long account and settles many a bitter debt she could remember now that she had sinned against her husband as well as he against her that she had sinned the first and perhaps the deepest he would have loved her if she would have permitted it have loved her with a cold callous worldly love but still with such love as he had to give but she had married him resolving to give no love at all knowing that she could give none almost boasting to herself that she had told him that she had none to give  the mans blood was in some sort on her head and she felt that the burden was very heavy all this bertram understood more thoroughly perhaps than she did and for many weeks he abstained altogether from going to hadley he met miss baker repeatedly in london and learned from her how lady harcourt bore herself how she bore herself outwardly that is the inward bearing of such a woman in such a condition it was hardly given to miss baker to read she was well in health miss baker said but pale and silent stricken and for hours motionless very silent miss baker would say she will sit for a whole morning without speaking a word thinkingthinkingthinking yes she had something of which to think it was no wonder that she should sit silent  and then after a while he went down to hadley and saw her  caroline my cousin he said to her  george george and then she turned her face from him and sobbed violently they were the first tears she had shed since the news had reached her  she did feel in very deed that the mans blood was on her head but for her would he not be sitting among the proud ones of the land had she permitted him to walk his own course by himself would this utter destruction have come upon him or having sworn to cherish him as his wife had she softened her heart towards him would this deed have been done no fifty times a day she would ask herself the question and as often would she answer it by the same words the mans blood was upon her head  for many a long day bertram said nothing to her of her actual state of existence he spoke neither of her past life as a wife nor her present life as a widow the name of that man whom living they had both despised and hated was never mentioned between them during all these months  and yet he was frequently with her he was with her aunt rather and thus she became used to have him sitting in the room beside her when in her presence he would talk of their moneymatters of the old man and his will in which luckily the name of sir henry harcourt was not mentioned and at last they brought themselves to better subjects higher hopeshopes that might yet be high and solace that was trustworthy in spite of all that was come and gone  and she would talk to him of himself of himself as divided from her in all things except in cousinhood and at her instigation he again put himself to work in the dusky purlieus of chancery lane mr die had now retired and drank his port and counted his per cents in the blessed quiet of his evening days but a gamaliel was not wanting and george sat himself down once more in the porch we may be sure that he did not sit altogether in vain  and then adelamrs wilkinson we should now call hervisited the two ladies in their silent retirement at hadley what words were uttered between her and lady harcourt were heard by no other human ear but they were not uttered without effect she who had been so stricken could dare again to walk to church and bear the eyes of the little world around her she would again walk forth and feel the sun and know that the fields were green and that the flowers were sweet and that praises were to be sung to godfor his mercy endureth for ever  it was five years after that night in eaton square when george bertram again asked herher who had once been caroline waddingtonto be his wife but sweet ladies sweetest fairest maidens there were no soft honey words of love then spoken no happy eager vows which a novelist may repeat hoping to move the soft sympathy of your bosoms it was a cold sad dreary matter that offer of his her melancholy silent acquiescence and that marriage in hadley church at which none were present but adela and arthur and miss baker  it was adela who arranged it and the result has shown that she was right they now live together very quietly very soberly but yet happily they have not adelas blessings no baby lies in carolines arms no noisy boy climbs on the arm of george bertrams chair their house is childless and very very quiet but they are not unhappy  reader can you call to mind what was the plan of life which caroline waddington had formed in the boldness of her young heart can you remember the aspirations of george bertram as he sat upon the mount of olives watching the stones of the temple over against him
