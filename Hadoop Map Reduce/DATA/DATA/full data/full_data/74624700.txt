74624700	the landlord at lions head  by william dean howells     part i   bibliographical  in those dim recesses of the consciousness where things have their beginning if ever things have a beginning i suppose the origin of this novel may be traced to a fact of a fortnights sojourn on the western shore of lake champlain in the summer of 1891 across the water in the state of vermont i had constantly before my eyes a majestic mountain form which the earlier french pioneers had named le lion couchant but which their plainerminded yankee successors preferred to call the camels hump it really looked like a sleeping lion the head was especially definite and when in the course of some ten years i found the scheme for a story about a summer hotel which i had long meant to write this image suggested the name of the landlord at lions head i gave the title to my unwritten novel at once and never wished to change it but rejoiced in the certainty that whatever the novel turned out to be the title could not be better  i began to write the story four years later when we were settled for the winter in our flat on central park and as i was a year in doing it with other things i must have taken the unfinished manuscript to and from magnolia massachusetts and long beach long island where i spent the following summer it was first serialized in harpers weekly and in the london illustrated news as well as in an australian newspaperi forget which one and it was published as a completed book in 1896  i remember concerning it a very becoming despair when at a certain moment in it i began to wonder what i was driving at i have always had such moments in my work and if i cannot fitly boast of them i can at least own to them in freedom from the pride that goes before a fall my only resource at such times was to keep working keep beating harder and harder at the wall which seemed to close me in till at last i broke through into the daylight beyond in this case i had really such a very good grip of my characters that i need not have had the usual fear of their failure to work out their destiny but even when the thing was done and i carried the completed manuscript to my dear old friend the late henry loomis nelson then editor of the weekly it was in more fear of his judgment than i cared to show as often happened with my manuscript in such exigencies it seemed to go all to a handful of shrivelled leaves when we met again and he accepted it for the weekly with a handclasp of hearty welcome i could scarcely gasp out my unfeigned relief we had talked the scheme of it over together he had liked the notion and he easily made me believe after my first dismay that he liked the result even better  i myself liked the hero of the tale more than i have liked worthier men perhaps because i thought i had achieved in him a true rustic new england type in contact with urban life under entirely modern conditions what seemed to me my esthetic success in him possibly softened me to his ethical shortcomings but i do not expect others to share my weakness for jeff durgin whose strong rough surname had been waiting for his personality ever since i had got it off the side of an icecart many years before  at the time the story was imagined harvard had been for four years much in the direct knowledge of the author and i pleased myself in realizing the heros experience there from even more intimacy with the university moods and manners than had supported me in the studies of an earlier fiction dealing with them i had not lived twelve years in cambridge without acquaintance such as even an elder man must make with the undergraduate life but it is only from its own level that this can be truly learned and i have always been ready to stand corrected by undergraduate experience still i have my belief that as a jaythe word may now be obsoletejeff durgin is not altogether out of drawing though this is of course the phase of his character which is one of the least important what i most prize in him if i may go to the bottom of the inkhorn is the realization of that antipuritan quality which was always vexing the heart of puritanism and which i had constantly felt one of the most interesting facts in my observation of new england  as for the sort of summer hotel portrayed in these pages it was materialized from an acquaintance with summer hotels extending over quarter of a century and scarcely to be surpassed if paralleled i had a passion for knowing about them and understanding their operation which i indulged at every opportunity and which i remember was satisfied as to every reasonable detail at one of the pleasantest seaside hostelries by one of the most intelligent and obliging of landlords yet hotels for hotels i was interested in those of the hills rather than those of the shores  i worked steadily if not rapidly at the story often i went back over it and tore it to pieces and put it together again it made me feel at times as if i should never learn my trade but so did every novel i have written every novel in fact has been a new trade in the case of this one the publishers were hurrying me in the revision for copy to give the illustrator who was hurrying his pictures for the english and australian serializations  kittery point maine july 1909     the landlord at lions head     i  if you looked at the mountain from the west the line of the summit was wandering and uncertain like that of most mountaintops but seen from the east the mass of granite showing above the dense forests of the lower slopes had the form of a sleeping lion the flanks and haunches were vaguely distinguished from the mass but the mighty head resting with its tossed mane upon the vast paws stretched before it was boldly sculptured against the sky the likeness could not have been more perfect when you had it in profile if it had been a definite intention of art and you could travel far north and far south before the illusion vanished in winter the head was blotted by the snows and sometimes the vagrant clouds caught upon it and deformed it or hid it at other seasons but commonly after the last snow went in the spring until the first snow came in the fall the lions head was a part of the landscape as imperative and importunate as the great stone face itself  long after other parts of the hill country were opened to summer sojourn the region of lions head remained almost primitively solitary and savage a stony mountain road followed the bed of the torrent that brawled through the valley at its base and at a certain point a still rougher lane climbed from the road along the side of the opposite height to a lonely farmhouse pushed back on a narrow shelf of land with a meagre acreage of field and pasture broken out of the woods that clothed all the neighboring steeps the farmhouse level commanded the best view of lions head and the visitors always mounted to it whether they came on foot or arrived on buckboards or in buggies or drove up in the concord stages from the farther and nearer hotels the drivers of the coaches rested their horses there and watered them from the spring that dripped into the green log at the barn the passengers scattered about the dooryard to look at the lions head to wonder at it and mock at it according to their several makes and moods they could scarcely have felt that they ever had a welcome from the stalwart handsome woman who sold them milk if they wanted it and small cakes of maple sugar if they were very strenuous for something else the ladies were not able to make much of her from the first but some of them asked her if it were not rather lonely there and she said that when you heard the catamounts scream at night and the bears growl in the spring it did seem lonesome when one of them declared that if she should hear a catamount scream or a bear growl she should die the woman answered well she presumed we must all die some time but the ladies were not sure of a covert slant in her words for they were spoken with the same look she wore when she told them that the milk was five cents a glass and the black maple sugar three cents a cake she did not change when she owned upon their urgence that the gaunt man whom they glimpsed around the corners of the house was her husband and the three lank boys with him were her sons that the children whose faces watched them through the writhing window panes were her two little girls that the urchin who stood shyly twisted all but his white head and sunburned face into her dress and glanced at them with a mocking blue eye was her youngest and that he was three years old with like coldness of voice and face she assented to their conjecture that the space walled off in the farther corner of the orchard was the family burial ground and she said with no more feeling that the ladies could see than she had shown concerning the other facts that the graves they saw were those of her husbands family and of the children she had lost there had been ten children and she had lost four she did not visibly shrink from the pursuit of the sympathy which expressed itself in curiosity as to the sickness they had died of the ladies left her with the belief that they had met a character and she remained with the conviction briefly imparted to her husband that they were tonguey  the summer folks came more and more every year with little variance in the impression on either side when they told her that her maple sugar would sell better if the cake had an image of lions head stamped on it she answered that she got enough of lions head without wanting to see it on all the sugar she made but the next year the cakes bore a rude effigy of lions head and she said that one of her boys had cut the stamp out with his knife she now charged five cents a cake for the sugar but her manner remained the same it did not change when the excursionists drove away and the deep silence native to the place fell after their chatter when a cock crew or a cow lowed or a horse neighed or one of the boys shouted to the cattle an echo retorted from the granite base of lions head and then she had all the noise she wanted or at any rate all the noise there was most of the time now and then a wagon passed on the stony road by the brook in the valley and sent up its clatter to the farmhouse on its high shelf but there was scarcely another break from the silence except when the coachingparties came  the continuous clash and rush of the brook was like a part of the silence as the red of the farmhouse and the barn was like a part of the green of the fields and woods all round them the blackgreen of pines and spruces the yellowgreen of maples and birches dense to the tops of the dreary hills and breaking like a bated sea around the lions head the farmer stooped at his work with a thin inwardcurving chest but his wife stood straight at hers and she had a massive beauty of figure and a heavily moulded regularity of feature that impressed such as had eyes to see her grandeur among the summer folks she was forty when they began to come and an ashen gray was creeping over the reddish heaps of her hair like the pallor that overlies the crimson of the autumnal oak she showed her age earlier than most fair people but since her marriage at eighteen she had lived long in the deaths of the children she had lost they were born with the taint of their fathers family and they withered from their cradles the youngest boy alone of all her brood seemed to have inherited her health and strength the rest as they grew up began to cough as she had heard her husbands brothers and sisters cough and then she waited in hapless patience the fulfilment of their doom the two little girls whose faces the ladies of the first coachingparty saw at the farmhouse windows had died away from them two of the lank boys had escaped and in the perpetual exile of california and colorado had saved themselves alive their father talked of going too but ten years later he still dragged himself spectrally about the labors of the farm with the same cough at sixty which made his oldest son at twentynine look scarcely younger than himself     ii  one soft noon in the middle of august the farmer came in from the cornfield that an early frost had blighted and told his wife that they must give it up he said in his weak hoarse voice with the catarrhal catching in it that it was no use trying to make a living on the farm any longer the oats had hardly been worth cutting and now the corn was gone and there was not hay enough without it to winter the stock if they got through themselves they would have to live on potatoes have a vendue and sell out everything before the snow flew and let the state take the farm and get what it could for it and turn over the balance that was left after the taxes the interest of the savingsbank mortgage would soon eat that up  the long loose cough took him and another cough answered it like an echo from the barn where his son was giving the horses their feed the mild waneyed young man came round the corner presently toward the porch where his father and mother were sitting and at the same moment a boy came up the lane to the other corner there were sixteen years between the ages of the brothers who alone were left of the children born into and borne out of the house the young man waited till they were within whispering distance of each other and then he gasped where you been  the boy answered promptly none your business and went up the steps before the young man with a lopeared livercolored mongrel at his heels he pulled off his ragged straw hat and flung it on the floor of the porch dinner over he demanded  his father made no answer his mother looked at the boys hands and face all of much the same earthen cast up to the eaves of his thatch of yellow hair and said you go and wash yourself at a certain light in his mothers eye which he caught as he passed into the house with his dog the boy turned and cut a defiant caper the oldest son sat down on the bench beside his father and they all looked in silence at the mountain before them they heard the boy whistling behind the house with sputtering and blubbering noises as if he were washing his face while he whistled and then they heard him singing with a muffled sound and sharp breaks from the muffled sound as if he were singing into the towel he shouted to his dog and threatened him and the scuffling of his feet came to them through all as if he were dancing  been after them woodchucks agin his father huskily suggested  i guess so said the mother the brother did not speak he coughed vaguely and let his head sink forward  the father began a statement of his affairs  the mother said you dont want to go into that we been all over it before if its come to the pinch now its come but you want to be sure  the man did not answer directly if we could sell off now and get out to where jim is in californy and get a piece of land he stopped as if confronted with some difficulty which he had met before but had hoped he might not find in his way this time  his wife laughed grimly i guess if the truth was known were too poor to get away  were poor he whispered back he added with a weak obstinacy i dknow as were as poor as that comes to the things would fetch something  enough to get us out there and then we should be on jims hands said the woman  we should till spring maybe i dknow as i want to face another winter here and i dknow as jackson does  the young man gasped back courageously i guess i can get along here well enough  its made jim ten years younger thats what he said urged the father  the mother smiled as grimly as she had laughed i dont believe it ll make you ten years richer and thats what you want  i dont believe but what we should ha done something with the place by spring or the state would the father said lifelessly  the voice of the boy broke in upon them from behind say mother ant you never goin to have dinner he was standing in the doorway with a startling cleanness of the hands and face and a strange wet sleekness of the hair his clothes were bedrabbled down the front with soap and water  his mother rose and went toward him his father and brother rose like apparitions and slanted after her at one angle  say the boy called again to his mother there comes a peddler he pointed down the road at the figure of a man briskly ascending the lane toward the house with a pack on his back and some strange appendages dangling from it  the woman did not look round neither of the men looked round they all kept on indoors and she said to the boy as she passed him i got no time to waste on peddlers you tell him we dont want anything  the boy waited for the figure on the lane to approach it was the figure of a young man who slung his burden lightly from his shoulders when he arrived and then stood looking at the boy with his foot planted on the lowermost tread of the steps climbing from the ground to the porch     iii  the boy must have permitted these advances that he might inflict the greater disappointment when he spoke we dont want anything he said insolently  dont you the stranger returned i do i want dinner go in and tell your mother and then show me where i can wash my hands  the bold ease of the stranger seemed to daunt the boy and he stood irresolute his dog came round the corner of the house at the first word of the parley and while his master was making up his mind what to do he smelled at the strangers legs well you cant have any dinner said the boy tentatively the dog raised the bristles on his neck and showed his teeth with a snarl the stranger promptly kicked him in the jaw and the dog ran off howling come here sir the boy called to him but the dog vanished round the house with a fading yelp  now young man said the stranger will you go and do as youre bid im ready to pay for my dinner and you can say so the boy stared at him slowly taking in the facts of his costume with eyes that climbed from the heavy shoes up the legs of his thickribbed stockings and his knickerbockers past the pleats and belt of his norfolk jacket to the red neckcloth tied under the loose collar of his flannel outingshirt and so by his face with its soft young beard and its quiet eyes to the top of his braidless bandless slouch hat of soft felt it was one of the earliest costumes of the kind that had shown itself in the hill country and it was altogether new to the boy come said the wearer of it dont stand on the order of your going but go at once and he sat down on the steps with his back to the boy who heard these strange terms of command with a face of vague envy  the noonday sunshine lay in a thin silvery glister on the slopes of the mountain before them and in the brilliant light the colossal forms of the lions head were prismatically outlined against the speckless sky through the silvery veil there burned here and there on the densely wooded acclivities the crimson torch of a maple kindled before its time but everywhere else there was the unbroken green of the forest subdued to one tone of gray the boy heard the stranger fetch his breath deeply and then expel it in a long sigh before he could bring himself to obey an order that seemed to leave him without the choice of disobedience he came back and found the stranger as he had left him come on if you want your dinner he said and the stranger rose and looked at him  whats your name he asked  thomas jefferson durgin  well thomas jefferson durgin will you show me the way to the pump and bring a towel along  want to wash  i havent changed my mind  come along then the boy made a movement as if to lead the way indoors the stranger arrested him  here take hold of this and put it out of the rush of travel somewhere he lifted his burden from where he had dropped it in the road and swung it toward the boy who ran down the steps and embraced it as he carried it toward a corner of the porch he felt of the various shapes and materials in it  then he said come on again and went before the guest through the dim hall running midway of the house to the door at the rear he left him on a narrow space of stone flagging there and ran with a tin basin to the spring at the barn and brought it back to him full of the cold water  towel he said pulling at the family roller inside the little porch at the door and he watched the stranger wash his hands and face and then search for a fresh place on the towel  before the stranger had finished the father and the elder brother came out and after an ineffectual attempt to salute him slanted away to the barn together the woman indoors was more successful when he found her in the diningroom where the boy showed him the table was set for him alone and it affected him as if the family had been hurried away from it that he might have it to himself everything was very simple the iron forks had two prongs the knives bone handles the dull glass was pressed the heavy plates and cups were white but so was the cloth and all were clean the woman brought in a good boiled dinner of cornedbeef potatoes turnips and carrots from the kitchen and a teapot and said something about having kept them hot on the stove for him she brought him a plate of biscuit fresh from the oven then she said to the boy you come out and have your dinner with me jeff and left the guest to make his meal unmolested  the room was square with two north windows that looked down the lane he had climbed to the house an open door led into the kitchen in an ell and a closed door opposite probably gave access to a parlor or a groundfloor chamber the windows were darkened down to the lower sash by green paper shades the walls were papered in a pattern of brown roses over the chimney hung a large picture a lifesize pencildrawing of two little girls one slightly older and slightly larger than the other each with round eyes and precise ringlets and with her hand clasped in the others hand  the guest seemed helpless to take his gaze from it and he sat fallen back in his chair at it when the woman came in with a pie  thank you i believe i dont want any dessert he said the fact is the dinner was so good that i havent left any room for pie are those your children  yes said the woman looking up at the picture with the pie in her hand theyre the last two i lost  oh excuse me the guest began  its the way they appear in the spirit life its a spirit picture  oh i thought there was something strange about it  well its a good deal like the photograph we had taken about a year before they died its a good likeness they say they dont change a great deal at first  she seemed to refer the point to him for his judgment but he answered wide of it  i came up here to paint your mountain if you dont mind mrs durginlions head i mean  oh yes well i dont know as we could stop you if you wanted to take it away a spare glimmer lighted up her face  the painter rejoined in kind the town might have something to say i suppose  not if you was to leave a good piece of intervale in place of it weve got mountains to spare  well then thats arranged what about a weeks board  i guess you can stay if youre satisfied  ill be satisfied if i can stay how much do you want  the woman looked down probably with an inward anxiety between the fear of asking too much and the folly of asking too little she said tentatively some of the folks that come over from the hotels say they pay as much as twenty dollars a week  but you dont expect hotel prices  i dont know as i do weve never had anybody before  the stranger relaxed the frown he had put on at the greed of her suggestion it might have come from ignorance or mere innocence im in the habit of paying five dollars for farm board where i stay several weeks what do you say to seven for a single week  i guess that ll do said the woman and she went out with the pie which she had kept in her hand     iv  the painter went round to the front of the house and walked up and down before it for different points of view he ran down the lane some way and then came back and climbed to the sloping field behind the barn where he could look at lions head over the roof of the house he tried an open space in the orchard where he backed against the wall enclosing the little burialground he looked round at it without seeming to see it and then went back to the level where the house stood this is the place he said to himself but the boy who had been lurking after him with the dog lurking at his own heels in turn took the words as a proffer of conversation  i thought youd come to it he sneered  did you asked the painter with a smile for the unsatisfied grudge in the boys tone why didnt you tell me sooner  the boy looked down and apparently made up his mind to wait until something sufficiently severe should come to him for a retort want i should help you get your things he asked presently  why yes said the painter with a glance of surprise i shall be much obliged for a lift he started toward the porch where his burden lay and the boy ran before him they jointly separated the knapsack from the things tied to it and the painter let the boy carry the easel and campstool which developed themselves from their folds and hinges and brought the colors and canvas himself to the spot he had chosen the boy looked at the tag on the easel after it was placed and read the name on itjere westover thats a funny name  im glad it amuses you said the owner of it  again the boy cast down his eyes discomfited and seemed again resolving silently to bide his time and watch for another chance  westover forgot him in the fidget he fell into trying this and that effect with his head slanted one way and then slanted the other his hand held up to shut out the mountain below the granite mass of lions head and then changed to cut off the sky above and then both hands lifted in parallel to confine the picture he made some tentative scrawls on his canvas in charcoal and he wasted so much time that the light on the mountainside began to take the rich tone of the afternoon deepening to evening a soft flush stole into it the sun dipped behind the top south of the mountain and lions head stood out against the intense clearness of the west which began to be flushed with exquisite suggestions of violet and crimson  good lord said westover and he flew at his colors and began to paint he had got his canvas into such a state that he alone could have found it much more intelligible than his palette when he heard the boy saying over his shoulder i dont think that looks very much like it he had last been aware of the boy sitting at the grassy edge of the lane tossing small bits of earth and pebble across to his dog which sat at the other edge and snapped at them then he lost consciousness of him he answered dreamily while he found a tint he was trying for with his brush perhaps you dont know he was so sure of his effect that the popular censure speaking in the boys opinion only made him happier in it  i know what i see said the boy  i doubt it said westover and then he lost consciousness of him again he was rapt deep and far into the joy of his work and had no thought but for that and for the dim question whether it would be such another day tomorrow with that light again on lions head when he was at last sensible of a noise that he felt he must have been hearing some time without noting it it was a lamentable sound of screaming as of some one in mortal terror mixed with wild entreaties oh dont jeff oh dont dont dont oh please oh do let us be oh jeff dont  westover looked round bewildered and not able amid the clamor of the echoes to make out where the cries came from then down at the point where the lane joined the road to the southward and the road lost itself in the shadow of a woodland he saw the boy leaping back and forth across the track with his dog beside him he was shouting and his dog barking furiously those screams and entreaties came from within the shadow westover plunged down the lane headlong with a speed that gathered at each bound and that almost flung him on his face when he reached the level where the boy and the dog were dancing back and forth across the road then he saw crouching in the edge of the wood a little girl who was uttering the appeals he had heard and clinging to her with a face of frantic terror a child of five or six years her cries had grown hoarse and had a hard mechanical action as they followed one another they were really in no danger for the boy held his dog tight by his collar and was merely delighting himself with their terror  the painter hurled himself upon him and with a quick grip upon his collar gave him half a dozen flathanded blows wherever he could plant them and then flung him reeling away  you infernal little ruffian he roared at him and the sound of his voice was enough for the dog he began to scale the hillside toward the house without a moments stay  the children still crouched together and westover could hardly make them understand that they were in his keeping when he bent over them and bade them not be frightened the little girl set about wiping the childs eyes on her apron in a motherly fashion her own were dry enough and westover fancied there was more of fury than of fright in her face she seemed lost to any sense of his presence and kept on talking fiercely to herself while she put the little boy in order like an indignant woman  great mean ugly thing ill tell the teacher on him thats what i will as soon as ever school begins ill see if he can come round with that dog of his scaring folks i wouldnt a been a bit afraid if it hadnt a been for franky dont cry any more franky dont you see theyre gone i presume he thinks it smart to scare a little boy and a girl if i was a boy once id show him  she made no sign of gratitude to westover as far as any recognition from her was concerned his intervention was something as impersonal as if it had been a thunderbolt falling upon her enemies from the sky  where do you live he asked ill go home with you if youll tell me where you live  she looked up at him in a daze and westover heard the durgin boy saying she lives right there in that little woodcolored house at the other end of the lane there aint no call to go home with her  westover turned and saw the boy kneeling at the edge of a clump of bushes where he must have struck he was rubbing with a tuft of grass at the dirt ground into the knees of his trousers  the little girl turned hawkishly upon him not for anything you can do jeff durgin  the boy did not answer  there she said giving a final pull and twitch to the dress of her brother and taking him by the hand tenderly now come right along franky  let me have your other hand said westover and with the little boy between them they set off toward the point where the lane joined the road on the northward they had to pass the bushes where jeff durgin was crouching and the little girl turned and made a face at him oh oh i dont think i should have done that said westover  i dont care said the little girl but she said in explanation and partial excuse he tries to scare all the girls ill let him know t he cant scare one  westover looked up toward the durgin house with a return of interest in the canvas he had left in the lane on the easel nothing had happened to it at the door of the barn he saw the farmer and his eldest son slanting forward and staring down the hill at the point he had come from mrs durgin was looking out from the shelter of the porch and she turned and went in with jeffs dog at her skirts when westover came in sight with the children     v  westover had his tea with the family but nothing was said or done to show that any of them resented or even knew of what had happened to the boy from him jeff himself seemed to have no grudge he went out with westover when the meal was ended and sat on the steps of the porch with him watching the painter watch the light darken on the lonely heights and in the lonely depths around westover smoked a pipe and the fire gleamed and smouldered in it regularly with his breathing the boy on a lower step pulled at the long ears of his dog and gazed up at him  they were both silent till the painter asked what do you do here when youre not trying to scare little children to death  the boy hung his head and said with the effect of excusing a long arrears of uselessness im goin to school as soon as it commences  theres one branch of your education that i should like to undertake if i ever saw you at a thing like that again dont you feel ashamed of yourself  the boy pulled so hard at the dogs ear that the dog gave a faint yelp of protest  they might a seen that i had him by the collar i want agoin to let go  well the next time i have you by the collar i wont let go either said the painter but he felt an inadequacy in his threat and he imagined a superfluity and he made some haste to ask who are they  whitwell is their name they live in that little house where you took them their fathers got a piece of land on zions head that hes clearin off for the timber their mothers dead and cynthy keeps house shes always makin up names and faces added the boy she thinks herself awful smart that frankys a perfect crybaby  well upon my word you are a little ruffian said westover and he knocked the ashes out of his pipe the next time you meet that poor little creature you tell her that i think youre about the shabbiest chap i know and that i hope the teacher will begin where i left off with you and not leave blackguard enough in you to  he stopped for want of a fitting figure and the boy said i guess the teacher wont touch me  westover rose and the boy flung his dog away from him with his foot want i should show you where to sleep  yes said westover and the boy hulked in before him vanishing into the dark of the interior and presently appeared with a lighted handlamp he led the way upstairs to a front room looking down upon the porch roof and over toward zions head which westover could see dimly outlined against the night sky when he lifted the edge of the paper shade and peered out  the room was neat with greater comfort in its appointments than he hoped for he tried the bed and found it hard but of straw and not the feathers he had dreaded while the boy looked into the waterpitcher to see if it was full and then went out without any form of goodnight  westover would have expected to wash in a tin basin at the back door and wipe on the family towel but all the means of toilet such as they were he found at hand here and a surprise which he had felt at a certain touch in the cooking renewed itself at the intelligent arrangements for his comfort a secondary quilt was laid across the foot of his bed his windowshade was pulled down and though the window was shut and the air stuffy within there was a sense of cleanliness in everything which was not at variance with the closeness  the bed felt fresh when he got into it and the sweet breath of the mountains came in so cold through the sash he had lifted that he was glad to pull the secondary quilt up over him he heard the clock tick in some room below from another quarter came the muffled sound of coughing but otherwise the world was intensely still and he slept deep and long     vi  the men folks had finished their breakfast and gone to their farmwork hours before westover came down to his breakfast but the boy seemed to be of as much early leisure as himself and was lounging on the threshold of the back door with his dog in waiting upon him he gave the effect of yesterdays cleanliness freshened up with more recent soap and water at the moment westover caught sight of him he heard his mother calling to him from the kitchen well now come in and get your breakfast jeff and the boy called to westover in turn ill tell her youre here as he rose and came indoors i guess shes got your breakfast for you  mrs durgin brought the breakfast almost as soon as westover had found his way to the table and she lingered as if for some expression of his opinion upon it the biscuit and the butter were very good and he said so the eggs were fresh and the hash from yesterdays cornedbeef could not have been better and he praised them but he was silent about the coffee  it ant very good she suggested  why im used to making my own coffee i lived so long in a country where its nearly the whole of breakfast that i got into the habit of it and i always carry my little machine with me but i dont like to bring it out unless  unless you cant stand the other folkss said the woman with a humorous gleam well you neednt mind me i want you should have good coffee and i guess i ant too old to learn if you want to show me our folks dont care for it much they like tea and i kind of got out of the way of it but at home we had to have it she explained to his inquiring glance  my father kept the tavern on the old road to st albans on the other side of lions head thats where i always lived till i married here  oh said westover and he felt that she had proudly wished to account for a quality which she hoped he had noticed in her cooking he thought she might be going to tell him something more of herself but she only said well any time you want to show me your way of makin coffee and went out of the room  that evening which was the close of another flawless day he sat again watching the light outside when he saw her come into the hallway with a large shadelamp in her hand she stopped at the door of a room he had not seen yet and looked out at him to ask  wont you come in and set in the parlor if you want to  he found her there when he came in and her two sons with her the younger was sleepily putting away some schoolbooks and the elder seemed to have been helping him with his lessons  hes got to begin school next week she said to westover and at the preparations the other now began to make with a piece of paper and a planchette which he had on the table before him she asked in the halfmocking halfdeprecating way which seemed characteristic of her you believe any in that  i dont know that ive ever seen it work said the painter  well sometimes it wont work she returned altogether mockingly now and sat holding her shapely hands which were neither so large nor so rough as they might have been across her middle and watching her son while the machine pushed about under his palm and he bent his wan eyes upon one of the ovalframed photographs on the wall as if rapt in a supernal vision the boy stared drowsily at the planchette jerking this way and that and making abrupt starts and stops at last the young man lifted his palm from it and put it aside to study the hieroglyphics it had left on the paper  whats it say asked his mother  the young man whispered i cant seem to make out very clear i guess i got to take a little time to it he added leaning back wearily in his chair ever seen much of the manifestations he gasped at westover  never any before said the painter with a leniency for the invalid which he did not feel for his belief  the young man tried for his voice and found enough of it to say theres a trance medium over at the huddle her control says t i can develop into a writin medium he seemed to refer the fact as a sort of question to westover who could think of nothing to say but that it must be very interesting to feel that one had such a power  i guess he dont know hes got it yet his mother interposed and planchette dont seem to know either  we hant given it a fair trial yet said the young man impartially almost impassively  wouldnt you like to see it do some of your sums jeff said the mother to the drowsy boy blinking in a corner you better go to bed  the elder brother rose i guess ill go too  the father had not joined their circle in the parlor now breaking up by common consent  mrs durgin took up her lamp again and looked round on the appointments of the room as if she wished westover to note them too the drab wallpaper the stiff chairs the long hard sofa in haircloth the high bureau of mahogany veneer  you can come in here and set or lay down whenever you feel like it she said we use it more than folks generally i presume we got in the habit havin it open for funerals     vii  four or five days of perfect weather followed one another and westover worked hard at his picture in the late afternoon light he had chosen for it in the morning he tramped through the woods and climbed the hills with jeff durgin who seemed never to do anything about the farm and had a leisure unbroken by anything except a rare call from his mother to help her in the house he built the kitchen fire and got the wood for it he picked the belated pease and the early beans in the garden and shelled them on the monday when the school opened he did a share of the family wash which seemed to have been begun before daylight and westover saw him hanging out the clothes before he started off with his books he suffered no apparent loss of selfrespect in these employments and while he still had his days free he put himself at westovers disposal with an effect of unimpaired equality he had expected evidently that westover would want to fish or shoot or at least join him in the hunt for woodchucks which he still carried on with abated zeal for lack of his company when the painter sat down to sketch certain bits that struck him when he found that westover cared for nothing in the way of sport as people commonly understand it he did not openly contemn him he helped him get the flowers he studied and he learned to know true mushrooms from him though he did not follow his teaching in eating the toadstools as his mother called them when they brought them home to be cooked  if it could not be said that he shared the affection which began to grow up in westover from their companionship there could be no doubt of the interest he took in him though it often seemed the same critical curiosity which appeared in the eye of his dog when it dwelt upon the painter fox had divined in his way that westover was not only not to be molested but was to be respectfully tolerated yet no gleam of kindness ever lighted up his face at sight of the painter he never wagged his tail in recognition of him he simply recognized him and no more and he remained passive under westovers advances which he had the effect of covertly referring to jeff when the boy was by for his approval or disapproval when he was not by the dogs manner implied a reservation of opinion until the facts could be submitted to his master  on the saturday morning which was the last they were to have together the three comrades had strayed from the vague wood road along one of the unexpected levels on the mountain slopes and had come to a standstill in a place which the boy pretended not to know his way out of westover doubted him for he had found that jeff liked to give himself credit for woodcraft by discovering an escape from the depths of trackless wildernesses  i guess you know where we are he suggested  no honestly said the boy but he grinned and westover still doubted him  hark whats that he said hushing further speech from him with a motion of his hand it was the sound of an axe  oh i know where we are said jeff its that canuck chopping in whitwells clearing come along  he led the way briskly down the mountainside now stopping from time to time and verifying his course by the sound of the axe this came and went and byandby it ceased altogether and jeff crept forward with a real or feigned uncertainty suddenly he stopped a voice called heigh there and the boy turned and fled crashing through the underbrush at a tangent with his dog at his heels  westover looked after them and then came forward a lank figure of a man at the foot of a poplar which he had begun to fell stood waiting him one hand on his axehelve and the other on his hip there was the scent of freshly smitten bark and sapwood in the air the ground was paved with broad clean chips  goodmorning said westover  how are you returned the other without moving or making any sign of welcome for a moment but then he lifted his axe and struck it into the carf on the tree and came to meet westover  as he advanced he held out his hand oh youre the one that stopped that fellow that day when he was tryin to scare my children well i thought i should run across you some time he shook hands with westover in token of the gratitude which did not express itself in words how are you treat you pretty well up at the durgins i guess so the old woman knows how to cook anyway jacksons about the best o the lot above ground though i dont know as i know very much against the old man either but that boy i declare i most feel like takin the top of his head off when he gets at his tricks set down  whitwell as westover divined the man to be took a seat himself on a high stump which suited his length of leg and courteously waved westover to a place on the log in front of him a long ragged beard of brown with lines of gray in it hung from his chin and mounted well up on his thin cheeks toward his friendly eyes his mustache lay sunken on his lip which had fallen in with the loss of his upper teeth from the lower jaw a few incisors showed at this slant and that as he talked  well well he said with the air of wishing the talk to go on but without having anything immediately to offer himself  westover said thank you as he dropped on the log and whitwell added relentingly i dont suppose a fellows so much to blame if hes got the devil in him as what the devil is  he referred the point with a twinkle of his eyes to westover who said its always a question of course whether its the devil it may be original sin with the fellow himself  well thats something so said whitwell with pleasure in the distinction rather than assent but i guess it aint original sin in the boy got it from his granfather pootty straight i should say and maybe the old man had it secondhand had to say just where so much cussedness gits statted  his fathers father asked westover willing to humor whitwells evident wish to philosophize the durgins history  mothers he kept the old tavern stand on the west side of lions head on the st albans road and i guess he kept a pootty good house in the old times when the stages stopped with him ever noticed how a man on the mean side in politics always knows how to keep a hotel well its something curious if there was ever a mean side to any question old mason was on it my folks used to live around there and i can remember when i was a boy hangin around the barroom nights hearin him argue that colored folks had no souls and along about the time the fugitiveslave law was passed the folks pootty near run him out o town for puttin the united states marshal on the scent of a fellow that was breakin for canada well it was just so when the war come it was known for a fact that he was in with them secesh devils up over the line that was plannin a raid into vermont in 63 hed got pootty low down by that time railroads took off all the travel tavern d got to be a regular doggery old man always drank some i guess that was a good while after his girl had married durgin he was dead against it and it broke him up considable when she would have him well one night the old stand burnt up and him in it and neither of em insured  whitwell laughed with a pleasure in his satire which gave the monuments in his lower jaw a rather sinister action but as if he felt a rebuke in westovers silence he added there aint anything against mis durgin shes done her part and shes had more than her share of hard knocks if she was tough to stat with shes had blows enough to meller her but thats the way i account for the boy i sposeid oughtnt to feel the way i do about him but hes such a pest to the whole neighborhood that hed have the most popla funel well i guess ive said enough im much obliged to you though mr  westover the painter suggested but the boy isnt so bad all the time  couldnt be said whitwell with a cackle of humorous enjoyment he has his spells of bein decent and hes pootty smart too but when the other spell ketches him its like as if the devil got ahold of him as i said in the first place i lost my wife here twothree years along back and that little girl you see him tormentin shes a regular little mother to her brother and whenever jeff durgin sees her with him seems as if the old scratch got into him well im glad i didnt come across him that day how you gittin along with lions head sets quiet enough for you whitwell rose from the stump and brushed the clinging chips from his thighs folks trouble you any lookin on  not yet said westover  well there aint a great many to said whitwell going back to his axe i should like to see you workin some day do know as i ever saw an attist at it  i should like to have you said westover any time  all right whitwell pulled his axe out of the carf and struck it in again with a force that made a wide square chip leap out he looked over his shoulder at westover who was moving away say stop in some time youre passin i live in that woodcolored house at the foot of the durgins lane     viii  in a little sunken place behind a rock some rods away westover found jeff lurking with his dog both silent and motionless hello he said inquiringly  come back to show you the way said the boy thought you couldnt find it alone  oh why didnt you say youd wait the boy grinned i shouldnt think a fellow like you would want to be afraid of any man even for the fun of scaring a little girl jeff stopped grinning and looked interested as if this was a view of the case that had not occurred to him but perhaps you like to be afraid  i dont know as i do said the boy and westover left him to the question a great part of the way home he did not express any regret or promise any reparation but a few days after that when he had begun to convoy parties of children up to see westover at work in the late afternoon on their way home from school and to show the painter off to them as a sort of family property he once brought the young whitwells he seemed on perfect terms with them now and when the crowd of larger children hindered the little boys view of the picture jeff in his quality of host lifted him under his arms and held him up so that he could look as long as he liked  the girl seemed ashamed of the good understanding before westover jeff offered to make a place for her among the other children who had looked long enough but she pulled the front of her bonnet across her face and said that she did not want to look and caught her brother by the hand and ran away with him westover thought this charming somewhat he liked the intense shyness which the childs intense passion had hidden from him before  jeff acted as host to the neighbors who came to inspect the picture and they all came within a circuit of several miles around and gave him their opinions freely or scantily according to their several temperaments they were mainly favorable though there was some frank criticism too spoken over the painters shoulder as openly as if he were not by there was no question but of likeness all finer facts were far from them they wished to see how good a portrait westover had made and some of them consoled him with the suggestion that the likeness would come out more when the picture got dry  whitwell when he came attempted a larger view of the artists work but apparently more out of kindness for him than admiration of the picture he said he presumed you could not always get a thing like that just right the first time and that you had to keep trying till you did get it but it paid in the end jeff had stolen down from the house with his dog drawn by the fascination which one we have injured always has for us when whitwell suddenly turned upon him and asked jocularly what do you think jeff the boy could only kick his dog and drive it home as a means of hiding his feelings  he brought the teacher to see the picture the last friday before the painter went away she was a coldlooking austere girl pretty enough with eyes that wandered away from the young man although jeff used all his arts to make her feel at home in his presence she pretended to have merely stopped on her way up to see mrs durgin and she did not venture any comment on the painting but when westover asked something about her school she answered him promptly enough as to the number and ages and sexes of the schoolchildren he ventured so far toward a joke with her as to ask if she had much trouble with such a tough subject as jeff and she said he could be good enough when he had a mind if he could get over his teasing she said with the air of reading him a lecture she would not have anything to complain of and jeff looked ashamed but rather of the praise than the blame his humiliation seemed complete when she said finally hes a good scholar  on the tuesday following westover meant to go it was the end of his third week and it had brought him into september the weather since he had begun to paint lions head was perfect for his work but with the long drought it had grown very warm many trees now had flamed into crimson on the hillslopes the yellowing corn in the fields gave out a thin dry sound as the delicate wind stirred the blades but only the sounds and sights were autumnal the heat was oppressive at midday and at night the cold had lost its edge there was no dew and mrs durgin sat out with westover on the porch while he smoked a final pipe there she had come to join him for some fixed purpose apparently and she called to her boy you go to bed jeff as if she wished to be alone with westover the men folks were already in bed he could hear them cough now and then  mr westover the woman began even as she swept her skirts forward before she sat down i want to ask you whether you would let that picture of yours go on part board ill give you back just as much as you say of this money  he looked round and saw that she had in the hand dropped in her lap the bills he had given her after supper  why i couldnt very well mrs durgin he began  i presume youll think im foolish she pursued but i do want that picture i dont know when ive ever wanted a thing more its just like lions head the way ive seen it day in and day out every summer since i come here thirtyfive years ago its beautiful  mrs durgin said westover you gratify me more than i can tell you i wishi wish i could let you have the picture ii dont know what to say  why dont you let me have it then if we ever had to go away from hereif anything happened to usits the one thing i should want to keep and take with me there thats the way i feel about it i cant explain but i do wish youd let me have it  some emotion which did not utter itself in the desire she expressed made her voice shake in the words she held out the banknotes to him and they rustled with the tremor of her hand  mrs durgin i suppose i shall have to be frank with you and you mustnt feel hurt i have to live by my work and i have to get as much as i can for it  thats what i say i dont want to beat you down on it ill give you whatever you think is right its my money and my husband feels just as i do about it she urged  you dont quite understand he said gently i expect to have an exhibition of my pictures in boston this fall and i hope to get two or three hundred dollars for lions head  ive been a proper fool cried the woman and she drew in a long breath  oh dont mind he begged its all right ive never had any offer for a picture that id rather take than yours i know the thing cant be altogether bad after what youve said and ill tell you what ill have it photographed when i get to boston and ill send you a photograph of it  how much will that be mrs durgin asked as if taught caution by her offer for the painting  nothing and if youll accept it and hang it up here somewhere i shall be very glad  thank you said mrs durgin and the meekness the wounded pride he fancied in her touched him  he did not know at first how to break the silence which she let follow upon her words at last he said  you spoke just now about taking it with you of course you dont think of leaving lions head  she did not answer for so long a time that he thought she had not perhaps heard him or heeded what he said but she answered finally we did think of it the day you come we had about made up our minds to leave  oh  but ive been thinkin of something since youve been here that i dont know but youll say is about as wild as wantin to buy a threehundreddollar picture with a weeks board she gave a short selfscornful laugh but it was a laugh and it relieved the tension  it may not be worth any more he said glad of the relief  oh i guess it is she rejoined and then she waited for him to prompt her  well  well its this and i wanted to ask you anyway you think thered be any chance of my gettin summer folks to come here and board if i was to put an advertisement in a boston paper i know its a lonesome place and there aint what you may call attractions but the folks from the hotels sometimes when they ride over in a stage to see the view praise up the scenery and i guess it is sightly i know that well enough and i aint afraid but what i can do for boarders as well as some if not better what do you think  i think thats a capital idea mrs durgin  its that or go she said there aint a livin for us on the farm any more and we got to do somethin if there was anything else i could do but ive thought it out and thought it out and i guess there aint anything i can do but take boardersif i can get them  i should think youd find it rather pleasant on some accounts your boarders would be company for you said westover  were company enough for ourselves said mrs durgin i aint ever been lonesome here from the first minute i guess i had company enough when i was a girl to last me the sort that hotel folks are i presume mr whitwell spoke to you about my father  yes he did mrs durgin  i dont presume he said anything that want true its all right but i know how my mother used to slave and how i used to slave myself and i always said id rather do anything than wait on boarders and now i guess i got to come to it the sight of summer folks makes me sick i guess i could a had em long ago if id wanted to there ive said enough she rose with a sudden lift of her powerful frame and stood a moment as if expecting westover to say something  he said well when youve made your mind up send your advertisement to me and ill attend to it for you  and you wont forget about the picture  no i wont forget that  the next morning he made ready for an early start and in his preparations he had the zealous and even affectionate help of jeff durgin the boy seemed to wish him to carry away the best impression of him or at least to make him forget all that had been sinister or unpleasant in his behavior they had been good comrades since the first evil day they had become good friends even and westover was touched by the boys devotion at parting he helped the painter get his pack together in good shape and he took pride in strapping it on westovers shoulders adjusting and readjusting it with care and fastening it so that all should be safe and snug he lingered about at the risk of being late for school as if to see the last of the painter and he waved his hat to him when westover looked back at the house from half down the lane then he vanished and westover went slowly on till he reached that corner of the orchard where the slanting gravestones of the family burialground showed above the low wall there suddenly a storm burst upon him the air rained apples that struck him on the head the back the side and pelted in violent succession on his knapsack and canvases campstool and easel he seemed assailed by four or five skilful marksmen whose missiles all told  when he could lift his face to look round he heard a shrill accusing voice oh jeff durgin and he saw another storm of apples fly through the air toward the little whitwell girl who dodged and ran along the road below and escaped in the direction of the schoolhouse then the boys face showed itself over the top of one of the gravestones all agrin with joy he waited and watched westover keep slowly on as if nothing had happened and presently he let some apples fall from his hands and walked slowly back to the house with his dog at his heels  when westover reached the level of the road and the shelter of the woods near whitwells house he unstrapped his load to see how much harm had been done to his picture he found it unhurt and before he had got the burden back again he saw jeff durgin leaping along the road toward the schoolhouse whirling his satchel of books about his head and shouting gayly to the girl now hidden by the bushes at the other end of the lane cynthy oh cynthy wait for me i want to tell you something     ix  westover received next spring the copy for an advertisement from mrs durgin which she asked to have him put in some paper for her she said that her son jackson had written it out and westover found it so well written that he had scarcely to change the wording it offered the best of farmboard with plenty of milk and eggs berries and fruit for five dollars a week at lions head farm and it claimed for the farm the merit of the finest view of the celebrated lions head mountain it was signed as her letter was signed mrs j m durgin with her postoffice address and it gave westover as a reference  the letter was in the same handwriting as the advertisement which he took to be that of jackson durgin it enclosed a dollar note to pay for three insertions of the advertisement in the evening transcript and it ended almost casually i do not know as you have heard that my husband james monroe durgin passed to spirit life this spring my son will help me to run the house  this death could not move westover more than it had apparently moved the widow during the three weeks he had passed under his roof he had scarcely exchanged three words with james monroe durgin who remained to him an impression of large round dullblue eyes a stubbly upper lip and cheeks and chin tagged with coarse haycolored beard the impression was so largely the impression that he had kept of the dullblue eyes and the gaunt slanted figure of andrew jackson durgin that he could not be very distinct in his sense of which was now the presence and which the absence he remembered with an effort that the sons beard was strawcolored but he had to make no effort to recall the robust effect of mrs durgin and her youngest son he wondered now as he had often wondered before whether she knew of the final violence which had avenged the boy for the prolonged strain of repression jeff had inflicted upon himself during westovers stay at the farm after several impulses to go back and beat him to follow him to school and expose him to the teacher to write to his mother and tell her of his misbehavior westover had decided to do nothing as he had come off unhurt in person and property he could afford to be more generously amused than if he had suffered damage in either the more he thought of the incident the more he was disposed to be lenient with the boy whom he was aware of having baffled and subdued by his superior wit and virtue in perhaps intolerable measure he could not quite make out that it was an act of bad faith there was no reason to think that the goodnatured things the fellow had done the constant little offices of zeal and friendliness were less sincere than this violent outbreak  the letter from lions head farm brought back his three weeks there very vividly and made westover wish he was going there for the summer but he was going over to france for an indefinite period of work in the only air where he believed modern men were doing good things in the right way he w a sale in the winter and he had sold pictures enough to provide the means for this sojourn abroad though his lions head mountain had not brought the two hundred and fifty or three hundred dollars he had hoped for it brought only a hundred and sixty but the time had almost come already when westover thought it brought too much now the letter from mrs durgin reminded him that he had never sent her the photograph of the picture which he had promised her he encased the photograph at once and wrote to her with many avowals of contrition for his neglect and strong regret that he was not soon to see the original of the painting again he paid a decent reverence to the bereavement she had suffered and he sent his regards to all especially his comrade jeff whom he advised to keep out of the appleorchard  five years later westover came home in the first week of a gasping august whose hot breath thickened round the cunarder before she got halfway up the harbor he waited only to see his pictures through the customhouse and then he left for the mountains the mountains meant lions head for him and eight hours after he was dismounting from the train at a station on the road which had been pushed through on a new line within four miles of the farm it was called lions head house now as he read on the side of the mountainwagon which he saw waiting at the platform and he knew at a glance that it was jeff durgin who was coming forward to meet him and take his handbag  the boy had been the prophecy of the man in even a disappointing degree westover had fancied him growing up to the height of his father and brother but jeff durgins stalwart frame was notable for strength rather than height he could not have been taller than his mother whose stature was above the standard of her sex but he was massive without being bulky his chest was deep his square shoulders broad his powerful legs bore him with a backward bulge of the calves that showed through his shapely trousers he caught up the trunks and threw them into the baggagewagon with a swelling of the muscles on his short thick arms which pulled his coatsleeves from his heavy wrists and broad short hands  he had given one of these to westover to shake when they met but with something conditional in his welcome and with a look which was not so much furtive as latent the thatch of yellow hair he used to wear was now cropped close to his skull which was a sort of duncolor and it had some drops of sweat along the lighter edge where his hat had shaded his forehead he put his hat on the seat between himself and westover and drove away from the station bareheaded to cool himself after his bout with the baggage which was following more slowly in its wagon there was a good deal of it and there were half a dozen peoplewomen of coursegoing to lions head house westover climbed to the place beside jeff to let them have the other two seats to themselves and to have a chance of talking but the ladies had to be quieted in their several anxieties concerning their baggage and the letters and telegrams they had sent about their rooms before they settled down to an exchange of apprehensions among themselves and left jeff durgin free to listen to westover  i dont know but i ought to have telegraphed you that i was coming westover said but i couldnt realize that you were doing things on the hotel scale perhaps you wont have room for me  guess we can put you up said jeff  no chance of getting my old room i suppose  i shouldnt wonder if theres any one in it i guess mother could change em  is that so asked westover with a liking for being liked which his tone expressed how is your mother  jeff seemed to think a moment before he answered  just exactly the same  a little older  not as i can see  does she hate keeping a hotel as badly as she expected  thats what she says answered jeff with a twinkle all the time while he was talking with westover he was breaking out to his horses which he governed with his voice trotting them up hill and down and walking them on the short infrequent levels in the mountain fashion  westover almost feared to ask and how is jackson  firstratethat is for him hes as well as ever he was i guess and he dont appear a day older youve changed some said jeff with a look round at westover  yes im twentynine now and i wear a heavier beard westover noticed that jeff was clean shaved of any sign of an approaching beard and artistically he rejoiced in the fellows young manly beauty which was very regular and sculpturesque youre about eighteen  nearer nineteen  is jackson as much interested in the other world as he used to be  spirits  yes  i guess he keeps it up with mr whitwell he dont say much about it at home he keeps all the books and helps mother run the house she couldnt very well get along without him  and where do you come in  well i look after the transportation said jeff with a nod toward his horseswhen im at home that is ive been at the academy in lovewell the last three winters and that means a good piece of the summer too first and last but i guess ill let mother talk to you about that  all right said westover what i dont know about education isnt worth knowing  jeff laughed and said to the off horse which seemed to know that he was meant get up there  and cynthia is cynthia at home westover asked  yes theyre all down in the little woodcolored house yet cynthia teaches winters and summers she helps mother she has charge of the diningroom  does franky cry as much as ever  no franks a fine boy hes in the house too kind of bellboy  and you havent worked mr whitwell in anywhere  well he talks to the ladies and takes parties of em mountainclimbing i guess we couldnt get along without mr whitwell he talks religion to em he cast a mocking glance at westover over his shoulder women seem to like religion whether they belong to church or not  westover laughed and asked and fox hows fox  well said jeff we had to give fox away he was always cross with the boarders children my brother was on from colorado and he took fox back with him  i didnt suppose said westover that i should have been sorry to miss fox but i guess i shall be  jeff seemed to enjoy the implication of his words he wasnt a bad dog he was stupid  when they arrived at the foot of the lane mounting to the farm westover saw what changes had been made in the house there were large additions tasteless and characterless but giving the rooms that were needed there was a vulgar modernity in the new parts expressed with a final intensity in the fourlight windows which are esteemed the last word of domestic architecture in the country jeff said nothing as they approached the house but westover said well youve certainly prospered youre quite magnificent  they reached the old level in front of the house artificially widened out of his remembrance with a white flagpole planted at its edge and he looked up at the front of the house which was unchanged except that it had been built a story higher back of the old front and discovered the window of his old room he could hardly wait to get his greetings over with mrs durgin and jackson who both showed a decorous pleasure and surprise at his coming before he asked  and could you let me have my own room mrs durgin  why yes she said if you dont want something a little nicer  i dont believe youve got anything nicer westover said  all right if you think so she retorted you can have the old room anyway     x  westover could not have said he felt very much at home on his first sojourn at the farm or that he had cared greatly for the durgins but now he felt very much at home and as if he were in the hands of friends  it was toward the close of the afternoon that he arrived and he went in promptly to the meal that was served shortly after he found that the farmhouse had not evolved so far in the direction of a hotel as to have reached the stage of a late dinner it was tea that he sat down to but when he asked if there were not something hot after listening to a catalogue of the cold meats the spectacled waitress behind his chair demanded with the air of putting him on his honor  you among those that came this afternoon  westover claimed to be of the new arrivals  well then you can have steak or chops and baked potatoes  he found the steak excellent though succinct and he looked round in the distinction it conferred upon him on the older guests who were served with cold ham tongue and cornedbeef he had expected to be appointed his place by cynthia whitwell but jeff came to the diningroom with him and showed him to the table he occupied with an effect of doing him special credit  from his impressions of the berries the cream the toast and the tea as well as the steak he decided that on the gastronomic side there could be no question but the durgins knew how to keep a hotel and his further acquaintance with the house and its appointments confirmed him in his belief all was very simple but sufficient and no guest could have truthfully claimed that he was stinted in towels in water in lamplight in the quantity or quality of bedding in hooks for clothes or wardrobe or bureau room westover made mrs durgin his sincere compliments on her success as they sat in the old parlor which she had kept for herself much in its former state and she accepted them with simple satisfaction  but i dont know as i should ever had the courage to try it if it hadnt been for you happening along just when you did she said  then im the founder of your fortunes  if you want to call them fortunes we dont complain its been a fight but i guess weve got the best of it the house is full and were turnin folks away i guess they cant say that at the big hotels they used to drive over from to see lions head at the farm she gave a low comfortable chuckle and told westover of the struggle they had made it was an interesting story and pathetic like all stories of human endeavor the efforts of the most selfish ambition have something of this interest and the struggle of the durgins had the grace of the wish to keep their home  and is jeff as well satisfied as the rest westover asked after other talk and comment on the facts  too much so said mrs durgin i should like to talk with you about jeff mr westover you and him was always such friends  yes said westover i shall be glad if i can be of use to you  why its just this i dont see why jeff shouldnt do something besides keep a hotel  westovers eyes wandered to the photograph of his painting of lions head which hung over the mantelpiece in what he felt to be the place of the greatest honor in the whole house and a sudden fear came upon him that perhaps jeff had developed an artistic talent in the belief of his family but he waited silently to hear  we did think that before we got through the improvements last spring a year ago we should have to get the savingsbank to put a mortgage on the place but we had just enough to start the season with and we thought we would try to pull through we had a splendid season and made money and this year were doin so well that i aint afraid for the future any more and i want to give jeff a chance in the world i want he should go to college  westover felt all the boldness of the aspiration but it was at least not in the direction of art wouldnt you rather miss him in the management  we should some but he would be here the best part of the summer in his vacations and jackson and i are full able to run the house without him  jackson seems very well said westover evasively  hes better hes only thirtyfour years old his father lived to be sixty and he had the same kind jeff tell you he had been at lovewell academy  yes he did  he done well there all his teachers that he ever had mrs durgin went on with the motherpride that soon makes itself tiresome to the listener said jeff done well at school when he had a mind to and at the academy he studied real hard i guess said mrs durgin with her chuckle that he thought that was goin to be the end of it one thing he had to keep up with cynthy and that put him on his pride you seen cynthy yet  no jeff told me she was in charge of the diningroom  i guess im in charge of the whole house said mrs durgin cynthys the housekeeper though shes a fine girl and a smart girl said mrs durgin with a visible relenting from some grudge and shell do well wherever you put her she went to the academy the first two winters jeff did weve about scooped in the whole whitwell family frankys here and his fatherswell his fathers kind of philosopher to the lady boarders mrs durgin laughed and westover laughed with her yes i want jeff should go to college and i want he should be a lawyer  westover did not find that he had anything useful to say to this so he said ive no doubt its better than being a painter  im not so sure three hundred dollars for a little thing like that she indicated the photograph of his lions head and she was evidently so proud of it that he reserved for the moment the truth as to the price he had got for the painting i was surprised when you sent me a photograph full as big i dont let every one in here but a good many of the ladies are artists themselvesamateurs i guessand first and last they all want to see it i guess theyll all want to see you mr westover theyll be wild as they call it when they know youre in the house yes i mean jeff shall go to college  bowdoin or dartmouth westover suggested  well i guess youll think im about as forthputting as i was when i wanted you to give me a threehundreddollar picture for a weeks board  i only got a hundred and sixty mrs durgin said westover conscientiously  well its a shame any rate three hundreds the price to all my boarders my if ive told that story once i guess ive told it fifty times  mrs durgin laughed at herself jollily and westover noted how prosperity had changed her it had freed her tongue it has brightened her humor it had cheered her heart she had put on flesh and her stalwart frame was now a far greater bulk than he remembered  well there she said the long and the short of it is i want jeff should go to harvard  he commanded himself to say i dont see why he shouldnt  mrs durgin called out come in jackson and westover looked round and saw the elder son like a gaunt shadow in the doorway ive just got where ive told mr westover where i want jeff should go it dont seem to have cad him off his feet any either  i presume said jackson coming in and sitting lankly down in the feathercushioned rockingchair which his mother pushed toward him with her foot that the expense would be more at harvard than it would at the other colleges  if you want the best you got to pay for it said mrs durgin  i suppose it would cost more westover answered jacksons conjecture i really dont know much about it one hears tremendous stories at boston of the rate of living among the swell students in cambridge people talk of five thousand a year and that sort of thing mrs durgin shut her lips after catching her breath but i fancy that its largely talk i have a friend whose son went through harvard for a thousand a year and i know that many fellows do it for much less  i guess we can manage to let jeff have a thousand a year said mrs durgin proudly and not scrimp very much either  she looked at her elder son who said i dont believe but what we could its more of a question with me what sort of influence jeff would come under there i think hes pretty much spoiled here  now jackson said his mother  ive heard said westover that harvard takes the nonsense out of a man i cant enter into what you say and it isnt my affair but in regard to influence at harvard it depends upon the set jeff is thrown with or throws himself with so at least i infer from what ive heard my friend say of his son there there are hardworking sets loafing sets and fast sets and i suppose it isnt different at harvard in such matters from other colleges  mrs durgin looked a little grave of course she said we dont know anybody at cambridge except some ladies that boarded with us one summer and i shouldnt want to ask any favor of them the trouble would be to get jeff started right  westover surmised a good many things but in the absence of any confidences from the durgins he could not tell just how much jackson meant in saying that jeff was pretty much spoiled or how little at first from mrs durgins prompt protest he fancied that jackson meant that the boy had been overindulged by his mother i understand he said in default of something else to say that the requirements at harvard are pretty severe  hes passed his preliminary examinations said jackson with a touch of hauteur and i guess he can enter this fall if we should so decide hell have some conditions probly but none but what he can work off i guess  then if you wish to have him go to college by all means let him go to harvard i should say its our great university and our oldest im not a college man myself but if i were i should wish to have been a harvard man if jeff has any nonsense in him it will take it out and i dont believe theres anything in harvard as harvard to make him worse  thats what we both think said jackson  ive heard westover continued and he rose and stood while he spoke that harvards like the world a man gets on there on the same terms that he gets on in the world he has to be a man and hed better be a gentleman  mrs durgin still looked serious have you come back to boston for good now do you expect to be there right along  ive taken a studio there yes i expect to be in boston now ive taken to teaching and i fancy i can make a living if jeff comes to cambridge and i can be of any use  we should be ever so much obliged to you said his mother with an air of great relief  not at all i shall be very glad your mountain air is drugging me mrs durgin i shall have to say goodnight or i shall tumble asleep before i get upstairs oh i can find the way i guess this part of the house seems the same he got away from them and with the lamp that jackson gave him found his way to his room a few moments later some one knocked at his door and a boy stood there with a pitcher some icewater mr westover  why is that you franky im glad to see you again how are you  im pretty well said the boy shyly he was a very handsome little fellow of distinctly dignified presence and westover was aware at once that here was not a subject for patronage is there anything else you want mr westover matches or soap or anything he put the pitcher down and gave a keen glance round the room  no everything seems to be here frank said westover  well goodnight said the boy and he slipped out quietly closing the door after him  westover pushed up his window and looked at lions head in the moonlight it slumbered as if with the sleep of centuriesaustere august the moonrays seemed to break and splinter on the outline of the lionshape and left all the mighty mass black below  in the old porch under his window westover heard whispering then you behave yourself jeff durgin came in a voice which could be no other than cynthia whitwells and jeff durgins laugh followed  he saw the girl in the morning she met him at the door of the diningroom and he easily found in her shy proud manner and her pure cold beauty the temperament and physiognomy of the child he remembered she was tall and slim and she held herself straight without stiffness her face was fine with a straight nose and a decided chin and a mouth of the same sweetness which looked from her still gray eyes her hair of the average brown had a rough effect of being quickly tossed into form which pleased him as she slipped down the room before him to place him at table he saw that she was as it were involuntarily unwillingly graceful she made him think of a wild sweetbrier of a hermitthrush but if there were this sort of poetic suggestion in cynthias looks her acts were of plain and honest prose such as giving westover the pleasantest place and the most intelligent waitress in the room  he would have liked to keep her in talk a moment but she made businesslike despatch of all his allusions to the past and got herself quickly away afterward she came back to him with the effect of having forced herself to come and the color deepened in her cheeks while she stayed  she seemed glad of his being there but helpless against the instincts or traditions that forbade her to show her pleasure in his presence her reticence became almost snubbing in its strictness when he asked her about her schoolteaching in the winter but he found that she taught at the little schoolhouse at the foot of the hill and lived at home with her father  and have you any bad boys that frighten little girls in your school he asked jocosely  i dont know as i have she said with a consciousness that flamed into her cheeks  perhaps the boys have reformed westover suggested  i presume she said stiffly that theres room for improvement in every one and then as if she were afraid he might take this personally she looked unhappy and tried to speak of other things she asked him if he did not see a great many changes at lions head he answered gravely that he wished he could have found it just as he left it and then she must have thought she had gone wrong again for she left him in an embarrassment that was pathetic but which was charming     xi  after breakfast westover walked out and saw whitwell standing on the grass in front of the house beside the flagstaff he suffered westover to make the first advances toward the renewal of their acquaintance but when he was sure of his friendly intention he responded with a cordial openness which the painter had fancied wanting in his children whitwell had not changed much the most noticeable difference was the compact phalanx of new teeth which had replaced the staggering veterans of former days and which displayed themselves in his smile of relenting there was some novelty of effect also in an arrangement of things in his hatband at first westover thought they were fishhooks and artificial flies such as the guides wear in the adirondacks to advertise their calling about the hotel offices and the piazzas but another glance showd him that they were sprays and wild flowers of various sorts with gay mosses and fungi and some stems of indianpipe  whitwell seemed pleased that these things should have caught westovers eye he said almost immediately lookin at my almanac this is one of our fielddays we have em once a week and i like to let the ladies see beforehand what natures got on the bill for em in the woods and pasturs  its a good idea said westover and its fresh and picturesque whitwell laughed for pleasure  they told me what a consolation you were to the ladies with your walks and talks  well i try to give em something to think about said whitwell  but why do you confine your ministrations to one sex  i dont on purpose but its the only sex here threefourths of the time even the children are mostly all girls when the husbands come up saturday nights they dont want to go on a tramp sundays they want to lay off and rest thats about how it is well you see some changes about lions head i presume he asked with what seemed an impersonal pleasure in them  i should rather have found the old farm but i must say im glad to find such a good hotel  jeff and his mother made their brags to you said whitwell with a kind of amiable scorn i guess if it want for cynthy she wouldnt know where she was standin half the time it dont matter where jeff stands i guess jacksons the best o the lot now the old mans gone there was no one by at the moment to hear these injuries except westover but whitwell called them out with a frankness which was perhaps more carefully adapted to the situation than it seemed westover made no attempt to parry them formally but he offered some generalities in extenuation of the unworthiness of the durgins which whitwell did not altogether refuse  oh its all right old woman talk to you about jeffs going to college i thought so wants to make another danel webster of him guess she cans far forth as danels graduatin went westover tried to remember how this had been with the statesman but could not whitwell added with intensifying irony so of look and tone guess the second danel wont have a chance to tear his degree up guess he wouldnt ever ben ready to try for it if it had depended on him they dont keep any record at harvard do they of the way fellows are prepared for their preliminary examinations  i dont quite know what you mean said westover  oh nothin you get a chance some time to ask jeff who done most of his studyin for him at the academy  this hint was not so darkling but westover could understand that whitwell attributed jeffs scholarship to the help of cynthia but he would not press him to an open assertion of the fact there was something painful in it to him it had the pathos which perhaps most of the success in the world would reveal if we could penetrate its outside  he was silent and whitwell left the point well he concluded whats goin on in them old european countries  oh the old thing said westover but i cant speak for any except france very well  whats their republic like over there ours see anything of it how it works  well you know said westover i was working so hard myself all the time  good whitwell slapped his leg westover saw that he had on long indiarubber boots which came up to his knees and he gave a wayward thought to the misery they would be on an august day to another man but whitwell was probably insensible to any discomfort from them when a mans mindin his own business any governments good i guess but i should like to prowl round some them places where they had the worst scenes of the revolution ever been in the place de la concorde whitwell gave it the full english pronunciation  i passed through it nearly every day  i want to know and that column that they pulled down in the commune that had that little boney on itsee that  in the place vendome  yes plass vonndome  oh yes you wouldnt know it had ever been down  nor the things it stood for  as to that i cant be so sure  well its funny said the philosopher how the world seems to always come out at the same hole it went in at he paused with his mouth open as if to let the notion have full effect with westover  the painter said and youre still in the old place mr whitwell  yes i like my own house theyve wanted me to come up here often enough but im satisfied where i am its quiet down there and when i get through for the day i can read and i like to keep my family together cynthy and frank always sleep at home and jombateeste eats with me you remember jombateeste  westover had to say that he did not  well i dont know as you did see him much he was that canuck i had helpin me clear that piece over on lions head for the pulpmill pulpmill went all to thunder and i never got a cent and sometimes jackson comes down with his plantchette and we have a good time  jackson still believes in the manifestations  yes but hes never developed much himself he cant seem to do much without the plantchette weve had up some of them old philosophers lately weve had up socrates  is that so it must be very interesting  whitwell did not answer and westover saw his eye wander he looked round several ladies were coming across the grass toward him from the hotel lifting their skirts and tiptoeing through the dew they called to him goodmorning mr whitwell and are you going up lions head today and dont you think it will rainguess not said whitwell with a fatherly urbanity and an air of amusement at the anxieties of the sex which seemed habitual to him he waited tranquilly for them to come up and then asked with a wave of his hand toward westover acquainted with mr westover the attist he named each of them and it would have been no great vanity in westover to think they had made their little movement across the grass quite as much in the hope of an introduction to him as in the wish to consult whitwell about his plans  the painter found himself the centre of an agreeable excitement with all the ladies in the house for this it was perhaps sufficient to be a man to be reasonably young and decently goodlooking to be an artist and an artist not unknown were advantages which had the splendor of superfluity  he liked finding himself in the simple and innocent american circumstance again and he was not sorry to be confronted at once with one of the most characteristic aspects of our summer he could read in the present development of lions head house all the history of its evolution from the first conception of farmboard which sufficed the earliest comers to its growth in the comforts and conveniences which more fastidious tastes and larger purses demanded before this point was reached the boarders would be of a good and wholesome sort but they would be people of no social advantages and not of much cultivation though they might be intelligent they would certainly not be fashionable five dollars a week implied all that except in the case of some wandering artist or the family of some poor young professor but when the farm became a boardinghouse and called itself a hotel as at present with lions head house and people paid ten dollars a week or twelve for transients a moment of its character was reached which could not be surpassed when its prosperity became greater and its inmates more pretentious in fact the people who can afford to pay ten dollars a week for summer board and not much more are often the best of the american people or at least of the new england people they may not know it and those who are richer may not imagine it they are apt to be middleaged maiden ladies from university towns living upon carefully guarded investments young married ladies with a scant child or two and needing rest and change of air college professors with nothing but their modest salaries literary men or women in the beginning of their tempered success clergymen and their wives away from their churches in the larger country towns or the smaller suburbs of the cities here and there an agreeable bachelor in middle life fond of literature and nature hosts of young and pretty girls with distinct tastes in art and devoted to the clever young painter who leads them to the sources of inspiration in the fields and woods such people are refined humane appreciative sympathetic and westover fresh from the life abroad where life is seldom so free as ours without some stain was glad to find himself in the midst of this unrestraint which was so sweet and pure he had seen enough of rich people to know that riches seldom bought the highest qualities even among his fellowcountrymen who suppose that riches can do everything and the first aspects of society at lions head seemed to him arcadian there really proved to be a shepherd or two among all that troop of shepherdesses old and young though it was in the middle of the week remote alike from the saturday of arrivals and the monday of departures to be sure there was none quite so young as himself except jeff durgin who was officially exterior to the social life  the painter who gave lessons to the ladies was already a man of forty and he was strongly dragoned round by a wife almost as old who had taken great pains to secure him for herself and who worked him to far greater advantage in his profession than he could possibly have worked himself she got him orders sold his pictures even in boston where they never buy american pictures found him pupils and kept the boldest of these from flirting with him westover who was so newly from paris was able to console him with talk of the salons and ateliers which he had not heard from so directly in ten years after the first inevitable moment of jealousy his wife forgave westover when she found that he did not want pupils and she took a leading part in the movement to have him read browning at a picnic organized by the ladies shortly after he came     xii  the picnic was held in whitwells clearing on the side of lions head where the moss almost as white as snow lay like belated drifts among the tall thin grass which overran the space opened by the axe and crept to the verge of the low pines growing in the shelter of the loftier woods it was the end of one of whitwells tramps home to nature as he called his walks and talks with the ladies and on this day westovers fellowpainter had added to his lessons in woodlore the claims of art intending that his class should make studies of various bits in the clearing and should try to catch something of its peculiar charm he asked westover what he thought of the notion and westover gave it his approval which became enthusiastic when he saw the place he found in it the melancholy grace the poignant sentiment of ruin which expresses itself in some measure wherever man has invaded nature and then left his conquest to her again in whitwells clearing the effect was intensified by the approach on the fading wood road which the wagons had made in former days when they hauled the fallen timber to the pulpmill in places it was so vague and faint as to be hardly a trail in others where the wheeltracks remained visible the trees had sent out a new growth of lower branches in the place of those lopped away and almost forbade the advance of footpassengers the ladies said they did not see how jeff was ever going to get through with the wagon and they expressed fears for the lunch he was bringing which seemed only too well grounded  but whitwell who was leading them on said you let a durgin alone to do a thing when hes made up his mind to it i guess youll have your lunch all right and by the time that they had got enough of browning they heard the welcome sound of wheels crashing upon dead boughs and swishing through the underbrush and in the pauses of these pleasant noises the voice of jeff durgin encouraging his horses the children of the party broke away to meet him and then he came in sight ahead of his team looking strong and handsome in his keeping with the scene before he got within hearing the ladies murmured a hymn of praise to his type of beauty they said he looked like a young hercules and westover owned with an inward smile that jeff had certainly made the best of himself for the time being he had taken a leaf from the book of the summer folks his stalwart calves revealed themselves in thick ribbed stockings he wore knickerbockers and a norfolk jacket of corduroy he had style as well as beauty and he had the courage of his clothes and looks westover was still in the first surprise of the american facts and he wondered just what part in the picnic jeff was to bear socially he was neither quite host nor guest but no doubt in the easy play of the life which westover was rather proud to find so charming the question would solve itself rationally and gracefully  where do you want the things the young fellow asked of the company at large as he advanced upon them from the green portals of the roadway pulling off his soft wool hat and wiping his wet forehead with his bluebordered white handkerchief  oh right here jeff the nimblest of the nymphs sprang to her feet from the lounging and crouching circle about westover she was a young nymph no longer but with a daughter not so much younger than herself as to make the contrast of her sixteen years painful westover recognized the officious selfapproving kind of the woman but he admired the brisk efficiency with which she had taken possession of the affair from the beginning and inspired every one to help in strict subordination to herself  when the cloths were laid on the smooth elastic moss and the meal was spread she heaped a plate without suffering any interval in her activities  i suppose youve got to go back to your horses jeff and you shall be the first served she said and she offered him the plate with a bright smile and friendly grace which were meant to keep him from the hurt of her intention  jeff did not offer to take the plate which she raised to him from where she was kneeling but looked down at her with perfect intelligence i guess i dont want anything he said and turned and walked away into the woods  the illadvised woman remained kneeling for a moment with her ingratiating smile hardening on her face while the sense of her blunder petrified the rest she was the first to recover herself and she said with a laugh that she tried to make reckless well friends i suppose the rest of you are hungry i know i am and she began to eat  the others ate too though their appetites might well have been affected by the diplomatic behavior of whitwell he would not take anything just at present he said and got his long length up from the root of a tree where he had folded it down i dont seem to care much for anything in the middle of the day breakfasts my best meal and he followed jeff off into the woods  really said the lady what did they expect but the question was so difficult that no one seemed able to make the simple answer  the incident darkened the day and spoiled its pleasure it cast a lessening shadow into the evening when the guests met round the fire in the large ugly new parlor at the hotel  the next morning the ladies assembled again on the piazza to decide what should be done with the beautiful day before them whitwell stood at the foot of the flagstaff with one hand staying his person against it like a figure posed in a photograph to verify proportions in the different features of a prospect  the heroine of the unhappy affair of the picnic could not forbear authorizing herself to invoke his opinion at a certain point of the debate and mr whitwell she called to him wont you please come here a moment  whitwell slowly pulled himself across the grass to the group and at the same moment as if she had been waiting for him to be present mrs durgin came out of the office door and advanced toward the ladies  mrs marven she said with the stony passivity which the ladies used to note in her when they came over to lions head farm in the tallyhos the stage leaves here at two oclock to get the down train at three i want you should have your trunks ready to go on the wagon a little before two  you want i should have mywhat do you mean mrs durgin  i want your rooms  you want my rooms  mrs durgin did not answer she let her steadfast look suffice and mrs marven went on in a rising flutter why you cant have my rooms i dont understand you ive taken my rooms for the whole of august and they are mine and  i have got to have your rooms said mrs durgin  very well then i wont give them up said the lady a bargains a bargain and i have your agreement  if youre not out of your rooms by two oclock your things will be put out and after dinner today you will not eat another bite under my roof  mrs durgin went in and it remained for the company to make what they could of the affair mrs marven did not wait for the result she was not a dignified person but she rose with hauteur and whipped away to her rooms hers no longer to make her preparations she knew at least how to give her going the effect of quitting the place with disdain and abhorrence  the incident of her expulsion was brutal but it was clearly meant to be so it made westover a little sick and he would have liked to pity mrs marven more than he could the ladies said that mrs durgins behavior was an outrage and they ought all to resent it by going straight to their own rooms and packing their things and leaving on the same stage with mrs marven none of them did so and their talk veered around to something extenuating if not justifying mrs durgins action  i suppose one of them said that she felt more indignant about it because she has been so very good to mrs marven and her daughter too they were both sick on her hands here for a week after they came first one and then the other and she looked after them and did for them like a mother  and yet another lady suggested what could mrs marven have done what did she do he wasnt asked to the picnic and i dont see why he should have been treated as a guest he was there purely and simply to bring the things and take them away and besides if there is anything in distinctions in differences if we are to choose who is to associate with usor our daughters  that is true the ladies said in one form or another with the tone of conviction but they were not so deeply convinced that they did not want a mans opinion and they all looked at westover  he would not respond to their look and the lady who had argued for mrs marven had to ask what do you think mr westover  ah its a difficult question he said i suppose that as long as one person believes himself or herself socially better than another it must always be a fresh problem what to do in every given case  the ladies said they supposed so and they were forced to make what they could of wisdom in which they might certainly have felt a want of finality  westover went away from them in a perplexed mind which was not simplified by the contempt he had at the bottom of all for something unmanly in jeff who had carried his grievance to his mother like a slighted boy and provoked her to take up arms for him  the sympathy for mrs marven mounted again when it was seen that she did not come to dinner or permit her daughter to do so and when it became known later that she had refused for both the dishes sent to their rooms her farewells to the other ladies when they gathered to see her off on the stage were airy rather than cheery there was almost a demonstration in her behalf but westover was oppressed by a kind of inherent squalor in the incident  at night he responded to a knock which he supposed that of frank whitwell with icewater and mrs durgin came into his room and sat down in one of his two chairs mr westover she said if you knew all i had done for that woman and her daughter and how much she had pretended to think of us all i dont believe youd be so ready to judge me  judge you cried westover bless my soul mrs durgin i havent said a word that could be tormented into the slightest censure  but you think i done wrong  i have not been at all able to satisfy myself on that point mrs durgin i think its always wrong to revenge ones self  yes i suppose it is said mrs durgin humbly and the tears came into her eyes i got the tray ready with my own hands that was sent to her room but she wouldnt touch it i presume she didnt like having a plate prepared for her but i did feel sorry for her she ant over and above strong and im afraid shell be sick there ant any restrant at our depot  westover fancied this a fit mood in mrs durgin for her further instruction and he said and if youll excuse me mrs durgin i dont think what you did was quite the way to keep a hotel  more tears flashed into mrs durgins eyes but they were tears of wrath now i would a done it she said if i thought every single one of em would a left the house the next minute for there ant one that has the first word to say against me any other way it want that i cared whether she thought my son was good enough to eat with her or not i know what i think and thats enough for me he want invited to the picnic and he ant one to put himself forward if she didnt want him to stay all she had to do was to do nothin but to make him up a plate before everybody and hand it to him to eat with the horses like a tramp or a dog mrs durgin filled to the throat with her wrath and the sight of her made westover keenly unhappy  yes yes he said it was a miserable business he could not help adding if jeff could have kept it to himselfbut perhaps that wasnt possible  mr westover said mrs durgin sternly do you think jeff would come to me like a great crybaby and complain of my lady boarders and the way they used him it was mr whitell that let it out or i dont know as i should ever known about it  im glad jeff didnt tell you said westover with a revulsion of good feeling toward him  hed a died first said his mother but mr whitell done just right all through and i shant soon forget it jeffs give me a proper goin over for what i done both the boys have but i couldnt help it and i should do just so again all is i wanted you should know just what you was blamin me for  i dont know that i blame you i only wish you could have helped itmanaged some other way  i did try to get over it and all i done was to lose a nights rest then this morning when i see her settin there so cool and mighty with the boarders and takin the lead as usual i just waited till she got whitell across and nearly everybody was there that saw what she done to jeff and then i flew out on her  westover could not suppress a laugh well mrs durgin your retaliation was complete it was dramatic  i dont know what you mean by that said mrs durgin rising and resuming her selfcontrol she did not refuse herself a grim smile but i guess she thought it was pretty perfect herselfor she will when shes able to give her mind to it im sorry for her daughter i never had anything against her or her mother either for that matter before franky look after you pretty well ill send him up with your icewater got everything else you want  i should have to invent a want if i wished to complain said westover  well i should like to have you do it we cant ever do too much for you well goodnight mr westover  goodnight mrs durgin     xiii  jeff durgin entered harvard that fall with fewer conditions than most students have to work off this was set down to the credit of lovewell academy where he had prepared for the university and some observers in such matters were interested to note how thoroughly the old school in a remote town had done its work for him  none who formed personal relations with him at that time conjectured that he had done much of the work for himself and even to westover when jeff came to him some weeks after his settlement in cambridge he seemed painfully out of his element and unamiably aware of it for the time at least he had lost the jovial humor not too kindly always which largely characterized him and expressed itself in sallies of irony which were not so unkindly either the painter perceived that he was on his guard against his own friendly interest jeff made haste to explain that he came because he had told his mother that he would do so he scarcely invited a return of his visit and he left westover wondering at the sort of vague rebellion against his new life which he seemed to be in the painter went out to see him in cambridge not long after and was rather glad to find him rooming with some other rustic freshman in a humble street running from the square toward the river for he thought jeff must have taken his lodging for its cheapness out of regard to his mothers means but jeff was not glad to be found there apparently he said at once that he expected to get a room in the yard the next year and eat at memorial hall he spoke scornfully of his boardinghouse as a place where they were all a lot of jays together and westover thought him still more at odds with his environment than he had before but jeff consented to come in and dine with him at his restaurant and afterward go to the theatre with him  when he came westover did not quite like his despatch of the halfbottle of california claret served each of them with the italian table dhote he did not like his having already seen the play he proposed and he found some difficulty in choosing a play which jeff had not seen it appeared then that he had been at the theatre two or three times a week for the last month and that it was almost as great a passion with him as with westover himself he had become already a critic of acting with a rough good sense of it and a decided opinion he knew which actors he preferred and which actresses better still it was some consolation for westover to find that he mostly took an admission ticket when he went to the theatre but though he could not blame jeff for showing his own fondness for it he wished that he had not his fondness  so far jeff seemed to have spent very few of his evenings in cambridge and westover thought it would be well if he had some acquaintance there he made favor for him with a friendly family who asked him to dinner they did it to oblige westover against their own judgment and knowledge for they said it was always the same with freshmen a single act of hospitality finished the acquaintance jeff came and he behaved with as great indifference to the kindness meant him as if he were dining out every night he excused himself very early in the evening on the ground that he had to go into boston and he never paid his dinnercall after that westover tried to consider his whole duty to him fulfilled and not to trouble himself further now and then however jeff disappointed the expectation westover had formed of him by coming to see him and being apparently glad of the privilege but he did not make the painter think that he was growing in grace or wisdom though he apparently felt an increasing confidence in his own knowledge of life  westover could only feel a painful interest tinged with amusement in his grotesque misconceptions of the world where he had not yet begun to right himself jeff believed lurid things of the society wholly unknown to him to his gross credulity boston houses which at the worst were the homes of a stiff and cold exclusiveness were the scenes of riot only less scandalous than the dissipation to which fashionable ladies abandoned themselves at champagne suppers in the back bay hotels and on their secret visits to the chinese opiumjoints in kingston street  westover tried to make him see how impossible his fallacies were but he could perceive that jeff thought him either wilfully ignorant or helplessly innocent and of far less authority than a barber who had the entree of all these swell families as hairdresser and who corroborated the witness of a hotel nightclerk jeff would not give their names to the depravity of the upper classes he had to content himself with saying i hope you will be ashamed some day of having believed such rot but i suppose its something youve got to go through you may take my word for it though that it isnt going to do you any good its going to do you harm and thats why i hate to have you think it for your own sake it cant hurt any one else  what disgusted the painter most was that with all his belief in the wickedness of the fine world it was clear that jeff would have willingly been of it and he divined that if he had any strong aspirations they were for society and for social acceptance he had fancied when the fellow seemed to care so little for the studies of the university that he might come forward in its sports jeff gave more and more the effect of tremendous strength in his peculiar physique though there was always the disappointment of not finding him tall he was of the middle height but he was hewn out and squared upward massively he felt like stone to any accidental contact and the painter brought away a bruise from the mere brunt of his shoulders he learned that jeff was a frequenter of the gymnasium where his strength must have been known but he could not make out that he had any standing among the men who went in for athletics if jeff had even this the sort of standing in college which he failed of would easily have been won too but he had been falsely placed at the start or some quality of his nature neutralized other qualities that would have made him a leader in college and he remained one of the least forward men in it other jays won favor and liking and ceased to be jays jeff continued a jay he was not chosen into any of the nicer societies those that he joined when he thought they were swell he could not care for when he found they were not  westover came into a knowledge of the facts through his casual and scarcely voluntary confidences and he pitied him somewhat while he blamed him a great deal more without being able to help him at all  it appeared to him that the fellow had gone wrong more through ignorance than perversity and that it was a stubbornness of spirit rather than a badness of heart that kept him from going right he sometimes wondered whether it was not more a baffled wish to be justified in his own esteem than anything else that made him overvalue the things he missed he knew how such an experience as that with mrs marven rankles in the heart of youth and will not cease to smart till some triumph in kind brines it ease but between the man of thirty and the boy of twenty there is a gulf fixed and he could not ask he did not know that a college man often goes wrong in his first year out of no impulse that he can very clearly account for himself and then when he ceases to be merely of his type and becomes more of his character he pulls up and goes right he did not know how much jeff had been with a set that was fast without being fine the boy had now and then a book in his hand when he came not always such a book as westover could have wished but still a book and to his occasional questions about how he was getting on with his college work jeff made brief answers which gave the notion that he was not neglecting it  toward the end of his first year he sent to westover one night from a stationhouse where he had been locked up for breaking a streetlamp in boston by his own showing he had not broken the lamp or assisted except through his presence at the misdeed of the tipsy students who had done it his breath betrayed that he had been drinking too but otherwise he seemed as sober as westover himself who did not know whether to augur well or ill for him from the proofs he had given before of his ability to carry off a bottle of wine with a perfectly level head jeff seemed to believe westover a person of such influence that he could secure his release at once and he was abashed to find that he must pass the night in the cell where he conferred with westover through the bars  in the police court where his companions were fined the next morning he was discharged for want of evidence against him but the university authorities did not take the same view as the civil authorities he was suspended and for the time he passed out of westovers sight and knowledge  he expected to find him at lions head where he went to pass the month of augustin painting those pictures of the mountain which had in some sort almost in spite of him become his specialty but mrs durgin employed the first free moments after their meeting in explaining that jeff had got a chance to work his way to london on a cattlesteamer and had been abroad the whole summer he had written home that the voyage had been glorious with plenty to eat and little to do and he had made favor with the captain for his return by the same vessel in september by other letters it seemed that he had spent the time mostly in england but he had crossed over into france for a fortnight and had spent a week in paris his mother read some passages from his letters aloud to show westover how jeff was keeping his eyes open his accounts of his travel were a mixture of crude sensations in the presence of famous scenes and objects of interest hardheaded observation of the facts of life narrowminded misconception of conditions and wholly intelligent and adequate study of the art of innkeeping in city and country  mrs durgin seemed to feel that there was some excuse due for the relative quantity of the last he knows thats what id care for the most and jeff ant one to forget his mother as if the word reminded her she added after a moment we shant any of us soon forget what you done for jeffthat time  i didnt do anything for him mrs durgin i couldnt westover protested  you done what you could and i know that you saw the thing in the right light or you wouldnt a tried to do anything jeff told me every word about it i know he was with a pretty harumscarum crowd but it was a lesson to him and i want goin to have him come back here right away and have folks talkin about what they couldnt understand after the way the paper had it  did it get into the papers  mm mrs durgin nodded and some dirty sneakin thing here wrote a letter to the paper and told a passel o lies about jeff and all of us and the paper printed jeffs picture with it i dont know how they got a hold of it so when he got that chance to go i just said go youll see hell keep all straight enough after this mr westover  old woman read you any of jeffs letters whitwell asked when his chance for private conference with westover came what was the rights of that scrape he got into  westover explained as favorably to jeff as he could the worst of the affair was the bad company he was in  well where theres smoke theres some fire cout discharged him and college suspended him thats about where it is i guess hell keep out o harms way next time read you what he said about them scenes of the revolution in paris  yes he seems to have looked it all up pretty thoroughly  done it for me i guess much as anything i was always talkin it up with him jeffs kep his eyes open thats a fact hes got a head on him moren i ever thought  westover decided that mrs durgins prepotent behavior toward mrs marven the summer before had not hurt her materially with the witnesses even there were many new boarders but most of those whom he had already met were again at lions head they said there was no air like it and no place so comfortable if they had sold their birthright for a mess of pottage westover had to confess that the pottage was very good instead of the irish woman at ten dollars a week who had hitherto been mrs durgins cook under her personal surveillance and direction she had now a man cook whom she boldly called a chef and paid eighty dollars a month he wore the white apron and white cap of his calling but westover heard him speak yankee through his nose to one of the stablemen as they exchanged hilarities across the space between the basement and the barndoor yes mrs durgin admitted hes an american and he learnt his trade at one of the best hotels in portland hes pretty headstrong but i guess he does what hes toldin the end the meanyous oh franky whitwell prints then hes got an amateur printingoffice in the stableloft     xiv  one morning toward the end of august whitwell who was starting homeward after leaving his ladies burdened with their wishes and charges for the morrow met westover coming up the hill with his paintinggear in his hand say he hailed him why dont you come down to the house tonight jacksons goin to come and if you hant seen him work the plantchette for a spell youll be surprised there ant hardly anybody he cant have up youll come good enough  what affected westover first of all at the seance and perhaps most of all was the quality of the air in the little house it was close and stuffy mixed with an odor of mould and an ancient smell of rats the kerosenelamp set in the centre of the table where jackson afterward placed his planchette devoured the little life that was left in it at the gasps which westover gave with some despairing glances at the closed windows whitwell said hot well i guess it is a little but you see jackson has got to be careful about the night air but i guess i can fix it for you he went out into the ell and westover heard him raising a window he came back and asked that do it ll get around in here directly and westover had to profess relief  jackson came in presently with the little canuck whom whitwell presented to westover know jombateeste  the two were talking about a landslide which had taken place on the other side of the mountain the news had just come that they had found among the ruins the body of the farmhand who had been missing since the morning of the slide his funeral was to be the next day  jackson put his planchette on the table and sat down before it with a sigh the canuck remained standing and on foot he was scarcely a head higher than the seated yankees well jackson said i suppose he knows all about it now meaning the dead farmhand  yes westover suggested if he knows anything  know anything whitwell shouted why man dont you believe hes as much alive as ever he was  i hope so said westover submissively  dont you know it  not as i know other things in fact i dont know it said westover and he was painfully aware of having shocked his hearers by the agnosticism so common among men in towns that he had confessed it quite simply and unconsciously he perceived that faith in the soul and life everlasting was as quick as ever in the hills whatever grotesque or unwonted form it wore jackson sat with closed eyes and his head fallen back whitwell stared at the painter with open mouth the little canuck began to walk up and down impatiently westover felt a reproach almost an abhorrence in all of them  whitwell asked why dont you think theres any proof of it  proof oh yes theres testimony enough to carry conviction to the stubbornest mind on any other point but its very strange about all that it doesnt convince anybody but the witnesses if a man tells me hes seen a disembodied spirit i cant believe him i must see the disembodied spirit myself  thats something so said whitwell with a relenting laugh  if one came back from the dead to tell us of a life beyond the grave we should want the assurance that hed really been dead and not merely dreaming  whitwell laughed again in the delight the philosophic mind finds even in the reasoning that hates it  the canuck felt perhaps the simpler joy that the average man has in any strange notion that he is able to grasp he stopped in his walk and said yes and if you was dead and went to heaven and stayed so long you smelt like lazarus and you come back and tol em what you saw nobody goin believe you  well i guess youre right there jombateeste said whitwell with pleasure in the canucks point after a moment he suggested to westover then i spose if you feel the way you do you dont care much about plantchette  oh yes i do said the painter we never know when we may be upon the point of revelation i wouldnt miss any chance  whether whitwell felt an ironic slant in the words or not he paused a moment before he said want to start her up jackson  jackson brought to the floor the forefeet of his chair which he had tilted from it in leaning back and without other answer put his hand on the planchette it began to fly over the large sheet of paper spread upon the table in curves and angles and eccentrics  feels pootty lively tonight said whitwell with a glance at westover  the little canuck as if he had now no further concern in the matter sat down in a corner and smoked silently whitwell asked after a moments impatience  cant you git her down to business jackson  jackson gasped shell come down when she wants to  the little instrument seemed in fact trying to control itself its movements became less wild and large the zigzags began to shape themselves into something like characters jacksons wasted face gave no token of interest whitwell laid half his gaunt length across the table in the endeavor to make out some meaning in them the canuck with his hands crossed on his stomach smoked on with the same gleam in his pipe and eye  the planchette suddenly stood motionless  she done murmured whitwell  i guess she is for a spell anyway said jackson wearily  lets try to make out what she says whitwell drew the sheets toward himself and westover who sat next him youve got to look for the letters everywhere sometimes shell give you fair and square writin and then again shell slat the letters down every which way and youve got to hunt em out for yourself heres a b ive got that begins along pretty early in the alphabet lets see what we can find next  westover fancied he could make out an f and a t  whitwell exulted in an unmistakable k and n and he made sure of an i and an e the painter was not so sure of an s well call it an s said whitwell and i guess ive got an o here and an h hello heres an a as large as life pootty much of a mixture  yes i dont see that were much better off than we were before said westover  well i dont know about that said whitwell  write em down in a row and see if we cant pick out some sense ive had worse finds than this no vowels at all sometimes but heres three  he wrote the letters down while jackson leaned back against the wall in patient quiet  well sir said whitwell pushing the paper where he had written the letters in a line to westover make anything out of em  westover struggled with them a moment i can make out one wordshaft  anything else demanded whitwell with a glance of triumph at jackson  westover studied the remaining letters yes i get one other wordbroken  just what i done but i wanted you to speak first its broken shaft jackson she caught right onto what we was talkin about this life he turned to westover in solemn exegesis is a broken shaft when death comes it rests upon the earth but you got to look for the top of it in the skies thats the way i look at it what do you think jackson jombateeste  i think anybody cant see that better go and get some heyeglass  westover remained in a shameful minority he said meekly it suggests a beautiful hope  jackson brought his chairlegs down again and put his hand on the planchette  feel that tinglin asked whitwell and jackson made yes with silent lips after hes been workin the plantchette for a spell and then leaves off and she wants to say something more whitwell explained to westover he seems to feel a kind of tinglin in his arm as if it was asleep and then hes got to tackle her again writin steady enough now jackson he cried joyously lets see he leaned over and read thomas jefferson the planchette stopped my i didnt go to do that said whitwell apologetically you much acquainted with jeffersons writins he asked of westover  the painter had to own his ignorance of all except the diction that the government is best which governs least but he was not in a position to deny that jefferson had ever said anything about a broken shaft  it may have come to him on the other side said whitwell  perhaps westover assented  the planchette began to stir itself again shes goin ahead cried whitwell he leaned over the table so as to get every letter as it was formed dyes death death is the broken shaft go on after a moment of faltering the planchette formed another letter it was a u and it was followed by an r and so on till durgin had been spelled thunder cried whitwell if anythings happened to jeff  jackson lifted his hand from the planchette  oh go on jackson whitwell entreated dont leave it so  i cant seem to go on jackson whispered and westover could not resist the fear that suddenly rose among them but he made the first struggle against it this is nonsense or if theres any sense in it it means that jeffs ship has broken her shaft and put back  whitwell gave a loud laugh of relief thats so youve hit it mr westover  jackson said quietly he didnt mean to start home till tomorrow and how could he send any message unless he was  easily cried westover its simply an instance of mental impressionof telepathy as they call it  thats so shouted whitwell with eager and instant conviction  westover could see that jackson still doubted if you believe that a disembodied spirit can communicate with you why not an embodied spirit if anything has happened to your brothers ship his mind would be strongly on you at home and why couldnt it convey its thought to you  because he hant started yet said jackson  westover wanted to laugh but they all heard voices without which seemed to be coming nearer and he listened with the rest he made out frank whitwells voice and his sisters and then another voice louder and gayer rose boisterously above them whitwell flung the door open and plunged out into the night he came back hauling jeff durgin in by the shoulder  here now he shouted to jackson you just let this feller and plantchette fight it out together  whats the matter with plantchette said jeff before he said to his brother hello jackson and to the canuck hello jombateeste he shook hands conventionally with them both and then with the painter whom he greeted with greater interest glad to see you here mr westover did i take you by surprise he asked of the company at large  no sir said whitwell didnt surprise us any if you are a fortnight ahead of time he added with a wink at the others  well i took a notion i wouldnt wait for the cattleship and i started back on a french boat thought id try it they live well but i hoped i should astonish you a little too i might as well waited  whitwell laughed we heard from youplantchette kept right round after you  that so asked jeff carelessly  fact have a good voyage whitwell had the air of putting a casual question  firstrate said jeff plantchette say not  no only about the broken shaft  broken shaft we didnt have any broken shaft plantchettes got mixed a little got the wrong ship  after a moment of chopfallenness whitwell said  then somebodys been makin free with your name curious how them devils cut up oftentimes  he explained and jeff laughed uproariously when he understood the whole case plantchettes been havin fun with you  whitwell gave himself time for reflection no sir i dont look at it that way i guess the wires got crossed some way if theres such a thing as the spirits o the livin influencin plantchette accordin to mr westovers say here i dont see why it want jeffs being so near that got control of her and made her sign his name to somebody elses words it shows theres something in it  well im glad to come back alive anyway said jeff with a joviality new to westover i tell you there ant many places finer than old lions head after all dont you think so mr westover i want to get the daylight on it but it does well by moonlight even he looked round at the tall girl who had been lingering to hear the talk of planchette at the backward tilt he gave his head to get her in range she frowned as if she felt his words a betrayal and slipped out of the room the boy had already gone and was making himself heard in the low room overhead  theres a lot of folks here this summer mother says he appealed from the check he had got to jackson every room taken for the whole month she says  weve been pretty full all july too said jackson blankly  well its a great business and ive picked up a lot of hints over there were not so smart as we think we are the swiss can teach us a thing or two they know how to keep a hotel  go to switzerland asked whitwell  i slipped over into the edge of it  i want to know well now them alps nowthey so much bigger n the white hills after all  well i dont know about all of em said jeff there may be some that would compare with our hills but i should say that you could take mount washington up and set it in the lap of almost any one of the alps i saw and it would look like a baby on its mothers knee  i want to know said whitwell again his tone expressed disappointment but impartiality he would do justice to foreign superiority if he must and about the ocean what about waves runnin mountains high  well we didnt have it very rough but i dont believe i saw any waves much higher than lions head jeff laughed to find whitwell taking him seriously wont that satisfy you  oh it satisfies me truth always does but now about london you didnt seem to say so much about london in your letters now is it so big as they let on bigthat is to the naked eye as you may say  there ant any one place where you can get a complete birdseye view of it said jeff and twothirds of it would be hid in smoke anyway youve got to think of a place that would take in the whole population of new england outside of massachusetts and not feel as if it had more than a comfortable meal  whitwell laughed for joy in the bold figure  ill tell you when youve landed and crossed up from liverpool and struck london you feel as if youd gone to sea again its an oceana whole atlantic of houses  thats right crowed whitwell thats the way i thought it was growin any  jeff hesitated it grows in the night youve heard about chicago growing  yes  well london grows a whole chicago every night  good said whitwell that suits me and about paris now paris strike you the same way  it dont need to said jeff thats a place where id like to live everybodys at home there its a mans house and his front yard and i tell you they keep it clean paris is washed down every morning scrubbed and mopped and rubbed dry you couldnt find any more dirt than you could in mothers kitchen after shes hung out her wash that so mr westover  westover confirmed in general jeffs report of the cleanliness of paris  and beautiful you dont know what a goodlooking town is till you strike paris and theyre proud of it too every man acts as if he owned it theyve had the statue of alsace in that place de la concorde of yours mr whitwell where they had the guillotine all draped in black ever since the war with germany and they mean to have her back some day  great country jombateeste whitwell shouted to the canuck  the little man roused himself from the muse in which he was listening and smoking me im frantsh he said  yes thats what jeff was sayin said whitwell i meant france  oh answered jombateeste impatiently i thought you mean the hunited state  well not this time said whitwell amid the general laughter  good for jombateeste said jeff stand up for canada every time john its the livest country in the world three months of the year and the ice keeps it perfectly sweet the other nine  whitwell could not brook a diversion from the high and serious inquiry they had entered upon it must have made this country look pretty slim when you got back howd new york look after paris  like a pigpen said jeff he left his chair and walked round the table toward a door opening into the adjoining room for the first time westover noticed a figure in white seated there and apparently rapt in the talk which had been going on at the approach of jeff and before he could have made himself seen at the doorway a tremor seemed to pass over the figure it fluttered to its feet and then it vanished into the farther dark of the room when jeff disappeared within there was a sound of rustling skirts and skurrying feet and the crash of a closing door and then the free rise of laughing voices without after a discreet interval westover said mr whitwell i must say goodnight ive got another days work before me its been a most interesting evening  you must try it again said whitwell hospitably we hant got to the bottom of that broken shaft yet youll see t plantchette ll have something more to say about it heigh jackson he rose to receive westovers goodnight the others nodded to him  as the painter climbed the hill to the hotel he saw two figures on the road below the one in white drapery looked severed by a dark line slanting across it at the waist in the country he knew such an appearance might mark the earliest stages of lovemaking or mere youthful tenderness in which there was nothing more implied or expected but whatever the fact was westover felt a vague distaste for it which as it related itself to a more serious possibility deepened to something like pain it was probable that it should come to this between those two but westover rebelled against the event with a sense of its unfitness for which he could not give himself any valid reason and in the end he accused himself of being a fool  two ladies sat on the veranda of the hotel and watched a cloudwreath trying to lift itself from the summit of lions head in the effort it thinned away to transparency in places in others it tore its frail texture asunder and let parts of the mountain show through then the fragments knitted themselves loosely together and the vapor lay again in dreamy quiescence  the ladies were older and younger and apparently mother and daughter the mother had kept her youth in face and figure so admirably that in another light she would have looked scarcely the elder it was the candor of the morning which confessed the fine vertical lines running up and down to her lips only a shade paler than the girls and that showed her hair a trifle thinner in its coppery brown her blue eyes a little dimmer they were both very graceful and they had soft caressing voices they now began to talk very politely to each other as if they were strangers or as if strangers were by they talked of the landscape and of the strange cloud effect before them they said that they supposed they should see the lions head when the cloud lifted and they were both sure they had never been quite so near a cloud before they agreed that this was because in switzerland the mountains were so much higher and farther off then the daughter said without changing the direction of her eyes or the tone of her voice the gentleman who came over from the station with us last night and the mother was aware of jeff durgin advancing toward the corner of the veranda where they sat  i hope you have got rested he said with the jovial bluntness which was characteristic of him with women  oh yes indeed said the elder lady jeff had spoken to her but had looked chiefly at the younger i slept beautifully so quiet here and with this delicious air have you just tasted it  no ive been up ever since daylight driving round said jeff im glad you like the air he said after a certain hesitation we always want to have people do that at lions head theres no air like it though perhaps i shouldnt say so  shouldnt the lady repeated  yes we own the air herethis part of it jeff smiled easily down at the ladys puzzled face  oh then you areare you a son of the house  son of the hotel yes said jeff with increasing ease the lady continued her question in a look and he went on ive been scouring the country for butter and eggs this morning we shall get all our supplies from boston next year i hope but we depend on the neighbors a little yet  how very interesting said the lady you must have a great many queer adventures she suggested in a provisional tone  well nothings queer to me in the hill country but you see some characters here he nodded over his shoulder to where whitwell stood by the flagstaff waiting the morning impulse of the ladies theres one of the greatest of them now  the lady put up a lorgnette and inspected whitwell what are those strange things he has got in his hatband  the flowers and the fungi of the season said jeff he takes parties of the ladies walking and that collection is what he calls his almanac  really cried the girl thats charming  delightful said the mother moved by the same impulse apparently  yes said jeff you ought to hear him talk ill introduce him to you after breakfast if you like  oh we should only be too happy said the mother and her daughter from her inflection knew that she would be willing to defer her happiness  but jeff did not mr whitwell he called out and whitwell came across the grass to the edge of the veranda i want to introduce you to mrs vostrandand miss vostrand  whitwell took their slim hands successively into his broad flat palm and made mrs vostrand repeat her name to him strangers at lions head i presume mrs vostrand owned as much and he added well i guess you wont find a much sightlier place anywhere though accordin to jeffs say here theyve got bigger mountains on the other side ever been in europe  why yes said mrs vostrand with a little mouth of deprecation in fact weve just come home weve been living there  that so returned whitwell in humorous toleration glad to get back i presume  oh yesyes said mrs vostrand in a sort of willowy concession as if the character before her were not to be crossed or gainsaid  well it ll do you good here said whitwell n the young lady too a few tramps over these hills ll make you look like another woman he added as if he had perhaps made his remarks too personal to the girl both of you  oh yes the mother assented fervently we shall count upon your showing us all theirmysteries  whitwell looked pleased ill do my bestwhenever youre ready he went on why jeff here has just got back too jeff what was the name of that french boat you said you crossed on i want to see if i cant make out what plantchette meant by that broken shaft she must have meant something and if i could find out the name of the shiptell the ladies about it jeff laughed with a shake of the head and whitwell continued why it was like this and he possessed the ladies of a fact which they professed to find extremely interesting at the end of their polite expressions he asked jeff again what did you say the name was  aquitaine said jeff briefly  why we came on the aquitaine said mrs vostrand with a smile for jeff but how did we happen not to see one another  oh i came secondcabin said jeff i worked my way over on a cattleship to london and when i decided not to work my way back i found i hadnt enough money for a firstcabin passage i was in a hurry to get back in time to get settled at harvard and so i came secondcabin it wasnt bad i used to see you across the rail  well said whitwell  how veryamusing said mrs vostrand what a small world it is with these words she fell into a vagary her daughter recalled her from it with a slight movement breakfast how impatient you are genevieve well she smiled the sweetest parting to whitwell and suffered herself to be led away by jeff  and youre at harvard im so interested my own boy will be going there soon  well theres no place like harvard said jeff im in my sophomore year now  oh a sophomore fancy cried mrs vostrand as if nothing could give her more pleasure my son is going to prepare at st marks did you prepare there  no i prepared at lovewell academy over here jeff nodded in a southerly direction  oh indeed said mrs vostrand as if she knew where lovewell was and instantly recognized the name of the ancient school  they had reached the dining room and jeff pushed the screendoor open with one hand and followed the ladies in he had the effect of welcoming them like invited guests he placed the ladies himself at a window where he said mrs vostrand would be out of the draughts and they could have a good view of lions head  he leaned over between them when they were seated to get sight of the mountain and there he said that clouds gone at last then as if it would be modester in the proprietor of the view to leave them to their flattering raptures in it he moved away and stood talking a moment with cynthia whitwell near the door of the servingroom he talked gayly with many tosses of the head and turns about while she listened with a vague smile motionlessly  shes very pretty said miss vostrand to her mother  yes the new england type murmured the mother  they all have the same look a good deal said the girl glancing over the room where the waitresses stood ranged against the wall with their hands folded at their waists they have better faces than figures but she is beautiful every way do you suppose they are all schoolteachers they look intellectual or is it their glasses  i dont know said the mother they used to be but things change here so rapidly it may all be different do you like it  i think its charming here said the younger lady evasively everything is so exquisitely clean and the food is very good is this cornbreadthat youve told me about so much  yes this is cornbread you will have to get accustomed to it  perhaps it wont take long i could fancy that girl knowing about everything dont you like her looks  oh very much mrs vostrand turned for another glance at cynthia  what say their smiling waitress came forward from the wall where she was leaning as if she thought they had spoken to her  oh we were speakingthe young lady to whom mr durgin was talkingshe is  shes the housekeepermiss whitwell  oh indeed she seems so young  i guess she knows what to dooo the waitress chanted we think shes about riight she smiled tolerantly upon the misgiving of the stranger if it was that and then retreated when the mother and daughter began talking together again  they had praised the mountain with the cloud off to jeff very politely and now the mother said a little more intimately but still with the deference of a society acquaintance he seems very gentlemanly and i am sure he is very kind i dont quite know what to do about it do you  no i dont its all strange to me you know  yes i suppose it must be but you will get used to it if we remain in the country do you think you will dislike it  oh no its very different  yes its different he is very handsome in a certain way the daughter said nothing and the mother added i wonder if he was trying to conceal that he had come secondcabin and was not going to let us know that he crossed with us  do you think he was bound to do so  no but it was very odd his not mentioning it and his going out on a cattlesteamer the mother observed  oh but thats very chic ive heard the daughter replied ive heard that the young men like it and think it a great chance they have great fun it isnt at all like secondcabin  you young people have your own world the mother answered caressingly     xvi  westover met the ladies coming out of the diningroom as he went in rather late to breakfast he had been making a study of lions head in the morning light after the cloud lifted from it he was always doing lions heads it seemed to him but he loved the mountain and he was always finding something new in it  he was now seeing it inwardly with so exclusive a vision that he had no eyes for these extremely pretty women till they were out of sight then he remembered noticing them and started with a sense of recognition which he verified by the hotel register when he had finished his meal it was in fact mrs james w vostrand and it was miss vostrand whom westover had know ten years before in italy mrs vostrand had then lately come abroad for the education of her children and was pausing in doubt at florence whether she should educate them in germany or switzerland her husband had apparently abandoned this question to her and he did not contribute his presence to her moral support during her struggle with a problem which westover remembered as having a tendency to solution in the direction of a permanent stay in florence  in those days he liked mrs vostrand very much and at twenty he considered her at thirty distinctly middleaged for one winter she had a friendly little salon which was the most attractive place in florence to him then a cub painter sufficiently unlicked he was aware of her children being a good deal in the salon a girl of eight who was like her mother and quite a savage little boy of five who may have been like his father if he was and the absent mr vostrand had the same habit of sulking and kicking at peoples shins westover could partly understand why mrs vostrand had come to europe for the education of her children it all came vividly back to him while he went about looking for mrs vostrand and her daughter on the verandas and in the parlors but he did not find them and he was going to send his name to their rooms when he came upon jeff durgin figuring about the office in a fresh london conception of an outing costume  youre very swell said westover halting him to take full note of it  like it well i knew youd understand what it meant mother thinks its a little too rowdylooking her idea is black broadcloth frockcoat and doeskin trousers for a gentleman you know he laughed with a young joyousness and then became serious couple of ladies here somewhere id like to introduce you to came over with me from the depot last night very nice people and id like to make it pleasant for themget up somethinggo somewhereand when you see their style you can judge what it had better be mrs vostrand and her daughter  thank you said westover i think i know them already at least one of them i used to go to mrs vostrands house in florence  that so well fact is i crossed with them but i came secondcabin because id spent all my money and i didnt get acquainted with them on the ship but we met in the train coming up last night said they had heard of lions head on the other side from friends but it was quite a coincidence dont you think id like to have them see what this neighborhood really is and i wish mr westover youd find out if you can what theyd like if theyre for walking we could get whitwell to personally conduct a party and if theyre for driving id like to show them a little mountaincoaching myself  i dont know whether id better not leave the whole thing to you jeff westover said after a moments reflection i dont see exactly how i could bring the question into a first interview  well perhaps it would be rather rushing it but if i get up something youll come mr westover  i will with great pleasure said westover and he went to make his call  a halfhour later he was passing the door of the old parlor which mrs durgin still kept for hers on his way up to his room when a sound of angry voices came out to him then the voice of mrs durgin defined itself in the words im not goin to have to ask any more folks for their rooms on your account jeff durginmr westover mr westover is that you her voice broke off to call after him as he hurried by wont you come in here a minute  he hesitated and then jeff called yes come in mr westover  the painter found him sitting on the old haircloth sofa with his stick between his hands and knees confronting his mother who was rocking excitedly to and fro in the old haircloth easychair  you know these folks that jeffs so crazy about she demanded  crazy cried jeff laughing and frowning at the same time whats crazy in wanting to go off on a drive and choose your own party  do you know them mrs durgin repeated to westover  the vostrands why yes i knew mrs vostrand in italy a good many years ago and ive just been calling on her and her daughter who was a little girl then  what kind of folks are they  what kind really why theyre very charming people  so jeff seems to think any call to show them any particular attention  i dont know if i quite understand  why its just this jeff here wants to make a picnic for them or something and i cant see the sense of it you remember what happened at that other picnic with that mrs marvenjeff tapped the floor with his stick impatiently and westover felt sorry for himand i dont want it to happen again and ive told jeff so i presume he thinks it ll set him right with them if theyre thinkin demeaning of him because he came over secondcabin on their ship  jeff set his teeth and compressed his lips to bear as best he could the giveaway which his mother could not appreciate in its importance to him  theyre not the kind of people to take such a thing shabbily said westover they didnt happen to mention it but mrs vostrand must have got used to seeing young fellows in straits of all kinds during her life abroad i know that i sometimes made the cup of tea and biscuit she used to give me in florence do duty for a dinner and i believe she knew it  jeff looked up at westover with a grateful sidelong glance  his mother said well then thats all right and jeff neednt do anything for them on that account and ive made up my mind about one thing whatever the hotel does has got to be done for the whole hotel it cant pick and choose amongst the guests westover liked so little the part of old family friend which he seemed whether he liked it or not to bear with the durgins that he would gladly have got away now but mrs durgin detained him with a direct appeal dont you think so mr westover  jeff spared him the pain of a response very well he said to his mother im not the hotel and you never want me to be i can do this on my own account  not with my coach and not with my hosses said his mother  jeff rose i might as well go on down to cambridge and get to work on my conditions  just as you please about that said mrs durgin with the same impassioned quiet that showed in her sons handsome face and made it one angry red to his yellow hair weve got along without you so far this summer and i guess we can the rest of the time and the sooner you work off your conditions the better i presume  the next morning jeff came to take leave of him where westover had pitched his easel and campstool on the slope behind the hotel  why are you really going he asked i was in hopes it might have blown over  no things dont blow over so easy with mother said jeff with an embarrassed laugh but no resentment she generally means what she says  well in this case jeff i think she was right  oh i guess so said jeff pulling up a long blade of grass and taking it between his teeth anyway it comes to the same thing as far as im concerned its for her to say what shall be done and what shant be done in her own house even if it is a hotel thats what i shall do in mine were used to these little differences but we talk it out and thats the end of it i shouldnt really go though if i didnt think i ought to get in some work on those conditions before the thing begins regularly i should have liked to help here a little for ive had a good time and i ought to be willing to pay for it but shes in good hands jacksons wellfor himand shes got cynthia  the easy security of tone with which jeff pronounced the name vexed westover i suppose your mother would hardly know how to do without her even if you were at home he said dryly  well thats a fact jeff assented with a laugh for the hit and jackson thinks the world of her i believe he trusts her judgment more than he does mothers about the hotel well i must be going you dont know where mrs vostrand is going to be this winter i suppose  no i dont said westover he could not help a sort of blind resentment in the situation if he could not feel that jeff was the best that could be for cynthia he had certainly no reason to regret that his thoughts could be so lightly turned from her but the fact anomalously incensed him as a slight to the girl who might have been still more sacrificed by jeffs constancy he forced himself to add i fancy mrs vostrand doesnt know herself  i wish i didnt know where i was going to be said jeff well goodbye mr westover ill see you in boston  oh goodbye the painter freed himself from his brush and palette for a parting handshake reluctantly  jeff plunged down the hill waving a final adieu from the corner of the hotel before he vanished round it  mrs vostrand and her daughter were at breakfast when westover came in after the early light had been gone some time they entreated him to join them at their table and the mother said i suppose you were up soon enough to see young mr durgin off isnt it too bad he has to go back to college when its so pleasant in the country  not bad for him said westover hes a young man who can stand a great deal of hard work partly because he was a little tired of jeff and partly because he was embarrassed in their presence by the reason of his going he turned the talk upon the days they had known together  mrs vostrand was very willing to talk of her past even apart from his and she told him of her sojourn in europe since her daughter had left school they spent their winters in italy and their summers in switzerland where it seemed her son was still at his studies in lausanne she wished him to go to harvard she said and she supposed he would have to finish his preparation at one of the american schools but she had left the choice entirely to mr vostrand  this seemed a strange event after twelve years stay in europe for the education of her children but westover did not feel authorized to make any comment upon it he fell rather to thinking how very pleasant both mother and daughter were and to wondering how much wisdom they had between them he reflected that men had very little wisdom as far as he knew them and he questioned whether after all the main difference between men and women might not be that women talked their follies and men acted theirs probably mrs vostrand with all her babble had done fewer foolish things than her husband but here westover felt his judgment disabled by the fact that he had never met her husband and his mind began to wander to a question of her daughter whom he had there before him he found himself bent upon knowing more of the girl and trying to eliminate her mother from the talk or at least to make genevieve lead in it but apparently she was not one of the natures that like to lead at any rate she remained discreetly in abeyance and westover fancied she even respected her mothers opinions and ideas he thought this very well for both of them whether it was the effect of mrs vostrands merit or miss vostrands training they seemed both of one exquisite gentleness and of one sweet manner which was rather elaborate and formal in expression they deferred to each other as politely as they deferred to him but if anything the daughter deferred most     xvii  the vostrands did not stay long at lions head before the week was out mrs vostrand had a letter summoning them to meet her husband at montreal where that mysterious man who never came into the range of westovers vision somehow was kept by business from joining them in the mountains  early in october the painter received mrs vostrands card at his studio in boston and learned from the scribble which covered it that she was with her daughter at the hotel vendome he went at once to see them there and was met almost before the greetings were past with a prayer for his opinion  favorable opinion he asked  favorable oh yes of course its simply this when i sent you my card we were merely birds of passage and now i dont know but we arewhat is the opposite of birds of passage  westover could not think and said so  well it doesnt matter we were walking down the street here this morning and we saw the sign of an apartment to let in a window and we thought just for amusement we would go in and look at it  and you took it  no not quite so rapid as that but it was lovely in such a pretty hotel garni and so exquisitely furnished we didnt really think of staying in boston wed quite made up our minds on new york but this apartment is a temptation  why not yield then said westover thats the easiest way with a temptation confess now that youve taken the apartment already  no no i havent yet said mrs vostrand  and if i advised not you wouldnt  ah thats another thing  when are you going to take possession mrs vostrand  oh at once i supposeif we do  and may i come in when im hungry just as i used to do in florence and will you stay me with flagons in the old way  there never was anything but tea you know well enough  the tea had rum in it  well perhaps it will have rum in it here if youre very good  i will try my best on condition that youll make any and every possible use of me mrs vostrand i cant tell you how very glad i am youre going to stay said the painter with a fervor that made her impulsively put out her hand to him he kept it while he could add i dont forgeti can never forgethow good you were to me in those days and at that she gave his hand a quick pressure if i can do anything at all for you you will let me wont you im afraid youll be so well provided for that there wont be anything ask them to slight you to misuse you in something so that i can come to your rescue  yes i will mrs vostrand promised and may we come to your studio to implore your protection  the sooner the better westover got himself away with a very sweet friendship in his heart for this rather anomalous lady who more than half her daughters life had lived away from her daughters father upon apparently perfectly good terms with him and so discreetly and selfrespectfully that no breath of reproach had touched her until now however her position had not really concerned westover and it would not have concerned him now if it had not been for a design that formed itself in his mind as soon as he knew that mrs vostrand meant to pass the winter in boston he felt at once that he could not do things by halves for a woman who had once done them for him by wholes and something over and he had instantly decided that he must not only be very pleasant to her himself but he must get his friends to be pleasant too his friends were some of the nicest people in boston nice in both the personal and the social sense he knew they would not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for him in a good cause and that made him all the more anxious that the cause should be good beyond question  since his last return from paris he had been rather a fad as a teacher and his class had been kept quite strictly to the ladies who got it up and to such as they chose to let enter it these were not all chosen for wealth or family there were some whose gifts gave the class distinction and the ladies were glad to have them it would be easy to explain mrs vostrand to these but the others might be more difficult they might have their anxieties and westover meant to ask the leader of the class to help him receive at the studio tea he had at once imagined for the vostrands and that would make her doubly responsible  he found himself drawing a very deep and long breath before he began to mount the many stairs to his studio and wishing either that mrs vostrand had not decided to spend the winter in boston or else that he were of a slacker conscience and could wear his gratitude more lightly but there was some relief in thinking that he could do nothing for a month yet he gained a degree of courage by telling the ladies when he went to find them in their new apartment that he should want them to meet a few of his friends at tea as soon as people began to get back to town and he made the most of their instant joy in accepting his invitation  his pleasure was somehow dashed a little before he left them by the announcement of jeff durgins name  i felt bound to send him my card said mrs vostrand while jeff was following his up in the elevator he was so very kind to us the day we arrived at zions head and i didnt know but he might be feeling a little sensitive about coming over secondcabin in our ship and  how like you mrs vostrand cried westover and he was now distinctly glad he had not tried to sneak out of doing something for her your kindness wont be worse wasted on durgin than it was on me in the old days when i supposed i had taken a secondcabin passage for the voyage of life theres a great deal of good in him i dont mean to say he got through his freshman year without trouble with the college authorities but the sophomore year generally brings wisdom  oh said mrs vostrand theyre always a little wild at first i suppose  later the ladies brought jeff with them when they came to westovers studio and the painter perceived that they were very good friends as if they must have met several times since he had seen them together he interested himself in the growing correctness of jeffs personal effect during his freshman year while the rigor of the unwritten harvard law yet forbade him a silk hat or a cane he had kept something of the boy if not the country boy westover had noted that he had always rather a taste for clothes but in this first year he did not get beyond a derbyhat and a sackcoat varied toward the end by a cutaway in the outing dress he wore at home he was always effective but there was something in jeffs figure which did not lend itself to more formal fashion something of herculean proportion which would have marked him of a classic beauty perhaps if he had not been in clothes at all or of a yeomanly vigor and force if he had been clad for work but which seemed to threaten the more worldly conceptions of the tailor with danger it was as if he were about to burst out of his clothes not because he wore them tight but because there was somehow more of the man than the citizen in him something native primitive something that westover could not find quite a word for characterized him physically and spiritually when he came into the studio after these delicate ladies the robust jeff durgin wore a long frockcoat with a flower in his buttonhole and in his left hand he carried a silk hat turned over his forearm as he must have noticed people whom he thought stylish carrying their hats he had on darkgray trousers and sharppointed enamelledleather shoes and westover grotesquely reflected that he was dressed as he stood to lead genevieve vostrand to the altar  westover saw at once that when he made his studio tea for the vostrands he must ask jeff it would be cruel and for several reasons impossible not to do so and he really did not see why he should not mrs vostrand was taking him on the right ground as a harvard student and nobody need take him on any other possibly people would ask him to teas at their own houses from westovers studio but he could not feel that he was concerned in that society is interested in a mans future not his past as it is interested in a womans past not her future  but when he gave his tea it went off wonderfully well in every way perhaps because it was one of the first teas of the fall it brought people together in their autumnal freshness before the winter had begun to wither their resolutions to be amiable to one another to dull their wits to stale their stories or to give so wide a currency to their sayings that they could not freely risk them with every one  westover had thought it best to be frank with the leading lady of his class when she said she should be delighted to receive for him and would provide suitable young ladies to pour a brunette for the tea and a blonde for the chocolate she took his scrupulosity very lightly when he spoke of mrs vostrands educational sojourn in europe she laughed and said she knew the type and the situation was one of the most obvious phases of the american marriage  he protested in vain that mrs vostrand was not the type she laughed again and said oh types were never typical but she was hospitably gracious both to her and to miss genevieve she would not allow that the mother was not the type when westover challenged her experience but she said they were charming and made haste to get rid of the question with the vivid demand but who was your young friend who ought to have worn a lionskin and carried a club  westover by this time disdained palliation he said that jeff was the son of the landlady at lions head mountain which he had painted so much and he was now in his second year at harvard where he was going to make a lawyer of himself and this interested the lady she asked if he had talent and a number of other things about him and about his mother and westover permitted himself to be rather graphic in telling of his acquaintance with mrs durgin     xviii  after all it was rather a simplehearted thing of westover to have either hoped or feared very much for the vostrands society in the sense of good society can always take care of itself and does so perfectly in the case of mrs vostrand some ladies who liked westover and wished to be civil to him asked her and her daughter to other afternoon teas shook hands with them at their coming and said when they went they were sorry they must be going so soon in the crowds people recognized them now and then both of those who had met them at westovers studio and of those who had met them at florence and lausanne but if these were merely people of fashion they were readily rid of the vostrands whom the dullest among them quickly perceived not to be of their own sort somehow many of the ladies of westovers class made genevieve promise to let them paint her and her beauty and her grace availed for several large dances at the houses of more daring spirits where the daughters made a duty of getting partners for her and discharged it conscientiously but there never was an approach to more intimate hospitalities and toward the end of february when good society in boston goes southward to indulge a lenten grief at old point comfort genevieve had so many vacant afternoons and evenings at her disposal that she could not have truthfully pleaded a previous engagement to the invitations jeff durgin made her they were chiefly for the theatre and westover saw him with her and her mother at different plays he wondered how jeff had caught on to the notion of asking mrs vostrand to come with them  jeffs introductions at westovers tea had not been many and they had not availed him at all he had been asked to no boston houses and when other students whom he knew were going in to dances the whole winter he was socially as quiet but for the vostrands as at the midyear examinations westover could not resent the neglect of society in his case and he could not find that he quite regretted it but he thought it characteristically nice of mrs vostrand to make as much of the friendless fellow as she fitly could he had no doubt but her tact would be equal to his management in every way and that she could easily see to it that he did not become embarrassing to her daughter or herself  one day after the east wind had ceased to blow the breath of the icefields of labrador against the new england coast and the buds on the trees along the mall between the lawns of the avenue were venturing forth in a hardy experiment of the boston may mrs vostrand asked westover if she had told him that mr vostrand was actually coming on to boston he rejoiced with her in this prospect and he reciprocated the wish which she said mr vostrand had always had for a meeting with himself  a fortnight later when the leaves had so far inured themselves to the weather as to have fully expanded she announced another letter from mr vostrand saying that after all he should not be able to come to boston but hoped to be in new york before she sailed  sailed cried westover  why yes didnt you know we were going to sail in june i thought i had told you  no  why yes we must go out to poor checco now mr vostrand insists upon that if ever we are a united family again mr westoverif mr vostrand can arrange his business when checco is ready to enter harvardi mean to take a house in boston im sure i should be contented to live nowhere else in america the place has quite bewitched medear old sober charming boston im sure i should like to live here all the rest of my life but why in the world do people go out of town so early those houses over there have been shut for a whole month past  they were sitting at mrs vostrands window looking out on the avenue where the pale globular electrics were swimming like jellyfish in the clear evening air and above the ranks of low trees the houses on the other side were closeshuttered from basement to attic  westover answered some go because they have such pleasant houses at the shore and some because they want to dodge their taxes  to dodge their taxes she repeated and he had to explain how if people were in their countryhouses before the 1st of may they would not have to pay the high personal tax of the city and she said that she would write that to mr vostrand it would be another point in favor of boston women she declared would never have thought of such a thing she denounced them as culpably ignorant of so many matters that concerned them especially legal matters and you think she asked that mr durgin will be a good lawyer that he willdistinguish himself  westover thought it rather a shortcut to jeff from the things they had been talking of but if she wished to speak of him he had no reason to oppose her wish ive heard its all changed a good deal there are still distinguished lawyers and lawyers who get on but they dont distinguish themselves in the old way so much and they get on best by becoming counsel for some powerful corporation  and you think he has talent she pursued for that i mean  oh i dont know said westover i think he has a good head he can do what he likes within certain limits and the limits are not all on the side i used to fancy he baffles me but of late i fancy youve seen rather more of him than i have  i have urged him to go more to you but said mrs vostrand with a burst of frankness he thinks you dont like him  hes wrong said westover but i might dislike him very much  i see what you mean said mrs vostrand and im glad youve been so frank with me ive been so interested in mr durgin so interested isnt he very young  the question seemed a bit of indirection to westover but he answered directly enough hes rather old for a sophomore i believe hes twentytwo  and genevieve is twenty mr westover may i trust you with something  with everything i hope mrs vostrand  its about genevieve her father is so opposed to her making a foreign marriage it seems to be his one great dread and of course shes very much exposed to it living abroad so much with me and i feel doubly bound on that account to respect her fathers opinions or even prejudices before we left florencein fact last winterthere was a most delightful young officer wished to marry her i dont know that she cared anything for him though he was everything that i could have wished handsome brilliant accomplished good family everything but rich and that was what mr vostrand objected to or rather he objected to putting up as he called it the sum that captain grassi would have had to deposit with the government before he was allowed to marry you know how it is with the poor fellows in the army there i dont understand the process exactly but the sum is something like sixty thousand francs i believe and poor gigi hadnt it i always called him gigi but his name is count luigi de popolani grassi and he is descended from one of the old republican families of florence he is so nice mr vostrand was opposed to him from the beginning and as soon as he heard of the sixty thousand francs he utterly refused he called it buying a soninlaw but i dont see why he need have looked at it in that light however it was broken off and we left florencemore for poor gigis sake than for genevieves i must say he was quite heartbroken i pitied him  her voice had a tender fall in the closing words and westover could fancy how sweet she would make her compassion to the young man she began several sentences aimlessly and he suggested to supply the broken thread of her discourse rather than to offer consolation while her eyes seemed to wander with her mind and ranged the avenue up and down those foreign marriages are not always successful  no they are not she assented but dont you think theyre better with italians than with germans for instance  i dont suppose the italians expect their wives to black their boots but ive heard that they beat them sometimes  in exaggerated cases perhaps they do mrs vostrand admitted and of course she added thoughtfully there is nothing like a purely american marriage for happiness  westover wondered how she really regarded her own marriage but she never betrayed any consciousness of its variance from the type     xix  a young couple came strolling down the avenue who to westovers artistic eye first typified grace and strength and then to his more personal perception identified themselves as genevieve vostrand and jeff durgin  they faltered before one of the benches beside the mall and he seemed to be begging her to sit down she cast her eyes round till they must have caught the window of her mothers apartment then as if she felt safe under it she sank into the seat and jeff put himself beside her it was quite too early yet for the simple lovers who publicly notify their happiness by the embraces and handclasps everywhere evident in our parks and gardens and a boston pair of social tradition would not have dreamed of sitting on a bench in commonwealth avenue at any hour but two such aliens as jeff and miss vostrand might very well do so and westover sympathized with their bohemian impulse  mrs vostrand and he watched them awhile in talk that straggled away from them and became more and more distraught in view of them jeff leaned forward and drew on the ground with the point of his stick genevieve held her head motionless at a pensive droop it was only their backs that westover could see and he could not of course make out a syllable of what was effectively their silence but all the same he began to feel as if he were peeping and eavesdropping mrs vostrand seemed not to share his feeling and there was no reason why he should have it if she had not he offered to go but she said no no he must not think of it till genevieve came in and she added some banalities about her always scolding when she had missed one of his calls they would be so few now at the most  why do you intend to go so soon he asked  she did not seem to hear him and he could see that she was watching the young people intently jeff had turned his face up toward genevieve without lifting his person and was saying something she suddenly shrank back from she made a start as if to rise but he put out his hand in front of her beseechingly or compellingly and she sank down again but she slowly shook her head at what he was saying and turned her face toward him so that it gave her profile to the spectators in that light and at that distance it was impossible to do more than fancy anything fateful in the words which she seemed to be uttering but westover chose to fancy this jeff waited a moment in apparent silence after she had spoken he sat erect and faced her and this gave his profile too he must have spoken for she shook her head again and then at other words from him nodded assentingly then she listened motionlessly while he poured a rapid stream of visible but inaudible words he put out his hand as if to take hers but she put it behind her westover could see it white there against the belt of her dark dress  jeff went on more vehemently but she remained steadfast slowly shaking her head when he ended she spoke and with something of his own energy he made a gesture of submission and when she rose he rose too she stood a moment and with a gentle and almost entreating movement she put out her hand to him he stood looking down with both his hands resting on the top of his stick as if ignoring her proffer then he suddenly caught her hand held it a moment dropped it and walked quickly away without looking back genevieve ran across the lawn and roadway toward the house  oh must you go mrs vostrand said to westover he found that he had probably risen in sympathy with jeffs action he was not aware of an intention of going but he thought he had better not correct mrs vostrands error  yes i really must now he said  well then she returned distractedly do come often  he hurried out to avoid meeting genevieve he passed her on the public stairs of the house but he saw that she did not recognize him in the dim light  late that night he was startled by steps that seemed to be seeking their way up the stairs to his landing and then by a heavy knock on his door he opened it and confronted jeff durgin  may i come in mr westover he asked with unwonted deference  yes come in said westover with no great relish setting his door open and then holding onto it a moment as if he hoped that having come in jeff might instantly go out again  his reluctance was lost upon jeff who said unconscious of keeping his hat on i want to talk with youi want to tell you something  all right wont you sit down  at this invitation jeff seemed reminded to take his hat off and he put it on the floor beside his chair im not in a scrape this timeor rather im in the worst kind of a scrape though it isnt the kind that you want bail for  yes westover prompted  i dont know whether youve noticedand if you havent it dont make any differencethat ive seemed tocare a good deal for miss vostrand  westover saw no reason why he should not be frank and said too much ive fancied sometimes for a student in his sophomore year  yes i know that well its over whether it was too much or too little he laughed in a joyless helpless way and looked deprecatingly at westover i guess ive been making a fool of myselfthats all  its better to make a fool of ones self than to make a fool of some one else said westover oracularly  yes said jeff apparently finding nothing more definite in the oracle than people commonly find in oracles but i think he went on with a touch of bitterness that her mother might have told me that she was engagedor the same as engaged  i dont know that she was bound to take you seriously or to suppose you took yourself so at your age and with your prospects in life if you want to knowwestover faltered and then went onshe began to be kind to you because she was afraid that you might think she didnt take your coming home secondcabin in the right way and one thing led to another you mustnt blame her for whats happened  westover defended mrs vostrand but he did not feel strong in her defence he was not sure that durgin was quite wrong absurd as he had been he sat down and looked up at his visitor under his brows  what are you here for jeff not to complain of mrs vostrand  jeff gave a short shamefaced laugh no its this youre such an old friend of mrs vostrands that i thought shed be pretty sure to tell you about it and i wanted to askto askthat you wouldnt say anything to mother  you are a boy i shouldnt think of meddling with your affairs said westover he got up again and jeff rose too  before noon the next day a district messenger brought westover a letter which he easily knew from the now belated tall angular hand to be from mrs vostrand it announced on a much crisscrossed little sheet that she and genevieve were inconsolably taking a very sudden departure and were going on the twelveoclock train to new york where mr vostrand was to meet them in regard to that affair which i mentioned last night he withdraws his objections we have had an overnight telegram and so i suppose all will go well i cannot tell you how sorry we both are not to see you again you have been such a dear good friend to us and if you dont hear from us again at new york you will from the other side genevieve had some very strange news when she came in and we both feel very sorry for the poor young fellow you must console him from us all you can i did not know before how much she was attached to gigi but it turned out very fortunately that she could say she considered herself bound to him and did everything to save mr ds feelings     xx  westover was not at lions head again till the summer before jeffs graduation in the mean time the hotel had grown like a living thing he could not have imagined wings in connection with the main edifice but it had put forth wingsone that sheltered a new and enlarged diningroom with two stories of chambers above and another that hovered a parlor and ballroom under a like provision of chambers an ell had been pushed back on the level behind the house the barn had been moved farther to the southward and on its old site a laundry built with quarters for the help over it all had been carefully frugally yet sufficiently done and westover was not surprised to learn that it was all the effect of jackson durgins ingenuity and energy mrs durgin confessed to having no part in it but she had kept pace with cynthia whitwells help in the housekeeping as jackson had cautiously felt his way to the needs of their public in the enlargement and rearrangement of the hotel the two housewives had watchfully studied not merely the demands but the halfconscious instincts of their guests and had responded to them simply and adequately in the spirit of jacksons exterior and structural improvements the walls of the new rooms were left unpapered and their floors uncarpeted there were thin rugs put down the woodwork was merely stained westover found that he need not to ask especially for some hot dish at night there was almost the abundance of a dinner though dinner was still at one oclock  mrs durgin asked him the first day if he would not like to go into the servingroom and see it while they were serving dinner she tried to conceal her pride in the busy scenethe waitresses pushing in through one valve of the doublehinged doors with their empty trays and out through the other with the trays full laden delivering their dishes with the broken victual at the wicket where the untouched portions were put aside and the rest poured into the waste following in procession along the reeking steamtable with its great tanks of soup and vegetables where the carvers stood with the joints and the trussed fowls smoking before them which they sliced with quick sweeps of their blades or waiting their turn at the board where the little plates with portions of fruit and dessert stood ready all went regularly on amid a clatter of knives and voices and dishes and the clashing rise and fall of the wire baskets plunging the soiled crockery into misty depths whence it came up clean and dry without the touch of finger or towel westover could not deny that there were elements of the picturesque in it so that he did not respond quite in kind to jeffs suggestionscene for a painter mr westover  the young fellow followed satirically at his mothers elbow and made a mock of her pride in it trying to catch westovers eye when she led him through the kitchen with its immense range and introduced him to a new chef who wiped his hand on his white apron to offer it to westover  dont let him get away without seeing the laundry mother her son jeered at a final air of absentmindedness in her and she defiantly accepted his challenge  jeffs mad because he wasnt consulted she explained and because we dont run the house like his onehorse european hotels  oh im not in it at all mr westover said the young fellow im as much a passenger as you are the only difference is that im allowed to work my passage  well one thing said his mother is that weve got a higher class of boarders than we ever had before youll see mr westover if you stay on here till august theres a class that boards all the year round and that knows what a hotel isabout as well as jeff i guess youll find em at the big city houses the first of the winter and then they go down to floridy or georgy for february and march and they get up to fortress monroe in april and work along north about the middle of may to them family hotels in the suburbs around boston and they stay there till its time to go to the shore they stay at the shore through july and then they come here in august and stay till the leaves turn theyre folks that live on their money and theyre the very highest class i guess its a round of gayety with em the whole year through  jeff from the vantage of his greater worldly experience was trying to exchange looks of intelligence with westover concerning those hoteldwellers whom his mother revered as aristocrats but he did not openly question her conceptions theyve told me how they do some of the ladies have she went on theyve got the money for it and they know how to get the most for their money why mr westover weve got rooms in this house now that we let for thirtyfive to fifty dollars a week for two persons and folks like that take em right along through august and september and want a room apiece its different now i can tell you from what it was when folks thought we was killin em if we wanted ten or twelve dollars  westover had finished his dinner before this tour of the house began and when it was over the two men strolled away together  you see its on the regular american lines jeff pursued after parting with his mother jacksons done it and he cant imagine anything else i dont say it isnt well done in its way but the ways wrong its stupid and clumsy when they were got so far from the hotel as to command a prospect of its ungainly mass sprawled upon the plateau his smouldering disgust burst out look at it did you ever see anything like it i wish the damned thing would burn upor down  westover was aware in more ways than one of jeffs exclusion from authority in the place where he was constantly set aside from the management as if his future were so definitely dedicated to another calling that not even his advice was desired or permitted and he could not help sympathizing a little with him when he chafed at his rejection he saw a great deal of him and he thought him quite up to the average of harvards seniors in some essentials he had been sobered apparently by experience his unfortunate loveaffair seemed to have improved him as the phrase is  they had some long walks and long talks together and in one of them jeff opened his mind if not his heart to the painter he wanted to be the landlord of the lions head which he believed he could make the best hotel in the mountains he knew of course that he could not hope to make any changes that did not suit his mother and his brother as long as they had the control but he thought they would let him have the control sooner if his mother could only be got to give up the notion of his being a lawyer as nearly as he could guess she wanted him to be a lawyer because she did not want him to be a hotelkeeper and her prejudice against that was because she believed that selling liquor made her father a drunkard  well now you know enough about me mr westover to know that drink isnt my danger  yes i think i do said westover  i went a little wild in my freshman year and i got into that scrape but ive never been the worse for liquor since fact is i never touch it now there isnt any more reason why i should take to drink because i keep a hotel than jackson but just that one time has set mother against it and i cant seem to make her understand that once is enough for me why i should keep a temperance house here of course you cant do anything else in these days if i was left to choose between hotelkeeping and any other life that i know of id choose it every time jeff went on after a moment of silence i like a hotel you can be your own man from the start the starts made here and ive helped to make it all youve got to do is to have commonsense in the hotel business and youre sure to succeed i believe ive got commonsense and i believe ive got some ideas that i can work up into a great success the reason that most people fail in the hotel business is that they waste so much and the landlord that wastes on his guests cant treat them well its got so now that in the big city houses they cant make anything on feeding people and so they try to make it up on the rooms i should feed them welli believe i know howand i should make money on my table as they do in europe  ive thought a good many things out my mind runs on it all the time but im not going to bore you with it now  oh not at all said westover id like to know what your ideas are  well some time ill tell you but look here mr westover i wish if mother gets to talking about me with you that youd let her know how i feel we cant talk together she and i without quarrelling about it but i guess you could put in a word that would show her i wasnt quite a fool she thinks ive gone crazy from seeing the way they do things in europe that im conceited and unpatriotic and i dont know what all jeff laughed as if with an inner fondness for his mothers wrongheadedness  and would you be willing to settle down here in the country for the rest of your life and throw away your harvard training on hotelkeeping  what do the other fellows do with their harvard training when they go into business as ninetenths of them do business is business whether you keep a hotel or import drygoods or manufacture cotton or run a railroad or help a big trust to cheat legally harvard has got to take a back seat when you get out of harvard but you dont suppose that keeping a summer hotel would mean living in the country the whole time do you thats the way mother does but i shouldnt it isnt good for the hotel even if i had such a place as lions head i should put a man and his family into it for the winter to look after it and i should go to town myselfto boston or new york or i might go to london or paris theyre not so far off and its so easy to get to them that you can hardly keep away jeff laughed and looked up at westover from the log where he sat whittling a pine stick westover sat on the stump from which the log had been felled eight or ten years before  you are modern he said  thats what i should do at first but i dont believe i should have lions head very long before i had another hotelin florida or the georgia uplands or north carolina somewhere i should take my help back and forth it would be as easy to run two hotels as oneeasier it would keep my hand in but if you want to know id rather stick here in the country year in and year out and run lions head than to be a lawyer and hang round trying to get a case for nine or ten years whos going to support me do you suppose i want to live on mother till im forty she dont think of that she thinks i can go right into court and begin distinguishing myself if i can fight the people off from sending me to congress id rather live in the country anyway i think towns the place for winter or twothree months of it and after that i havent got any use for it but mother shes got this oldfashioned ambition to have me go to a city and set up there she thinks that if i was a lawyer in boston i should be at the top of the heap but i know better than that and so do you and i want you to give her some little hint of how it really is how it takes family and money and a lot of influence to get to the top in any city  it occurred to westover and not for the first time that the frankest thing in jeff durgin was his disposition to use his friends it seemed to him that jeff was always asking something of him and it did not change the fact that in this case he thought him altogether in the right he said that if mrs durgin spoke to him of the matter he would not keep the light from her he looked behind him now for the first time in recognition of the place where they had stopped why this is whitwells clearing  didnt you know it jeff asked it changes a good deal every year and you havent been here for awhile have you  not since mrs marvens picnic said westover and he added quickly to efface the painful association which he must have called up by his heedless words  the woods have crowded back upon it so it cant be more than half its old size  no jeff assented he struck his heel against a fragment of the pine bough he had been whittling and drove it into the soft ground beside the log and said without looking up from it i met that woman at a dance last winter it wasnt her dance but she was running it as if it were just the way she did with the picnic she seemed to want to let bygones be bygones and i danced with her daughter shes a nice girl i thought mother did wrong about that now he looked at westover she couldnt help it but it wasnt the thing to do a hotel is a public house and you cant act as if it wasnt if mother hadnt known how to keep a hotel so well in other ways she might have ruined the house by not knowing in a thing like that but weve got some of the people with us this year that used to come here when we first took farmboarders mother dont know that theyre ever so much nicer socially than the people that take the fiftydollar rooms he laughed and then he said seriously if i ever had a son i dont believe i should let my pride in him risk doing him mischief and if youve a mind to let her understand that you believe im set against the law for good and all  i guess i shall not be your ambassador so far as that why dont you tell her yourself  she wont believe me said jeff with a laugh she thinks i dont know my mind and i dont like the way we differ when we differ we differ more than we mean to i dont pretend to say im always right she was right about that other picnicthe one i wanted to make for mrs vostrand i suppose he ended unexpectedly that you hear from them now and then  no i dont i havent heard from them for a year not sinceyou knew genevieve was married  yes i knew that said jeff steadily  i dont quite make it all out mr vostrand was very much opposed to it mrs vostrand told me but he must have given way at last and he must have put up the money jeff looked puzzled and westover explained you know the officers in the italian armyand all the other armies in europe for that matterhave to deposit a certain sum with the government before they can marry and in the case of count grassi mr vostrand had to furnish the money  jeff said after a moment well she couldnt help that  no the girl wasnt to blame i dont know that any one was to blame but im afraid our girls wouldnt marry many titles if their fathers didnt put up the money  well i dont see why they shouldnt spend their money that way as well as any other said jeff and this proof of his impartiality suggested to westover that he was not only indifferent to the mercenary international marriages which are a scandal to so many of our casuists but had quite outlived his passion for the girl concerned in this  at any rate jeff added i havent got anything to say against it mr westover ive always wanted to say one thing to you then i came to your room that night i wanted to complain of mrs vostrand for not letting me know about the engagement and i wasnt man enough to acknowledge that what you said would account for their letting me make a fool of myself but i believe i am now and i want to say it  im glad you can see it in that way said westover and since you do i dont mind saying that i think mrs vostrand might have been a little franker with you without being less kind she was kind but she wasnt quite frank  well its all over now said jeff and he rose up and brushed the whittlings from his knees and i guess its just as well     xxi  that afternoon westover saw jeff helping cynthia whitwell into his buckboard and then after his lively horse had made some paces of a start spring to the seat beside her and bring it to a stand can i do anything for you over at lovewell mr westover he called and he smiled toward the painter then he lightened the reins on the mares back she squared herself for a start in earnest and flashed down the sloping hotel road to the highway below and was lost to sight in the clump of woods to the southward  thats a good friend of yours cynthy he said leaning toward the girl with a simple comfort in her proximity she was dressed in a palepink color with a hat of yet paler pink without having a great deal of fashion she had a good deal of style she looked bright and fresh there was a dash of pink in her cheeks which suggested the color of the sweetbrier its purity and sweetness and if there was something in cynthias character and temperament that suggested its thorns too one still could not deny that she was like that flower she liked to shop and she liked to ride after a good horse as the neighbors would have said she was going over to lovewell to buy a number of things and jeff durgin was driving her there with the swift mare that was his peculiar property she smiled upon him without the usual reservations she contrived to express in her smiles  well i dont know anybody id rather have for my friend than mr westover she added he acted like a friend the very first time i saw him  jeff laughed with shameless pleasure in the reminiscence her words suggested well i did get my comeuppings that time and i dont know but hes been a pretty good friend to me too im not sure he likes me but mr westover is a man that could be your friend if he didnt like you  what have you done to make him like you asked the girl  nothing said jeff with a shout of laughter in his conviction ive done a lot of things to make him despise me from the start but if you like a person yourself you want him to like you whether you deserve it or not  i dont know as i do  you say that because you always deserve it you cant tell how it is with a fellow like me i should want you to like me cynthy whatever you thought of me he looked round into her face but she turned it away  they had struck the level long for the hill country at the foot of the hotel road and the mare that found herself neither mounting nor descending a steep dropped from the trot proper for an acclivity into a rapid walk  this mare can walk like a kentucky horse said jeff i believe i could teach her singlefoot he added with a laugh if i knew how and now cynthia laughed with him  i was just going to say that  yes you dont lose many chances to give me a dig do you  oh i dont know as i look for them perhaps i dont need to the pine woods were deep on either side they whispered in the thin sweet wind and gave out their odor in the high westering sun they covered with their shadows the road that ran velvety between them  this is nice said jeff letting himself rest against the back of the seat he stretched his left arm along the top and presently it dropped and folded itself about the waist of the girl  you may take your arm away jeff she said quietly  why  because it has no right there for one thing she drew herself a little aside and looked round at him you wouldnt put it round a town girl if you were riding with her  i shouldnt be riding with her girls dont go buggyriding in town any more said jeff brutally  then i shall know what to do the next time you ask me  oh theyd go quick enough if i asked them up here in the country etiquette dont count with them when theyre on a vacation  im not on a vacation so it counts with me please take your arm away said cynthia  oh all right but i shouldnt object to your putting your arm around me  you will never have the chance  why are you so hard on me cynthy asked jeff you didnt used to be so  people change  do i  not for the better  jeff was dumb she was pleased with her hit and laughed but her laugh did not encourage him to put his arm round her again he let the mare walk on and left her to resume the conversation at whatever point she would  she made no haste to resume it at last she said with sufficient apparent remoteness from the subject they had dropped jeff i dont know whether you want me to talk about it but i guess i ought to even if it isnt my place exactly i dont think jacksons very well this summer  jeff faced round toward her what makes you think he isnt well  hes weaker havent you noticed it  yes i have noticed that hes worked down thats all  no that isnt all but if you dont think so  i want to know what you think cynthy said jeff with the amorous resentment all gone from his voice sometimes folks outside notice the signs morei dont mean that youre an outsider as far as were concerned  she put by that point fathers noticed it too and hes with jackson a good deal  ill look after it if he isnt so well hes got to have a doctor that mediums stuff cant do him any good dont you think he ought to have a doctor  oh yes  you dont think a doctor can do him much good  he ought to have one said the girl noncommittally  cynthia ive noticed that jackson was weak too and its no use pretending that hes simply worked down i believe hes worn out do you think mothers ever noticed it  i dont believe she has  its the one thing i cant very well make up my mind to speak to her about i dont know what she would do he did not say if she lost jackson but cynthia knew he meant that and they were both silent of course he went on i know that she places a great deal of dependence upon you but jacksons her main stay hes a good man and hes a good son i wish id always been half as good  cynthia did not protest against his selfreproach as he possibly hoped she would she said i think jacksons got a very good mind he reads a great deal and hes thought a great deal and when it comes to talking i never heard any one express themselves better the other night we were out looking at the starsi came part of the way home with him i didnt like to let him go alone he seemed so feeble and he got to showing me mars he thinks its inhabited and hes read all that the astronomers say about it and the seas and the canals that theyve found on it he spoke very beautifully about the other life and then he spoke about death cynthias voice broke and she pulled her handkerchief out of her belt and put it to her eyes jeffs heart melted in him at the sight he felt a tender affection for her very unlike the gross content he had enjoyed in her presence before and he put his arm round her again but this time almost unconsciously and drew her toward him she did not repel him she even allowed her head to rest a moment on his shoulder though she quickly lifted it and drew herself away not resentfully it seemed but for her greater freedom in talking  i dont believe hes going to die jeff said consolingly more as if it were her brother than his that he meant but hes a very sick man and hes got to knock off and go somewhere it wont do for him to pass another winter here he must go to california or colorado theyd be glad to have him there either of them or he can go to florida or over to italy it wont matter how long he stays  what are you talking about jeff durgin cynthia demanded severely what would your mother do what would she do this winter  that brings me to something cynthia said jeff and i dont want you to say anything till ive got through i guess i could help mother run the place as well as jackson and i could stay here next winter  you  now you let me talk my minds made up about one thing im not going to be a lawyer i dont want to go back to harvard im going to keep a hotel and if i dont keep one here at lions head im going to keep it somewhere else  have you told your mother  not yet i wanted to hear what you would say first  i oh i havent got anything to do with it said cynthia  yes you have youve got everything to do with it if youll say one thing first cynthia you know how i feel about you its been so ever since we were boy and girl here i want you to promise to marry me will you  the girl seemed neither surprised nor very greatly pleased perhaps her pleasure had spent itself in that moment of triumphant expectation when she foresaw what was coming or perhaps she was preoccupied in clearing the way in her own mind to a definite result  what do you say cynthia jeff pursued with more injury than misgiving in his voice at her delay in answering dont youcare for me  oh yes i presume ive always done thatever since we were boy and girl as you say but  well said jeff patiently but not insecurely  have you  have i what  always cared for me  he could not find his voice quite as promptly as before he cleared his throat before he asked has mr westover been saying anything about me  i dont know what you mean exactly but i presume you do  well theni always expected to tell youi did have a fancy for that girl for miss vostrand and i told her so its like something that never happened she wouldnt have me thats all  and you expect me to take what she wouldnt have  if you like to call it that but i should call it taking a man that had been out of his head for a while and had come to his senses again  i dont know as i should ever feel safe with a man that had been out of his head once  you wouldnt find many men that hadnt said jeff with a laugh that was rather scornful of her ignorance  no i presume not she sighed she was beautiful and i believe she was good too she was very nice perhaps i feel strangely about it but if she hadnt been so nice i shouldnt have been so willing that you should have cared for her  i suppose i dont understand said jeff but i know i was hard hit whats the use its over shes married i cant go back and unlive it all but if you want time to thinkof course you doive taken time enough  he was about to lift the reins on the mares back as a sign to her that the talk was over for the present and to quicken her pace when cynthia put out her hand and laid it on his and said with a certain effect of authority i shouldnt want you should give up your last year in harvard  just as you say cynthy and in token of intelligence he wound his arm round her neck and kissed her it was not the first kiss by any means in the country kisses are not counted very serious or at all binding and cynthia was a country girl but they both felt that this kiss sealed a solemn troth between them and that a common life began for them with it     xxii  cynthia came back in time to go into the diningroom and see that all was in order there for supper before the door opened the waitresses knew that she had been out riding as they called it with jeff durgin the fact had spread electrically to them where they sat in a shady angle of the hotel listening to one who read a novel aloud and skipped all but the most exciting love parts they conjectured that the pair had gone to lovewell but they knew nothing more and the subtlest of them would not have found reason for further conjecture in cynthias behavior when she came in and scanned the tables and the girls dresses and hair where they stood ranged against the wall she was neither whiter nor redder than usual and her nerves and her tones were under as good control as a girls ever are after she has been out riding with a fellow it was not such a great thing anyway to ride with jeff durgin first and last nearly all the young lady boarders had been out with him upon one errand or another to lovewell  after supper when the girls had gone over to their rooms in the helps quarters and the guests had gathered in the wide low office in the light of the fire kindled on the hearth to break the evening chill jeff joined cynthia in her inspection of the diningroom she always gave it a last look to see that it was in perfect order for breakfast before she went home for the night jeff went home with her he was impatient of her duties but he was in no hurry when they stole out of the side door together under the stars and began to stray sidelong down the hill over the dewless grass  he lingered more and more as they drew near her fathers house in the abandon of a mans love he wished to give himself solely up to it to think and to talk of nothing else after a mans fashion but a womans love is no such mere delight it is serious practical for her it is all future and she cannot give herself wholly up to any present moment of it as a man does  now jeff she said after a certain number of partings in which she had apparently kept his duty clearly in mind you had better go home and tell your mother  oh theres time enough for that he began  i want you to tell her right away or there wont be anything to tell  is that so he joked back well if i must i must i suppose but i didnt think youd take the whiphand so soon cynthia  oh i dont ever want to take the whiphand with you jeff dont make me  well i wont then but what are you in such a hurry to have mother know for shes not going to object and if she does  it isnt that said the girl quickly if i had to go round a single day with your mother hiding this from her i should begin to hate you i couldnt bear the concealment i shall tell father as soon as i go in  oh your father ll be all right of course  yes hell be all right but if he wouldnt and i knew it i should have to tell him all the same now goodnight well there then and there now let me go  she paused for a moment in her own room to smooth her tumbled hair and try to identify herself in her glass then she went into the sittingroom where she found her father pulled up to the table with his hat on and poring over a sheet of hieroglyphics which represented the usual evening with planchette  have you been to help jackson up she asked  well i wanted to but he wouldnt hear of it hes feelin ever so much better tonight and he wanted to go alone i just come in  yes youve got your hat on yet  whitwell put his hand up and found that his daughter was right he laughed and said i guess i must a forgot it weve had the most interestin season with plantchette that i guess weve about ever had shes said something here  well never mind ive got something more important to say than plantchette has said cynthia and she pulled the sheet away from under her fathers eyes  this made him look up at her why whats happened  nothing jeff durgin has asked me to marry him  he has the new england training is not such as to fit people for the expression of strong emotion and the best that whitwell found himself able to do in view of the fact was to pucker his mouth for a whistle which did not come  yesthis afternoon said cynthia lifelessly the tension of her nerves relaxed in a languor which was evident even to her father though his eyes still wandered to the sheet she had taken from him  well you dont seem over and above excited about it diddid yourwhat did you say  how should i know what i said what do you think of it father  i dont know as i ever give the subject much attention said the philosopher i always meant to take it out of him somehow if he got to playin the fool  then you wanted i should accept him  what difference d it make what i wanted that what you done  yes ive accepted him said the girl with a sigh i guess ive always expected to  well i thought likely it would come to that myself all i can say cynthy is t hes a lucky feller  whitwell leaned back bracing his knees against the table which was one of his philosophic poses i have sometimes believed that jeff durgin was goin to turn out a blackguard hes got it in him hes as like his granfather as two peas and he was an old devil but you got to account in all these here heredity cases for counteractin influences the durgins are as good as wheat right along all of em and i guess mis durgins mother must have been a pretty good woman too mis durgins all right too if she has got a will of her own whitwell returned from his scientific inquiry to ask how ll she take it  i dont know said cynthia dreamily but without apparent misgiving thats jeffs lookout  so tis i guess she wont make much fuss a woman never likes to see her son get married but youve been a kind of daughter to her so long well i guess that part of it ll be all right jackson said whitwell in a tone of relief as if turning from an irrelevant matter to something of real importance was down here tonight tryin to ring up some them spirits from the planet mars martians he calls em his minds got to runnin a good deal on mars lately i guess its this apposition that they talk about that does it mars comin so much nearer the earth by a million of miles or so it stands to reason that he should be more influenced by the minds on it i guess its a case o that telepathy that mr westover tells about i judge that if he kept at it before mars gits off too far again he might make something out of it i couldnt seem to find much sense in what plantchette done tonight we couldnt either of us but she has her spells when you cant make head or tail of her but mebbe shes just leadin up to something the way she did about that broken shaft when jeff come home we hant ever made out exactly what she meant by that yet  whitwell paused and cynthia seized the advantage of his getting round to jeff again he wanted to give up going to harvard this last year but i wouldnt let him  jeff did asked her father well you done a good thing that time anyway cynthy his mother d never get over it  theres something else shes got to get over and i dont know how she ever will hes going to give up the law  give up the law  yes dont tease father he says hes never cared about it and he wants to keep a hotel i thought that id ought to tell him how we felt about jacksons having a rest and going off somewhere and he wanted to begin at once but i said if he left off the last year at harvard i wouldnt have anything to do with him  whitwell put his hand in his pocket for his knife and mechanically looked down for a stick to whittle in default of any he scratched his head i guess shell make it warm for him shes had her mind set on his studyin law so long t she wont give up in a hurry she cant see that jackson aint fit to help her run the hotel any moretill hes had a rest anywayand i believe she thinks her and frank could run itand you shell make an awful kick said whitwell solemnly i hope you didnt encourage him cynthy  i should encourage him said the girl hes got the right to shape his own life and nobody else has got the right to do it and i should tell his mother so if she ever said anything to me about it  all right said whitwell i suppose you know what youre about  i do father jeff would make a good landlord hes got ideas about a hotel and i can see that theyre the right ones hes been out in the world and hes kept his eyes open he will make lions head the best hotel in the mountains  its that already  he doesnt think its half as good as he can make it  it wouldnt be half what it is now if it want for you and frank  i guess he understands that said cynthia frank would be the clerk  got it all mapped out said whitwell proudly in his turn look out you dont slip up in your calculations thats all  i guess we chant slip up     xiii  jeff came into the ugly old family parlor where his mother sat mending by the kerosenelamp which she had kept through all the household changes and pushed enough of her work aside from the corner of the table to rest his arm upon it  mother i want you to listen to me and to wait till i get done will you  she looked up at him over her spectacles from the stocking she was darning the china egg gleamed through the frayed place what notion have you got in your head now  its about jackson he isnt well hes got to leave off work and go away  the mothers hand dropped at the end of the yarn she had drawn through the stocking heel and she stared at jeff then she resumed her work with the decision expressed in her tone your father lived to be sixty years old and jackson ant forty the doctor said there want any reason why he shouldnt live as long as his father did  im not saying he wont live to a hundred im saying he oughtnt to stay another winter here jeff said decisively  mrs durgin was silent for a time and then she said jeff is that your notion about jackson or whose is it  its mine now  mrs durgin waited a moment then she began with a feeling quite at variance with her words  well ill thank cynthy whitell to mind her own business of course she added and in what followed her feeling worked to the surface in her words i know t she thinks the world of jackson and he does of her and i presume she means well i guess shed be more apt to notice if there was any change than what i should what did she say  jeff told as nearly as he could remember and he told what cynthia and he had afterward jointly worked out as to the best thing for jackson to do mrs durgin listened frowningly but not disapprovingly as it seemed though at the end she asked and what am i going to do with jackson gone  jeff laughed with his head down well i guess you and cynthy could run it with frank and mr whitwell  mr whitell said mrs durgin concentrating in her accent of his name the contempt she could not justly pour out on the others  oh jeff went on i did think that i could take hold with you if you could bring yourself to let me off this last year at harvard  jeff said his mother reproachfully you know you dont mean that youd give up your last year in college  i do mean it but i dont expect you to do it and i dont ask it i suggested it to cynthy when we got to talking it over and she saw it wouldnt do  well she showed some sense that time mrs durgin said  i dont know when cynthy hasnt shown sense except once and then i guess it was my fault  what do you mean  why this afternoon i asked her to marry me some time and she said she would he looked at his mother and laughed and then he did not laugh he had expected her to be pleased he had thought to pave the way with this confession for the declaration of his intention not to study law and to make his engagement to cynthia serve him in reconciling his mother to the other fact but a menacing suspense followed his words  his mother broke out at last you asked cynthy whitell to marry you and she said she would well i can tell her she wont then  and i can tell you she will jeff stormed back he rose to his feet and stood over his mother  she began steadily as if he had not spoken if that designin  look out mother dont you say anything against cynthia shes been the best girl to you in the world and you know it shes been as true to you as jackson has himself she hasnt got a selfish bone in her body and shes so honest she couldnt design anything against you or any one unless she told you first now you take that back take it back shes no more designing thanthan you are  mrs durgin was not moved by his storming but she was inwardly convinced of error i do take it back cynthy is all right shes all you say and more its your fault then and youve got yourself to thank for whosever fault it is shell pack  if cynthy packs i pack said jeff understand that the moment she leaves this house i leave it too and ill marry her anyway frank d leave andandpshaw what do you care for that but i dont know what you mean i always thought you liked cynthy and respected her i didnt believe i could tell you a thing that would please you better than that she had said she would have me but if it dont all right  mrs durgin held her peace in bewilderment she stared at her son with dazed eyes under the spectacles lifted above her forehead she felt a change of mood in his unchanged tone of defiance and she met him halfway i tell you i take back what i called cynthia and i told you so butbut i didnt ever expect you to marry her  why didnt you there isnt one of the summer folks to compare with her shes got more sense than all of em ive known her ever since i can remember why didnt you expect it  i didnt expect it  oh i know you thought id see somebody in bostonsome swell girl well they wouldnt any of them look at me and if they would they wouldnt look at you  i shouldnt care whether they looked at me or not  i tell you they wouldnt look at me you dont understand about these things and i do they marry their own kind and im not their kind and i shouldnt be if i was daniel webster himself daniel webster who remembers him or cares for him or ever did you dont believe it you think that because ive been at harvardoh cant i make you see it im what they call a jay in harvard and harvard dont count if youre a jay  his mother looked at him without speaking she would not confess the ambition he taxed her with and perhaps she had nothing so definite in her mind perhaps it was only her pride in him and her faith in a splendid future for him that made her averse to his marriage in the lot she had always known and on a little lower level in it that her own she said at last  i dont know what you mean by being a jay but i guess we better not say anything more about this tonight  all right jeff returned there never were any formal goodnights between the durgins and he went away now without further words  his mother remained sitting where he left her two or three times she drew her empty darningneedle through the heel of the stocking she was mending  she was still sitting there when jackson passed on his way to bed after leaving the office in charge of the night porter he faltered as he went by and as he stood on the threshold she told him what jeff had told her  thats good he said lifelessly good for jeff he added thoughtfully conscientiously  why ant it good for her too demanded jeffs mother in quick resentment of the slight put upon him  i didnt say it want said jackson but its better for jeff  she may be very glad to get him  i presume she is shes always cared for him i guess shell know how to manage him  i dont know said mrs durgin as i like to have you talk so about jeff he was here just now wantin to give up his last year in harvard so s to let you go off on a vacation he thinks youve worked yourself down  jackson made no recognition of jeffs professed selfsacrifice i dont want any vacation im feeling firstrate now i guess that stuff i had from the writin medium has begun to take hold of me i dont know when ive felt so well i believe im going to get stronger than ever i was jeff say i needed a rest  something like a smile of compassion for the delusion of his brother dawned upon the sick mans wasted face which was blotched with large freckles and stared with dim large eyes from out a framework of grayish hair and grayish beard cut to the edges of the cheeks and chin     xxiv  mrs durgin and cynthia did not seek any formal meeting the next morning the course of their work brought them together but it was not till after they had transacted several household affairs of pressing importance that mrs durgin asked whats this about you and jeff  has he been telling you asked cynthia in her turn though she knew he had  yes said mrs durgin with a certain dryness which was half humorous i presume if you two are satisfied its all right  i guess were satisfied said the girl with a tremor of relief which she tried to hide  nothing more was said and there was no physical demonstration of affection or rejoicing between the women they knew that the time would come when they would talk over the affair down to the bone together but now they were content to recognize the fact and let the time for talking arrive when it would i guess said mrs durgin youd better go over to the helps house and see how that youngest miller girls gittin along shed ought to give up and go home if she ant fit for her work  ill go and see her said cynthia i dont believe shes strong enough for a waitress and i have got to tell her so  well returned mrs durgin glumly after a moments reflection i shouldnt want you should hurry her wait till shes out of bed and give her another chance  all right  jeff had been lurking about for the event of the interview and he waylaid cynthia on the path to the helps house  im going over to see that youngest miller girl she explained  yes i know all about that said jeff well mother took it just right didnt she you cant always count on her but i hadnt much anxiety in this case she likes you cynthia  i guess so said the girl demurely and she looked away from him to smile her pleasure in the fact  but i believe if she hadnt known you were with her about my last year in harvardit would have been different i could see when i brought it in that you wanted me to go back her mind was made up for you  why need you say anything about that  oh i knew it would clinch her i understand mother if you want something from her you mustnt ask it straight out you must propose something very disagreeable then when she refuses that you can come in for what you were really after and get it  i dont know said cynthia as i should like to think that your mother had been tricked into feeling right about me  tricked the color flashed up in jeffs face  not that jeff said the girl tenderly but you know what i mean i hope you talked it all out fully with her  fully i dont know what you mean  about your not studying law andeverything  i dont believe in crossing a river till i come to it said jeff i didnt say anything to her about that  you didnt  no what had it got to do with our being engaged  what had your going back to harvard to do with it if your mother thinks im with her in that shell think im with her in the other and im not im with you she let her hand find his as they walked side by side and gave it a little pressure  its the greatest thing cynthy he said breathlessly to have you with me in that but if you said i ought to study law i should do it  i shouldnt say that for i believe youre right but even if i believed you were wrong i shouldnt say it you have a right to make your life what you want it and your mother hasnt only she must know it and you must tell her at once  at once  yesnow what good will it do to put it off youre not afraid to tell her  i dont like you to use that word  and i dont like to use it but i know how it is youre afraid that the brunt of it will come on me shell think youre all right but im all wrong because i agree with you  something like that  well now im not afraid of anything she can say and what could she do she cant part us unless you let her and then i should let her too  but whats the hurry whats the need of doing it right off  because its a deceit not to do it its a lie  i dont see it in that light i might change my mind and still go on and study law  you know you never will now jeff why do you act so  jeff did not answer at once he walked beside her with a face of trouble that became one of resolve in the set jaws i guess youre right cynthy shes got to know the worst and the sooner she knows it the better  yes  he had another moment of faltering you dont want i should talk it over with mr westover  what has he got to do with it  thats true  if you want to see it in the right light you can think youve let it run on till after youre out of college and then youve got to tell her suppose she asked you how long you had made up your mind against the law how should you feel and if she asked me whether id known it all along and i had to say i had and that id supported and encouraged you in it how should i feel  she mightnt ask any such question said jeff gloomily cynthia gave a little impatient oh and he hastened to add but youre right ive got to tell her ill tell her tonight  dont wait till tonight do it now  now  yes and ill go with you as soon as ive seen the youngest miller girl they had reached the helps house now and cynthia said you wait outside here and ill go right back with you oh i hope it isnt doing wrong to put it off till ive seen that girl she disappeared through the door and jeff waited by the steps outside plucking up one long grass stem after another and biting it in two when cynthia came out she said i guess shell be all right now come and dontlose another second  youre afraid i shant do it if i wait any longer  im afraid i shant there was a silence after this  do you know what i think of you cynthy asked jeff hurrying to keep up with her quick steps youve got more courage  oh dont praise me or i shall break down  ill see that you dont break down said jeff tenderly its the greatest thing to have you go with me  why dont you see she lamented if you went alone and told your mother that i approved of it you would look as if you were afraid and wanted to get behind me and im not going to have that  they found mrs durgin in the dark entry of the old farmhouse and cynthia said with involuntary imperiousness come in here mrs durgin i want to tell you something  she led the way to the old parlor and she checked mrs durgins question has that miller girl  it isnt about her said cynthy pushing the door to its about me and jeff  mrs durgin became aware of jeffs presence with an effect of surprise there ant anything more is there  yes there is cynthia shrilled now jeff  its just this mother cynthy thinks i ought to tell youand she thinks i ought to have told you last nightshe expected me tothat im not going to study law  and i approve of his not doing it cynthia promptly followed and she put herself beside jeff where he stood in front of his mothers rockingchair  she looked from one to the other of the faces before her im sorry a son of mine she said with dignity had to be told how to act with his mother but if he had i dont know as anybody had a better right to do it than the girl thats going to marry him and ill say this cynthia whitwell before i say anything else youve begun right i wish i could say jeff had  there was an uncomfortable moment before cynthia said he expected to tell you  oh yes i know said his mother sadly she added sharply and did he expect to tell me what he intended to do for a livin  jeff took the word yes i did i intend to keep a hotel  what hotel asked mrs durgin with a touch of taunting in her tone  this one  the mother of the bold rebellious boy that jeff had been stirred in mrs durgins heart and she looked at him with the eyes that used to condone his mischief but she said i guess youll find out that theres more than one has to agree to that  yes there are two you and jackson and i dont know but what three if you count cynthy here  his mother turned to the girl you think this fellows got sense enough to keep a hotel  yes mrs durgin i do i think hes got good ideas about a hotel  and whats he goin to do with his college education  jeff interposed you think that all the college graduates turn out lawyers and doctors and professors some of em are mighty glad to sweep out banks in hopes of a clerkship and some take any sort of a place in a mill or a business house to work up and some bum round out west on cattle ranches and some if theyre lucky get newspaper reporters places at ten dollars a week  cynthia followed with the generalization i dont believe anybody can know too much to keep a hotel it wont hurt jeff if hes been to harvard or to europe either  i guess theres a pair of you said mrs durgin with superficial contempt she was silent for a time and they waited well there she broke out again ive got something to chew upon for a spell i guess go along now both of you and the next time youve got to face your mother jeff dont you come in lookin round anybodys petticoats ill see you later about all this  they went away with the joyful shame of children who have escaped punishment  thats the last of it cynthy said jeff  i guess so the girl assented with a certain grief in her voice i wish you had told her first  oh never mind that now cried jeff and in the dim passageway he took her in his arms and kissed her  he would have released her but she lingered in his embrace will you promise that if theres ever anything like it again you wont wait for me to make you  i like your having made me but i promise he said  then she tightened her arms round his neck and kissed him     xxv  the will of jeffs mother relaxed its grip upon the purpose so long held as if the mere strain of the tenacity had wearied and weakened it when it finally appeared that her ambition for her son was not his ambition for himself and would never be she abandoned it perhaps it was the easier for her to forego her hopes of his distinction in the world because she had learned before that she must forego her hopes of him in other ways she had vaguely fancied that with the acquaintance his career at harvard would open to him jeff would make a splendid marriage she had followed darkling and stumbling his course in society as far as he would report it to her and when he would not suffer her to glory in it she believed that he was forbidding her from a pride that would not recognize anything out of the common in it she exulted in his pride and she took all his snubbing reserves tenderly as so many proofs of his success  at the bottom of her heart she had both fear and contempt of all townspeople whom she generalized from her experience of them as summer folks of a greater or lesser silliness she often found herself unable to cope with them even when she felt that she had twice their sense she perceived that they had something from their training that with all her undisciplined force she could never hope to win from her own environment but she believed that her son would have the advantages which baffled her in them for he would have their environment and she had wished him to rivet his hold upon those advantages by taking a wife from among them and by living the life of their world her wishes of course had no such distinct formulation and the feeling she had toward cynthia as a possible barrier to her ambition had no more definition there had been times when the fitness of her marriage with jeff had moved the mothers heart to a jealousy that she always kept silent while she hoped for the accident or the providence which should annul the danger but genevieve vostrand had not been the kind of accident or the providence that she would have invoked and when she saw jeffs fancy turning toward her mrs durgin had veered round to cynthia all the same she kept a keen eye upon the young ladies among the summer folks who came to lions head and tacitly canvassed their merits and inclinations with respect to jeff in the oftenimagined event of his caring for any one of them she found that her artfully casual references to her sons being in harvard scarcely affected their mothers in the right way the fact made them think of the head waiters whom they had met at other hotels and who were working their way through dartmouth or williams or yale and it required all the force of jeffs robust personality to dissipate their erroneous impressions of him he took their daughters out of their arms and from under their noses on long drives upon his buckboard and it became a convention with them to treat his attentions somewhat like those of a powerful but faithful vassal  whether he was indifferent or whether the young ladies were coy none of these official flirtations came to anything he seemed not to care for one more than another he laughed and joked with them all and had an official manner with each which served somewhat like a disparity of years in putting them at their ease with him they agreed that he was very handsome and some thought him very talented but they questioned whether he was quite what you would call a gentleman it is true that this misgiving attacked them mostly in the mass singly they were little or not at all troubled by it and they severally behaved in an unprincipled indifference to it  mrs durgin had the courage of her own purposes but she had the fear of jeffs after the first pang of the disappointment which took final shape from his declaration that he was going to marry cynthia she did not really care much she had the habit of the girl she respected her she even loved her the children as she thought of them had known each other from their earliest days jeff had persecuted cynthia throughout his graceless boyhood but he had never intimidated her and his mother with all her weakness for him felt that it was well for him that his wife should be brave enough to stand up against him  she formulated this feeling no more than the others but she said to westover whom jeff bade her tell of the engagement it ant exactly as i could a wished it to be but i dont know as mothers are ever quite suited with their childrens marriages i presume its from always kind of havin had her round under my feet ever since she was born as you may say and seein her family always so shiftless well i cant say that of frank either hes turned out a fine boy but the father cynthy is one of the most capable girls smart as a trap and bright as a biscuit shes masterful too she need to have a will of her own with jeff  something of the insensate pride that mothers have in their childrens faults as their quick tempers or their wastefulness or their revengefulness expressed itself in her tone and it was perhaps this that irritated westover  i hope hell never let her know it i dont think a strong will is a thing to be prized and i shouldnt consider it one of cynthias good points the happiest life for her would be one that never forced her to use it  i dont know as i understand you exactly said mrs durgin with some dryness i know jeffs got rather of a domineering disposition but i dont believe but she can manage him without meetin him on his own ground as you may say  shes a girl in a thousand westover returned evasively  then you think hes shown sense in choosin of her pursued jeffs mother resolute to find some praise of him in westovers words  hes a very fortunate man said the painter  well i guess youre right mrs durgin acquiesced as much to jeffs advantage as she could you know i was always afraid he would make a fool of himself but i guess hes kept his eyes pretty well open all the while well she closed the subject with this exclamation him and cynthys been at me about jackson she added abruptly theyve cooked it up between em that hes out of health or run down or something  her manner referred the matter to westover and he said he isnt looking so well this summer he ought to go away somewhere  thats what they thought said mrs durgin smiling in her pleasure at having their opinion confirmed by the old and valued friend of the family  whereabouts do you think hed best go  oh i dont know italyor egypt  i guess if you could get jackson to go away at all it would be to some of them old bible countries said mrs durgin weve got to have a fight to get him off make the best of it and ive thought it over since the children spoke about it and i couldnt seem to see jackson willin to go out to californy or colorady to either of his brothers but i guess he would go to egypt that a good climate for thehis complaint  she entered eagerly into the question and westover promised to write to a boston doctor whom he knew very well and report jacksons case to him and get his views of egypt  tell him how it is said mrs durgin and the tussle we shall have to have anyway to make jackson believe hed ought to have a rest hell go to egypt if hell go anywheres because his mind keeps runnin on bible questions and it ll interest him to go out there and we can make him believe its just to bang around for the winter hes terrible hopeful now that she began to speak all her longrepressed anxiety poured itself out and she hitched her chair nearer to westover and wistfully clutched his sleeve thats the worst of jackson you cant make him believe anythings the matter sometimes i cant bear to hear him go on about himself as if he was a well young man he expects that mediums stuff is goin to cure him  people sick in that way are always hopeful said westover  oh dont i know it hant i seen my children and my husbandoh do ask that doctor to answer as quick as he can     xxvi  westover had a difficulty in congratulating jeff which he could scarcely define to himself but which was like that obscure resentment we feel toward people whom we think unequal to their good fortune he was ashamed of his grudge whatever it was and this may have made him overdo his expressions of pleasure he was sensible of a false cordiality in them and he checked himself in a flow of forced sentiment to say more honestly i wish youd speak to cynthia for me you know how much i think of her and how much i want to see her happy you ought to be a very good fellow jeff  ill tell her that shell like that said jeff she thinks the world of you  does she well  and i guess shell be glad you sent word shes been wondering what you would say shes always so afraid of you  is she youre not afraid of me are you but perhaps you dont think so much of me  i guess cynthia and i think alike on that point said jeff without abating westovers discomfort  there was a stress of sharp cold that year about the 20th of august then the weather turned warm again and held fine till the beginning of october within a week of the time when jackson was to sail it had not been so hard to make him consent when he knew where the doctor wished him to go and he had willingly profited by westovers suggestions about getting to egypt his interest in the matter which he tried to hide at first under a mask of decorous indifference mounted with the fire of whitwells enthusiasm and they held nightly councils together studying his course on the map and consulting planchette upon the points at variance that rose between them while jombateeste sat with his chair tilted against the wall and pulled steadily at his pipe which mixed its strong fumes with the smell of the kerosenelamp and the perennial odor of potatoes in the cellar under the low room where the companions forgathered  toward the end of september westover spent the night before he went back to town with them after a season with planchette their host pushed himself back with his knees from the table till his chair reared upon its hind legs and shoved his hat up from his forehead in token of philosophical mood  i tell you jackson he said youd ought to get hold o some them occult devils out there and squeeze their science out of em any buddhists in egypt mr westover  i dont think there are said westover unless jackson should come across some wandering hindu or he might push on and come home by the way of india  do it jackson his friend conjured him may cost you something more but it ll be worth the money if its true what some them blavetsky fellers claim you can visit us here in your astral bodygit in with em the right way i should like to have you try it whats the reason india wouldnt be as good for him as egypt anyway whitwell demanded of westover  i suppose the climates rather too moist the heat would be rather trying to him there  that so  and hes taken his ticket for alexandria westover pursued  well i guess thats so whitwell tilted his backward sloping hat to one side so as to scratch the northeast corner of his bead thoughtfully  but as far as that is concerned said westover and the doctrine of immortality generally is concerned jackson will have his hands full if he studies the egyptian monuments  what they got to do with it  everything egypt is the home of the belief in a future life it was carried from egypt to greece he might come home by way of athens  why man cried whitwell do you mean to say that them old hebrew saints josephs brethren that went down into egypt after corn didnt know about immortality and them egyptian devils did  theres very little proof in the old testament that the israelites knew of it  whitwell looked at jackson that the idee you got  i guess hes right said jackson theres something a little about it in job and something in the psalms but not a great deal  and we got it from them egyptian d  i dont say that westover interposed but they had it before we had as we imagine it we got it though christianity  jombateeste who had taken his pipe out of his mouth in a controversial manner put it back again  westover added but theres no question but the egyptians believed in the life hereafter and in future rewards and punishments for the deeds done in the body thousands of years before our era  well im dumned said whitwell  jombateeste took his pipe out again hit show they got good sense they knowthey feel it in their bonewhat goin appenwhen you dead me i guess they got some prophet find it hout for them then they goin take the credit  i guess thats something so jombateeste said whitwell it dont stand to reason that folks without any alphabet as you may say and only a lot of pictures for words like injuns could figure out the immortality of the soul they got the idee by inspiration somehow why here its like this them pharaohs must have always been clawin out for the hebrews before they got a hold of joseph and when they found out the true doctrine they hushed up where they got it and their priests went on teachin it as if it was their own  thats wat i say got it from the ebrew  well it dont matter a great deal where they got it so they got it said jackson as he rose  i believe ill go with you said westover  all there is about it said the sick man solemnly with a frail effort to straighten himself to which his sunken chest would not respond is this no man ever did figure that out for himself a man sees folks die and as far as his senses go they dont live again but somehow he knows they do and his knowledge comes from somewhere else its inspired  thats wat i say jombateeste hastened to interpose got it from the ebrew feel it in is bone  out under the stars jackson and westover silently mounted the hillside together at one of the thankyoumarms in the road the sick man stopped like a weary horse to breathe he took off his hat and wiped the sweat of weakness that had gathered upon his forehead and looked round the sky powdered with the constellations and the planets its sightly he whispered  yes it is fine westover assented but the stars of our northern nights are nothing to what youll see in egypt  jackson repeated vaguely egypt where i should like to go is mars he fixed his eyes on the flaming planets in a long stare but i suppose they have their own troubles same as we do they must get sick and die like the rest of us but i should like to know more about em you believe its inhabited dont you  westovers agnosticism did not somehow extend to mars yes ive no doubt of it  jackson seemed pleased ive read everything i can lay my hands on about it ive got a notion that if theres any choosin after we get through here i should like to go to mars for a while or as long as i was a little homesick still and wanted to keep as near the earth as i could he added quaintly  westover laughed you could study up the subject of irrigation there they say thats what keeps the parallel markings green on mars and telegraph a few hints to your brother in colorado after the martians perfect their signal code  perhaps the invalids fancy flagged he drew a long ragged breath i dont know as i care to leave home much if it want a kind of duty i shouldnt he seemed impelled by a sudden need to say how do you think jefferson and mother will make it out together  ive no doubt theyll manage said westover  theyre a good deal alike jackson suggested  westover preferred not to meet his overture youll be back you know almost as soon as the season commences next summer  yes jackson assented more cheerfully and now cynthys sure to be here  yes she will be here said westover not so cheerfully  jackson seemed to find the opening he was seeking in westovers tone what do you think of gettin married anyway mr westover he asked  we havent either of us thought so well of it as to try it jackson said the painter jocosely  think its a kind of chance  its a chance  jackson was silent then i ant one of them he said abruptly that think a mans goin to be made over by marryin this woman or that if he ant goin to be the right kind of a man himself he ant because his wifes a good woman sometimes i think that a mans wife is the last person in the world that can change his disposition she can influence him about this and about that but she cant change him it seems as if he couldnt let her if he tried and after the first startoff he dont try  thats true westover assented were terribly inflexible nothing but something like a change of heart as they used to call it can make us different and even then were apt to go back to our old shape when you look at it in that light marriage seems impossible yet it takes place every day  its a great risk for a woman said jackson putting on his hat and stirring for an onward movement but i presume that if the man is honest with her its the best thing she can have the great trouble is for the man to be honest with her  honesty is difficult said westover  he made jackson promise to spend a day with him in boston on his way to take the mediterranean steamer at new york when they met he yielded to an impulse which the invalids forlornness inspired and went on to see him off he was glad that he did that for though jackson was not sad at parting he was visibly touched by westovers kindness  of course he talked away from it i guess ive left em in pretty good shape for the winter at lions head he said ive got whitwell to agree to come up and live in the house with mother and shell have cynthy with her anyway and frank and jombateeste can look after the bosses easy enough  he had said something like this before but westover could see that it comforted him to repeat it and he encouraged him to do so in full he made him talk about getting home in the spring after the frost was out of the ground but he questioned involuntarily while the sick man spoke whether he might not then be lying under the sands that had never known a frost since the glacial epoch when the last warning for visitors to go ashore came jackson said with a wan smile while he held westovers hand i shant forget this very soon  write to me said westover     part ii     xxvii  jackson kept his promise to write to westover but he was better than his word to his mother and wrote to her every week that winter  i seem just to live from letter to letter its ridiclous she said to cynthia once when the girl brought the mail in from the barn where the men folks kept it till they had put away their horses after driving over from lovewell with it the trains on the branch road were taken off in the winter and the postoffice at the hotel was discontinued the men had to go to the town by cutter over a highway that the winds sifted half full of snow after it had been broken out by the oxteams in the morning but mrs durgin had studied the steamer days and calculated the time it would take letters to come from new york to lovewell and unless a blizzard was raging some one had to go for the mail when the day came it was usually jombateeste who reverted in winter to the type of habitant from which he had sprung he wore a blue woollen cap like a large sock pulled over his ears and close to his eyes and below it his cleanshaven brown face showed he had blue woollen mittens and boots of russet leather without heels came to his knees he got a pair every time he went home on st johns day his lean little body was swathed in several short jackets and he brought the letters buttoned into one of the innermost pockets he produced the letter from jackson promptly enough when cynthia came out to the barn for it and then he made a show of getting his horse out of the cutter shafts and shouting international reproaches at it till she was forced to ask havent you got something for me jombateeste  you expec some letter he said unbuckling a strap and shouting louder  you know whether i do give it to me  i don know i think i drop something on the road i saw something white maybe snow good deal of snow  dont plague give it here  wait i finish unhitch i cant find any letter till i get some time to look  oh now jombateeste give me my letter  wat you want letter for always same thing well old the oss i goin to feel  jombateeste felt in one pocket after another while cynthia clung to the colts bridle and he was uncertain till the last whether he had any letter for her when it appeared she made a flying snatch at it and ran and the comedy was over to be repeated in some form the next week  the girl somehow always possessed herself of what was in her letters before she reached the room where mrs durgin was waiting for hers she had to read that aloud to jacksons mother and in the evening she had to read it again to mrs durgin and whitwell and jombateeste and frank after they had done their chores and they had gathered in the old farmhouse parlor around the airtight sheetiron stove in a heat of eighty degrees whitwell listened with planchette ready on the table before him and he consulted it for telepathic impressions of jacksons actual mental state when the reading was over  he got very little out of the perverse instrument i cant seem to work her if jackson was here  we shouldnt need to ask planchette about him cynthia once suggested with the spare sense of humor that sometimes revealed itself in her  well i guess thats something so her father candidly admitted but the next time he consulted the helpless planchette as hopefully as before you cant tell you cant tell he urged  the trouble seems to be that planchette cant tell said mrs durgin and they all laughed they were not people who laughed a great deal and they were each intent upon some point in the future that kept them from pleasure in the present the little canuck was the only one who suffered himself a contemporaneous consolation his early faith had so far lapsed from him that he could hospitably entertain the wild psychical conjectures of whitwell without an accusing sense of heresy and he found the winter of northern new england so mild after that of lower canada that he experienced a high degree of animal comfort in it and looked forward to nothing better to be well fed well housed and well heated to smoke successive pipes while the others talked and to catch through his smokewreaths vague glimpses of their meanings was enough he felt that in being promoted to the care of the stables in jacksons absence he occupied a dignified and responsible position with a confidential relation to the exile which justified him in sending special messages to him and attaching peculiar value to jacksons remembrances  the exiles letters said very little about his health which in the sense of no news his mother held to be good news but they were full concerning the monuments and the ethnological interest of life in egypt  they were largely rescripts of each days observations and experiences close and full as his mother liked them in regard to fact and generously philosophized on the side of politics and religion for whitwell the eastern question became in the snowchoked hills of new england the engrossing concern of this speculative mind and he was apt to spring it upon mrs durgin and cynthia at mealtimes and other defenceless moments he tried to debate it with jombateeste who conceived of it as a form of spiritualistic inquiry and answered from the hayloft where he was throwing down fodder for the cattle to whitwell volubly receiving it on the barn floor below that he believed him everybody got a hastral body english same as mormons  guess you mean moslems said whitwell and jombateeste asked the difference defiantly  the letters which came to cynthia could not be made as much a general interest and in fact no one else cared so much for them as for jacksons letters not even jeffs mother after cynthia got one of them she would ask perfunctorily what jeff said but when she was told there was no news she did not press her question  if jackson dont get back in time next summer mrs durgin said in one of the talks she had with the girl i guess i shall have to let jeff and you run the house alone  i guess we shall want a little help from you said cynthia demurely she did not refuse the implication of mrs durgins words but she would not assume that there was more in them than they expressed  when jeff came home for the three days vacation at thanksgiving he wished again to relinquish his last year at harvard and cynthia had to summon all her forces to keep him to his promise of staying he brought home the books with which he was working off his conditions with a halfhearted intention of study and she took hold with him and together they fought forward over the ground he had to gain his mother was almost willing at last that he should give up his last year in college  what is the use she asked hes give up the law and he might as well commence here first as last if hes goin to  the girl had no reason to urge against this she could only urge her feeling that he ought to go back and take his degree with the rest of his class  if youre going to keep lions head the way you pretend you are she said to him as she could not say to his mother you want to keep all your harvard friends dont you and have them remember you go back jeff and dont you come here again till after youve got your degree never mind the christmas vacation nor the easter stay in cambridge and work off your conditions you can do it if you try oh dont you suppose i should like to have you here she reproached him  he went back with a kind of grudge in his heart which he confessed in his first letter home to her when he told her that she was right and he was wrong he was sure now with the impulse which their work on them in common had given him that he should get his conditions off and he wanted her and his mother to begin preparing their minds to come to his class day he planned how they could both be away from the hotel for that day the house was to be opened on the 20th of june but it was not likely that there would be so many people at once that they could not give the 21st to class day frank and his father could run lions head somehow or if they could not then the opening could be postponed till the 24th at all events they must not fail to come cynthia showed the whole letter to his mother who refused to think of such a thing and then asked as if the fact had not been fully set before her when is it to be  the 21st of june  well hes early enough with his invitation she grumbled  yes he is said cynthia and she laughed for shame and pleasure as she confessed i was thinking he was rather late  she hung her head and turned her face away but mrs durgin understood you ben expectin it all along then  i guess so  i presume said the elder woman that hes talked to you about it he never tells me much i dont see why you should want to go whats it like  oh i dont know but its the day the graduating class have to themselves and all their friends come  well i dont know why anybody should want to go said mrs durgin i shant tell him he wont want to own me when he sees me what am i goin to wear i should like to know what you goin to wear cynthy     xxviii  jeffs place at harvard had been too long fixed among the jays to allow the hope of wholly retrieving his condition now it was too late for him to be chosen in any of the nicer clubs or societies but he was not beyond the mounting sentiment of comradery which begins to tell in the last year among college men and which had its due effect with his class one of the men who had always had a foible for humanity took advantage of the prevailing mood in another man and wrought upon him to ask among the fellows he was asking to a tea at his rooms several fellows who were distinctly and almost typically jay the tea was for the aunt of the man who gave it a very pretty woman from new york and it was so richly qualified by young people of fashion from boston that the infusion of the jay flavor could not spoil it if it would not rather add an agreeable piquancy this college mood coincided that year with a benevolent emotion in the larger world from which fashion was not exempt society had just been stirred by the reading of a certain book which had then a very great vogue and several people had been down among the wretched at the north end doing good in a consciencestricken effort to avert the millennium which the book in question seemed to threaten the lady who matronized the tea was said to have done more good than you could imagine at the north end and she caught at the chance to meet the college jays in a spirit of christian charity when the man who was going to give the tea rather sheepishly confessed what the altruistic man had got him in for she praised him so much that he went away feeling like the hero of a holy cause she promised the assistance and sympathy of several brave girls who would not be afraid of all the jays in college  after all only one of the jays came not many in fact had been asked and when jeff durgin actually appeared it was not known that he was both the first and the last of his kind the lady who was matronizing the tea recognized him with a throe of her quickened conscience as the young fellow whom she had met two winters before at the studio tea which mr westover had given to those queer florentine friends of his and whom she had never thought of since though she had then promised herself to do something for him she had then even given him some vague hints of a prospective hospitality and she confessed her sin of omission in a swift but graphic retrospect to one of her brave girls while jeff stood blocking out a space for his stalwart bulk amid the alien elegance just within the doorway and the host was making his way toward him with an outstretched hand of hardy welcome  at an earlier period of his neglect and exclusion jeff would not have responded to the belated overture which had now been made him for no reason that he could divine but he had nothing to lose by accepting the invitation and he had promised the altruistic man whom he rather liked he did not dislike the giver of the tea so much as some other men and so he came  the brave girl whom the matron was preparing to devote to him stood shrinking with a trepidation which she could not conceal at sight of his strange massiveness with his rustgold hair coming down toward his thick yellow brows and mocking blue eyes in a dense bang and his jaw squaring itself under the rather insolent smile of his full mouth the matron felt that her victim teas perhaps going to fail her when a voice at her ear said as if the question were extorted who in the world is that  she instantly turned and flashed out in a few inspired syllables the fact she had just imparted to her treacherous heroine do let me introduce him miss lynde i must do something for him when he gets up to me if he ever does  by all means said the girl who had an impulse to laugh at the rude force of jeffs face and figure so disproportioned to the occasion and she vented it at the matrons tribulation the matron was shaking hands with people right and left and exchanging inaudible banalities with them she did not know what the girl said in answer but she was aware that she remained near her she had professed her joy at seeing jeff again when he reached her and she turned with him and said let me present you to miss lynde mr durgin and so abandoned them to each other  as jeff had none of the anxiety for social success which he would have felt at an earlier period he now left it to miss lynde to begin the talk or not as she chose he bore himself with so much indifference that she was piqued to an effort to hold his eyes that wandered from her to this face and that in the crowd  do you find many people you know mr durgin  i dont find any  i supposed you didnt from the way you looked at them  how did i look at them  as if you wanted to eat them and one never wants to eat ones friends  why  oh i dont know they wouldnt agree with one  jeff laughed and he now took fuller note of the slender girl who stood before him and swayed a little backward in a graceful curve he saw that she had a dull thick complexion with liquid eyes set wide apart and slanted upward slightly and a nose that was deflected inward from the straight line but her mouth was beautiful and vividly red like a crimson blossom  couldnt you find me some place to sit down mr durgin she asked  he had it on his tongue to say well not unless you want to sit down on some enemy but he did not venture this when it comes to daring of that sort the boldest man is commonly a little behind a timid woman  several of the fellows had clubbed their rooms and lent them to the man who was giving the tea he used one of the apartments for a cloakroom and he meant the other for the social overflow from his own but people always prefer to remain dammedup together in the room where they are received and miss lynde looked between the neighboring heads and over the neighboring shoulders and saw the borrowed apartment quite empty at the moment of this discovery the host came fighting his way up to make sure that jeff had been provided for in the way of introductions he promptly introduced him to miss lynde she said oh thats been done cant you think of something new jeff liked the style of this i dont mind it but im afraid mr durgin must find it monotonous  oh well do something original yourself then miss lynde said the host start a movement for that room across the passage thats mine too for the occasion and save some of these peoples lives its suffocating in here  i dont mind saving mr durgins said the girl if he wants it saved  oh i know hes just dying to have you save it said the host and he left them to inspire other people to follow their example but such as glanced across the passage into the overflow room seemed to think it now the possession solely of the pioneers of the movement at any rate they made no show of joining them and after miss lynde and jeff had looked at the pictures on the walls and the photographs on the mantel of the room where they found themselves they sat down on chairs fronting the open door and the door of the room they had left the windowseat would have been more to jeffs mind and he had proposed it but the girl seemed not to have heard him she took the deep easychair in full view of the company opposite and left him to pull up a chair beside her  i always like to see the pictures in a mans room she said with a little sigh of relief from their inspection and a partial yielding of her figure to the luxury of the chair then i know what the man is this mani dont know whose room it isseems to have spent a good deal of his time at the theatre  isnt that where most of them spend their time asked jeff  im sure i dont know is that where you spend yours  it used to be im not spending my time anywhere just now she looked questioningly and he added i havent got any to spend  oh indeed is that a reason why dont you spend somebody elses  nobody has any that i know  youre all working off conditions you mean  thats what im doing or trying to  then its never certain whether you can do it after all  not so certain as to be free from excitement said jeff smiling  and are you consumed with the melancholy that seems to be balling up all the men at the prospect of having to leave harvard and go out into the hard cold world  i dont look it do i jeff asked  no you dont and you dont feel it youre not trying concealment and so forth  no if id had my own way id have left harvard before this he could see that his bold assumption of difference or indifference told upon her i couldnt get out into the hard cold world too soon  how fearless most of them dont know what theyre going to do in it  i do  and what are you going to do or perhaps you think thats asking  oh no im going to keep a hotel  he had hoped to startle her but she asked rather quietly what do you mean and she added as if to punish him for trying to mystify her ive heard that it requires gifts for that isnt there some proverb  yes but im going to try to do it on experience he laughed and he did not mind her trying to hit him for he saw that he had made her curious  do you mean that you have kept a hotel  for three generations he returned with a gravity that mocked her from his bold eyes  im sure i dont know what you mean she said indifferently where is your hotel in bostonnew yorkchicago  its in the countryits a summer hotel he said as before  she looked away from him toward the other room theres my brother i didnt know he was coming  shall i go and tell him where you are jeff asked following the direction of her eyes  no no he can find me said the girl sinking back in her chair again he left her to resume the talk where she chose and she said if its something ancestral of course  i dont know as its that exactly my grandfather used to keep a country tavern and so its in the blood but the hotel i mean is something that weve worked up into from a farm boardinghouse  you dont talk like a country person the girl broke in abruptly  not in cambridge i do in the country  and so she prompted youre going to turn it into a hotel when youve got out of harvard  its a hotel already and a pretty big one but im going to make the right kind of hotel of it when i take hold of it  and what is the right kind of a hotel  thats a long story it would make you tired  it might but weve got to spend the time somehow you could begin and then if i couldnt stand it you could stop  its easier to stop first and begin some other time i guess ill let you imagine my hotel miss lynde  oh i understand now said the girl the table will be the great thing you will stuff people  do you mean that im trying to stuff you  how do i know you never can tell what men really mean  jeff laughed with mounting pleasure in her audacity that imparted a sense of tolerance for him such as he had experienced very seldom from the boston girls he had met after all he had met but few it flattered him to have her doubt what he had told her in his reckless indifference it implied that he was fit for better things than hotelkeeping  you never can tell how much a woman believes he retorted  and you keep trying to find out  no but i think that they might believe the truth  youd better try them with it  well i will do you really want to know what im going to do when i get through  let me see miss lynde leaned forward with her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and softly kicked the edge of her skirt with the toe of her shoe as if in deep thought jeff waited for her to play her comedy through yes she said i think i did wish to knowat one time  but you dont now  now how can i tell it was a great while ago  i see you dont  miss lynde did not make any reply she asked do you know my aunt durgin  i didnt know you had one  yes everybody has an aunteven when they havent a mother if you can believe the gilbert operas i ask because i happen to live with my aunt and if you knew her she mightask you to call miss lynde scanned jeffs face for the effect of this  he said gravely if youll introduce me to her ill ask her to let me  would you really said the girl ive half a mind to try i wonder if youd really have the courage  i dont think im easily rattled  you mean that im trying to rattle you  no  im not my aunt is just what ive said  you havent said what she was is she here  no thats the worst of it if she were i should introduce you just to see if youd dare well some other time i will  you think therell be some other time jeff asked  i dont know there are all kinds of times bytheway what time is it  jeff looked at his watch quarter after six  then i must go she jumped to her feet and faced about for a glimpse of herself in the little glass on the mantel and put her hand on the large pink roses massed at her waist one heavy bud dropped from its stem to the floor where while she stood the edge of her skirt pulled and pushed it she moved a little aside to peer over at a photograph jeff stooped and picked up the flower which he offered her  you dropped it he said bowing over it  did i she looked at it with an effect of surprise and doubt  i thought so but if you dont i shall keep it  the girl removed her careless eyes from it when they break off so short they wont go back  if i were a rose i should want to go back said jeff  she stopped in one of her many aversions and reversions and looked at him steadily across her shoulder you wont have to keep a poet mr durgin  thank you i always expected to write the circulars myself ill send you one  do  with this rose pressed between the leaves so youll know  that would be very pretty but you must take me to mrs bevidge now if you can  i guess i can said jeff and in a minute or two they stood before the matronizing hostess after a passage through the babbling and laughing groups that looked as impossible after they had made it as it looked before  mrs bevidge gave the girls hand a pressure distinct from the official touch of parting and contrived to say for her hearing alone thank you so much bessie youve done missionary work  i shouldnt call it that  it will do for you to say so he wasnt really so bad then thank you again dear  jeff had waited his turn but now after the girl had turned away as if she had forgotten him his eyes followed her and he did not know that mrs bevidge was speaking to him miss lynde had slimly lost herself in the mass till she was only a graceful tilt of hat before she turned with a distraught air when her eyes met jeffs they lighted up with a look that comes into the face when one remembers what one has been trying to think of she gave him a brilliant smile that seemed to illumine him from head to foot and before it was quenched he felt as if she had kissed her hand to him from her rich mouth  then he heard mrs bevidge asking something about a hall and he was aware of her bending upon him a look of the daring humanity that had carried her triumphantly through her good works at the north end  oh im not in the yard said jeff with belated intelligence  then will just cambridge reach you  he gave his number and street and she thanked him with the benevolence that availed so much with the lower classes he went away thrilling and tingling with that girls tones in his ear her motions in his nerves and the colors of her face filling his sight which he printed on the air whenever he turned as one does with a vivid light after looking at it     xxix  when jeff reached his room he felt the need of writing to cynthia with whatever obscure intention of atonement he told her of the college tea he had just come from and made fun of it and the kind of people he had met especially the affected girl who had tried to rattle him he said he guessed she did not think she had rattled him a great deal  while he wrote he kept thinking how this miss lynde was nearer his early ideal of fashion of high life which westover had pretty well snubbed out of him than any woman he had seen yet she seemed a girl who would do what she pleased and would not be afraid if it did not please other people he liked her having tried to rattle him and he smiled to himself in recalling her failure it was as if she had laid hold of him with her little hands to shake him and had shaken herself he laughed out in the dark when this image came into his mind its intimacy flattered him and he believed that it was upon some hint from her that mrs bevidge had asked his address she must be going to ask him to her house and very soon for it was part of jeffs meagre social experience that this was the way swells did they might never ask you twice but they would ask you promptly  the thing that mrs bevidge asked jeff to when her note reached him the second day after the tea was a meeting to interest young people in the work at the north end and jeff swore under his breath at the disappointment and indignity put upon him he had reckoned upon an afternoon tea at least or even in the flights of fancy which he now disowned to himself a dance after the midyears or possibly an earlier reception of some sort he burned with shame to think of a theatreparty which he had fondly specialized with a seat next miss lynde  he tore mrs bevidges note to pieces and decided not to answer it at all as the best way of showing how he had taken her invitation but mrs bevidges benevolence was not wanting in courage she believed that jeff should pay his footing in society such as it was and should allow himself to be made use of the first thing when she had no reply from him she wrote him again asking him to an adjourned meeting of the first convocation which had been so successful in everything but numbers this time she baited her hook in hoping that the young men would feel something of the interest the young ladies had already shown in the matter she expressed the fear that mr durgin had not got her earlier letter and she sent this second to the care of the man who had given the tea  jeffs resentment was now so far past that he would have civilly declined to go to the womans house but all his hopes of seeing that girl as he always called miss lynde in his thought were revived by the mention of the young ladies interested in the cause he accepted though all the way into boston he laid wagers with himself that she would not be there and up to the moment of taking her hand he refused himself any hope of winning  there was not much business before the meeting that had really been all transacted before it was mainly to make sure of the young men who were present in the proportion of one to five young ladies at least mrs bevidge explained that she had seen the wastefulness of amateur effort among the poor and announced that hereafter she was going to work with the established charities these were very much in want of visitors especially young men to go about among the applicants for relief and inquire into their real necessities and get work for them she was hers self going to act as secretary for the meetings during the coming month and apparently she wished to signalize her accession to the regular forces of charity by bringing into camp as large a body of recruits as she could  but jeff had not come to be made use of or as a jay who was willing to work for his footing in society he had come in the hope of meeting miss lynde and now that he had met her he had no gratitude to mrs bevidge as a means and no regret for the defeat of her good purposes so far as she intended their fulfilment in him he was so cool and selfpossessed in excusing himself for reasons that he took no pains to make seem unselfish that the altruistic man who had got him asked to the college tea as a friendless jay felt it laid upon him to apologize for mrs bevidges want of tact  she means well and shes very much in earnest in this work but i must say she can make herself very offensivewhen she doesnt try she has a right to ask our help but not to parade us as the captives of her bow and spear  oh thats all right said jeff he perceived that the amiable fellow was claiming for all an effect that jeff knew really implicated himself alone i couldnt load up with anything of that sort if im to work off my conditions you know  are you in that boat said the altruist as if he were too and he put his hand compassionately on jeffs iron shoulder and left him to miss lynde whose side he had not stirred from since he had found her  it seems to me she said that where there are so many of you in the same boat you might manage to get ashore somehow  yes or all go down together jeff laughed and ate mrs bevidges breadandbutter and drank her tea with a relish unaffected by his refusal to do what she asked him he was right perhaps and perhaps she deserved nothing better at his hands but the altruist when he glanced at him from the other side of the room thought that he had possibly wasted his excuses upon jeffs selfcomplacence  he went away in a halo of young ladies several of the other girls grouped themselves in their departure and it happened that miss lynde and jeff took leave together mrs bevidge said to her with the caressing tenderness of one in the same set goodbye dear to jeff she said with the cold conscience of those whom their nobility obliges i am always at home on thursdays mr durgin  oh thank you said jeff he understood what the words and the manner meant together but both were instantly indifferent to him when he got outside and found that miss lynde was not driving something which was neither look nor smile nor word of course but nothing more at most than a certain pull and tilt of the shoulder as she turned to walk away from mrs bevidges door told him from her that he might walk home with her if he would not seem to do so  it was one of the pink evenings dry and clear that come in the boston december and they walked down the sidehill street under the delicate tracery of the elm boughs in the face of the metallic sunset in the section of the charles that the perspective of the street blocked out the wrinkled current showed as if glazed with the hard color jeffs strong frame rejoiced in the cold with a hale pleasure when he looked round into the face of the girl beside him with the gray film of her veil pressed softly against her red mouth by her swift advance their faces were nearly on a level as they looked into each others eyes and he kept seeing the play of the veils edge against her lips as they talked  why shant you go to mrs bevidges thursdays she asked theyre very nice  how do you know im not going he retorted  by the way you thanked her  do you advise me to go  i havent got anything to do with it what do mean by that  i dont know curiosity i suppose  well i do advise you to go said the girl shall you be there next thursday  i i never go to mrs bevidges thursdays  touche said jeff and they both laughed can you always get in at an enemy that way  enemy  well friend its the same thing  i see said the girl you belong to the pessimistic school of seniors  why dont you try to make an optimist of me  would it be worth while  that isnt for me to say  dont be diffident thats staler yet  ill be anything you like  im not sure you could for an instant jeff did not feel the point and he had not the magnanimity when he did to own himself touched again apparently if this girl could not rattle him she could beat him at fence and the will to dominate her began to stir in him if he could have thought of any sarcasm no matter how crushing he would have come back at her with it he could not think of anything and he walked at her side inwardly chafing for the chance which would not come  when they reached her door there was a young man at the lock with a latchkey which he was not making work for after a bated blasphemy of his failure he turned and twitched the bell impatiently  miss lynde laughed provokingly and he looked over his shoulder at her and at jeff who felt his injury increased by the disadvantage this young man put him at jeff was as correctly dressed he wore a silk hat of the last shape and a long frockcoat he was properly gloved and shod his clothes fitted him and were from the best tailor but at sight of this young man in clothes of the same design he felt illdressed he was in like sort aware of being rudely blocked out physically and coarsely colored as to his blond tints of hair and eye and cheek even the sinister something in the young mans look had distinction and there was style in the signs of dissipation in his handsome face which jeff saw with a hunger to outdo him  miss lynde said to jeff my brother mr durgin and then she added to the other you ought to ring first arthur and try your key afterward  the keys all right said the young man without paying any attention to jeff beyond a glance of recognition he turned his back and waited for the door to be opened  his sister suggested with an amiability which jeff felt was meant in reparation to him perhaps a night latch never works before darkor very well before midnight the door was opened and she said to jeff with winning entreaty wont you come in mr durgin  jeff excused himself for he perceived that her politeness was not so much an invitation to him as a defiance to her brother he gave her credit for no more than it was worth and he did not wish any the less to get even with her because of it     xxx  at dinner in the absence of the butler alan lynde attacked his sister across the table for letting herself be seen with a jay who was not only a jay but a cad and personally so offensive to most of the college men that he had never got into a decent club or society he had been suspended the first year and if he had not had the densest kind of cheek he would never have come back lynde said he would like to know where she had picked the fellow up  she answered that she had picked him up if that was the phrase he liked at mrs bevidges and then alan swore a little so as not to be heard by their aunt who sat at the head of the table and looked down its length between them serenely ignorant in her slight deafness of what was going on between them to her perception alan was no more vehement than usual and bessie no more smilingly selfcontained he said he supposed that it was some more of lancasters damned missionary work then and he wondered that a gentleman like morland had ever let lancaster work such a jay in on him he had seen her afficher herself with the fellow at morlands tea he commanded her to stop it and he professed to speak for her good  bessie returned that she knew how strongly he felt from the way he had misbehaved when she introduced him to mr durgin but that she supposed he had been at the club and his nerves were unstrung was that the reason perhaps why he could not make his latchkey work mr durgin might be a cad and she would not say he was not a jay but so far he had not sworn at her and if he had been suspended and come back there were some people who had not been suspended or come back either though that might have been for want of cheek  she ended by declaring she was used to going into society without her brothers protection or even his company and she would do her best to get on without his advice or was it his conduct he wished her to profit by  it had come to the fish going out by this time and alan who had eaten with no appetite and drunken feverishly of apollinaris flung down his napkin and went out too  what is the matter asked his aunt looking after him  bessie shrugged but she said presently with her lips more than her voice i dont think he feels very well  do you think he  the girl frowned assent and the meal went on to its end then she and her aunt went into the large dull library where they passed the evenings which bessie did not spend in some social function these evenings were growing rather more frequent with her advancing years for she was now nearly twentyfive and there were few seniors so old she was not the kind of girl to renew her youth with the sophomores and freshmen in the classes succeeding the class with which she had danced through college so far as she had kept up the old relation with students she continued it with the men who had gone into the lawschool but she saw less and less of these without seeing more of other men and perhaps in the last analysis she was not a favorite she was allowed to be fascinating but she was not felt to be flattering and people would rather be flattered than fascinated in fact the men were mostly afraid of her and it has been observed of girls of this kind that the men who are not afraid of them are such as they would do well to be afraid of whether that was quite the case with bessie lynde or not it was certain that she who was always the cleverest girl in the room and if not the prettiest then the most effective had not the best men about her her men were apt to be those whom the other girls called stupid or horrid and whom it would not be easy though it might be more just to classify otherwise the other girls wondered what she could see in them but perhaps it was not necessary that she should see anything in them if they could see all she wished them to see and no more in her  the room where tea was now brought and put before her was volumed round by the collections of her grandfather except for the spaces filled by his portrait and that of earlier ancestors going back to the time when copley made masterpieces of his fellowbostonians her aunt herself looked a family portrait of the middle period a little anterior to her fathers but subsequent to her greatgrandfathers she had a comely face with large smooth cheeks and prominent eyes the edges of her decorous brown wig were combed rather near their corners and a fitting cap palliated but did not deny the wig she had the quiet but rather dull look of people slightly deaf and she had perhaps been stupefied by a life of unalloyed prosperity and propriety she had grown an old maid naturally but not involuntarily and she was without the sadness or the harshness of disappointment she had never known much of the world though she had always lived in it she knew that it was made up of two kinds of peoplepeople who were like her and people who were not like her and she had lived solely in the society of people who were like her and in the shelter of their opinions and ideals she did not contemn or exclude the people who were unlike her but she had never had any more contact with them than she now had with the weather of the streets as she sat filling her large armchair full of her ladylike correctness in the library of the handsome house her father had left her the irruption of her brothers son and daughter into its cloistered quiet had scarcely broken its invulnerable order it was right and fit they should be there after his death and it was not strange that in the course of time they should both show certain unregulated tendencies which since they were not known to be lynde tendencies must have been derived from the southwestern woman her brother had married during his social and financial periclitations in a region wholly inconceivable to her their mother was dead too and their aunts life closed about them with full acceptance if not complacence as part of her world they had grown to manhood and womanhood without materially discomposing her faith in the oldfashioned unitarian deity whose service she had always attended  when alan left college in his freshman year and did not go back but went rather to europe and egypt and japan it appeared to her myopic optimism that his escapades had been pretty well hushed up by time and distance after he came home and devoted himself to his club she could have wished that he had taken up some profession or business but since there was money enough she waited in no great disquiet until he showed as decided a taste for something else as he seemed for the present to have only for horses in the mean while from time to time it came to her doctors advising his going to a certain retreat but he came out the first time so much better and remained well so long that his aunt felt a kind of security in his going again and again whenever he became at all worse he always came back better as she took the cup of tea that bessie poured out for her she recurred to the question that she had partly asked already  do you think alan is getting worse again  not so very much said the girl candidly hes been at the club i suppose but he left the table partly because i vexed him  because you what  because i vexed him he was scolding me and i wouldnt stand it  her aunt tasted her tea and found it so quite what she liked that she said from a natural satisfaction with bessie i dont see what he had to scold you about  well returned bessie and she got her pretty voice to the level of her aunts hearing with some straining and kept it there when he is in that state he has to scold some one and i had been rather annoying i suppose  what had you been doing asked her aunt making out her words more from the sight than from the sound after all  i had been walking home with a jay and we found alan trying to get in at the front door with his key and i introduced him to the jay  miss louisa lynde had heard the word so often from her niece and nephew that she imagined herself in full possession of its meaning she asked where had you met him  i met him first said the girl at willie morlands tea last week and today i found him at mrs bevidges altruistic toot  i didnt know said her aunt after a momentary attention to her tea that jays were interested in that sort of thing  the girl laughed i believe theyre not it hasnt quite reached them yet and i dont think it will ever reach my jay mrs bevidge tried to work him into the cause but he refused so promptly and sointelligently dont you knowand so almost brutally that poor freddy lancaster had to come and apologize to him for her want of tact bessie enjoyed the fact which she had colored a little in another laugh but she had apparently not possessed her aunt of the humor of it she remained seriouslyattentive and the girl went on he was not the least abashed at having refused he stayed till the last and as we came out together and he was going my way i let him walk home with me hes a jay but he isnt a common jay bessie leaned forward and tried to implant some notion of jeffs character and personality in her aunts mind  miss lynde listened attentively enough but she merely asked when all was said and why was alan vexed with you about him  well said the girl falling back into her chair generally because this mans a jay and particularly because hes been rather a baddish jay i believe he was suspended in his first year for something or other and you know poor alans very particular but molly enderby says freddy lancaster gives him the best of characters now bessie pulled down her mouth with an effect befitting the notion of repentance and atonement then she flashed out perhaps he had been drinking when he got into trouble alan could never forgive him for that  i think said her aunt it is to your brothers credit that he is anxious about your associations  oh very much shouted bessie with a burst of laughter and as he isnt practically so i ought to have been more patient with his theory but when he began to scold me i lost my temper and i gave him a few wholesome truths in the guise of taunts that was what made him go away i suppose  but i dont really see her aunt pursuedwhat occasion he had to be angry with you in this instance  oh i do said bessie mr durgin isnt one to inspire the casual beholder with the notion of his spiritual distinction his face is so rude and strong and he has such a primitive effect in his clothes that you feel as if you were coming down the street with a prehistoric man that the barbers and tailors had put a fin de siecle surface on at the mystification which appeared in her aunts face the girl laughed again i should have been quite as anxious if i had been in alans place and i shall tell him so sometime if i had not been so interested in the situation i dont believe i could have kept my courage whenever i looked round and found that prehistoric man at my elbow it gave me the creeps a little as if he were really carrying me off to his cave i shall try to express that to alan     xxxi  the ladies finished their tea and the butler came and took the cups away miss lynde remained silent in her chair at her end of the librarytable and byandby bessie got a book and began to read when her aunt woke up it was half past nine was that alan coming in she asked  i dont think hes been out said the girl it isnt late enough for him to come inor early enough  i believe ill go to bed miss lynde returned i feel rather drowsy  bessie did not smile at a comedy which was apt to be repeated every evening that she and her aunt spent at home together they parted for the night with the decencies of family affection and bessie delivered the elder lady over to her maid then the girl sank down again and lay musing in her deep chair before the fire with her book shut on her thumb she looked rather old and worn in her reverie her face lost the air of gay banter which after the beauty of her queer eyes and her vivid mouth was its charm the eyes were rather dull now and the mouth was a little withered  she was waiting for her brother to come down as he was apt to do if he was in the house after their aunt went to bed to smoke a cigar in the library he was in his house shoes when he shuffled into the room but her ear had detected his presence before a hiccough announced it she did not look up but let him make several failures to light his cigar and damn the matches under his breath before she pushed the droplight to him in silent suggestion as he leaned over her chairback to reach its chimney with his cigar in his mouth she said youre all right alan  he waited till he got round to his aunts easychair and dropped into it before he answered so are you bess  im not so sure of that said the girl as i should be if you were still scolding me i knew that he was a jay well enough and id just seen him behaving very like a cad to mrs bevidge  then i dont understand how you came to be with him  oh yes you do alan you mustnt be logical you might as well say you cant understand how you came to be more serious than sober the brother laughed helplessly it was the excitement  but you cant give way to that sort of thing bess said her brother with the gravity of a man feeling the consequences of his own errors  i know i cant but i do she returned i know its bad for me if it isnt for other people come ill swear off if you will  im always ready to swear off said the young man gloomily he added but youve got brains bess and i hate to see you playing the fool  do you really alan asked the girl pleased perhaps as much by his reproach as by his praise do you think ive got brains  youre the only girl that has  oh i didnt mean to ask so much as that but whats the reason i cant do anything with them other girls draw and play and write i dont do anything but go in for the excitement thats bad for me i wish youd explain it  alan lynde did not try the question seemed to turn his thoughts back upon himself to dispiriting effect ive got brains too i believe he began  lots of them cried his sister generously there isnt any of the men to compare with you if i had you to talk with all the time i shouldnt want jays i dont mean to flatter youre a constant feast of reason i dont care for flows of soul you always take right views of things when youre yourself and even when youre somebody else youre not stupid you could be anything you chose  the devil of it is i cant choose he replied  yes i suppose thats the devil of it said the girl  you oughtnt to use such language as that bess said her brother severely  oh i dont with everybody she returned never with ladies  he looked at her out of the corner of his eye with a smile at once rueful and comic  you got me i guess that time he owned  touche mr durgin says he fences it seems and he speaks french it was like an animal speaking french you always expect them to speak english but i dont mind your swearing before me i know that it helps to carry off the electricity she laughed and made him laugh with her  is there anything to him he growled when they stopped laughing  yes a good deal said bessie with an air of thoughtfulness and then she went on to tell all that jeff had told her of himself and she described his aplomb in dealing with the benevolent bevidge as she called her and sketched his character as it seemed to her the sketch was full of shrewd guesses and she made it amusing to her brother who from the vantage of his own baddishness no doubt judged the original more intelligently  well youd better let him alone after this he said at the end  yes she pensively assented i suppose its as if you took to some very common kind of whiskey isnt it i see what you mean if one must it ought to be champagne  she turned upon him a look of that keen but limited knowledge which renders womens conjectures of evil always so amusing or so pathetic to men  better let the champagne alone too said her brother darkly  yes i know that she admitted and she lay back in her chair looking dreamily into the fire after a while she asked abruptly will you give it up if i will  i am afraid i couldnt  you could try  oh im used to that  then its a bargain she said she jumped from her chair and went over to him and smoothed his hair over his forehead and kissed the place she had smoothed though it was unpleasantly damp to her lips poor boy poor boy now remember no more jays for me and no more jags for you goodnight  her brother broke into a wild laugh at her slanging which had such a bizarre effect in relation to her physical delicacy     xxxii  jeff did not know whether miss bessie lynde meant to go to mrs bevidges thursdays or not he thought she might have been bantering him by what she said and he decided that he would risk going to the first of them on the chance of meeting her she was not there and there was no one there whom he knew mrs bevidge made no effort to enlarge his acquaintance and after he had drunk a cup of her tea he went away with rage against society in his heart which he promised himself to vent at the first chance of refusing its favors but the chance seemed not to come the world which had opened its gates to him was fast shut again and he had to make what he could of renouncing it he worked pretty hard and he renewed himself in his fealty to cynthia while his mind strayed curiously to that other girl but he had almost abandoned the hope of meeting her again when a large party was given on the eve of the harvard midyear examinations which end the younger gayeties of boston for a fortnight at least in january the party was so large that the invitations overflowed the strict bounds of society at some points in the case of jeff durgin the excess was intentional beyond the vague benevolence which prompted the giver of the party to ask certain other outsiders she was a lady of a soul several sizes larger than the souls of some other society leaders she was not afraid to do as she liked for instance she had not only met the vostrands at westovers tea several years before but she had afterward offered some hospitalities to those ladies which had discharged her whole duty toward them without involving her in any disadvantages jeff had been presented to her at westovers but she disliked him so promptly and decidedly that she had left him out of even the things that she asked some other jays to like lectures and parlor readings for good objects it was not until one of her daughters met him first at willie morlands tea and then at mrs bevidges meeting that her social conscience concerned itself with him at the first her daughter had not spoken to him as might very well have happened since bessie lynde had kept him away with her nearly all the time but at the last she had bowed pleasantly to him across the room and jeff had responded with a stiff obeisance whose coldness she felt the more for having been somewhat softened herself in mrs bevidges altruistic atmosphere  i think he was hurt mamma the girl explained to her mother that youve never had him to anything i suppose they must feel it  oh well send him a card then said her mother and when jeff got the card rather near the eleventh hour he made haste to accept not because he cared to go to mrs enderbys house but because he hoped he should meet miss lynde there  bessie was the first person he met after he turned from paying his duty to the hostess she was with her aunt and she presented him and promised him a dance which she let him write on her card she sat out another dance with him and he took her to supper  to westover who had gone with the increasing forlornness a man feels in such pleasures after thirtyfive it seemed as if the two were in each others company the whole evening the impression was so strong with him that when jeff restored bessie to her aunt for the dance that was to be for some one else and came back to the supperroom the painter tried to satisfy a certain uneasiness by making talk with him but jeff would not talk he got away with a bottle of champagne which he had captured and a plate heaped with croquettes and pease and galantine and salad there were no ladies left in the room by that time and few young men but the oldsters crowded the place with their bald heads devoutly bowed over their victual or their frosty mustaches bathed in their drink singly or in groups the noise of their talk and laughter mixed with the sound of their eating and drinking and the clash of the knives and dishes over their stooped shoulders and past their rounded stomachs westover saw alan lynde vaguely making his way with a glass in his hand and looking vaguely about for wine he saw jeff catch his wandering eye and make offer of his bottle and then saw lynde after a moment of haughty pause unbend and accept it his thin face was flushed and his hair tossed over his forehead but jeff seemed not to take note of that he laughed boisterously at something lynde said and kept filling his glass for him his own color remained clear and cool it was as if his powerful physique absorbed the wine before it could reach his brain  westover wanted to interfere and so far as jeff was concerned he would not have hesitated but lynde was concerned too and you cannot save such a man from himself without offence he made his way to the young man hoping he might somehow have the courage he wanted  jeff held up the bottle and called to him get yourself a glass mr westover he put on the air of a host and would hardly be denied know mr westover mr lynde just talking about you he explained to westover  alan had to look twice at the painter oh yes mr durgin heretelling me about his place in the mountains says youve been there goinggoing myself in the summer see hishorses he made pauses between his words as some people do when they try to keep from stammering  westover believed lynde understood jeff to be a country gentleman of sporting tastes and he would not let that pass yes its the pleasantest little hotel in the mountains  strictlytemperance i suppose said alan trying to smile with lips that obeyed him stiffly he appeared not to care who or what jeff was the champagne had washed away all difference between them he went on to say that he had heard of jeffs intention of running the hotel himself when he got out of harvard he held it to be damned good stuff  jeff laughed your sister wouldnt believe me when i told her  i think i didnt mention miss lynde said alan haughtily  jeff filled his glass alan looked at it faltered and then drank it off the talk began again between the young men but it left westover out and he had to go away whether jeff was getting lynde beyond himself from the love of mischief such as had prompted him to tease little children in his boyhood or was trying to ingratiate himself with the young fellow through his weakness or doing him harm out of mere thoughtlessness westover came away very unhappy at what he had seen his unhappiness connected itself so distinctly with lyndes family that he went and sat down beside miss lynde from an obscure impulse of compassion and tried to talk with her it would not have been so hard if she were merely deaf for she had the skill of deaf people in arranging the conversation so that a nodded yes or no would be all that was needed to carry it forward but to westover she was terribly dull and he was gasping as in an exhausted receiver when bessie came up with a smile of radiant recognition for his extremity she got rid of her partner and devoted herself at once to westover how good of you she said without giving him the pain of an awkward disclaimer  he could counter in equal sincerity and ambiguity how beautiful of you  yes she said i am looking rather well tonight but dont you think effective would have been a better word she smiled across her aunt at him out of a cloud of pink from which her thin shoulders and slender neck emerged and her arms gloved to the top fell into her lap one of them seemed to terminate naturally in the fan which sensitively shared the inquiescence of her person  i will say effective too if you insist said westover but at the same time youre the most beautiful person here  how lovely of you even if you dont mean it she sighed if girls could have more of those things said to them they would be better dont you think or at least feel better  westover laughed we might organize a societythey have them for nearly everything nowfor saying pleasant things to young ladies with a view to the moral effect  oh do i  but it ought to be done conscientiously and you couldnt go round telling every one that she was the most beautiful girl in the room  why not shed believe it  yes but the effect on the members of the society  oh yes that but you could vary it so as to save your conscience you could say how divinely youre looking or how angelic or youre the very poetry of motion or you are grace itself or your gown is a perfect dream or any little commonplace and every one would take it for praise of her personal appearance and feel herself a great beauty just as i do now though i know very well that im all out of drawing and just chicqued together  i couldnt allow any one but you to say that miss bessie and i only let it pass because you say it so well  yes youre always so good you wouldnt contradict me even when you turned me out of your class  did i turn you out of my class  not just in so many words but when i said i couldnt do anything in art you didnt insist that it was because i wouldnt and of course then i had to go ive never forgiven you mr westover never do keep on talking very excitedly theres a man coming up to us that i dont want to think i see him or hell stop there hes veered off where were you mr westover  ah miss bessie said the painter delighted at her drama there isnt anything you couldnt do if you would  you mean parlor entertainments impersonations impressions that sort of thing i have thought of it but it would be too easy i want to try something difficult  for instance  well being very very good i want something that would really tax my powers i should like to be an example i tried it the other night just before i went to sleep and it was fine i became an example to others but when i woke upi went on in the old way i want something hard dont you know but i want it to be easy  she laughed and westover said i am glad youre not serious no one ought to be an example to others to be exemplary is as dangerous as to be complimentary  it certainly isnt so agreeable to the object said the girl but its fine for the subject as long as it lasts how metaphysical were getting the objective and the subjective its quite what i should expect of talk at a boston dance if i were a newyorker have you seen anything of my brother within the last hour or so mr westover  yes i just left him in the supperroom shall i go get him for you when he had said this with the notion of rescuing him from jeff westover was sorry for he doubted if alan lynde were any longer in the state to be brought away from the supperroom and he was glad to have bessie say  no no hell look us up in the course of the eveningor the morning a young fellow came to claim her for a dance and westover had not the face to leave miss lynde all the less because she told him he must not think of staying he stayed till the dance was over and bessie came back to him  what time is it mr westover i see my aunt beginning to nod on her perch  westover looked at his watch its ten minutes past two  how early sighed the girl im tired of it arent you  very said westover i was tired an hour ago  bessie sank back in her chair with an air of nervous collapse and did not say anything westover saw her watching the young couples who passed in and out of the room where the dancing was or found corners on sofas or windowseats or sheltered spaces beside the doors and the chimneypiece the girls panting and the men leaning forward to fan them she looked very tired of it and when a young fellow came up and asked her to dance she told him that she was provisionally engaged come back and get me if you cant do better she said and he answered there was no use trying to do better and said he would wait till the other man turned up or didnt if she would let him he sat down beside her and some young talk began between them  in the midst of it jeff appeared he looked at westover first and then approached with an embarrassed face  bessie got vividly to her feet no apologies mr durgin please but in just another moment youd have last your dance  westover saw what he believed a change pass in jeffs look from embarrassment to surprise and then to flattered intelligence he beamed all over and he went away with bessie toward the ballroom and left westover to a wholly unsupported belief that she had not been engaged to dance with jeff he wondered what her reckless meaning could be but he had always thought her a young lady singularly fitted by nature and art to take care of herself and when he reasoned upon what was in his mind he had to own that there was no harm in jeffs dancing with her  he took leave of miss lynde and was going to get his coat and hat for his walk home when he was mysteriously stopped in a corner of the stairs by one of the caterers men whom he knew it is so unnatural to be addressed by a servant at all unless he asks you if you will have something to eat or drink that westover was in a manner prepared to have him say something startling its about young mr lynde sor weve got um in one of the rooms upstairs but he aint fit to go home alone and ive been lookin for somebody that knows the family to help get um into a carge he wont go for anny of us sor  where is he asked westover in anguish at being unable to refuse the appeal but loathing the office put upon him  ill show you sor said the caterers man and he sprang up the stairs before westover with glad alacrity     xxxiii  in a little room at the side of that where the mens hats and coats were checked alan lynde sat drooping forward in an armchair with his head fallen on his breast he roused himself at the flash of the burner which the man turned up whats all this he demanded haughtily wheres the carriage whats the matter  your carriage is waiting lynde said westover ill see you down to it and he murmured hopelessly to the caterers man is there any back way  theres the wan we got um up by  it will do said westover as simply  but lynde called out defiantly back way i shant go down back way inshult to guest i wishsaygoodnight tomrs enderby who you anyway damn caterers man  im westover lynde the painter began but the young fellow broke in upon him shaking his hand and then taking his arm  oh westover all right ill go down back way with you thoughtthought it was damn caterers man nooffence  no its all right westover got his arm under lyndes elbow and with the man going before for them to fall upon jointly in case they should stumble he got him down the dark and twisting stairs and through the basement hall which was vaguely haunted by the dispossessed women servants of the family and so out upon the pavement of the moonlighted streets  call miss lyndes carge shouted the caterers man to the barker and escaped back into the basement leaving westover to stay his helpless charge on the sidewalk  it seemed a publication of the wretchs shame when the barker began to fill the night with hoarse cries of miss lyndes carriage carriage for miss lynde the cries were taken up by a coachman here and there in the rank of vehicles whose varnished roofs shone in the moon up and down the street after a time that westover of course felt to be longer than it was miss lyndes old coachman was roused from his sleep on the box and started out of the rank he took in the situation with the eye of custom when he saw alan supported on the sidewalk by a stranger at the end of the canopy covering the pavement  he said oh ahl right sor and when the two whitegloved policemen from either side of it helped westover into the carriage with lynde he set off at a quick trot the policemen clapped their hands together and smiled across the strip of carpet that separated them and winks and nods of intelligence passed among the barkers to the footmen about the curb and steps there were none of them sorry to see a gentleman in that state some of them had perhaps seen alan in that state before  halfway home he roused himself and put his hand on the carriagedoor latch tell the coachman drive us totheclub make night of it  no no said westover trying to restrain him wed better go right on to your house  whowhowho are you demanded alan  westover  oh yeswestover thought we left westover at mrs enderbys thought it was that jaywhats his name durgin hes awful jay but civil to me and i want be civil to him youre notjay no thats right fellow made me sick but i took his champagne and i must show him someattention he released the doorhandle and fell back against the cushioned carriage wall hes a blackguard he said sourly notsimple jayblackguard too nonobusiness bring in my sisters name hey youyou say itswestover oh yes westover old friend of family tell you good joke westovermy sisters no more jays for me no more jags for you thats what she sayjust between her and me you know shes a lady bess is knows when to useslang markmark of a lady know when to use slang pretty goodjays and jags guess we didnt count this timeeither of us  when the carriage pulled up before miss lyndes house westover opened the door youre at home now lynde come lets get out  lynde did not stir he asked westover again who he was and when he had made sure of him he said with dignity very well now they must get the other fellow westover entreated he even reasoned lynde lay back in the corner of the carriage and seemed asleep  westover thought of pulling him up and getting him indoors by main force he appealed to the coachman to know if they could not do it together  why you see i couldnt leave me harsses sor said the coachman whats he wants sor he bent urbanely down from his box and listened to the explanation that westover made him standing in the cold on the curbstone with one hand on the carriage door then its no use sor the man decided whin hes that way ahl hell couldnt stir um best go back sor and try to find the gentleman  this was in the end what westover had to do feeling all the time that a thing so frantically absurd could not be a waking act but helpless to escape from its performance he thought of abandoning his charge and leaving him to his fate when he opened the carriage door before mrs enderbys house but with the next thought he perceived that this was on all accounts impossible he went in and began his quest for jeff sending various serving men about with vague descriptions of him and asking for him of departing guests mostly young men he did not know but who he thought might know jeff  he had to take off his overcoat at last and reappear at the ball the crowd was still great but visibly less dense than it had been by a sudden inspiration he made his way to the supperroom and he found jeff there filling a plate as if he were about to carry it off somewhere he commanded jeffs instant presence in the carriage outside he told him of alans desire for him  jeff leaned back against the wall with the plate in his hand and laughed till it half slipped from his hold when he could get his breath he said ill be back in a few minutes ive got to take this to miss bessie lynde but ill be right back  westover hardly believed him but when he got on his own things again jeff joined him in his hat and overcoat and they went out together  it was another carriage that stopped the way now and once more the barker made the night ring with what westover felt his heartless and shameless cries for miss lyndes carriage after a maddening delay it lagged up to the curb and jeff pulled the door open  hello he said theres nobody here  nobody there cried westover and they fell upon the coachman with wild question and reproach the policeman had to tell him at last that the carriage must move on to make way for others  the coachman had no explanation to offer he did not know how or when mr alan had got away  but you can give a guess where hes gone jeff suggested with a presence of mind which westover mutely admired  well sor i know where he do be gahn sometimes the man admitted  well that will do take me there said jeff you go in and account for me to miss lynde he instructed westover across his shoulder ill get him home before morning somehow and ill send the carriage right back for the ladies now  westover had the forethought to decide that miss bessie should ask for jeff if she wanted him and this simplified matters very much she asked nothing about him at sight of westover coming up to her where she sat with her aunt she merely said why mr westover i thought you took leave of this scene of gayety long ago  did you westover returned provisionally and she saved him from the sin of framing some deceit in final answer by her next question  have you seen anything of alan lately she asked in a voice involuntarily lowered  westover replied in the same octave yes i saw him going a good while ago  oh said the girl then i think my aunt and i had better go too  still she did not go and there was an interval in which she had the air of vaguely waiting to westovers vision the young people still passing to and from the ballroom were like the painted figures of a picture quickened with sudden animation there were scarcely any elders to be seen now except the chaperons who sat in their places with iron fortitude westover realized that he was the only man of his age left he felt that the lights ought to have grown dim but the place was as brilliant as ever a window had been opened somewhere and the cold breath of the night was drawing through the heated rooms  he was content to have bessie stay on though he was almost dropping with sleep for he was afraid that if she went at once the carriage might not have got back and the whole affair must somehow be given away at last if she were waiting she decided to wait no longer and then westover did not know how to keep her he saw her rise and stoop over her aunt putting her mouth to the elder ladys ear and he heard her saying i am going home aunt louisa she turned sweetly to him wont you let us set you down mr westover  why thank you i believe i prefer walking but do let me have your carriage called and again he hurried himself into his overcoat and hat and ran downstairs and the barker a third time sent forth his lamentable cries in summons of miss lyndes carriage  while he stood on the curbstone eagerly peering up and down the street he heard without being able either to enjoy or resent it one of the policemen say across him to the other miss lynde seems to be doin a liverystable business tonight  almost at the moment a carriage drove up and he recognized miss lyndes coachman who recognized him  just got back sor he whispered and a minute later bessie came daintily out over the carpeted way with her aunt  how good of you she said and goodnight mr westover said miss lynde with an implication in her voice that virtue was peculiarly its own reward for those who performed any good office for her or hers  westover shut them in the carriage rolled off and he started on his homeward walk with a long sigh of relief     xxxiv  bessie asked the sleepy man who opened her aunts door whether her brother had come in yet and found that he had not she helped her aunt off upstairs with her maid and when she came down again she sent the man to bed she told him she was going to sit up and she would let her brother in the caprices of alans latchkey were known to all the servants and the man understood what she meant he said he had left a light in the receptionroom and there was a fire there and bessie tripped on down from the library floor where she had met him she had put off her ball dress and had slipped into the simplest and easiest of breakfast frocks which was by no means plain bessie had no plain frocks for any hour of the day her frocks all expressed in stuff and style and color and the bravery of their flying laces and ribbons the audacity of spirit with which she was herself chicqued together as she said this one she had on now was something that brightened her dull complexion and brought out the best effect of her eyes and mouth and seemed the effluence of her personal dash and grace it made the most of her and she liked it beyond all her other negligees for its complaisance  she got a book and sat down in a long low chair before the fire and crossed her pretty slippers on the warm hearth it was a quarter after three by the clock on the mantel but she had never felt more eagerly awake the party had not been altogether to her mind up to midnight but after that it had been a series of rapid and vivid emotions which continued themselves still in the tumult of her nerves and seemed to demand an indefinite sequence of experience she did not know what state her brother might be in when he came home she had not seen anything of him after she first went out to supper till then though he had kept himself straight as he needs must but she could not tell what happened to him afterward she hoped that he would come home able to talk for she wished to talk she wished to talk about herself and as she had already had flattery enough she wanted some truth about herself she wanted alan to say what he thought of her behavior the whole evening with that jay he must have seen something of it in the beginning and she should tell him all the rest she should tell him just how often she had danced with the man and how many dances she had sat out with him how she had pretended once that she was engaged when another man asked her and then danced with the jay to whom she pretended that he had engaged her for the dance she had wished to see how he would take it for the same reason she had given to some one else a dance that was really his she would tell alan how the jay had asked her for that last dance and then never come near her again that would give him the whole situation and she would know just what he thought of it  what she thought of herself she hardly knew or made believe she hardly knew she prided herself upon not being a flirt she might not be very good as goodness went but she was not despicable and a flirt was despicable she did not call the audacity of her behavior with the jay flirting he seemed to understand it as well as she and to meet her in her own spirit she wondered now whether this jay was really more interesting than the other men one met or only different whether he was original like alan himself or merely novel and would soon wear down to the tiresomeness that seemed to underlie them all and made one wish to do something dreadful in the jays presence she had no wish to do anything dreadful was it because he was dreadful enough for both all the time without doing anything she would like to ask alan that and see how he would take it nothing seemed to put the jay out so far as she had tried and she had tried some bold impertinences with him he was very jolly through them all and at the worst of them he laughed and asked her for that dance which he never came to claim though in the mean time he brought her some belated supper and was devoted to her and her aunt inventing services to do for them then suddenly he went off and did not return and mr westover mysteriously reappeared and got their carriage  she heard a scratching at the keyhole of the outside door she knew it was alans latch she had left the inner door ajar that there might be no uncertainty of hearing him and she ran out into the space between that and the outer door where the fumbling and scraping kept on  is that you alan she called softly and if she had any doubt before she had none when she heard her brother outside cursing his luck with his key as usual  she flung the door open and confronted him with another man who had his arms around him as if he had caught him from falling with the inward pull of the door alan got to his feet and grappled with the man and insisted that he should come in and make a night of it  bessie saw that it was jeff and they stood a moment looking at each other jeff tried to free himself with an appeal to bessie i beg your pardon miss lynde i walked home with your brother and i was just helping him to get ini didnt think that you  alan said with his measured distinctness nobody cares what you think come in and get something to carry you over the bridge cambridge cars stopped running long ago i say you shall he began to raise his voice a light flashed in a window across the way and a sash was lifted some one must be looking out  oh come in with him bessie implored and at a little yielding in jeff her brother added  come in you damn jay he pulled at jeff  jeff made haste to shut the door behind them he was laughing and if it was from mere brute insensibility to what would have shocked another in the situation his frank recognition of its grotesqueness was of better effect than any hopeless effort to ignore it would have been people adjust themselves to their trials it is the pretence of the witness that there is no trial which hurts and bessie was not wounded by jeffs laugh  theres a fire here in the receptionroom she said can you get him in  i guess so  jeff lifted alan into the room and stayed him on foot there while he took off his hat and overcoat and then he let him sink into the low easychair bessie had just risen from all the time alan was bidding her ring and have some champagne and cold meat set out on the sideboard and she was lightly promising and coaxing but he drowsed quickly in the warmth and the last demand for supper died half uttered on his lips  jeff asked across him cant i get him upstairs for you i can carry him  she shook her head and whispered back i can leave him here and she looked at jeff with a moments hesitation did youdo you think thatany one noticed him at mrs enderbys  no they had got him in a room by himselfthe caterers men had  and you found him there  mr westover found him there jeff answered  i dont understand  didnt he come to you after i left  yes  i told him to excuse me  he didnt  well i guess he was pretty badly rattled jeff stopped himself in the vague laugh of one who remembers something ludicrous and turned his face away  tell me what it was she demanded nervously  mr westover had been home with him once and he wouldnt stay he made mr westover come back for me  what did he want with you  jeff shrugged  and then what  we went out to the carriage as soon as i could get away from you but he wasnt in it i sent mr westover back to you and set out to look for him  that was very good of you and ithank you for your kindness to my brother i shall not forget it and i wish to beg your pardon  what for asked jeff bluntly  for blaming you when you didnt come back for the dance  if bessie had meant nothing but what was fitting to the moment some inherent lightness of nature played her false but even the histrionic touch which she could not keep out of her voice her manner another sort of man might have found merely pathetic  jeff laughed with subtle intelligence were you very hard on me  very she answered in kind forgetting her brother and the whole terrible situation  tell me what you thought of me he said and he came a little nearer to her looking very handsome and very strong i should like to know  i said i should never speak to you again  and you kept your word said jeff well thats all right goodnightor goodmorning whichever it is he took her hand which she could not withdraw or feigned to herself that she could not withdraw and looked at her with a silent laugh and a hardy sceptical glance that she felt take in every detail of her prettiness her plainness then he turned and went out and she ran quickly and locked the door upon him     xxxv  bessie crept up to her room where she spent the rest of the night in her chair amid a tumult of emotion which she would have called thinking she asked herself the most searching questions but she got no very candid answers to them and she decided that she must see the whole fact with some others eyes before she could know what she had meant or what she had done  when she let the daylight into her room it showed her a face in her mirror that bore no trace of conflicting anxieties her complexion favored this effect of inward calm it was always thick and her eyes seemed to her all the brighter for their vigils  a smile even hovered on her mouth as she sat down at the breakfasttable in the pretty negligee she had worn all night and poured out miss lyndes coffee for her  thats always very becoming to you bessie said her aunt its the nicest breakfast gown you have  do you think so bessie looked down at it first on one side and then on the other as a woman always does when her dress is spoken of  mr alan said he would have his breakfast in his room miss murmured the butler in husky respectfulness as he returned to bessie from carrying miss lyndes cup to her he dont want anything but a little toast and coffee  she perceived that the words were meant to make it easy for her to ask isnt he very well andrew  about as usual miss said andrew a thought more sepulchral than before hes going onabout as usual  she knew this to mean that he was going on from bad to worse and that his last nights excess was the beginning of a debauch which could end only in one way she must send for the doctor he would decide what was best when he saw how alan came through the day  late in the afternoon she heard mary enderbys voice in the receptionroom bidding the man say that if miss bessie were lying down she would come up to her or would go away just as she wished she flew downstairs with a glad cry of molly what an inspiration i was just thinking of you and wishing for you but i didnt suppose you were up yet  its pretty early said miss enderby but i should have been here before if i could for i knew i shouldnt wake you bessie with your habit of turning night into day and getting up any time in the forenoon  how dissipated you sound  yes dont i but ive been thinking about you ever since i woke and i had to come and find out if you were alive anyhow  come upstairs and see said bessie holding her friends hand on the sofa where they had dropped down together and going all over the scene of last night in that place for the thousandth time  no no i really mustnt i hope you had a good time  at your house  how dear of you but bessie i got to thinking youd been rather sacrificed it came into my mind the instant i woke and gave me this severe case of conscience i suppose its a kind of conscience  yes yes go on i like having been a martyr if i dont know what about  why you know bessie or if you dont you will presently that it was i who got mamma to send him a card i felt rather sorry for him that day at mrs bevidges because shed so obviously got him there to use him and i got mamma to ask him everything takes care of itself at a large affair and i thought i might trust in providence to deal with him after he came and then i saw you made a means the whole evening i didnt reflect that there always has to be a means  its a question of mr durgin said bessie coldly thrilling at the sound of a name that she pronounced so gayly in a tone of sympathetic amusement  miss enderby bobbed her head it shows that we ought never to do a good action doesnt it but poor thing how you must have been swearing off  i dont know was it so very bad im trying to think said bessie thinking that after this beginning it would be impossible to confide in mary enderby  oh now bessie dont you be patient or i shall begin to lose my faith in human nature just say at once that it was an outrage and ill forgive you you see miss enderby went on it isnt merely that hes a jay but he isnt a very nice jay none of the men like himexcept freddy lancaster of course he likes everybody on principle he doesnt count i thought that perhaps although hes so crude and blunt he might be sensitive and highminded youre always reading about such things but they say he isnt in the least oh not the least they say he goes with a set of fast jays and that hes dreadful though he has a very good mind and could do very well if he chose thats what cousin jim said today hes just been at our house and it was so extremely telepathic that i thought i must run round and prevent your having the man on your conscience if you felt you had had too much of him you wont lay him up against us will you she jumped to her feet  you dear said bessie keeping mary enderbys hand and pressing it between both of hers against her breast as they now stood face to face do come up and have some tea  no no really i cant  they were both involuntarily silent the door had been opened to some one and there was a brief parley which ended in a voice they knew to be the doctors saying then ill go right up to his room both the girls broke into laughing adieux to hide their consciousness that the doctor was going up to see alan lynde who was never sick except in the one way  miss enderby even said i was so glad to see alan looking so well last night  yes he had such a good time said bessie and she followed her friend to the door where she kissed her reassuringly and thanked her for taking all the trouble she had bidding her not be the least anxious on her account  it seemed to her that she should sink upon the stairs in mounting them to the library mary enderby had told her only what she had known before it was what her brother had told her but then it had not been possible for the man to say that he had brought alan home tipsy and been alone in the house with her at three oclock in the morning he would not only boast of it to all that vulgar comradehood of his but it might get into those terrible papers which published the society scandals there would be no way but to appeal to his pity his generosity she fancied herself writing to him but he could show her note and she must send for him to come and see her and try to put him on his honor or that would not do either she must make it happen that they should be thrown together and then speak to him even that might make him think she was afraid of him or he might take it wrong and believe that she cared for him he had really been very good to alan and she tried to feel safe in the thought of that she did feel safe for a moment but if she had meant nothing but to make him believe her grateful what must he infer from her talking to him in the light way she did about forgiving him for not coming back to dance with her her manner her looks her tone had given him the right to say that she had been willing to flirt with him there at that hour and in those dreadful circumstances  she found herself lying in a deep armchair in the library when she was aware of dr lacy pausing at the door and looking tentatively in upon her  come in doctor she said and she knew that her face was wet with tears and that she spoke with the voice of weeping  he came forward and looked narrowly at her without sitting down theres nothing to be alarmed about miss bessie he said but i think your brother had better leave home again for a while  yes she said blankly her mind was not on his words  i will make the arrangements  thank you said bessie listlessly  the doctor had made a step backward as if he were going away and now he stopped arent you feeling quite well miss bessie  oh yes she said and she began to cry  the doctor came forward and said cheerily let me see he pulled a chair up to hers and took her wrist between his fingers if you were at mrs enderbys last night youll need another night to put you just right but youre pretty well as it is he let her wrist softly go and said you mustnt distress yourself about your brothers case of course its hard to have it happen now after hes held up so long longer than it has been before i think isnt it but its something that it has been so long the next time let us hope it will be longer still  the doctor made as if to rise bessie put her hand out to stay him what is it makes him do it  ah thats a great mystery said the doctor i suppose you might say the excitement  yes  but it seems to me very often in such cases as if it were to escape the excitement i think youre both keyed up pretty sharply by nature miss bessie said the doctor with the personal kindness he felt for the girl and the pity softening his scientific spirit  i know she answered were alike why dont i take to drinking too  the doctor laughed at such a question from a young lady but with an inner seriousness in his laugh as if coming from a patient it was to be weighed well i suppose it isnt the habit of your sex miss bessie  sometimes it is sometimes women get drunk and then i think they do less harm than if they did other things to get away from the excitement she longed to confide in him the words were on her tongue she believed he could help her tell her what to do out of his stores of knowledge and experience he must have some suggestion some remedy he could advise her he could stand her friend so far people told their doctors all kinds of things silly things why should she not tell her doctor this  it would have been easier if it had been an older man who might have had a daughter of her age but he was in that period of the early forties when a doctor sometimes has a matteroffact disagreeable wife whose idea stands between him and the spiritual intimacy of his patients so that it seems as if they were delivering their confidences rather to her than to him he was able he was good he was extremely acute he was even with the latest facts and theories but as he sat straight up in his chair his stomach defined itself as a halfmoon before him and he said to the quivering heap of emotions beside him you mean like breaking hearts and such little matters  it was fatally stupid and it beat her back into herself  yes she said with a contempt that she easily hid from him thats worse than getting drunk isnt it  well it isnt so regarded said the doctor who supposed himself to have made a sprightly answer and laughed at it i wish miss bessie youd take a little remedy im going to send you youve merely been up too late but its a very good thing for people whove been up too late  thank you and about my brother  oh ill send a man to look after him tonight and tomorrow i really think hed better go     xxxvi  miss lynde had gone earlier than usual to bed when bessie heard alans door open and then heard him feeling his way fumbingly downstairs she surmised that he had drunk up all that he had in his room and was making for the sideboard in the diningroom  she ran and got the two decantersone of whiskey and one of brandy which he was in the habit of carrying back to his room from such an incursion  alan she called to him in a low voice  where are you he answered back  in the library she said come in here please  he came and stood looking gloomily in from the doorway he caught sight of the decanters and the glasses on the library table oh he said and gave a laugh cut in two by a hiccough  come in and shut the door alan she said lets make a night of it ive got the materials here she waved her hand toward the decanters  alan shrugged i dont know what you mean but he came forward and slouched into one of the deep chairs  well ill tell you what said bessie with a laugh were both excited and we want to get away from ourselves isnt that whats the matter with you when it begins doctor lacy thinks it is  does he alan asked i didnt suppose he had so much sense what of it  nothing merely that im going to drink a glass of whiskey and a glass of brandy for every glass that you drink tonight  you mustnt play the fool bess said her brother with dignified severity  but im really serious alan shall i give you something which shall we begin on and wed better begin soon for theres a man coming from the doctor to look after you and then you wont get anything  dont be ridiculous give me those decanters alan struggled out of his chair and trembled over to where she had them on the table beside her  she caught them up one in either hand and held them as high as she could lift them if you dont sit down and promise to keep still ill smash them both on the hearth you know i will  her strange eyes gleamed and he hesitated then he went back to his chair  i dont see whats got into you tonight i dont want anything he said he tried to brave it out but presently he cast a piteous glance at the decanters where she had put them down beside her again does the doctor think id better go again he asked  yes  when  tomorrow  he looked at the decanters and when is that fellow coming  he may be here any moment  its pretty rough he sighed two glasses of that stuff would drive you so wild you wouldnt know where you were bess he expostulated  well i wish i didnt know where i was i wish i wasnt anywhere he looked at her and then dropped his eyes with the effect of giving up a hopeless conundrum  but he asked whats the matter  she scanned him keenly before she answered something that i should like to tell youthat you ought to know alan do you think you are fit to judge of a very serious matter  he laughed pathetically i dont believe im in a very judicial frame of mind tonight bess tomorrow  oh tomorrow where will you be tomorrow  thats true well what is it ill try to listen but if you knew how my nerves were going his eyes wandered from hers back to the decanters if i had just one glass  ill have one too she said with a motion toward the decanter next her  he threw up his arms oh well go on ill listen as well as i can he sank down in his chair and stretched his little feet out toward the fire go on  she hesitated before she began do you know who brought you home last night alan  yes he answered quickly westover  yes mr westover brought you and you wouldnt stay you dont remember anything else  no what else  nothing for you if you dont remember she sat in silent hopelessness for a while and her brothers eyes dwelt on the decanters which she seemed to have forgotten alan she broke out abruptly im worried and if i cant tell you about it theres no one i can  the appeal in her voice must have reached him though he seemed scarcely to have heeded her words what is it he asked kindly  you went back to the enderbys after mr westover brought you home and then some one else had to bring you again  how do you know  i was up and let you in  did you bessie that was like you he said tenderly  and i had to let him in too you pulled him into the house and you made such a disturbance at the door that he had to come in for fear you would bring the police  what a beast said alan of himself as if it were some one else  he came in with you and you wanted him to have some supper and you fell asleep before the fire in the receptionroom  thatthat was the dream said alan severely what are you talking that stuff for bessie  oh no she retorted with a laugh as if the pleasure of its coming in so fitly were compensation for the shame of the fact the dream was what happened afterward the dream was that you fell asleep there and left me there with him  well poor old westover hes a gentleman you neednt be worried about him  youre not fit cried the girl i give it up she got upon her feet and stood a moment listless  no im not bessie i cant pull my mind together tonight but look here he seemed to lose what he wanted to say he asked is it something ive got you in for do i understand that  partly she said  well then ill help you out you can trust me bessie you can indeed you dont believe it  oh i believe you think i can trust you  but this time you can if you need my help i will stand by you right or wrong if you want to tell me now ill listen and ill advise you the best i can  its just something ive got nervous about she said while her eyes shone with sudden tears but i wont trouble you with it tonight theres no such great hurry we can talk about it in the morning if youre better then oh i forgot youre going away  no said the young man with pathetic dignity im not going if you need my help but youre right about me tonight bessie im not fit im afraid i cant grasp anything tonight tell me in the morning oh dont be afraid he cried out at the glance she gave the decanters thats over now you could put them in my hands and be safe enough im going back to bed and in the morning  he rose and went toward the door if that doctors man comes tonight you can send him away again he neednt bother  all right alan she said fondly goodnight dont worry about me try to get some sleep  and you must sleep too you can trust me bessie  he came back after he got out of the room and looked in bess if youre anxious about it if you dont feel perfectly sure of me you can take those things to your room with you he indicated the decanters with a glance  oh no i shall leave them here it wouldnt be any use your just keeping well overnight youll have to keep well a long time alan if youre going to help me and thats the reason id rather talk to you when you can give your whole mind to what i say  is it something so serious  i dont know thats for you to judge not verynot at all perhaps  then i wont fail you bessie i shall keep well as you call it as long as you want me goodnight  goodnight i shall leave these bottles here remember  you neednt be afraid you might put them beside my bed  bessie slept soundly from exhaustion and in that provisional fashion in which people who have postponed a care to a given moment are able to sleep but she woke early and crept downstairs before any one else was astir and went to the library the decanters stood there on the table empty her brother lay a shapeless heap in one of the deep armchairs     xxxvii  westover got home from the enderby dance at last with the forecast of a violent cold in his system which verified itself the next morning he had been housed a week when jeff durgin came to see him why didnt you let me know you were sick he demanded id have come and looked after you  thank you said westover with as much stiffness as he could command in his physical limpness i shouldnt have allowed you to look after me and i want you to understand now that there cant be any sort of friendliness between us till youve accounted for your behavior with lynde the other night  you mean at the party jeff asked tranquilly  yes cried westover if i had not been shut up ever since i should have gone to see you and had it out with you ive only let you in now to give you the chance to explain and i refuse to hear a word from you till you do westover did not think that this was very forcible and he was not much surprised that it made jeff smile  why i dont know what there is to explain i suppose you think i got him drunk i know what you thought that night but he was pretty well loaded when he struck my champagne it wasnt a question of what he was going to do any longer but how he was going to do it i kept an eye on him and at the right time i helped the caterers man to get him up into that room where he wouldnt make any trouble i expected to go back and look after him but i forgot him  i dont suppose really that youre aware what a devils argument that is said westover you got lynde drunk and then you went back to his sister and allowed her to treat you as if you were a gentleman and didnt deserve to be thrown out of the house this at last was something like what westover had imagined he would say to jeff and he looked to see it have the imagined effect upon him  do you suppose asked jeff with cheerful cynicism that it was the first time she was civil to a man her brother got drunk with  no but all the more you ought to have considered her helplessness it ought to have made her the more sacredjeff gave an exasperating shrugto you and you ought to have kept away from her for decencys sake  i was engaged to dance with her  i cant allow you to be trivial with me durgin said westover youve acted like a blackguard and worse if there is anything worse  jeff stood at a corner of the fire leaning one elbow on the mantel and he now looked thoughtfully down on westover who had sunk weakly into a chair before the hearth i dont deny it from your point of view mr westover he said without the least resentment in his tone you believe that everything is done from a purpose or that a thing is intended because its done but i see that most things in this world are not thought about and not intended they happen just as much as the other things that we call accidents  yes said westover but the wrong things dont happen from people who are in the habit of meaning the right ones  i believe they do fully half the time jeff returned and as far as the grand result is concerned you might as well think them and intend them as not i dont mean that you ought to do it thats another thing and if i had tried to get lynde drunk and then gone to dance with his sister i should have been what you say i am but i saw him getting worse without meaning to make him so and i went back to her becausei wanted to  and you think i suppose said westover that she wouldnt have cared any more than you cared if she had known what you did  i cant say anything about that  the painter continued bitterly you used to come in here the first year with notions of society women that would have disgraced a goth or a gorilla did you form your estimate of miss lynde from those premises  im not a boy now jeff answered and i havent stayed all the kinds of a fool i was  then you dont think miss lynde would speak to you or look at you after she knew what you had done  i should like to tell her and see said jeff with a hardy laugh but i guess i shant have the chance ive never been a favorite in society and i dont expect to meet her again  perhaps youd like to have me tell her  why yes i believe i should if you could tell me what she thoughtnot what she said about it  you are a brute answered westover with a puzzled air what puzzled him most and pleased him least was the fellows patience under his severity which he seemed either not to feel or not to mind it was of a piece with the behavior of the rascally boy whom he had cuffed for frightening cynthia and her little brother long ago and he wondered what final malevolence it portended  jeff said as if their controversy were at an end and they might now turn to more personal things you look pretty slim mr westover ant there something i can do for youget you ive come in with a message from mother she says if you ever want to get that winter view of lions head nows your time she wants you to come up there she and cynthia both do they can make you as comfortable as you please and theyd like to have a visit from you cant you go  westover shook his head ruefully its good of them and i want you to thank them for me but i dont know when im going to get out again  oh youll soon get out said jeff im going to look after you a little and this time westover was too weak to protest he did not forbid jeffs taking off his overcoat he suffered him to light his spiritlamp and make a punch of the whiskey which he owned the doctor was giving him and when jeff handed him the steaming glass and asked him hows that he answered with a pleasure in it which he knew to be deplorable its fine  jeff stayed the whole evening with him and made him more comfortable than he had been since his cold began westover now talked seriously and frankly with him but no longer so harshly and in his relenting he felt a return of his old illogical liking for him he fancied in durgins kindness to himself an indirect regret and a desire to atone for what he had done and he said the effect is in youthe worst effect i dont think either of the young lyndes very exemplary people but youd be doing yourself a greater wrong than youve done then if you didnt recognize that you had been guilty toward them  jeff seemed struck by this notion what do you want me to do what can i do chase myself out of society something like that im willing its too easy though as i said ive never been wanted much there and i shouldnt be missed  well then how would you like to leave it to the people at lions head to say what you should do westover suggested  i shouldnt like it said jeff promptly theyd judge it as you doas if theyd done it themselves thats the reason women are not fit to judge his gay face darkened but tell em if you want to  bah cried the painter why should i want to im not a woman in everything  i beg your pardon mr westover i didnt mean that i only meant that youre an idealist i look at this thing as if some one else had done it i believe thats the practical way and i shouldnt go in for punishing any one else for such a thing very severely he made another punchfor himself this time he said but westover joined him in a glass of it  it wont do to take that view of your faults jeff he said gravely  whats the reason jeff demanded and now either the punch had begun to work in westovers brain or some other influence of like force and quality he perceived that in this earthbound temperament was the potentiality of all the success it aimed at the acceptance of the moral fact as it was without the unconscious effort to better it or to hold himself strictly to account for it was the secret of the power in the man which would bring about the material results he desired and this simplicity of the motive involved had its charm  westover was aware of liking durgin at that moment much more than he ought and of liking him helplessly in the light of his goodnatured selfishness the injury to the lyndes showed much less a sacrilege than it had seemed westover began to see it with jeffs eyes and to see it with reference to what might be low and mean in them instead of what might be fine and high  he was sensible of the growth jeff had made intellectually he had not been at harvard nearly four years for nothing he had phrases and could handle them in whatever obscure or perverse fashion he had profited by his opportunities the fellow who could accuse him of being an idealist and could in some sort prove it was no longer a naughty boy to be tutored and punished the revolt latent in him would be violent in proportion to the pressure put upon him and westover began to be without the wish to press his fault home to him so strongly in the optimism generated by the punch he felt that he might leave the case to jeff himself or else in the comfort we all experience in sinking to a lower level he was unwilling to make the effort to keep his own moral elevation but he did make an effort to save himself by saying you cant get what youve done before yourself as you can the action of some one else its part of you and you have to judge the motive as well as the effect  well thats what im doing said jeff but it seems to me that youre trying to have me judge of the effect from a motive i didnt have as far as i can make out i hadnt any motive at all  he laughed and all that westover could say was then youre still responsible for the result but this no longer appeared so true to him     xxxviii  it was not a condition of westovers welcome at lions head that he should seem peculiarly the friend of jeff durgin but he could not help making it so and he began to overact the part as soon as he met jeffs mother he had to speak of him in thanking her for remembering his wish to paint lions head in the winter and he had to tell her of jeffs thoughtfulness during the past fortnight he had to say that he did not believe he should ever have got away if it had not been for him this was true durgin had even come in from cambridge to see him off on the train he behaved as if the incident with lynde and all their talk about it had cemented the friendship between westover and himself and he could not be too devoted it now came out that he had written home all about westover and made his mother put up a stove in the painters old room so that he should have the instant use of it when he arrived  it was an airtight woodstove and it filled the chamber with a heat in which westover drowsed as soon as he entered it he threw himself on the bed and slept away the fatigue of his railroad journey and the cold of his drive with jombateeste from the station his nap was long and he woke from it in a pleasant languor with the dreamclouds still hanging in his brain he opened the damper of his stove and set it roaring again then he pulled down the upper sash of his window and looked out on a world whose elements of wood and snow and stone he tried to coordinate there was nothing else in that world but these things so repellent of one another he suffered from the incongruity of the wooden bulk of the hotel with the white drifts deep about it and with the granite cliffs of lions head before it where the gray crags darkened under the pink afternoon light which was beginning to play upon its crest from the early sunset the wind that had seemed to bore through his thick cap and his skull itself and that had tossed the dry snow like dust against his eyes on his way from the railroad had now fallen and an incomparable quiet wrapped the solitude of the hills a teasing sense of the impossibility of the scene as far as his art was concerned filled him full of a fond despair of rendering its feeling he could give its light and color and form in a sufficiently vivid suggestion of the fact but he could not make that pink flush seem to exhale like a long breath upon those rugged shapes he could not impart that sentiment of delicately almost of elegance which he found in the wilderness while every detail of civilization physically distressed him in one place the snow had been dug down to the pine planking of the pathway round the house and the contact of this woodenness with the frozen ground pierced his nerves and set his teeth on edge like a harsh noise when once he saw it he had to make an effort to take his eyes from it and in a sort unknown to him in summer he perceived the offence of the hotel itself amid the pure and lonely beauty of the winter landscape it was a note of intolerable banality of philistine pretence and vulgar convention such as whitwells low unpainted cottage at the foot of the hill did not give nor the little red schoolhouse on the other hand showing through the naked trees there should have been really no human habitation visible except a wigwam in the shelter of the pines here and there and when he saw whitwell making his way up the hillside road westover felt that if there must be any human presence it should be some savage clad in skins instead of the philosopher in his rubber boots and his clothingstore ulster he preferred the small wiry shape of jombateeste in his blue woollen cap and his canadian footgear as he ran round the corner of the house toward the barn and left the breath of his pipe in the fine air behind him  the light began to deepen from the pale pink to a crimson which stained the tops and steeps of snow and deepened the dark of the woods massed on the mountain slopes between the irregular fields of white the burnished brown of the hardwood trees the dull carbon shadows of the evergreens seemed to wither to one black as the red strengthened in the sky westover realized that he had lost the best of any possible picture in letting that first delicate color escape him this crimson was harsh and vulgar in comparison it would have almost a chromo quality he censured his pleasure in it as something gross and material like that of eating and on a sudden he felt hungry he wondered what time they would give him supper and he took slight account of the fact that a caprice of the wind had torn its hood of snow from the mountain summit and that the profile of the lions head showed almost as distinctly as in summer he stood before the picture which for that day at least was lost to him and questioned whether there would be a hearty meal something like a dinner or whether there would be something like a farmhouse supper mainly of doughnuts and tea  he pulled up his window and was going to lie down again when some one knocked and frank whitwell stood at the door do you want we should bring your supper to you here mr westover or will you  oh let me join you all cried the painter eagerly is it readyshall i come now  well in about five minutes or so frank went away after setting down in the room the lamp he had brought it was a lamp which westover thought he remembered from the farmhouse period and on his way down he realized as he had somehow not done in his summer sojourns the entirety of the old house in the hotel which had encompassed it the primitive cold of its stairways and passages struck upon him as soon as he left his own room and he found the parlor door closed against the chill there was a hot stovefire within and a kerosenelamp turned low but there was no one there and he had the photograph of his first picture of lions head to himself in the dim light the voices of mrs durgin and cynthia came to him from the diningroom and from the kitchen beyond with the occasional clash of crockery and the clang of iron upon iron about the stove and the quick tread of womens feet upon the bare floor with these pleasant noises came the smell of cooking and later there was an opening and shutting of doors with a thrill of the freezing air from without and the dull thumping of whitwells rubber boots and the quicker flapping of jombateestes soft leathern soles then there was the sweep of skirted feet at the parlor door and cynthia whitwell came in without perceiving him she went to the table by the darkening window and quickly turned up the light of the lamp in her ignorance of his presence he saw her as if she had been alone almost as if she were out of the body he received from her unconsciousness the impression of something rarely pure and fine and he had a sudden compassion for her as for something precious that is fated to be wasted or misprized at a little movement which he made to relieve himself from a sense of eavesdropping she gave a start and shut her lips upon the little cry that would have escaped from another sort of woman  i didnt know you were here she said and she flushed with the shyness of him which she always showed at first she had met him already with the rest but they had scarcely spoken together and he knew of the struggle she must now be making with herself when she went on i didnt know you had been called i thought you were still sleeping  yes i seemed to sleep for centuries said west over and i woke up feeling coeval with lions head but i hope to grow younger again  she faltered and then she asked did you see the light on it when the sun went down  i wish i hadnt i could never get that lighteven if it ever came again  its there every afternoon when its clear  im sorry for that i shall have to try for it then  wasnt that what you came for she asked by one of the efforts she was making with everything she said he could have believed he saw the pulse throbbing in her neck but she held herself stonestill and he divined her resolution to conquer herself if she should die for it  yes i came for that said westover thats what makes it so dismaying if i had only happened on it i shouldnt have been responsible for the failure i shall make of it  she smiled as if she liked his lightness but doubted if she ought we dont often get lions head clear of snow  yes thats another hardship said the painter everything is against me if we dont have a snow overnight and a cloudy day tomorrow i shall be in despair  she played with the little wheel of the wick she looked down and then with a glance flashed at him she gasped i shall have to take your lamp for the table tea is ready  oh well if you will only take me with it im frightfully hungry  apparently she could not say anything to that he tried to get the lamp to carry it out for her but she would not let him it isnt heavy she said and hurried out before him  it was all nothing but it was all very charming and westover was richly content with it and yet not content for he felt that the pleasure of it was not truly his but was a moment of merely borrowed happiness  the table was laid in the old farmhouse sittingroom where he had been served alone when he first came to lions head but now he sat down with the whole family even to jombateeste who brought in a faint odor of the barn with him  they had each been in contact with the finer world which revisits nature in the summertime and they must all have known something of its usages but they had reverted in form and substance to the rustic living of their neighbors they had steak for westover and baked potatoes but for themselves they had such farm fare as mrs durgin had given him the first time he supped there they made their meal chiefly of doughnuts and tea and hot biscuit with some sweet dishes of a festive sort added in recognition of his presence and there was mincepie for all mrs durgin and whitwell ate with their knives and jombateeste filled himself so soon with every implement at hand that he was able to ask excuse of the others if he left them for the horses before they had half finished frank whitwell fed with a kind of official or functional conformity to the ways of summer folks but cynthia at whom westover glanced with anxiety only drank some tea and ate a little bread and butter he was ashamed of his anxiety for he had owned that it ought not to have mattered if she had used her knife like her father and it seemed to him as if he had prompted mrs durgin by his curious glance to say we dont know half the time how the child lives cynthy take something to eat  cynthia pleaded that she was not hungry mrs durgin declared that she would die if she kept on as she was going and then the girl escaped to the kitchen on one of the errands which she made from time to time between the stove and the table  i presume its your coming mr westover mrs durgin went on with the comfortable superiority of elderly people to all the trials of the young i dont know why she should make a stranger of you every time youve known her pretty much all her life  ever since you give jeff what he deserved for scaring her and frank with his dog said whitwell  poor fox mrs durgin sighed he did have the least sense for a dog i ever saw and jeff used to be so fond of him well i guess he got tired of him too toward the last  hes gone to the happy huntinggrounds now colorady didnt agree with himor old age said whitwell i dont see why the injuns want right he pursued thoughtfully if theyve got souls why hant their dogs i suppose mr westover here would say there want any certainty about the injuns themselves  you know my weak point mr whitwell the painter confessed but i cant prove they havent  nor dogs neither i guess said whitwell tolerantly its curious though if animals have got souls that we hant ever had any communications from em you might say that agin the idea  no ill let you say it returned westover but a good many of the communications seem to come from the lower intelligences if not the lower animals  whitwell laughed out his delight in the thrust well i guess thats something so and them old egyptian devils over there that you say discovered the doctrine of immortality seemed to think a cat was about as good as a man whats that he appealed to mrs durgin jackson said in his last letter about their cat mummies  well i guess ill finish my supper first said mrs durgin whose nerves westover would not otherwise have suspected of faintness but jacksons letters she continued loyally are about the best letters  know theyd got some of em in the papers whitwell asked and at the surprise that westover showed he told him how a fellow who was trying to make a paper go over at the huddle had heard of jacksons letters and teased for some of them and had printed them as neighborhood news in that side of his paper which he did not buy ready printed in boston  mrs durgin studied with modest deprecation the effect of the fact upon westover and seemed satisfied with it well of course its interestin to jacksons old friends in the country here they know hed look at things over there pretty much as they would well i had to lend the letters round so much anyway it was a kind of a relief to have em in the paper where everybody could see em and be done with it mr whitell here he fixes em up sos to leave out the family part and i guess theyre pretty well thought of  westover said he had no doubt they were and he should want to see all the letters they could show him in print and out of print  if jackson only had jeffs health and opportunities the mother began with a suppressed passion in her regret  frank whitwell pushed back his chair i guess ill ask to be excused he said to the head of table  there i ant goin to say any more about that if thats what youre afraid of frank said mrs durgin well i presume i do talk a good deal about jackson when i get goin and i presume its natural cynthy shouldnt want i should talk about jeff before folks frank ant you goin to wait for that plate of hot biscuitif she ever gits it here  i guess i dont care for anything more said frank and he got himself out of the room more inarticulately than he need westover thought  his father followed his retreat with an eye of humorous intelligence i guess frank dont want to keep the young ladies waitin a great while theres a church sociable over t the huddle he explained to westover  oh thats it is it mrs durgin put in why didnt he say so  well the young folks dont any of em seem to want to talk about such things nowadays and i dont know as they ever did whitwell took westover into his confidence with a wink  the biscuit that cynthia brought in were burned a little on top and mrs durgin recognized the fact with the question did you get to studyin out there take one do mr westover you hant made half a meal if i didnt keep round after her i dont know what would become of us all the young ladies down at boston any of em try to keep up with the fellows in college  i suppose they do in the harvard annex said westover simply in spite of the glance with which mrs durgin tried to convey a covert meaning he understood it afterward but for the present his singlemindedness spared the girl  she remained to clear away the table when the rest left it and westover followed mrs durgin into the parlor where she indemnified herself for refraining from any explicit allusion to jeff before cynthia the boy she explained when she had made him ransack his memory for every scrap of fact concerning her son dont hardly ever write to me and i guess he dont give cynthy very much news i presume hes workin harder than ever this year and im glad hes goin about a little from what you say i guess hes got to feelin a little better it did worry me for him to feel so what you may call meechin about folks you see anything that made you think he want appreciated  after westover got back into his own room some one knocked at his door and he found whitwell outside he scarcely asked him to come in but whitwell scarcely needed the invitation got everything you want i told cynthy id come up and see after you frank wont be back in time he sat down and put his feet on top of the stove and struck the heels of his boots on its edge from the habit of knocking the caked snow off them in that way on stovetops he did not wait to find out that there was no responsive sizzling before he asked with a long nasal sigh well how is jeff gettin along  he looked across at westover who had provisionally seated himself on his bed  why in the old way whitwell kept his eye on him and he added i suppose we dont any of us change we develop  whitwell smiled with pleasure in the loosely philosophic suggestion you mean that hes the same kind of a man that he was a boy well i guess thats so the question is what kind of a boy was he ive been mullin over that considable since cynthy and him fixed it up together of course i know its their business and all that but i presume ive got a right to speelate about it  he referred the point to westover who knew an inner earnestness in it in spite of whitwells habit of outside jocosity every right in the world i should say mr whitwell he answered seriously  well im glad you feel that way said whitwell with a little apparent surprise i dont want to meddle any but i know what cynthy isi no need to brag her upand i dont feel so over and above certain t i know what he is hes a good deal of a mixture if you want to know how he strikes me i dont mean i dont like him i do the fellows got a way with him that makes me kind of like him when i see him hes goodnatured and clever and hes willin to take any amount of trouble for you but you cant tell where to have him westover denied the appeal for explicit assent in whitwells eye and he went on if id done that fellow a good turn in spite of him or if id held him up to something that he allowed was right and consented to i should want to keep a sharp lookout that he didnt play me some ugly trick for it hes a comical devil whitwell ended rather inadequately how ds it look to you seen anything lately that seemed to tally with my idee  no no i cant say that i have said westover reluctantly he wished to be franker than he now meant to be but he consulted a scruple that he did not wholly respect a mere convention it seemed to him presently he said ive always felt that charm in him too and ive seen the other traits though not so clearly as you seem to have done he has a powerful will yes  he stopped and whitwell asked been up to any deviltry lately  i cant say he has nothing that i can call intentional  no said whitwell whats he done though  really mr whitwell i dont know that you have any right to expect me to talk him over when im here as his mothers guesthis own guest  no i hant said whitwell what about the father of the girl hes goin to marry  westover could not deny the force of this youd be anxious if i didnt tell you what i had in mind i dare say more than if i did he told him of jeffs behavior with alan lynde and of his talk with him about it and i think he was honest it was something that happened that wasnt meant  whitwell did not assent directly somewhat to westovers surprise he asked fellow ever done anything to jeff  not that i know of i dont know that they ever met before  whitwell kicked his heels on the edge of the stove again then it might been an accident he said dryly  westover had to break the silence that followed and he found himself defending jeff though somehow not for jeffs sake he urged that if he had the strong will they both recognized in him he would never commit the errors of a weak man which were usually the basest  how do you know that a strongwilled man ant a weak one whitwell astonished him by asking ant what we call a strong will just a kind of a bulldog clinch that the dog himself cant unloose i take it a man that has a good will is a strong man if jeff done a right thing against his will he wouldnt rest easy till hed showed that he want obliged to by some mischief worse n what he was kept out of i tell you mr westover if id made that fellow toe the mark any way id be afraid of him whitwell looked at westover with eyes of significance if not of confidence then he rose with a prolonged mwelll were all born but we ant all buried this world is a queer place but i guess jeff ll come out right in the end  westover said im sure he will and he shook hands warmly with the father of the girl jeff was going to marry  whitwell came back after he had got some paces away and said of course this is between you and me mr westover  of course  i dont mean mis durgin i shouldnt care what she thought of my talkin him over with you i dont know he continued putting up his hand against the doorframe to give himself the comfort of its support while he talked as you understood what she mean by the young ladies at boston keepin up with the fellows in college well thats what cynthys doin with jeff right along and if he ever works off them conditions of his and gits his degree it ll be because she helped him to i tell you theres more than one kind of telepathy in this world mr westover thats all     xxxix  westover understood from whitwells afterthought that it was cynthia he was anxious to keep ignorant of his misgivings if they were so much as misgivings but the importance of this fact could not stay him against the tide of sleep which was bearing him down when his head touched the pillow it swept over him and he rose from it in the morning with a gayety of heart which he knew to be returning health he jumped out of bed and stuffed some shavings into his stove from the woodbox beside it and laid some logs on them he slid the damper open and then lay down again listening to the fire that showed its red teeth through the slats and roared and laughed to the day which sparkled on the white world without when he got out of bed a second time he found the room so hot that he had to pull down his windowsash and he dressed in a temperature of twenty degrees below zero without knowing that the dry air was more than fresh mrs durgin called to him through the open door of her parlor as he entered the diningroom cynthy will give you your breakfast mr westover were all done long ago and im busy in here and the girl appeared with the coffeepot and the dishes she had been keeping hot for him at the kitchen stove she seemed to be going to leave him when she had put them down before him but she faltered and then she asked do you want i should pour your coffee for you  oh yes do he begged and she sat down across the table from him im ashamed to make this trouble for you he added i didnt know it was so late  oh we have the whole day for our work she answered tolerantly  he laughed and said how strange that seems i suppose i shall get used to it but in town we seem never to have a whole day for a days work we always have to do part of it at night or the next morning do you ever have a day here thats too large a size for its work  you can nearly always find something to do about a house she returned evasively but the time doesnt go the way it does in the summer  oh i know how the country is in the winter he said i was brought up in the country  i didnt know that she said and she gave him a stare of surprise before her eyes fell  yes out in wisconsin my people were emigrants and i lived in the woods there till i began to paint my way out i began pretty early but i was in the woods till i was sixteen  i didnt know that she repeated i always thought that you were  summer folks like the rest no im alltheyearround folks originally but i havent been in the country in the winter since i was a boy and its all been coming back to me here like some one elses experience  she did not say anything but the interest in her eyes which she could not keep from his face now prompted him to go on  you can make a beginning in the west easier than you can in the east and some people who came to our lumber camp discovered me and gave me a chance to begin i went to milwaukee first and they made me think i was somebody then i came on to new york and they made me think i was nobody i had to go to europe to find out which i was but after i had been there long enough i didnt care to know what i was trying to do was the important thing to me not the fellow who was trying to do it  yes she said with intelligence  i met some boston people in italy and i thought i should like to live where that kind of people lived thats the way i came to be in boston it all seems very simple now but i used to think it might look romantic from the outside ive had a happy life and im glad it began in the country i shouldnt care if it ended there i dont know why ive bothered you with my autobiography though perhaps because i thought you knew it already  she looked as if she would have said something fitting if she could have ruled herself to it but she said nothing at all her failure seemed to abash her and she could only ask him if he would not have some more coffee and then excuse herself and leave him to finish his breakfast alone  that day he tried for his picture from several points outofdoors before he found that his own window gave him the best with the window open and the stove warm at his back he worked there in great comfort nearly every afternoon the snows kept off and the clear sunsets burned behind the summit day after day he painted frankly and faithfully and made a picture which he said to himself no one would believe in with that warm color tender upon the frozen hills the soft suffusion of the winter scene was improbable to him when he had it in nature before his eyes when he looked at it as he got it on his canvas it was simply impossible  in the forenoons he had nothing to do for he worked at his picture only when the conditions renewed themselves with the sinking sun he tried to be in the open air and get the good of it but his strength for walking had failed him and he kept mostly to the paths broken around the house he went a good deal to the barn with whitwell and jombateeste to look after the cattle and the horses whose subdued stamping and champing gave him a sort of animal pleasure the blended odors of the haymows and of the creatures breaths came to him with the faint warmth which their bodies diffused through the cold obscurity  when the wide doors were rolled back and the full day was let in he liked the appeal of their startled eyes and the calls they made to one another from their stalls while the men spoke back to them in terms which they seemed to have in common with them and with the poultry that flew down from the barn lofts to the barn floor and out into the brilliant day with loud clamor and affected alarm  in these simple experiences he could not imagine the summer life of the place it was nowhere more extinct than in the hollow verandas where the rockingchairs swung in july and august and where westovers steps in his long tramps up and down woke no echo of the absent feet indoors he kept to the few stoveheated rooms where he dwelt with the family and sent only now and then a vague conjecture into the hotel built round the old farmhouse he meant before he left to ask mrs durgin to let him go through the hotel but he put it off from day to day with a physical shrinking from its cold and solitude  the days went by in the swiftness of monotony his excursions to the barn his walks on the verandas his work on his picture filled up the few hours of the light and when the dark came he contentedly joined the little group in mrs durgins parlor he had brought two or three books with him and sometimes he read from one of them or he talked with whitwell on some of the questions of life and death that engaged his speculative mind jombateeste preferred the kitchen for the naps he took after supper before his early bedtime frank whitwell sat with his books there where westover sometimes saw his sister helping him at his studies he was loyally faithful and obedient to her in all things he helped her with the dishes and was not ashamed to be seen at this work she had charge of his goings and comings in society he submitted to her taste in his dress and accepted her counsel on many points which he referred to her and discussed with her in lowspoken conferences he seemed a formal serious boy shy like his sister his father let fall some hints of a religious cast of mind in him he had an ambition beyond the hotel he wished to study for the ministry and it was not alone the chance of going home with the girls that made him constant at the evening meetings i dont know where he gits it said his father with a shake of the head that suggested doubt of the wisdom of the sons preference of theology to planchette  cynthia had the same care of her father as of her brother she kept him neat and held him up from lapsing into the slovenliness to which he would have tended if she had not as westover suspected made constant appeals to him for the respect due their guest mrs durgin for her part left everything to cynthia with a contented acceptance of her future rule and an abiding trust in her sense and strength which included the details of the light work that employed her rather luxurious leisure jombateeste himself came to cynthia with his mending and her needle kept him tight and firm against the winter which it amused westover to realize was the canucks native element insomuch that there was now something incongruous in the notion of jombateeste and any other season  the girls motherly care of all the household did not leave westover out buttons appeared on garments long used to shifty contrivances for getting on without them buttonholes were restored to their proper limits his overcoat pockets were searched for gloves and the gloves put back with their fingertips drawn close as the petals of a flower which had decided to shut and be a bud again  he wondered how he could thank her for his share of the blessing that her passion for motherly care was to all the house it was pathetic and he used sometimes to forecast her selfdevotion with a tender indignation which included a due sense of his own present demerit he was not reconciled to the sacrifice because it seemed the happiness or at least the will of the nature which made it all the same it seemed a waste in its relation to the man she was to marry  mrs durgin and cynthia sat by the lamp and sewed at night or listened to the talk of the men if westover read aloud they whispered together from time to time about some matters remote from it as women always do where there is reading it was quiet but it was not dull for westover who found himself in no hurry to get back to town  sometimes he thought of the town with repulsion its unrest its vacuous troubled life haunted him like a memory of sickness but he supposed that when he should be quite well again all that would change and be as it was before he interested himself with the sort of shrewd ignorance of it that cynthia showed in the questions she asked about it now and then when they chanced to be left alone together he fancied that she was trying to form some intelligible image of jeffs environment there and was piecing together from his talk of it the impressions she had got from summer folks he did his best to help her and to construct for her a veritable likeness of the world as far as he knew it  a time came when he spoke frankly of jeff in something they were saying and she showed no such shrinking as he had expected she would he reflected that she might have made stricter conditions with mrs durgin than she expected to keep herself in mentioning him this might well have been necessary with the mothers pride in her son which knew no stop when it once began to indulge itself what struck westover more than the girls selfpossession when they talked of jeff was a certain austerity in her with regard to him she seemed to hold herself tense against any praise of him as if she should fail him somehow if she relaxed at all in his favor  this at least was the rather mystifying impression which westover got from her evident wish to criticise and understand exactly all that he reported rather than to flatter herself from it whatever her motive was he was aware that through it all she permitted herself a closer and fuller trust of himself at times it was almost too implicit he would have liked to deserve it better by laying open all that had been in his heart against jeff but he forbore of course and he took refuge as well as he could in the respect by which she held herself at a reverent distance from him when he could not wholly respect himself     xl  one morning westover got leave from mrs durgin to help cynthia open the dim rooms and cold corridors at the hotel to the sun and air she promised him he should take his death but he said he would wrap up warm and when he came to join the girl in his overcoat and fur cap he found cynthia equipped with a woollen cloud tied around her head and a little shawl pinned across her breast  is that all he reproached her i ought to have put on a single wreath of artificial flowers and some sort of a blazer for this expedition dont you think so mrs durgin  i believe women can stand about twice as much cold as you can the best of you she answered grimly  then i must try to keep myself as warm as i can with work he said you must let me do all the rough work of airing out wont you cynthia  there isnt any rough work about it she answered in a sort of motherly toleration of his mood without losing anything of her filial reverence  she took care of him he perceived as she took care of her brother and her father but with a delicate respect for his superiority which was no longer shyness  they began with the office and the parlor where they flung up the windows and opened the doors and then they opened the diningroom where the tables stood in long rows with the chairs piled on them legs upward cynthia went about with many sighs for the dust on everything though to westovers eyes it all seemed frigidly clean if it goes on as it has for the past two years she said we shall have to add on a new diningroom i dont know as i like to have it get so large  i never wanted it to go beyond the original farmhouse said westover ive been jealous of every boarder but the first i should have liked to keep it for myself and let the world know lions head from my pictures  i guess mrs durgin thinks it was your picture that began to send people here  and do you blame me too what if the thing im doing now should make it a winter resort nothing could save you then but a fire i believe thats jeffs ambition only he would want to put another hotel in place of this something that would be more popular then the ruin i began would be complete and i shouldnt come any more i couldnt bear the sight  i guess mrs durgin wouldnt think it was lions head if you stopped coming said cynthia  but you would know better than that said westover and then he was sorry he had said it for it seemed to ask something of different quality from her honest wish to make him know their regard for him  she did not answer but went down a long corridor to which they had mounted to raise the window at the end while he raised another at the opposite extremity when they met at the stairway again to climb to the story above he said i am always ashamed when i try to make a person of sense say anything silly and she flushed still without answering as if she understood him and his meaning pleased her but fortunately a person of sense is usually equal to the temptation one ought to be serious when he tries it with a person of the other sort but i dont know that one is  do you feel any draught between these windows asked cynthia abruptly i dont want you should take cold  oh im all right said westover  she went into the rooms on one side of the corridor and put up their windows and flung the blinds back he did the same on the other side he got a peculiar effect of desolation from the mattresses pulled down over the foot of the bedsteads and the dismantled interiors reflected in the mirrors of the dressingcases and he was going to speak of it when he rejoined cynthia at the stairway leading to the third story when she said those were mrs vostrands rooms i came out of the last she nodded her head over her shoulder toward the floor they were leaving  were they indeed and do you remember peoples rooms so long  yes i always think of rooms by the name of people that have them if theyre any way peculiar  he thought this bit of uncandor charming and accepted it as if it were the whole truth and mrs vostrand was certainly peculiar tell me cynthia what did you think of her  she was only here a little while  but you wouldnt have come to think of her rooms by her name if she hadnt made a strong impression on you she did not answer and he said i see you didnt like her  the girl would not speak and mr westover went on she used to be very good to me and i think she used to be better to herself than she is now he knew that jeff must have told cynthia of his affair with genevieve vostrand and he kept himself from speaking of her by a resolution he thought creditable as he mounted the stairs to the upper story in the silence to which cynthia left his last remark at the top she made a little pause in the obscurer light of the closeshuttered corridor while she said i liked her daughter the best  yes he returned inever felt very well acquainted with her i believe one couldnt get far with her though for the matter of that one didnt get far with mrs vostrand herself did you think genevieve was much influenced by her mother  she didnt seem a strong character  no that was it she was what her mother wished her to be ive often wondered how much she was interested in the marriage she made  cynthia let a rustic silence ensue and westover shrank again from the inquisition he longed to make  it was not genevieve vostrands marriage which really concerned him but cynthias engagement and it was her mind that he would have liked to look into it might well be supposed that she regarded it in a perfect matteroffact way and with no ambition beyond it she was a country girl acquainted from childhood with facts of life which townbred girls would not have known without a blunting of the sensibilities and why should she be different from other country girls she might be as good and as fine as he saw her and yet be insensible to the spiritual toughness of jeff because of her love for him her very goodness might make his badness unimaginable to her and if her refinement were from the conscience merely and not from the tastes and experiences too there was not so much to dread for her in her marriage with such a man still he would have liked if he could to tell her what he had told her father of durgins behavior with lynde and let her bring the test of her selfdevotion to the case with a clear understanding he had sometimes been afraid that whitwell might not be able to keep it to himself but now he wished that the philosopher had not been so discreet he had all this so absorbingly in mind that he started presently with the fear that she had said something and he had not answered but when he asked her he found that she had not spoken they were standing at an open window looking out upon lions head when he said i dont know how i shall show my gratitude to mrs durgin and you for thinking of having me up here ive done a picture of lions head that might be ever so much worse but i shouldnt have dreamed of getting at it if it hadnt been for you though ive so often dreamed of doing it now i shall go home richer in every sort of waythanks to you  she answered simply you neednt thank anybody but it was jeff who thought of it we were ready enough to ask you  that was very good of him said westover whom her words confirmed in a suspicion he had had all along but what did it matter that jeff had suggested their asking him and then attributed the notion to them it was not so malign for him to use that means of ingratiating himself with westover and of making him forget his behavior with lynde and it was not unnatural it was very characteristic at the worst it merely proved that jeff was more ashamed of what he had done than he would allow and that was to his credit  he heard cynthia asking mr westover have you ever been at class day he wants us to come  class day oh class day he took a little time to gather himself together yes ive been at a good many if you care to see something pretty its the prettiest thing in the world the students sisters and mothers come from everywhere and theres fashion and feasting and flirting from ten in the morning till ten at night im not sure theres so much happiness but i cant tell the young people know about that i fancy theres a good deal of defeat and disappointment in it all but if you like beautiful dresses and music and dancing and a great flutter of gayety you can get more of it at class day than you can in any other way the good time depends a great deal upon the acquaintance a student has and whether he is popular in college westover found this road a little impassable and he faltered  cynthia did not apparently notice his hesitation do you think mrs durgin would like it  mrs durgin westover found that he had been leaving her out of the account and had been thinking only of cynthias pleasure or pain well i dont supposeit would be rather fatiguingdid jeff want her to come too  he said so  thats very nice of him if he could devote himself to her butand would she like to go  to please him she would westover was silent and the girl surprised him by the appeal she suddenly made to him mr westover do you believe it would be very well for either of us to go i think it would be better for us to leave all that part of his life alone its no use in pretending that were like the kind of people he knows or that we know their ways and i dont believe  westover felt his heart rise in indignant sympathy there isnt any one he knows to compare with you he said and in this he was thinking mainly of bessie lynde youre worth a thousandif i wereif hes half a man he would be proudi beg your pardon i dont meanbut you understand  cynthia put her head far out of the window and looked along the steep roof before them there is a blind off one of the windows i heard it clapping in the wind the other night i must go and see the number of the room she drew her head in quickly and ran away without letting him see her face  he followed her let me help you put it on again  no no she called back frank will do that or jombateeste when they come to shut up the house     xli  westover did not meet durgin for several days after his return from lions head he brought messages for him from his mother and from whitwell and he waited for him to come and get them so long that he had to blame himself for not sending them to him when jeff appeared at the end of a week westover had a certain embarrassment in meeting him and the effort to overcome this carried him beyond his sincerity he was aware of feigning the cordiality he showed and of having less real liking for him than ever before he suggested that he must be busier every day now with his college work and he resented the air of social prosperity which jeff put on in saying yes there was that and then he had some engagements which kept him from coming in sooner  he did not say what the engagements were and they did not recur to the things they had last spoken of westover could not do so without jeffs leading and he was rather glad that he gave none he stayed only a little time which was spent mostly in a show of interest on both sides and the hollow hilarities which people use to mask their indifference to one anothers being and doing jeff declared that he had never seen westover looking so well and said he must go up to lions head again it had done him good as for his picture it was a corker it made him feel as if he were there he asked about all the folks and received westovers replies with vague laughter and an absence in his bold eye which made the painter wonder what his mind was on without the wish to find out he was glad to have him go though he pressed him to drop in soon again and said they would take in a play together  jeff said he would like to do that and he asked at the door whether westover was going to the tea at mrs bellinghams he said he had to look in there before he went out to cambridge and left westover in mute amaze at the length he had apparently gone in a road that had once seemed no thoroughfare for him jeffs social acceptance even after the enderby ball which was now some six or seven weeks past had been slow but of late for no reason that he or any one else could have given it had gained a sudden precipitance and people who wondered why they met him at other houses began to ask him to their own  he did not care to go to their houses and he went at first in the hope of seeing bessie lynde again but this did not happen for some time and it was a midlenten tea that brought them together as soon as he caught sight of her he went up to her and began to talk as if they had been in the habit of meeting constantly she could not control a little start at his approach and he frankly recognized it  whats the matter  ohthe window  it isnt open he said trying it do you want to try it yourself  i think i can trust you she answered but she sank a little into the shelter of the curtains not to be seen talking with him perhaps or not to be interruptedshe did not analyze her motive closely  he remained talking to her until she went away and then he contrived to go with her she did not try to escape him after that each time they met she had the pleasure of realizing that there had never been any danger of what never happened but beyond this she could perhaps have given no better reason for her willingness to meet him again and again than the bewildered witnesses of the fact in her set people not only never married outside of it but they never flirted outside of it for one of themselves even for a girl like bessie whom they had not quite known from childhood to be apparently amusing herself with a man like that so wholly alien in origin in tradition was something unheard of and it began to look as if bessie lynde was more than amused it seemed to mary enderby that wherever she went she saw that man talking to bessie she could have believed that it was by some evil art that he always contrived to reach bessies side if anything could have been less like any kind of art than the bold push he made for her as soon as he saw her in a room but sometimes miss enderby feared that it was bessie who used such finesse as there was and always put herself where he could see her she waited with trembling for her to give the affair sanction by making her aunt ask him to something at her house on the other hand she could not help feeling that bessies flirtation was all the more deplorable for the want of some such legitimation  she did not even know certainly whether jeff ever called upon bessie at her aunts house till one day the man let him out at the same time he let her in  oh come up molly bessie sang out from the floor above and met her halfway down the stairs where she kissed her and led her embraced into the library  you dont like my jay do you dear she asked promptly  mary enderby turned her face the mirror of conscience upon her and asked is he your jay  well no not just in that sense molly but suppose he was  then i should have nothing to say  and suppose he wasnt  still mary enderby found herself with nothing of all she had a thousand times thought she should say to bessie if she had ever the slightest chance it always seemed so easy till now to take bessie in her arms and appeal to her good sense her selfrespect her regard for her family and friends and now it seemed so impossible  she heard herself answering very stiffly perhaps id better apologize for what ive said already you must think i was very unjust the last time we mentioned him  not at all cried bessie with a laugh that sounded very mocking and very unworthy to her friend hes all that you said and worse but hes more than you said and better  i dont understand said mary coldly  hes very interesting hes original hes different  oh every one says that  and he doesnt flatter me or pretend to think much of me if he did i couldnt bear him you know how i am molly he keeps me interested dont you understand and prowling about in the great unknown where he has his weird being  bessie put her hand to her mouth and laughed at mary enderby with her slanted eyes a sort of parisian version of a chinese motive in eyes  i suppose her friend said sadly you wont tell me more than you wish  i wont tell you more than i knowthough id like to said bessie she gave mary a sudden hug you dear there isnt anything of it if thats what you mean  but isnt there danger that there will be bessie her friend entreated  danger i shouldnt call it danger exactly  but if you dont respect him bessie  why how can i he doesnt respect me  i know youre teasing now said mary enderby getting up and youre quite right i have no business to  bessie pulled her down upon the seat again yes you have dont i tell you over and over he doesnt respect me because i dont know how to make him and he wouldnt like it if i did but now ill try to make you understand i dont believe i care for him the least but mind im not certain for ive never cared for any one and i dont know what its like you know im not sentimental i think sentiments funny and im not dignified  youre divine murmured mary enderby with reproachful adoration  yes but you see how my divinity could be improved said bessie with a wild laugh im not sentimental but im emotional and he gives me emotions hes a riddle and im all the time guessing at him you get the answer to the kind of men we know easily and its very nice but it doesnt amuse you so much as trying now mr durginwhat a name i can see it makes you creepis no more like one of us than abear isand his attitude toward us is that of a bear whos gone so much with human beings that he thinks hes a human being hes delightful that way and do you know hes intellectual he actually brings me books and wants to read passages to me out of them he has brought me the plans of the new hotel hes going to build its to be very aesthetic and its going to be called the lions head inn theres to be a little theatre for amateur dramatics which i could conduct and for all sorts of professional amusements if you should ever come molly im sure we shall do our best to make you comfortable  mary enderby would not let bessie laugh upon her shoulder after she said this bessie lynde she said severely if you have no regard for yourself you ought to have some regard for him you may say you are not encouraging him and you may believe it  oh i shouldnt say it if i didnt believe it bessie broke in with a mock air of seriousness  i must be going said mary stiffly and this time she succeeded in getting to her feet  bessie laid hold of her again you think youve been trifled with dont you dear  no  yes you do dont you try to be slippery molly the plain pikestaff is your style morally speakingif any one knows what a pikestaff is well now listen youre anxious about me  you know how i feel bessie said mary enderby looking her in the eyes  yes i do said bessie the trouble is i dont know how i feel but if i ever do molly ill tell you is that fair  yes  ill give you ample warning at the least little consciousness in the region of the pericardium off will go a note by a district messenger and when you come ill do whatever you say there  oh bessie cried her friend and she threw her arms round her you always were the most fascinating creature in the world  yes said bessie thats what i try to have him think     xlii  toward the end of april most people who had places at the shore were mostly in them but they came up to town on frequent errands and had one effect of evanescence with people who still remained in their boston houses provisionally and seemed more than half absent the enderbys had been at the shore for a fortnight and the lyndes were going to be a fortnight longer in boston yet as bessie made her friend observe when mary ran in for lunch or stopped for a moment on her way to the train every few days they were both of the same transitory quality  it might as well be i as you bessie said one day if we only think so its all very weird dear and im not sure but it is you who sit day after day at my lonely casement and watch the sparrows examining the fuzzy buds of the jap ivy to see just how soon they can hope to build in the vines do you object to the ivy buds looking so very much like snipped woollen rags if you do im sure its you here in my place for when i come up to town in your personality it sets my teeth on edge in fact thats the worst thing about boston nowthe fuzzy ivy buds theres so much ivy when you can forget the buds there are a great many things to make you happy i feel quite as if we were spending the summer in town and i feel very adventurous and very virtuous like some sort of selfrighteous bohemian you dont know how i look down on people who have gone out of town i consider them very selfish and heartless i dont know why exactly but when we have a good marrowfreezing northeasterly storm and the newspapers come out with their ironical congratulations to the taxdodgers at the shore i feel that providence is on my side and im getting my reward even in this world bessie suddenly laughed i see by your expression of fixed inattention molly that youre thinking of mr durgin  mary gave a start of protest but she was too honest to deny the fact outright and bessie ran on  no we dont sit on a bench in the common or even in the garden or on the walk in commonwealth avenue if we come to it later as the season advances i shall make him stay quite at the other end of the bench and not put his hand along the top you neednt be afraid molly all the proprieties shall be religiously observed perhaps i shall ask aunt louisa to let us sit out on her front steps when the evenings get warmer but i assure you its much more comfortable indoors yet even in town though youll hardly believe it at the shore shall you come up to class day  oh i dont know mary began with a sigh of the baffled hope and the inextinguishable expectation which the mention of class day stirs in the heart of every boston girl past twenty  yes said bessie with a sigh burlesqued from marys that is what we all say and it is certainly the most maddening of human festivals i suppose if we were quite left to ourselves we shouldnt go but we seem never to be quite after every class day i say to myself that nothing on earth could induce me to go to another but when it comes round again i find myself grasping at any straw of a pretext im pretending now that ive a tender obligation to go because its his class day  bessie cried mary enderby you dont mean it  not if i say it mary dear what did i promise you about the pericardiac symptoms but i feeli feel that if he asks me i must go shouldnt you like to go and see a jay class daybe part of it think of going once to the pi ute spreador whatever it is and dancing in their tent and being left out of the gym and beck yes i ought to go so that it can be brought home to me and i can have a realizing sense of what i am doing and be stayed in my mad career  perhaps mary enderby suggested colorlessly he will be devoted to his own people she had a cold fascination in the picture bessies words had conjured up and she was saying this less to bessie than to herself  and i should meet themhis mothers and sisters bessie dramatized an excess of anguish oh mary that is the very thorn i have been trying not to press my heart against and does your hand commend it to my embrace his folks yes they would be folks and what folks i think i am getting a realizing sense wait dont speak dont move molly bessie dropped her chin into her hand and stared straight forward gripping mary enderbys hand  mary withdrew it i shall have to go bessie she said how is your aunt  must you then i shall always say that it was your fault that i couldnt get a realizing sensethat you prevented me just when i was about to see myself as others see meas you see me shes very well bessie sighed in earnest and her friend gave her hand a little pressure of true sympathy but of course its rather dull here now  i hate to have you staying on couldnt you come down to us for a week  no we both think its best to be here when alan gets back we want him to go down with us bessie had seldom spoken openly with mary enderby about her brother but that was rather from marys shrinking than her own she knew that everybody understood his case she went so far now as to say hes ever so much better than he has been we have such hopes of him if he can keep well when he gets back this time  oh i know he will said mary fervently im sure of it couldnt we do something for you bessie  no there isnt anything butthank you i know you always think of me and thats worlds when are you coming up again  i dont know next week some time  come in and see meand alan if he should be at home he likes you and he will be so glad  mary kissed bessie for consent you know how much i admire alan he could be anything  yes he could if he could  bessie seldom put so much earnest in anything and mary loved as she would have said the sad sincerity the honest hopelessness of her tone we must help him i know we can  we must try but people who couldif they could bessie stopped  her friend divined that she was no longer speaking wholly of her brother but she said there isnt any if about it and there are no ifs about anything if we only think so its a sin not to think so  the mixture of severity and of optimism in the nature of her friend had often amused bessie and it did not escape her tacit notice in even so serious a moment as this her theory was that she was shocked to recognize it now because of its relation to her brother but her theories did not always agree with the facts  that evening however she was truly surprised when after a rather belated ring at the door the card of mr thomas jefferson durgin came up to her from the receptionroom her aunt had gone to bed and she had a luxurious moment in which she reaped all the reward of selfdenial by supposing herself to have foregone the pleasure of seeing him and sending down word that she was not at home she did not wish indeed to see him but she wished to know how he felt warranted in calling in the evening and it was this unworthy curiosity which she stifled for that luxurious moment the next with undiminished dignity she said ask him to come up andrew and she waited in the library for him to offer a justification of the liberty he had taken  he offered none whatever but behaved at once as if he had always had the habit of calling in the evening or as if it was a general custom which he need not account for in his own case he brought her a book which they had talked of at their last meeting but he made no excuse or pretext of it  he said it was a beautiful night and that he had found it rather warm walking in from cambridge the exercise had moistened his whole rich red color and fine drops of perspiration stood on his cleanshaven upper lip and in the hollow between his under lip and his bold chin he pushed back the coarse darkyellow hair from his forehead with his handkerchief and let his eyes mock her from under his thick strawcolored eyebrows she knew that he was enjoying his own impudence and he was so handsome that she could not refuse to enjoy it with him she asked him if he would not have a fan and he allowed her to get it for him from the mantel will you have some tea  no but a glass of water if you please he said and bessie rang and sent for some apollinaris which jeff drank a great goblet of when it came then he lay back in the deep chair he had taken with the air of being ready for any little amusing thing she had to say  are you still a pessimist mr durgin she asked tentatively with the effect of innocence that he knew meant mischief  no he said im a reformed optimist  what is that  its a man who cant believe all the good he would like but likes to believe all the good he can  bessie said it over with burlesque thoughtfulness there was a girl here today she said solemnly who must have been a reformed pessimist then for she said the same thing  oh miss enderby said jeff  bessie started youre preternatural but what a pity you should be mistaken how came you to think of her  she doesnt like me and you always put me on trial after shes been here  am i putting you on trial now its your guilty conscience why shouldnt mary enderby like you  because im not good enough  oh and what has that to do with peoples liking you if that was a reason how many friends do you think you would have  im not sure that i should have any  and doesnt that make you feel badly  very jeffs confession was a smiling one  you dont show it  i dont want to grieve you  oh im not sure that would grieve me  well i thought i wouldnt risk it  how considerate of you  they had come to a little barrier up that way and could go no further jeff said ive just been interviewing another reformed pessimist  mr westover  youre preternatural too and youre not mistaken either do you ever go to his studio  no i havent been there since he told me it would be of no use to come as a student he can be terribly frank  nobody knows that better than i do said jeff with a smile for the notion of westovers frankness as he had repeatedly experienced it but he means well  oh thats what they always say but all the frankness cant be well meant why should uncandor be the only form of malevolence  thats a good idea i believe ill put that up on westover the next time hes frank  and will you tell me what he says  oh i dont know about that jeff lay back in his chair at large ease and chuckled i should like to tell you what hes just been saying to me but i dont believe i can  do  you know he was up at lions head in february and got a winter impression of the mountain did you see it  no was that what you were talking about  we talked about something a great deal more interestingthe impression he got of me  winter impression  cold enough he had come to the conclusion that i was very selfish and unworthy that i used other people for my own advantage or let them use themselves that i was treacherous and vindictive and if i didnt betray a man i couldnt be happy till i had beaten him he said that if i ever behaved well it came after i had been successful one way or the other  how perfectly fascinating bessie rested her elbow on the corner of the table and her chin in the palm of the hand whose thin fingers tapped her red lips the light sleeve fell down and showed her pretty lean little forearm did it strike you as true at all  i could see how it might strike him as true  now you are candid but go on what did he expect you to do about it  nothing he said he didnt suppose i could help it  this is immense said bessie i hope im taking it all in how came he to give you this flattering little impression so hopeful too or perhaps your frankness doesnt go any farther  oh i dont mind saying he seemed to think it was a sort of abstract duty he owed to my people  yourfolks asked bessie  yes said jeff with a certain dryness but as her face looked blankly innocent he must have decided that she meant nothing offensive he relaxed into a broad smile its a queer household up there in the winter i wonder what you would think of it  you might describe it to me and perhaps we shall see  you couldnt realize it said jeff with a finality that piqued her he reached out for the bottle of apollinaris with somehow the effect of being in another students room and poured himself a glass this would have amused her nine times out of ten but the tenth time had come when she chose to resent it  i suppose she said you are all very much excited about class day at cambridge  that sounds like a remark made to open the way to conversation jeff went on to burlesque a reply in the same spirit oh very much so indeed miss lynde we are all looking forward to it so eagerly are you coming  she rejected his lead with a slight sigh so skilfully drawn that it deceived him when she said gravely  i dont know its apt to be a very baffling time at the best all the men that you like are taken up with their own people and even the men that you dont like overvalue themselves and think theyre doing you a favor if they give you a turn at the gym or bring you a plate of something  well they are arent they  i suppose yes thats what makes me hate it one doesnt like to have such men do one a favor and then juniors get younger every year even a nice junior is only a junior she concluded with a sad fall of her mocking voice  i dont believe theres a senior in harvard that wouldnt forsake his family and come to the rescue if your feelings could be known said jeff he lifted the bottle at his elbow and found it empty and this seemed to remind him to rise  dont make them known please said bessie i shouldnt want an ovation she sat after he had risen as if she wished to detain him but when he came up to take leave she had to put her hand in his she looked at it there and so did he it seemed very little and slim about onethird the size of his palm and it seemed to go to nothing in his grasp i should think she added that the jays would have the best time on class day i should like to dance at one of their spreads and do everything they did it would be twice the fun and there would be some nature in it i should like to see a jay class day  if youll come out ill show you one said jeff without wincing  oh will you she said taking away her hand that would be delightful but what would become of your folks she caught a corner of her mouth with her teeth as if the word had slipped out  do you call them folks asked jeff quietly  isupposeddont you  not in boston i do at lions head  oh wellpeople  i dont know as theyre coming  how delightful i dont mean that but if theyre not and if you really knew some jays and could get me a little glimpse of their class day  i think i could manage it for you he spoke as before but he looked at her with a mockery in his lips and eyes as intelligent as her own and the latent change in his mood gave her the sense of being in the presence of a vivid emotion she rose in her excitement she could see that he admired her and was enjoying her insolence too in a way though in a way that she did not think she quite understood and she had the wish to make him admire her a little more  she let a light of laughter come into her eyes of harmless mischief played to an end i dont deserve your kindness and i wont come ive been very wicked dont you think  not veryfor you said jeff  oh how good she broke out but be frank now ive offended you  how i know im a jay and in the country ive got folks  ah i see youre hurt at my joking and im awfully sorry i wish there was some way of making you forgive me but it couldnt be that alone she went on rather aimlessly as to her words trusting to his answer for some leading and willing meanwhile to prolong the situation for the effect in her nerves it had been a very dull and tedious day and she was finding much more than she could have expected in the mingled fear and slight which he inspired her with in such singular measure these feminine subtleties of motive are beyond any but the finest natures in the other sex and perhaps all that jeff perceived was the note of insincerity in her words  couldnt be what alone he asked  what ive said she ventured letting her eyes fall but they were not eyes that fell effectively and she instantly lifted them again to his  you havent said anything and if youve thought anything what have i got to do with that i think all sorts of things about peopleor folks as you call them  oh thank you now you are forgiving me  i think them about you  oh do sit down and tell me the kind of things you think about me bessie implored sinking back into her chair  you mightnt like them  but if they would do me good  what should i want to do you good for  thats true sighed bessie thoughtfully  peoplefolks  thank you so much  dont try to do each other good unless theyre cranks like lancaster or bores like mrs bevidge  you belong to the analytical school of seniors go on  thats all said jeff  and you dont think ive tried to do you good  he laughed her comedy was delicious to him he had never found anybody so amusing he almost respected her for it  if that is your opinion of me mr durgin she said very gravely i am sorry may i remark that i dont see why you come then  i can tell you said jeff and he advanced upon her where she sat so abruptly that she started and shrank back in her chair i come because youve got brains and youre the only girl that hashere they were alans words almost his words and for an instant she thought of her brother end wondered what he would think of this jays praising her in his terms because jeff went on youve got more sense and nonsensethan all the women here put together because its better than a play to hear you talkand act and because youre gracefuland fascinating and chic andgoodnight miss lynde  he put out his hand but she did not take it as she rose haughtily weve said goodnight once i prefer to say goodbye this time im sure you will understand why after this i cannot see you again she seemed to examine him for the effect of these words upon him before she went on  no i dont understand he answered coolly but it isnt necessary i should and im quite willing to say goodbye if you prefer you havent been so frank with me as i have with you but that doesnt make any difference perhaps you never meant to be or couldnt be if you meant goodbye he bowed and turned toward the door  she fluttered between him and it i wish to know what you accuse me of  i nothing  you imply that i have been unjust toward you  oh no  and i cant let you go till you prove it  prove to a woman thatwill you let me pass  no she spread her slender arms across the doorway  oh very well jeff took her hands and put them both in the hold of one of his large strong bands then with the contact it came to him from a varied experience of girls in his rustic past that this young lady who was nothing but a girl after all was playing her comedy with a certain purpose however little she might know it or own it he put his other large strong hand upon her waist and pulled her to him and kissed her another sort of man no matter what he had believed of her would have felt his act a sacrilege then and there jeff only knew that she had not made the faintest straggle against him she had even trembled toward him and he brutally exulted in the belief that he had done what she wished whether it was what she meant or not  she for her part realized that she had been kissed as once she had happened to see one of the maids kissed by the grocers boy at the basement door in an instant this man had abolished all her defences of family of society of personality and put himself on a level with her in the most sacred things of life her mind grasped the fact and she realized it intellectually while as yet all her emotions seemed paralyzed she did not know whether she resented it as an abominable outrage or not whether she hated the man for it or not but perhaps he was in love with her and his love overpowered him in that case she could forgive him if she were in love with him she asked herself whether she was and whether she had betrayed herself to him so that he was somehow warranted in what he did she wondered if another sort of man would have done it a gentleman who believed she was in love with him she wondered if she were as much shocked as she was astonished she knew that there was everything in the situation to make the fact shocking but she got no distinct reply from her jarred consciousness  it ought to be known and known at once she ought to tell her brother as soon as she saw him she thought of telling her aunt and she fancied having to shout the affair into her ear and having to repeat he kissed me dont you understand kissed me then she reflected with a start that she could never tell any one that in the midst of her world she was alone in relation to this she was as helpless and friendless as the poorest and lowliest girl could be she was more so for if she were like the maid whom the grocers boy kissed she would be of an order of things in which she could advise with some one else who had been kissed and she would know what to feel  she asked herself whether she was at all moved at heart till now it seemed to her that it had not been different with her toward him from what it had been toward all the other men whose meaning she would have liked to find out she had not in the least respected them and she did not respect him but if it happened because he was overcome by his love for her and could not help it then perhaps she must forgive him whether she cared for him or not  these ideas presented themselves with the simultaneity of things in a dream in that instant when she lingered helplessly in his hold and she even wondered if by any chance andrew had seen them but she heard his step on the floor below and at the same time it appeared to her that she must be in love with this man if she did not resent what he had done     xliii  westover was sitting at an open window of his studio smoking out into the evening air and looking down into the thinly foliaged tops of the public garden where the electrics fainted and flushed and hissed cars trooped by in the troubled street scraping the wires overhead that screamed as if with pain at the touch of their trolleys and kindling now and again a soft planet as the trolleys struck the batlike plates that connected the crossing lines the painter was getting almost as much pleasure out of the planets as pain out of the screams and he was in an afterdinner languor in which he was very reluctant to recognize a step which he thought he knew on his stairs and his stairslanding a knock at his door followed the sound of the approaching steps he lifted himself and called out inhospitably come in and as he expected jeff durgin came in westovers meetings with him had been an increasing discomfort since his return from lions head the uneasiness which he commonly felt at the first moment of encounter with him yielded less and less to the influence of jeffs cynical bonhomie and it returned in force as soon as they parted  it was rather dim in the place except for the light thrown up into it from the turmoil of lights outside but he could see that there was nothing of the smiling mockery on jeffs face which habitually expressed his inner hardihood it was a frowning mockery  hello said westover  hello answered jeff any commands for lions head  what do you mean  im going up there tomorrow ive got to see cynthia and tell her what ive been doing  westover waited a moment before he asked do you want me to ask what youve been doing  i shouldnt mind it  the painter paused again i dont know that i care to ask is it any good  no shouted jeff its the worst thing yet i guess youll think i couldnt have believed it myself if i hadnt been through it i shouldnt have supposed i was such a fool i dont care for the girl i never did  cynthia  cynthia no miss lynde oh try to take it in jeff cried with a laugh at the daze in westovers face you must have known about the flirtation if you havent youre the only one his vanity in the fact betrayed itself in his voice it came to a crisis last week and we tried to make each other believe that we were in earnest but there wont be any real love lost  westover did not speak he could not make out whether he was surprised or whether he was shocked and it seemed to him that he was neither surprised nor shocked he wondered whether he had really expected something of the kind sooner or later or whether he was not always so apprehensive of some deviltry in durgin that nothing he did could quite take him unawares at last he said i suppose its trueeven though you say it its probably the only truth in you  thats something like said jeff as if the contempt gave him a sort of pleasure and his heavy face lighted up and then darkened again  well said westover what are we going to do youve come to tell me  im going to break with her i dont care for herthat he snapped his fingers i told her i cared because she provoked me to it happened because she wanted it to and led up to it  ah said westover you put it on her but he waited for durgins justification with a dread that he should find something in it  pshaw whats the use its been a game from the beginning and a question which should ruin i won she meant to throw me over if the time came for her but it came for me first and its only a question now which shall break first weve both been near it once or twice already i dont mean she shall get the start of me  westover had a glimpse of the innate enmity of the sexes in this game of its presence in passion that was lived and of its prevalence in passion that was played but the fate of neither gambler concerned him he was impatient of his interest in what jeff now went on to tell him without scruple concerning her or palliation of himself he scarcely realized that he was listening but afterward he remembered it all with a little pity for bessie and none for jeff but with more shame for her too love seems more sacredly confided to women than to men it is and must be a higher and finer as well as a holier thing with them their blame for its betrayal must always be the heavier he had sometimes suspected bessies willingness to amuse herself with jeff as with any other man who would let her play with him and he would not have relied upon anything in him to defeat her purpose if it had been anything so serious as a purpose  at the end of durgins story he merely asked and what are you going to do about cynthia  i am going to tell her said jeff thats what i am going up there for  westover rose but jeff remained sitting where he had put himself astride of a chair with his face over the back the painter walked slowly up and down before him in the capricious play of the street light he turned a little sick and he stopped a moment at the window for a breath of air  well asked jeff  oh you want my advice westover still felt physically incapable of the indignation which he strongly imagined i dont know what to say to you durgin you transcend my powers are you able to see this whole thing yourself  i guess so jeff answered i dont idealize it though i look at facts theyre bad enough you dont suppose that miss lynde is going to break her heart over  i dont believe i care for miss lynde any more than i care for you but i believe i wish you were not going to break with her  why  because you and she are fit for each other if you want my advice i advise you to be true to herif you can  and cynthia  break with her  oh jeff gave a snort of derision  youre not fit for her you couldnt do a crueler thing for her than to keep faith with her  do you mean it  yes i mean it stick to miss lyndeif shell let you  jeff seemed puzzled by westovers attitude which was either too sincere or too ironical for him he pushed his hat which he had kept on back from his forehead damned if i dont believe she would he mused aloud the notion seemed to flatter him and repay him for what he must have been suffering he smiled but he said she wouldnt do even if she were any good cynthia is worth a million of her if she wants to give me up after she knows all about me well and good i shunt blame her but i shall give her a fair chance and i shunt whitewash myself you neednt be afraid of that mr westover  why should i care what you do asked the painter scornfully  well you cant on my account durgin allowed but you do care on her account  yes i do said westover sitting down again and he did not say anything more  durgin waited a long while for him to speak before he asked then thats really your advice is it  yes break with her  and stick to miss lynde  if shell let you  jeff was silent in his turn he started from his silence with a laugh shed make a daisy landlady for lions head i believe she would like to try it awhile just for the fun but after the ball was overwell it would be a good joke if it was a joke cynthia is a womanshe ant any corpselight she understands me and she dont overrate me either she knew just how much i was worth and she took me at her own valuation ive got my way in life marked out and she believes in it as much as i do if anybody can keep me level and make the best of me she can and shes going to have the chance if she wants to im going to act square with her about the whole thing i guess shes the best judge in a case like this and i shall lay the whole case before her dont you be afraid of that and shes got to have a free field why even if there want any question of her he went on falling more and more into his vernacular i dont believe i should care in the long run for this other one we couldnt make it go for any time at all she wants excitement and after the summer folks began to leave and wed been to florida for a winter and then came back to lions headwell this planet hasnt got excitement enough in it for that girl and i doubt if the solar system has at any rate im not going to act as advanceagent for her  i see said westover that youve been reasoning it all out and im not surprised that youve kept your own advantage steadily in mind i dont suppose you know what a savage you are and i dont suppose i could teach you i shant try at any rate ill take you on your own ground and i tell you again you had better break with cynthia i wont say that its what you owe her for that wont have any effect with you but its what you owe yourself you cant do a wrong thing and prosper on it  oh yes you can jeff interrupted with a sneering laugh how do you suppose all the big fortunes were made by keeping the commandments  no but youre an unlucky man if life hasnt taught you that you must pay in suffering of some kind sooner or later for every wrong thing you do  now thats one of your oldfashioned superstitions mr westover said jeff with a growing kindliness in his tone as if the pathetic delusion of such a man really touched him you pay or you dont pay just as it happens if you get hit soon after youve done wrong you think its retribution and if it holds off till youve forgotten all about it you think its a strange providence and you puzzle over it but you dont reform you keep right along in the old way prosperity and adversity theyve got nothing to do with conduct if youre a strong man you get there and if youre a weak man all the righteousness in the universe wont help you but i propose to do whats right about cynthia and not whats wrong and according to your own theory of lifewhich wont hold water a minutei ought to be blessed to the third and fourth generation i dont look for that though i shall be blessed if i look out for myself and if i dont i shall suffer for my want of foresight but i shant suffer for anything else well im going to cut some of my recitations and im going up to lions head tomorrow to settle my business with cynthia ive got a little business to look after here with some one else first and i guess i shall have to be about it i dont know which i shall like the best he rose and went over to where westover was sitting and held out his hand to him  what is it asked westover  any commands for lions head jeff said as at first  no said westover turning his face away  oh all right durgin put his hand into his pocket unshaken     xliv  what is it jeff asked cynthia the next night as they started out together after supper and began to stroll down the hill toward her fathers house it lay looking very little and low in the nook at the foot of the lane on the verge of the woods that darkened away to the northward from it under the glassy night sky lit with the spare young moon the peeping of the frogs in the marshy places filled the air the hoarse voice of the brook made itself heard at intervals through them  its not so warm here quite as it is in boston he returned are you wrapped up enough this air has an edge to it  im all right said the girl what is it  you think theres something you dont believe ive come up for rest over sunday i guess mother herself didnt and i could see your father following up my little lies as if he want going to let one escape him well youre right there is something think of the worst thing you can cynthy  she pulled her hand out of his arm which she had taken and halted him by her abrupt pause youre not going to get through  im all right on my conditions said jeff with forlorn derision youll have to guess again he stood looking back over his shoulder at her face which showed white in the moonlight swathed airily round in the oldfashioned soft woollen cloud she wore  is it some trouble youve got into i shall stand by you  oh you splendid girl the troubles over but its something you cant stand by me in i guess you know that girl i wrote to you aboutthe one i met at the college tea and  yes miss lynde  come on we cant stay here talking lets go down and sit on your porch she mechanically obeyed him and they started on together down the hill again but she did not offer to take his arm and he kept the width of the roadway from her  what about her she quietly asked  last night i ended up the flirtation ive been carrying on with her ever since  i want to know just what you mean jeff  i mean that last week i got engaged to her and last night i broke with her cynthia seemed to stumble on something he sprang over and caught her and now she put her hand in his arm and stayed herself by him as they walked  go on she said  thats all there is of it  no she stopped and then she asked with a kind of gentle bewilderment what did you want to tell me for  to let you break with meif you wanted to  dont you care for me any more  yes more than ever i did but im not fit for you cynthia mr westover said i wasnt i told him about it  what did he say  that i ought to break with you  but if you broke with her  he told me to stick to her he was right about you cynthy im not fit for you and thats a fact  what was it about that girl tell me everything she spoke in a tone of plaintive entreaty very unlike the command she once used with jeff when she was urging him to be frank with her and true to himself they had come to her fathers house and she freed her hand from his arm again and sat down on the step before the side door with a little sigh as of fatigue  youll take cold said jeff who remained on foot in front of her  no she said briefly go on  why jeff began harshly and with a note of scorn for himself and his theme in his voice there isnt any more of it but theres no end to her i promised mr westover i shouldnt whitewash myself and i shant ive been behaving badly and its no excuse for me because she wanted me to i began to go for her as soon as i saw that she wanted me to and that she liked the excitement the excitement is all that she cared for she didnt care for me except for the excitement of it she thought she could have fun with me and then throw me over but i guess she found her match you couldnt understand such a girl and i dont brag of it all she cared for was to flirt with me and she liked it all the more because i was a jay and she could get something new out of it i cant explain it but i could see it right along she fooled herself more than she fooled me  was shevery goodlooking cynthia asked listlessly  no shouted jeff she wasnt goodlooking at all she was dark and thin and she had little slanting eyes but she was graceful and she knew how to make herself go further than any girl i ever saw if she came into a room she made you look at her or you had to somehow she was bright too and she had more sense than all the other girls there put together but she was a fool all the same jeff paused is that enough  it isnt all  no it isnt all we didnt meet much at first but i got to walking home with her from some teas and then we met at a big ball i danced with her the whole while nearly andand i took her brother homepshaw he was drunk and iwell he had got drunk drinking with me at the ball the wine didnt touch me but it turned his head and i took him home hes a drunkard anyway she let us in when we got to their house and that kind of made a tie between us she pretended to think she was under obligations to me and so i got to going to her house  did she know how her brother got drunk  she does now i told her last night  how came you to tell her  i wanted to break with her i wanted to stop it once for all and i thought that would do it if anything would  did that make her willing to give you up  jeff checked himself in a sort of retrospective laugh im not so sure i guess she liked the excitement of that too you couldnt understand the kind of girl sheshe wanted to flirt with me that night i brought him home tipsy  i dont care to hear any more about her why did you give her up  because i didnt care for her and i did care for you cynthy  i dont believe it cynthia rose from the step where she had been sitting as if with renewed strength go up and tell father to come down here i want to see him she turned and put her hand on the latch of the door  youre not going in there cynthia said jeff it must be like death in there  its more like death out here but if its the cold you mean you neednt be troubled weve had a fire today airing out the house will you go  but what do youwhat are you going to say to me  i dont know yet if i said anything now i should tell you what mr westover did go back to that girl if shell let you youre fit for each other as he said did you tell her that you were engaged to some one else  i did last night  but before that she didnt know how false you were well youre not fit for her then youre not good enough  she opened the door and went in closing it after her jeff turned and walked slowly away then he came quickly back as if he were going to follow her within but through the window he saw her as she stood by the table with a lamp in her hand she had turned up the light which shone full in her face and revealed its severe beauty broken and writhen with the effort to repress her weeping he might not have minded the severity or the beauty but the pathos was more than he could stand oh lord he said with a shrug and he turned again and walked slowly up the hill  when whitwell faced his daughter in the little sittingroom whose low ceiling his hat almost touched as he stood before her the storm had passed with her and her teardrenched visage wore its wonted look of still patience  did jeff tell you why i sent for you father  no but i knew it was trouble said whitwell with a dignity whichhis sympathy for her gave a countenance better adapted to the expression of the lighter emotions  i guess you were right about him she resumed she went on to tell in brief the story that jeff had told her her father did not interrupt her but at the end he said inadequately hes a comical devil i knew about his gittin that feller drunk mr westover told me when he was up here  mr westover did said cynthia in a note of indignation  he didnt offer to whitwell explained i got it out of him in spite of him i guess he had sat down with his hat on as his absentminded habit was and he now braced his knees against the edge of the table cynthia sat across it from him with her head drooped over it drawing vague figures on the board with her finger what are you goin to do  i dont know she answered  i guess you dont quite realize it yet her father suggested tenderly well i dont want to hurry you any take your time  i guess i realize it said the girl  well its a pootty plain case thats a fact whitwell conceded she was silent and he asked how did he come to tell you  its what he came up for he began to tell me at once i was certain there was some trouble  was it his notion to come i wonder or mr westovers  it was his but mr westover told him to break off with me and keep on with her if she would let him  i guess that was pootty good advice said whitwell letting his face betray his humorous relish of it i guess theres a pair of em  she was not playing any one else false said cynthia bitterly  well i guess thats so too her father assented tant so much of a muchness as you might think in that light he took refuge from the subject in an undirected whistle  after a moment the girl asked forlornly what should you do father if you were in my place  well there i guess you got me cynthy said her father i dont believe t any man i dont care how old he is or how much experience hes had knows exactly how a girl feels about a thing like this or has got any call to advise her of course the way i feel is like takin the top of his head off but i d know he added as that would do a great deal of good either i presume a womans got rather of a chore to get along with a man anyway we ant any of us much to brag on its out o sight out o mind with the best of us i guess  it wouldnt be with jacksonit wouldnt be with mr westover  there ant many men like mr westoverwell not a great many or jackson either time i wish jackson was home hed know how to straighten this thing out and he wouldnt weaken over jeff muchwell not much but he ant here and youve got to act for yourself the way i look at it is this you took jeff when you knowed what a comical devil he was and i presume you hant got quite the same right to be disappointed in what he done as if you hadnt knowed now mind i ant excusin him but if you knowed he was the feller to play the devil if he got a chance the question is whetherwhether  i know what you mean father said the girl and i dont want to shirk my responsibility it was everything to have him come right up and tell me  well said whitwell impartially as far forth as that goes i dont think hes strained himself hed know you would hear of it sooner or later anyway and he hant just found out that he was goin wrong been keepin it up for the last three months and writin you all the while them letters you was so crazy to get  yes sighed the girl but weve got to be just to his disposition as well as his actions i can see it in one light that can excuse it some he cant bear to be put down and i know hes been left out a good deal among the students and its made him bitter he told me about it thats one reason why he wanted to leave harvard this last year he saw other young men made much of when he didnt get any notice and when he had the chance to pay them back with a girl of their own set that was trying to make a fool of him  that was the time for him to remember you said whitwell  cynthia broke under the defence she was trying to make yes she said with an indrawn sigh and she began to sob piteously  the sight of her grief seemed to kindle her fathers wrath to a flame any way you look at him hes been a dumn blackguard thats what hes been youre a million times too good for him and i  she sobbed herself quiet and then she said father i dont like to go up there tonight i want to stay here  all right cynthia ill come down and stay with you you got everything we want here  yes and ill go up and get the breakfast for them in the morning there wont be much to do  dumn em let em get their own breakfast said whitwell recklessly  and father the girl went on as if he had not spoken dont you talk to mrs durgin about it will you  no no i shant speak to her ill just tell frank you and me are goin to stay down here tonight shell suspicion something but she can figure it out for herself or she can make jeff tell her it cant be kept from her  well let him be the one to tell her whatever happens i shall never speak of it to a soul besides you  all right cynthy youll have the night to think it overi guess you wont sleep muchand ill trust you to do whats the best thing about it     xlv  cynthia found mrs durgin in the old farmhouse kitchen at work getting breakfast when she came up to the hotel in the morning she was early but the elder woman had been earlier still and her heavy face showed more of their common nightlong trouble than the girls  she demanded at sight of her whats the matter with you and jeff cynthy  cynthia was unrolling the cloud from her hair she said as she tied on her apron you must get him to tell you mrs durgin  then there is something  yes  has jeff been using you wrong  cynthia stooped to open the oven door and to turn the pan of biscuit she found inside she shut the door sharply to and said as she rose i dont want to tell anything about it and i shant mrs durgin he can do it if he wants to shall i make the coffee  yes you seem to make it better than i do do you think i shouldnt believe you was fair to him  i wasnt thinking of that but its his secret if he wants to keep it he can keep it for all me  you hant give each other up  i dont know cynthia turned away with a trembling chin and began to beat the coffee up with an egg she had dropped into the pot she put the breakfast on the table when it was ready but she would not sit down with the rest she said she did not want any breakfast and she drank a cup of coffee in the kitchen  it fell to jeff mainly to keep the talk going he had been out at the barn with jombateeste since daybreak looking after the cattle and the joy of the weather had got into his nerves and spirits at first he had lain awake after he went to bed but he had fallen asleep about midnight and got a good nights rest he looked fresh and strong and very handsome he talked resolutely to every one at the table but jombateeste was always preoccupied with eating at his meals and frank whitwell had on a sunday silence which was perhaps deepened by a feeling that there was something wrong between his sister and jeff and it would be rash to commit himself to an open friendliness until he understood the case his father met jeffs advances with philosophical blandness and evasion and mrs durgin was provisionally dry and severe both with the whitwells and her son after breakfast she went to the parlor and jeff set about a tour of the hotel inside and out he looked carefully to the details of its winter keeping then he came back and boldly joined his mother where she sat before her stove whose subdued heat she found pleasant in the lingering cold of the early spring  he tossed his hat on the table beside her and sat down on the other side of the stove well i must say the place has been well looked after i dont believe jackson himself could have kept it in better shape when was the last you heard from him  i hope said his mother gravely youve been lookin after your end at boston too  well not as well as you have here mother said jeff candidly has cynthy told you  i guess she expected you to tell me if there was anything  theres a lot but i guess i neednt go over it all ive been playing the devil  jeff  yes i have ive been going with another girl down there one the kind you wanted me to make up to and i went so far iwell i made love to her and then i thought it over and found out i didnt really care for her and i had to tell her so and then i came up to tell cynthy thats about the size of it what do you think of it  d you tell cynthy  yes i told her  what d she say  she said id better go back to the other girl jeff laughed hardily but his mother remained impassive  i guess shes right i guess you had  that seems to be the general opinion thats what mr westover advised i seem to be the only one against it i suppose you mean that im not fit for cynthy i dont deny it all i say is i want her and i dont want the other one what are you going to do in a case like that  the way i should look at it said his mother is this whatever you are cynthy made you you was a lazy disobedient worthless boy and it was her carin for you from the first that put any spirit and any principle into you it was her that helped you at school when you was little things together and she helped you at the academy and shes helped you at college ill bet she could take a degree or whatever it is at harvard better than you could now and if you ever do take a degree youve got her to thank for it  thats so said jeff and whats the reason you didnt want me to marry her when i came in here last summer and told you id asked her to  you know well enough what the reason was it was part of the same thing as my wantin you to be a lawyer but i might knowed that if you didnt have cynthy to go into court with you and put the words into your mouth you wouldnt make a speech that wouldmrs durgin paused for a fitting figuresave a flea from the gallows  jeff burst into a laugh well i guess thats so mother and now you want me to throw away the only chance ive got of learning how to run lions head in the right way by breaking with cynthy  nobody wants you to run lions head for a while yet his mother returned scornfully jackson is going to run lions head hell be home the end of june and ill run lions head till he gets here you talk she went on as if it was in your hands to break with cynthy or throw away the chance with her the way i look at it shes broke with you and you hant got any chance with her oh jeff she suddenly appealed to him tell me all about it what have you been up to if i understood it once i know i can make her see it in the right light  the better you understand it mother the less youll like it and i guess cynthy sees it in the right light already what did she say  nothing she said shed leave it to you  well thats like cynthy ill tell you then said jeff and he told his mother his whole affair with bessie lynde he had to be very elemental and he was aware as he had never been before of the difference between bessies world and his mothers world in trying to make bessies world conceivable to her  he was patient in going over every obscure point and illustrating from the characters and condition of different summer folks the facts of bessies entourage it is doubtful however if he succeeded in conveying to his mother a clear and just notion of the purely chic nature of the girl in the end she seemed to conceive of her simply as a hussy and so pronounced her without limit or qualification in spite of jeffs laughing attempt to palliate her behavior and to inculpate himself she said she did not see what he had done that was so much out of the way that thing had led him on from the beginning she had merely got her comeuppings when all was said mrs durgin believed cynthia would look at it as she did if she could have it put before her rightly jeff shook his head with persistent misgiving his notion was that cynthia saw the affair only too clearly and that there was no new light to be thrown on it from her point of view mrs durgin would not allow this she was sure that she could bring cynthia round and she asked jeff whether it was his getting that fellow drunk that she seemed to blame him for the most he answered that he thought that was pretty bad but he did not believe that was the worst thing in cynthias eyes he did not forbid his mothers trying to do what she could with her and he went away for a walk and left the house to the two women jombateeste was in the barn which he preferred to the house and frank whitwell had gone to church over at the huddle as jeff passed whitwells cottage in setting out on his stroll he saw the philosopher through the window seated with his legs on the table his hat pushed back and his spectacles fallen to the point of his nose reading and moving his lips as he read  the forenoon sun was soft but the air was cool  there was still plenty of snow on the upper slopes of the hills and there was a drift here and there in a corner of pasture wall in the valley but the springtime green was beginning to hover over the wet places in the fields the catkins silvered the golden tracery of the willow branches by the brook there was a buzz of bees about them and about the maples blackened by the earlier flow of sap through the holes in the bark made by the woodpeckers bills now and then the tremolo of a bluebird shook in the tender light and the keen air at one point in the road where the sun fell upon some young pines in a sheltered spot a balsamic odor exhaled from them  these gentle sights and sounds and odors blended in the influence which jeffs spirit felt more and more he realized that he was a blot on the loveliness of the morning he had a longing to make atonement and to win forgiveness his heart was humbled toward cynthia and he went wondering how his mother would make it out with her and how if she won him any advantage he should avail himself of it and regain the girls trust he had no doubt of her love he perceived that there was nothing for him hereafter but the most perfect constancy of thought and deed and he desired nothing better  at a turn of his road where it branched toward the huddle a group of young girls stood joking and laughing before jeff came up with them they separated and all but one continued on the way beyond the turning she came toward jeff who gayly recognized her as she drew near  she blushed and bridled at his bow and at his beauty and splendor and in her embarrassment pertly said that she did not suppose he would have remembered her she was very young but at fifteen a country girl is not so young as her town sister at eighteen in the ways of the other sex  jeff answered that he should have known her anywhere in spite of her looking so much older than she did in the summer when she had come with berries to the hotel he said she must be feeling herself quite a young lady now in her long dresses and he praised the dress which she had on he said it became her style and he found such relief from his heavy thoughts in these harmless pleasantries that he kept on with them he had involuntarily turned with her to walk back to her house on the way he had come and he asked her if he might not carry her catkins for her she had a sheaf of them in the hollow of her slender arm which seemed to him very pretty and after a little struggle she yielded them to him the struggle gave him still greater relief from his selfreproach and at her gate he begged her to let him keep one switch of the pussywillows and he stood a moment wondering whether he might not ask her for something else she chose one from the bundle and drew it lightly across his face before she put it in his hand you may have this for cynthy she said and she ran laughingly up the pathway to her door     xlvi  cynthia did not appear at dinner and jeff asked his mother when he saw her alone if she had spoken to the girl yes but she said she did not want to talk yet  all right he returned im going to take a nap i believe i feel as if i hadnt slept for a month  he slept the greater part of the afternoon and came down rather dull to the early tea cynthia was absent again and his mother was silent and wore a troubled look whitwell was full of a novel conception of the agency of hypnotism in interpreting the life of the soul as it is intimated in dreams he had been reading a book that affirmed the consubstantiality of the sleepdream and the hypnotic illusion he wanted to know if jeff down at boston had seen anything of the hypnotic doings that would throw light on this theory  it was still full light when they rose from the table and it was scarcely twilight when jeff heard cynthia letting herself out at the back door he fancied her going down to her fathers house and he went out to the corner of the hotel to meet her she faltered a moment at sight of him and then kept on with averted face  he joined her and walked beside her well cynthy what are you going to say to me im off for cambridge again tomorrow morning and i suppose weve got to understand each other i came up here to put myself in your hands to keep or to throw away just as you please well have you thought about it  every minute said the girl quietly  well  if you had cared for me it couldnt have happened  oh yes it could now thats just where youre mistaken thats where a woman never can understand a man i might carry on with half a dozen girls and yet never forget you or think less of you although i could see all the time how pretty and bright every one of em was thats the way a mans mind is built its curious but its true  i dont believe i care for any share in your mind then said the girl  oh come now you dont mean that you know i was just joking you know i dont justify what ive done and i dont excuse it but i think ive acted pretty square with you about itabout telling you i mean i dont want to lay any claim but you remember when you made me promise that if there was anything shady i wanted to hide from youwell i acted on that you do remember  yes said cynthia and she pulled the cloud over the side of her face next to him and walked a little faster  he hastened his steps to keep up with her cynthy if you put your arms round me as you did then  i cant jeff  you dont want to  yes i do but you dont want me to as you did then do you she stopped abruptly and faced him full tell me honestly  jeff dropped his bold eyes and the smile left his handsome mouth  you dont said the girl for you know that if you did i would do it she began to walk on again it wouldnt be hard for me to forgive you anything youve done against meor against yourself i should care for you the sameif you were the same person but youre not the same and you know it i told you thenthat time that i didnt want to make you do what you knew was right and i never shall try to do it again im sorry i did it then i was wrong and i should be afraid of you if i did now some time you would make me suffer for it just as youve made me suffer for making you do then what was right  it struck jeff as a very curious fact that cynthia must always have known him better than he knew himself in some ways for he now perceived the truth and accuracy of her words he gave her mind credit for the penetration due her heart he did not understand that it is through their love women divine the souls of men what other witnesses of his character had slowly and carefully reasoned out from their experience of him she had known from the beginning because he was dear to her  he was silent and then with rare gravity he said cynthia i believe youre right and he never knew how her heart leaped toward him at his words im a pretty bad chap i guess but i want you to give me another chance and ill try not to make you pay for it either he added with a flicker of his saucy humor  ill give you a chance then she said and she shrank from the hand he put out toward her go back and tell that girl youre free now and if she wants you she can have you  is that what you call a chance demanded jeff between anger and injury for an instant he imagined her deriding him and revenging herself  its the only one i can give you shes never tried to make you do what was right and youll never be tempted to hurt her  youre pretty rough on me cynthy jeff protested almost plaintively he asked more in character aint you afraid of making me do right now  im not making you i dont promise you anything even if she wont have you  oh  did you suppose i didnt mean that you were free that i would put a lie in your mouth for you to be true with  i guess youre too deep for me said jeff after a sulky silence  then its all off between us what do you say  what do you say  i say its just as it was before if you care for me  i care for you but it can never be the same as it was before what youve done youve done i wish i could help it but i cant i cant make myself over into what i was twentyfour hours ago i seem another person in another world its as if i died and came to life somewhere else im sorry enough if that could help but it cant go and tell that girl the truth that you came up here to me and i sent you back to her  a gleam of amusement visited jeff in the gloom where he seemed to be darkling he fancied doing that very thing with bessie lynde and the wild joy she would snatch from an experience so unique so impossible then the gleam faded and what if i didnt want her he demanded  tell her that too said cynthia  i suppose said jeff sulkily youll let me go away and do as i please if im free  oh yes i dont want you to do anything because i told you i wont make that mistake again go and do what you are able to do of your own free will you know what you ought to do as well as i do and you know a great deal better what you can do  they had reached cynthias house and they were talking at the side door as they had the night before when there had been hope for her in the newness of her calamity before she had yet fully imagined it  jeff made no answer to her last words he asked am i going to see you again  i guess not i dont believe i shall be up before you start  all right goodbye then he held out his hand and she put hers in it for the moment he chose to hold it then he turned and slowly climbed the hill  cynthia was still lying with her face in her pillow when her father came into the dark little house and peered into her room with the newly lighted lamp in his hand she turned her face quickly over and looked at him with dry and shining eyes  well its all over with jeff and me father  well im satisfied said whitwell if you could ha made it up so you could ha felt right about it i shouldnt ha had anything to say against it but im glad its turned out the way it has hes a comical devil and he always was and im glad you ant takin on about him any more you used to have so much spirit when you was little  ohspirit you dont know how much spirit ive had now  well i presume not whitwell assented  ive been thinking said the girl after a little pause that we shall have to go away from here  well i guess not her father began not for no jeff dur  yes yes we must dont make one talk about it well stay here till jackson gets back in june and thenwe must go somewhere else well go down to boston and ill try to get a place to teach or something and frank can get a place  i presume whitwell mused that mr westover could  father cried the girl with an energy that startled him as she lifted herself on her elbow dont ever think of troubling mr westover oh she lamented i was thinking of troubling him myself but we mustnt we mustnt i should be so ashamed  well said whitwell time enough to think about all that we got two good months yet to plan it out before jackson gets back and i guess we can think of something before that i presume he added thoughtfully that when mrs durgin hears that youve give jeff the sack shell make considable of a kick she done it when you got engaged     xlvii  after he went back to cambridge jeff continued mechanically in the direction given him by motives which had ceased for him in the midst of his divergence with bessie lynde he had still kept an inner fealty to cynthia and tried to fulfil the purposes and ambition she had for him the operation of this habitual allegiance now kept him up to his work but the time must come when it could no longer operate when his whole consciousness should accept the fact known to his intelligence and he should recognize the close of that incident of his life as the bereaved finally accept and recognize the fact of death  the event brought him relief and it brought him freedom he was sensible in his relaxation of having strained up to anothers ideal of having been hampered by anothers will his pleasure in the relief was tempered by a regret not wholly unpleasant for the girl whose aims since they were no longer his must be disappointed he was sorry for cynthia and in his remorse he was fonder of her than he had ever been he felt her magnanimity and clemency he began to question in that wordless deep of being where volition begins whether it would not be paying a kind of duty to her if he took her at her word and tried to go back to bessie lynde but for the present he did nothing but renounce all notion of working at his conditions or attempting to take a degree that was part of a thing that was past and was no part of anything to come so far as jeff now forecast his future  he did not choose to report himself to westover and risk a scolding or a snubbing he easily forgave westover for the tone he had taken at their last meeting but he did not care to see him he would have met him halfway however in a friendly advance and he was aware of much goodwill toward him which he could not have been reluctant to show if chance had brought them together  jeff missed cynthias letters which used to come so regularly every tuesday and he had a halfhour every sunday which was at first rather painfully vacant since he no longer wrote to her but in this vacancy he had at least no longer the pang of selfreproach which her letters always brought him and he was not obliged to put himself to the shame of concealment in writing to her he had never minded that tacit lying on his own account but he hated it in relation to her it always hurt him as something incongruous and unfit he wrote to his mother now on sunday and in his first letter while the impression of cynthias dignity and generosity was still vivid he urged her to make it clear to the girl that he wished her and her family to remain at lions head as if nothing had happened he put a great deal of real feeling into this request and he offered to go and spend a year in europe if his mother thought that cynthia would be more reconciled to his coming back at the end of that time  his mother answered with a dryness to which his ear supplied the tones of her voice that she would try to get along in the management of lions head till his brother got back but that she had no objection to his going to europe for a year if he had the money to spare jeff could not refuse her joke as he felt it a certain applause but he thought it pretty rough that his mother should take part so decidedly against him as she seemed to be doing he had expected her to be angry with him but before they parted she had seemed to find some excuse for him and yet here she was siding against her own son in what he might very well consider an unnatural way if jackson had been at home he would have laid it to his charge but he knew that cynthia would have scorned even to speak of him with his mother and he knew too well his mothers slight for whitwell to suppose that he could have influenced her his mind turned in momentary suspicion to westover had westover he wondered with a purpose to pay him up for it forming itself simultaneously with his question been setting his mother against him she might have written to westover to get at the true inwardness of his behavior and westover might have written her something that had made her harden her heart against him but upon reflection this seemed out of character for both of them and jeff was thrown back upon his mothers sober second thought of his misconduct for an explanation of her coldness he could not deny that he had grievously disappointed her in several ways but he did not see why he should not take a certain hint from her letter or construct a hint from it at one with a vague intent prompted by his own restless and curious vanity since he had parted with bessie lynde on terms of humiliation for her which must have been anguish for him if he had ever loved her or loved anything but his power over her he had remained in absolute ignorance of her he had not heard where she was or how she was but now as the few weeks before class day and commencement crumbled away he began to wonder why she made no sign he believed that since she had been willing to go so far to get him she would not be willing to give him up so easily the thought of cynthia had always intruded more or less effectively between them but now that this thought began to fade into the past the thought of bessie began to grow out of it with no interposing shadow  however jeff was in no hurry it was not passion that moved him and the mood in which he could play with the notion of getting back to his flirtation with bessie lynde was pleasanter after the violence of recent events than any renewal of strong sensations could be he preferred to loiter in this mood and he was meantime much more comfortable than he had been for a great while he was rid of the disagreeable sense of disloyalty to cynthia and he was rid of the stress of living up to her conscience in various ways he was rid of bessie lynde too and of the trouble of forecasting and discounting her caprices his thought turned at times with a soft regret to hopes disappointments experiences connected with neither and now tinged with a tender melancholy unalloyed by shame or remorse as he drew nearer to class day he had a somewhat keener compunction for cynthia and the hopes he had encouraged her to build and had then dashed but he was coming more and more to regard it all as fatality and if the chance that he counted upon to bring him and bessie together again had occurred he could have more easily forgiven himself  one of the jays who was spreading on rather a large scale wanted jeff to spread with him but he refused because as he said he meant to keep out of it altogether and for the same reason he declined to take part in the spread of a rather jay society he belonged to in his secret heart he trusted that some friendly fortuity might throw an invitation to beck hall in his way or at least a card for the gym which if no longer the place it had been was still by no means jay he got neither but as he felt all the joy of the june day in his young blood he consoled himself very well with the dancing at one of the halls where the company happened that year to be openly almost recklessly jay jeff had some distinction among the fellows who enviously knew of his social success during the winter and especially of his affair with bessie lynde and there were some girls very pretty and very well dressed among the crowd of girls who were neither they were from remote parts of the country and in the charge of chaperons ignorant of the differences so poignant to local society jeff went about among them and danced with the sisters and cousins of several men who seemed superior to the lost condition of their kinswomen these were nice fellows enough but doomed by their grinding or digging or their want of worldly wisdom to a place among the jays when they really had some qualifications for a nobler standing he had a very good time and he was enjoying himself in his devotion to a lively young brunette whom he was making laugh with his jokes about some of the others when his eye was caught by a group of ladies who advanced among the jays with something of that collective intrepidity and individual apprehension characteristic of people in slumming they had the air of not knowing what might happen to them but the adventurous young boston matron in charge of the girls kept on a bold front behind her lorgnette and swept the strange company she found herself in with an unshrinking eye as she led her band among the promenaders and past the couples seated along the walls she hesitated a moment as her glance fell upon jeff and then she yielded at whatever risk to the comfort of finding a known face among so many aliens why mr durgin she called out bessie heres mr durgin and she turned to the girl who was in her train as jeff had perceived by something finer than the senses from the first  he rose from the side of his brunette whose brother was standing near and shook hands with the adventurous young matron who seemed suddenly much better acquainted with him than he had ever thought her and with bessie lynde the others were new york girls and the matron presented him are you going on she asked and the vague challenge with the smile that accompanied it was sufficient invitation for him  why i believe so he said and he turned to take leave of his pretty brunette but she had promptly vanished with her brother and he was spared the trouble of getting rid of her he would have been equal to much more for the sake of finding himself with bessie lynde again whose excitement he could see burning in her eyes though her thick complexion grew neither brighter nor paler he did not know what quality of excitement it might be but he said audaciously its a good while since we met and he was sensible that his audacity availed  is it she asked he put himself at her side and he did not leave her again till he went to dress for the struggle around the tree he found himself easily included in the adventurous young matrons party he had not the elegance of some of the taller and slenderer men in the scholars gown but the cap became his handsome face his affair with bessie lynde had given him a certain note and an adventurous young matron who was naturally a little indiscriminate might very well have been willing to let him go about with her party she could not know how impudent his mere presence was with reference to bessie and the girl herself made no sign that could have enlightened her she accepted something more that her share of his general usefulness to the party she danced with him whenever he asked her and she seemed not to scruple to publish her affair with him in the openest manner if he could have stilled a certain shame for her which he felt he would have thought he was having the best kind of time they made no account of bygones in their talk but she had never been so brilliant or prompted him to so many of the effronteries which were the spirit of his humor he thought her awfully nice with lots of sense he liked her letting him come back without any fooling or fuss and he began to admire instead of despising her for it decidedly it was as she would have said the chicquest sort of thing what was the use anyway he made up his mind  when he said he must go and dress for the tree he took leave of her first and he was aware of a vivid emotion which was like regret in her at parting with him she said must he she seemed to want to say something more to him while he was dismissing himself from the others he noticed that once or twice she opened her lips as if she were going to speak in the end she did nothing more important than to ask if he had seen her brother but after he had left the party he turned and saw her following him with eyes that he fancied anxious and even frightened in their gaze  the riot round the tree roared itself through its wonted events class after class of the undergraduates filed in and sank upon the grass below the terraces and parterres of brilliantly dressed ladies within the quadrangle of seats the alumni pushed themselves together against the wall of holder chapel the men of the senior class came last in their grotesque variety of sweaters and second and third best clothes for the scramble at the tree the regulation cheers tore from throats that grew hoarser and hoarser till every class and every favorite in the faculty had been cheered then the signalhat was flung into the air and the rush at the tree was made and the combat for the flowers that garlanded its burly waist began  jeffs size and shape forbade him to try for the flowers from the shoulders of others he was one of a group of jays who set their backs to the tree and fought away all comers except their own they pulled down every man not of their sort and put up a jay who stripped the tree of its flowers and flung them to his fellows below as he was let drop to the ground jeff snatched a handful of his spoil from him and made off with it toward the place where he had seen bessie lynde and her party but when he reached the place shouldering and elbowing his way through the press she was no longer there he saw her hat at a distance through the crowd where he did not choose to follow and he stuffed the flowers into his breast to give to her later he expected to meet her somewhere in the evening if not he would try to find her at her aunts house in town failing that he could send her the flowers and trust her for some sort of leading acknowledgment  he went and had a bath and dressed himself freshly and then he went for a walk in the still evening air he was very hot from the battle which had been fought over him and which he had shared with all his strength and it seemed to him as if he could not get cool he strolled far out along concord avenue beyond the expanses and icehorses of fresh pond into the country toward belmont with his hat off and his head down he was very well satisfied and he was smiling to himself at the ease of his return to bessie and securely speculating upon the outcome of their renewed understanding  he heard a vehicle behind him rapidly driven and he turned out for it without looking around then suddenly he felt a fiery sting on his forehead and then a shower of stings swiftly following each other over his head and face he remembered stumbling when he was a boy into a nest of yellowjackets that swarmed up around him and pierced him like sparks of fire at every uncovered point but he knew at the same time that it was some one in the vehicle beside him who was lashing him over the head with a whip he bowed his head with his eyes shut and lunged blindly out toward his assailant hoping to seize him  but the horse sprang aside and tore past him down the road jeff opened his eyes and through the blood that dripped from the cuts above them he saw the wicked face of alan lynde looking back at him from the dogcart where he sat with his man beside him he brandished his broken whip in the air and flung it into the bushes jeff walked on and picked it up before he turned aside to the pools of the marsh stretching on either hand and tried to stanch his hurts and get himself into shape for returning to town and stealing back to his lodging he had to wait till after dark and watch his chance to get into the house unnoticed     xlviii  the chum to whom jeff confided the story of his encounter with a man he left nameless inwardly thanked fortune that he was not that man for he knew him destined sooner or later to make such reparation for the injuries he had inflicted as jeff chose to exact he tended him carefully and respected the reticence jeff guarded concerning the whole matter even with the young doctor whom his friend called and who kept to himself his impressions of the nature of jeffs injuries  jeff lay in his darkened room and burned with them and with the thoughts guesses purposes which flamed through his mind had she that girl known what her brother meant to do had she wished him to think of her in the moment of his punishment and had she spoken of her brother so that he might recall her or had she had some ineffective impulse to warn him against her brother when she spoke of him  he lay and raged in vain with his conjectures and he did a thousand imagined murders upon lynde in revenge of his shame  toward the end of the week while his hurts were still too evident to allow him to go outofdoors before dark he had a note from westover asking him to come in at once to see him  your brother jackson westover wrote reached boston by the new york train this morning and is with me here i must tell you i think he is not at all well but he does not know how sick he is and so i forewarn you he wants to get on home but i do not feel easy about letting him make the rest of the journey alone some one ought to go with him i write not knowing whether you are still in cambridge or not or whether if you are you can get away at this time but i think you ought and i wish at any rate that you would come in at once and see jackson then we can settle what had best be done  jeff wrote back that he had been suffering with a severe attack of erysipelashe decided upon erysipelas for the time being but he meant to let westover know later that he had been in a rowand the doctor would not let him go out yet he promised to come in as soon as he possibly could if westover thought jackson ought to be got home at once and was not fit to travel alone he asked him to send a hospital nurse with him  westover replied by jeffs messenger that it would worry and alarm jackson to be put in charge of a nurse but that he would go home with him and they would start the next day he urged jeff to come and see his brother if it was at all safe for him to do so but if he could not westover would give his mother a reassuring reason for his failure  mrs durgin did not waste any anxiety for the sickness which prevented jeff from coming home with his brother she said ironically that it must be very bad and she gave all her thought and care to jackson the sick man rallied as he prophesied he should in his native air and celebrated the sense and science of the last doctor he had seen in europe who told him that he had made a great gain but he had better hurry home as fast as he could for he had got all the advantage he could expect to have from his stay abroad and now home air was the best thing for him  it could not be known how much of this he believed he had at any rate the pathetic hopefulness of his malady but his mother believed it all and she nursed him with a faith in his recovery which whitwell confided to westover was about as much as he wanted to see for one while she seemed to grow younger in the care of him and to get back to herself more and more from the facts of jeffs behavior which had aged and broken her she had to tell jackson about it all but he took it with that indifference to the things of this world which the approach of death sometimes brings and in the light of his passivity it no longer seemed to her so very bad it was a relief to have jackson say well perhaps it was for the best and it was a comfort to see how he and cynthia took to each other it was almost as if that dreadful trouble had not been she told jackson what hard work she had had to make cynthia stay with her and how the girl had consented to stay only until jeff came home but she guessed now that jackson had got back he could make cynthia see it all in another light and perhaps it would all come right again she consulted him about jeffs plan of going abroad and jackson said it might be about as well he should soon be around and he thought if jeff went it would give cynthia more of a chance to get reconciled after all his mother suggested a good many fellows behaved worse than jeff had done and still had made it up with the girls they were engaged to and jackson gently assented  he did not talk with cynthia about jeff out of that delicacy or that coldness common to them both perhaps it was not necessary for them to speak of him perhaps they understood him aright in their understanding of each other  westover stayed on day after day thinking somehow that he ought to wait till jeff came there were only a few other people in the hotel and these were of a quiet sort they were not saddened by the presence of a doomed man under the same roof as gayer summer folks might have been and they were themselves no disturbance to him  he sat about with them on the veranda and he made friends among them and they did what they could to encourage and console him in his impatience to take up his old cares in the management of the hotel the whitwells easily looked after the welfare of the guests and jackson was so much better to every ones perception that westover could honestly write jeff a good report of him  the report may have been so good that jeff took the affair too easily it was a fortnight after jacksons return to lions head when he began to fail so suddenly and alarmingly that westover decided upon his own responsibility to telegraph jeff of his condition but he had the satisfaction of whitwells approval when he told him what he had done  of course jackson ant long for this world anybody but him and his mother could see that and now hes just melting away as you might say i hant liked his not carin to work plantchette since he got back looked to me from the start that he kind of knowed that it want worth while for him to trouble about a world that hell know all about so soon anyways and d you notice he dont seem to care about mars either ive tried to wake him up on it twothree times but you cant git him to take an interest i guess jeff cant git here any too soon on jacksons account but as far forth as i go he couldnt git here too late i should like to take the top of his head off  westover had been in whitwells confidence since their first chance of speech together he now said  i know it will be rather painful to you to have him here for some reasons but  you mean cynthy well i guess when cynthy cant get along with the sight of jeff durgin shell be a different girl from what shes ever been before if shes got to see that skunk agin i guess this is about the best time to do it  it was westover who drove to meet jeff at the station when he got his despatch naming the train he would take and he found him looking very well and perhaps stouter than he had been  they left the station in silence after their greeting and jeffs inquiries about jackson jeff had taken the reins and now he put them with the whip in one hand and pushed up his hat with the other and turned his face full upon westover notice anything in particular he demanded  no yessome slight marks  i guess that fellow fixed me up pretty well paints black eyes and that kind of thing i got to scrapping with a man class day we wanted to settle a little business we began at the tree and he left his marks on me i meant to tell you the truth as soon as i could get at you but i had to say erysipelas in my letter i guess if you dont mind well let erysipelas stand with the rest  i shouldnt have cared westover said if youd let it stand with me  oh thank you jeff returned  there could have been no show of affection at his meeting with jackson even if there had been any fact of it that was not the law of their life but jeff had always been a turbulent rebellious younger brother resentful of jacksons control too much his junior to have the associations of an equal companionship in the past and yet too near him in age to have anything like a filial regard for him they shook hands and each asked the other how he was and then they seemed to have done with each other jeffs mother kissed him in addition to the handshaking but made him feel her preoccupation with jackson she asked him if he had hurried home on jacksons account and he promptly lied her out of this anxiety  he shook hands with cynthia too but it was across the barrier which had not been lowered between them since they parted he spoke to jackson about her the day after he came home when jackson said he was feeling unusually strong and well and the two brothers had strolled out through the orchard together now and then he gave the sick man his arm and when he wanted to sit down in a sunny place he spread the shawl he carried for him  i suppose mothers told you about cynthy and me jackson he began  jackson answered with lacklustre eyes yes presently he asked whats become of the other girl  damn her i dont know whats become of her and i dont care jeff exploded furiously  then you dont care for her any more jackson pursued with the same languid calm  i never cared for her  jackson was silent and the matter seemed to have faded out of his mind but it was keenly alive in jeffs mind and he was in the strange necessity which men in the flush of life and health often feel of seeking counsel of those who stand in the presence of death as if their words should have something of the mystical authority of the unknown wisdom they are about to penetrate  what i want to know is what i am going to do about cynthy  i dont know jackson answered vaguely and he expressed by his indirection the sense he must sometimes have had of his impending fatei dont know what shes going to do her or mother either  yes jeff assented thats what i think of and id do anything that i couldthat you thought was right  jackson apparently concentrated his mind upon the question by an effort do you care as much for cynthy as you used to  yes said jeff after a moment as much as i ever did and more but ive been thinking since the thing happened that if id cared for her the way she did for me it wouldnt have happened look here jackson you know ive never pretended to be like some menlike mr westover for examplealways looking out for the right and the wrong and all that i didnt make myself and i guess if the almighty dont make me go right its because he dont want me to but i have got a conscience about cynthy and id be willing to help out a little if i knew how about her the devil of it is ive got to being afraid i dont mean that im not fit for her any mans fit for any woman if he wants her bad enough but im afraid i shant ever care for her in the right way thats the point ive cared for just one woman in this world and it ant cynthy as far as i can make out but shes gone and i guess i could coax cynthy round again and i could be what she wants me to be after this  jackson lay upon his shawl looking up at the sky full of islands of warm clouds in its sea of blue he was silent so long that jeff began to think he had not been listening he could not hear him breathe and he came forward to him quickly from the shadow of the tree where he sat  well jackson whispered turning his eyes upon him  well jeff returned  i guess youd better let it alone said jackson  all right thats what i think too     xlix  jackson died a week later and they buried him in the old family lot in the farthest corner of the orchard his mother and cynthia put on mourning for him and they stood together by his open grave mrs durgin leaning upon her sons arm and the girl upon her fathers the women wept quietly but jeffs eyes were dry though his face was discharged of all its prepotent impudence westover standing across the grave from him noticed the marks on his forehead that he said were from his scrapping and wondered what really made them he recognized the spot where they were standing as that where the boy had obeyed the law of his nature and revenged the stress put upon him for righteousness over the stone of the nearest grave jeff had shown a face of triumphant derision when he pelted westover with apples the painters mind fell into a chaos of conjecture and misgiving so that he scarcely took in the words of the composite service which the minister from the union chapel at the huddle read over the dead  some of the guests from the hotel came to the funeral but others who were not in good health remained away and there was a general sense among them which imparted itself to westover that jacksons dying so at the beginning of the season was not a fortunate incident as he sat talking with jeff at a corner of the piazza late in the afternoon frank whitwell came up to them and said there were some people in the office who had driven over from another hotel to see about board but they had heard there was sickness in the house and wished to talk with him  i wont come said jeff  theyre not satisfied with what ive said the boy urged what shall i tell them  tell them togo to the devil said jeff and when frank whitwell made off with this message for delivery in such decent terms as he could imagine for it jeff said rather to himself than to westover i dont see how were going to run this hotel with that old family lot down there in the orchard much longer  he assumed the air of full authority at lions head and westover felt the stress of a painful conjecture in regard to the whitwells intensified upon him from the moment he turned away from jacksons grave  cynthia and her father had gone back to their own house as soon as jeff returned and though the girl came home with mrs durgin after the funeral and helped her in their common duties through the afternoon and evening westover saw her taking her way down the hill with her brother when the long days work was over jeff saw her too he was sitting with westover at the office door smoking and he was talking of the whitwells  i suppose they wont stay he said and i cant expect it but i dont know what mother will do exactly  at the same moment whitwell came round the corner of the hotel from the barn and approached them jeff i guess i better tell you straight off that were goin the children and me  all right mr whitwell said jeff with respectful gravity i was afraid of it  westover made a motion to rise but whitwell laid a detaining hand upon his knee there aint anything so private about it so far as i know  dont go mr westover said jeff and westover remained  we ant agoin to leave you in the lurch and we want you should take your time especially mis durgin but the sooner the better heigh  yes i understand that mr whitwell i guess mother will miss you but if you must go you must the two men remained silent a moment and then jeff broke out passionately rising and flinging his cigar away i wish i could go instead that would be the right way and i guess mother would like it full as well do you see any way to manage it he put his foot up in his chair and dropped his elbow on his knee with his chin propped in his hand westover could see that he meant what he was saying if there was any way id do it i know what you think of me and i should be just like you in your place i dont feel right to turn you out here i dont mr whitwell and yet if i stay ive got to do it whats the reason i cant go  you cant said whitwell and thats all about it we shouldnt let you if you could but i ant surprised you feel the way you do he added unsparingly as you say i should feel just so myself if i was in your place well goodnight mr westover  whitwell turned and slouched down the hill leaving the painter to the most painful moment he had known with jeff durgin and nearer sympathy thats all right mr westover jeff said i dont blame him  he remained in a constraint from which he presently broke with mocking hilarity when jombateeste came round the corner of the house as if he had been waiting for whitwell to be gone and told jeff he must get somebody else to look after the horses  why dont you wait and take the horses with you jombateeste he inquired theyll be handing in their resignation the next thing why not go altogether  the little canuck paused as if uncertain whether he was made the object of unfriendly derision or not and looked at westover for help apparently he decided to chance it in as bitter an answer as he could invent the oss cant elp imself mr durgin e stay but you don hown everybody  thats so jombateeste said jeff thats a good hit it makes me feel awfully have a cigar the canuck declined with a dignified bow and jeff said you dont smoke any more oh i see its my tobacco youre down on whats the matter jombateeste what are you going away for jeff lighted for himself the cigar the canuck had refused and smoked down upon the little man  mr witwell goin jombateeste said a little confused and daunted  whats mr whitwell going for  you hask mr witwell  all right and if i can get him to stay will you stay too jombateeste i dont like to see a rat leaving a ship the ships sure to sink if he does how do you suppose im going to run lions head without you to throw down hay to the horses it will be ruin to me sure jombateeste all the guests know how you play on the pitchfork out there and theyll leave in a body if they hear youve quit do say youll stay and ill reduce your wages onehalf on the spot  jombateeste waited to hear no more injuries he said youll don got money enough mr durgin by gosh to reduce my wages and he started down the hill toward whitwells house with as great loftiness as could comport with a downhill gait and his stature  well i seem to be getting it all round mr westover said jeff this must make you feel good i dont know but i begin to believe theres a god in israel myself  he walked away without saying goodnight and westover went to bed without the chance of setting himself right in the morning when he came down to breakfast and stopped at the desk to engage a conveyance for the station from frank whitwell the boy forestalled him with a grave face you dont know about mrs durgin  no what about her  well we cant tell exactly father thinks its a shock jombateeste gone over to lovewell for the doctor cynthias with her it seemed to come on in the night  he spoke softly that no one else might hear but by noon the fact that mrs durgin had been stricken with paralysis was all over the place the gloom cast upon the opening season by jacksons death was deepened among the guests some who had talked of staying through july went away that day but under cynthias management the housekeeping was really unaffected by mrs durgins calamity and the people who stayed found themselves as comfortable as ever jeff came fully into the hotel management and in their business relation cynthia and he were continually together there was no longer a question of the whitwells leaving him even jombateeste persuaded himself to stay and westover felt obliged to remain at least till the present danger in mrs durgins case was past  with the first return of physical strength mrs durgin was impatient to be seen about the house and to retrieve the season that her affliction had made so largely a loss the people who had become accustomed to it stayed on and the house filled up as she grew better but even the sight of her in a wheeled chair did not bring back the prosperity of other years she lamented over it with a keen and full perception of the fact but in a cloudy association of it with the joint future of jeff and cynthia  one day after mrs durgin had declared that she did not know what they were to do if things kept on as they were going whitwell asked his daughter  do you suppose she thinks you and jeff have made it up again  i dont know said the girl with a troubled voice and i dont know what to do about it it dont seem as if i could tell her and yet its wrong to let her go on  why didnt he tell her demanded her father tant fair his leavin it to you but its like him  the sick womans hold upon the fact weakened most when she was tired when she was better she knew how it was with them commonly it was when cynthia had got her to bed for the night that she sent for jeff and wished to ask him what he was going to do you cant expect cynthy to stay here another winter helpin you with jackson away youve got to either take her with you or else come here yourself give up your last year in college why dont you i dont want you should stay and i dont know who does if i was in cynthias place id let you work off your own conditions now youve give up the law shell kill herself tryin to keep you along  sometimes her speech became so indistinct that no one but cynthia could make it out and jeff listening with a face as nearly discharged as might be of its laughing irony had to turn to cynthia for the word which no one else could catch and which the stricken woman remained distressfully waiting for her to repeat to him with her anxious eyes upon the girls face he was dutifully patient with all his mothers whims he came whenever she sent for him and sat quiet under the severities with which she visited all his past unworthiness who you been hectorin now i should like to know she began on him one evening when he came at her summons between you and fox i got no peace of my life where is the dog  fox is all right mother jeff responded youre feeling a little better tonight ant you  i dont know i cant tell she returned with a gleam of intelligence in her eye then she said i dont see why im left to strangers all the time  you dont call cynthia a stranger do you mother he asked coaxingly  ohcynthy said mrs durgin with a glance as of surprise at seeing her no cynthys all right but wheres jackson and your father if ive told them not to be out in the dew once ive told em a hundred times cynthyd better look after her housekeepin if she dont want the whole place to run behind and not a soul left in the house what time o year is it now she suddenly asked after a little weary pause  its the last of august mother  oh she sighed i thought it was the beginnin of may didnt you come up here in may  yes  well thenor mebbe thats one o them tormentin dreams they do pester so what did you come for  jeff was sitting on one side of her bed and cynthia on the other she was looking at the sufferers face and she did not meet the glance of amusement which jeff turned upon her at being so fairly cornered well i dont know he said i thought you might like to see me  what d he come forthe sick woman turned to cynthia  youd better tell her said the girl coldly to jeff she wont be satisfied till you do shell keep coming back to it  well mother said jeff still with something of his hardy amusement i hadnt been acting just right and i thought id better tell cynthy  you better let the child alone if i ever catch you teasin them children again ill make jackson shoot fox  all right mother said jeff  she moved herself restively in bed whats this she demanded of her son that whitwells tellin about you and cynthy breakin it off  well there was talk of that said jeff passing his hand over his lips to keep back the smile that was stealing to them  who done it  cynthia kept her eyes on jeff who dropped his to his mothers face cynthy did it but i guess i gave her good enough reason  about that hussy in boston she was full more to blame than what you was i dont see what cynthy wanted to do it for on her account  i guess cynthy was right  mrs durgins speech had been thickening more and more she now said something that jeff could not understand he looked involuntarily at cynthia  she says she thinks i was hasty with you the girl interpreted  jeff kept his eyes on hers but he answered to his mother not any more than i deserved i hadnt any right to expect that she would stand it  again the sick woman tried to say something jeff made out a few syllables and after his mother had repeated her words he had to look to cynthia for help  she wants to know if its all right now  what shall i say asked jeff huskily  tell her the truth  what is the truth  that we havent made it up  jeff hesitated and then said well not yet mother and he bent an entreating look upon cynthia which she could not feel was wholly for himself ii guess we can fix it somehow i behaved very badly to cynthia  no not to me the girl protested in an indignant burst  not to that little scalawag then cried jeff if the wrong wasnt to you there wasnt any wrong  it was to you cynthia retorted  oh i guess i can stand it said jeff and his smile now came to his lips and eyes  his mother had followed their quick parley with eager looks as if she were trying to keep her intelligence to its work concerning them the effort seemed to exhaust her and when she spoke again her words were so indistinct that even cynthia could not understand them till she had repeated them several times  then the girl was silent while the invalid kept an eager look upon her she seemed to understand that cynthia did not mean to speak and the tears came into her eyes  do you want me to know what she said asked jeff respectfully reverently almost  cynthia said gently she says that then you must show you didnt mean any harm to me and that you cared for me all through and you didnt care for anybody else  thank you said jeff and he turned to his mother ill do everything i can to make cynthy believe that mother  the girl broke into tears and went out of the room she sent in the nightwatcher and then jeff took leave of his mother with an unwonted kiss  into the shadow of a starlit night he saw the figure he had been waiting for glide out of the glitter of the hotel lights he followed it down the road  cynthia he called and when he came up with her he asked whats the reason we cant make it true why cant you believe what mother wants me to make you  cynthia stopped as her wont was when she wished to speak seriously do you ask that for my sake or hers  for both your sakes  i thought so you ought to have asked it for your own sake jeff and then i might have been fool enough to believe you but now  she started swiftly down the hill again and this time he did not try to follow her     l  mrs durgins speech never regained the measure of clearness it had before no one but cynthia could understand her and often she could not the doctor from lovewell surmised that she had sustained another stroke lighter more obscure than the first and it was that which had rendered her almost inarticulate the paralysis might have also affected her brain and silenced her thoughts as well as her words either she believed that the reconciliation between jeff and cynthia had taken place or else she could no longer care she did not question them again but peacefully weakened more and more near the end of september she had a third stroke and from this she died  the day after the funeral jeff had a talk with whitwell and opened his mind to him  im going over to the other side and i shant be back before spring or about time to start the season here what i want to know is whether if im out of the house and not likely to come back youll stay here and look after the place through the winter it hasnt been a good season but i guess i can afford to make it worth your while if you look at it as a matter of business  whitwell leaned forward and took a straw into his mouth from the golden wall of oat sheaves in the barn where they were talking a soft rustling in the mow overhead marked the remote presence of jombateeste who was getting forward the hay for the horses pushing it toward the holes where it should fall into their racks  i should want to think about it said whitwell i do know as cynthyd care much about stayinor frank  how long do you want to think about it jeff demanded ignoring the possible wishes of cynthia and frank  i guess i could let you know by night  all right said jeff  he was turning away when whitwell remarked  i dont know as i should want to stay without i could have somebody i could depend on with me to look after the hosses frank wouldnt want to  whod you like  welljombateeste  ask him  whitwell called to the canuck and he came forward to the edge of the mow and stood fork in hand looking down  want to stay here this winter and look after the horses jombateeste whitwell asked  nosseh said the canuck with a misliking eye on jeff  i mean along with me whitwell explained if i conclude to stay will you jeffs goin abroad  i guess i stay said jombateeste  dont strain yourself jombateeste said jeff with malevolent derision  not for you jeff dorrgin returned the canuck i strain myself till i bust if i want  jeff sneered to whitwell well then the most important point is settled let me know about the minor details as soon as you can  all right  whitwell talked the matter over with his children at supper that evening jeff had made him a good offer and he had the winter before him to provide for  i dont know what deviltry hes up to he said in conclusion  frank looked to his sister for their common decision i am going to try for a school she said quietly its pretty late but i guess i can get something you and frank had better stay  and you dont feel as if it was kind of meechin our takin up with his offer after whats whitwell delicately forbore to fill out his sentence  you are doing the favor father said the girl he knows that and i guess he wouldnt know where to look if you refused and after all whats happened now is as much my doing as his  i guess thats something so said whitwell with a long sigh of relief well im glad you can look at it in that light cynthy its the way the fellers built i presume as much as anything  his daughter waived the point i shouldnt feel just right if none of us stayed in the old place i should feel as if we had turned our backs on mrs durgin  her eyes shone and her father said well i guess thats so come to think of it shes been like a mother to you this past year hant she and it must have come pootty hard for her sidin agin jeff but she done it  the girl turned her head away they were sitting in the little low keepingroom of whitwells house and her father had his hat on provisionally through the window they could see the light of the lantern at the office door of the hotel whose mass was lost in the dark above and behind the lamp it was all very still outside  i declare whitwell went on musingly i wisht mr westover was here  cynthia started but it was to ask do you want i should help you with your latin frank  whitwell came back an hour later and found them still at their books he told them it was all arranged durgin was to give up the place to him in a week and he was to surrender it again when jeff came back in the spring in the mean time things were to remain as they were after he was gone they could all go and live at lions head if they chose  well see said cynthia ive been thinking that might be the best way after all i might not get a school its so late  thats so her father assented i declare he added after a moments muse i felt sorry for the feller settin up there alone with nobody to do for him but that old thing hes got in she cant cook any more than he desisted for want of a comparison and said such a lookin table too  do you think i better go and look after things a little cynthia asked  well you no need to said her father he got down the planchette and labored with it while his children returned to franks lessons  dumn f i can make the thing work he said to himself at last i cant git any of em up if jackson was here now  thrice a day cynthia went up to the hotel and oversaw the preparation of jeffs meals and kept taut the slack housekeeping of the old irish woman who had remained as a favor after the hotel closed and professed to have lost the chance of a place for the winter by her complaisance she submitted to cynthias authority and tried to make interest for an indefinite stay by sudden zeal and industry and the last days of jeff in the hotel were more comfortable than he openly recognized he left the care of the building wholly to whitwell and shut himself up in the old farm parlor with the plans for a new hotel which he said he meant to put up some day if he could ever get rid of the old one he went once to lovewell where he renewed the insurance and somewhat increased it and he put a small mortgage on the property he forestalled the slow progress of the knowledge of others affairs which in the country is as sure as it is slow and told whitwell what he had done he said he wanted the mortgage money for his journey and the insurance money if he could have the luck to cash up by a good fire to rebuild with  cynthia seldom met him in her comings and goings but if they met they spoke on the terms of their boy and girl associations and with no approach through resentment or tenderness to the relation that was ended between them she saw him oftener than at any other time setting off on the long tramps he took through the woods in the afternoons he was always alone and so far as any one knew his wanderings had no object but to kill the time which hung heavy on his hands during the fortnight after his mothers death before he sailed it might have seemed strange that he should prefer to pass the days at lions head after he had arranged for the care of the place with whitwell and whitwell always believed that he stayed in the hope of somehow making up with cynthia  one day toward the very last durgin found himself pretty well fagged in the old pulpmill clearing on the side of lions head which still belonged to whitwell and he sat down on a mouldering log there to rest it had always been a favorite picnic ground but the season just past had known few picnics and it was those of former years that had left their traces in rusty sardinecans and broken glass and crockery on the border of the clearing which was now almost covered with white moss jeff thought of the day when he lurked in the hollow below with fox while westover remained talking with whitwell he thought of the picnic that mrs marven had embittered for him and he thought of the last time that he had been there with westover when they talked of the vostrands  life had so far not been what he meant it and just now it occurred to him that he might not have wholly made it what it had been it seemed to him that a good many other people had come in and taken a hand in making his own life what it had been and if he had meddled with theirs more than he was wanted it was about an even thing as far as he could make out he was a sort of ingredient in the general mixture he had probably done his share of the flavoring but he had had very little to do with the mixing there were different ways of looking at the thing westover had his way but it struck jeff that it put too much responsibility on the ingredient and too little on the power that chose it he believed that he could prove a clear case in his own favor as far as the question of final justice was concerned but he had no complaints to make things had fallen out very much to his mind he was the landlord at lions head at last with the full right to do what he pleased with the place and with half a years leisure before him to think it over he did not mean to waste the time while he was abroad if there was anything to be learned anywhere about keeping a summer hotel he was going to learn it and he thought the summer hotel could be advantageously studied in its winter phases in the mild climates of southern europe he meant to strike for the class of americans who resorted to those climates to divine their characters and to please their tastes  he unconsciously included cynthia in his scheme of inquiry he had been used so long to trust to her instincts and opinions and to rely upon her help and he realized that she was no longer in his life with something like the shock a man experiences when the loss of a limb which continues a part of his inveterate consciousness is brought to his sense by some mechanical attempt to use it but even in this pang he did not regret that all was over between them he knew now that he had never cared for her as he had once thought and on her account if not his own he was glad their engagement was broken a soft melancholy for his own disappointment imparted itself to his thoughts of cynthia he felt truly sorry for her and he truly admired and respected her he was in a very lenient mood toward every one and he went so far in thought toward forgiving his enemies that he was willing at least to pardon all those whom he had injured a little rustling in the underbrush across the clearing caught his quick ear and he looked up to see jombateeste parting the boughs of the young pines on its edge and advancing into the open with a gun on his shoulder he called to him cheerily hello john any luck  jombateeste shook his head nawthing he hesitated  what are you after  partridge jombateeste ventured back  jeff could not resist the desire to scoff which always came upon him at sight of the canuck oh pshaw why dont you go for woodchucks they fly low and you can hit them on the wing if you cant sneak on em sitting  jombateeste received his raillery in dignified silence and turned back into the woods again he left durgin in heightened goodhumor with himself and with the world which had finally so well adapted itself to his desires and designs  jeff watched his resentful going with a grin and then threw himself back on the thick bed of dry moss where he had been sitting and watched the clouds drifting across the space of blue which the clearing opened overhead his own action reminded him of jackson lying in the orchard and looking up at the sky he felt strangely at one with him and he experienced a tenderness for his memory which he had not known before jackson had been a good man he realized that with a curious sense of novelty in the reflection he wondered what the incentives and the objects of such men as jackson and westover were anyway something like grief for his brother came upon him not such grief as he had felt passionately enough though tacitly for his mother but a regret for not having shown jackson during his life that he could appreciate his unselfishness though he could not see the reason or the meaning of it he said to himself in their safe remoteness from each other that he wished he could do something for jackson he wondered if in the course of time he should get to be something like him he imagined trying  he heard sounds again in the edge of the clearing but he decided that it was that fool jombateeste coming back and when steps approached softly and hesitantly across the moss he did not trouble himself to take his eyes from the clouds he was only vexed to have his revery broken in upon  a voice that was not jombateestes spoke i say can you tell me the way to the brooker institute or to the road down the mountain  jeff sat suddenly boltupright in another moment he jumped to his feet the brooker institute was a branch of the keeley cure recently established near the huddle and this must be a patient who had wandered from it on one of the excursions the inmates made with their guardians and lost his way this was the fact that jeff realized at the first glance he gave the man the next he recognized that the man was alan lynde  oh its you he said quite simply he felt so cruelly the hardship of his one unforgiven enemys coming upon him just when he had resolved to be good that the tears came into his eyes then his rage seemed to swell up in him like the rise of a volcanic flood im going to kill you he roared and he launched himself upon lynde who stood dazed  but the murder which jeff meant was not to be so easily done lynde had not grown up in dissolute idleness without acquiring some of the arts of selfdefence which are called manly he met jeffs onset with remembered skill and with the strength which he had gained in three months of the wholesome regimen of the brooker institute he had been sent there not by dr lacys judgment but by his despair and so far the cure had cured he felt strong and fresh and the hate which filled jeff at sight of him steeled his shaken nerves and reinforced his feebler muscles too  he made a desperate fight where he could not hope for mercy and kept himself free of his powerful foe whom he fought round and foiled if he could not hurt him jeff never knew of the blows lynde got in upon him he had his own science too but he would not employ it he wanted to crash through lyndes defence and lay hold of him and crush the life out of him  the contest could not have lasted long at the best but before lynde was worn out he caught his heel in an old laurel root and while he whirled to recover his footing jeff closed in upon him caught him by the middle flung him down upon the moss and was kneeling on his breast with both hands at his throat  he glared down into his enemys face and suddenly it looked pitifully little and weak like a girls face a childs  sometimes afterward it seemed to him that he forbore because at that instant he saw jombateeste appear at the edge of the clearing and come running upon them at other times he had the fancy that his action was purely voluntary and that against the logic of his hate and habit of his life he had mercy upon his enemy he did not pride himself upon it he rather humbled himself before the fact which was accomplished through his will and not by it and remained a mystery he did not try to solve  he took his hands from lyndes throat and his knees off his breast get up he said and when lynde stood trembling on his feet he said to jombateeste show this man the way to the brooker institute ill take your gun home for you and it was easy for him to detach the piece from the bewildered canucks grasp go and if you stop or even let him look back ill shoot him quick     li  the day after thanksgiving when westover was trying to feel well after the turkey and cranberry and cider which a lady had given him at a consciously oldfashioned thanksgiving dinner but not making it out sufficiently to be able to work he was astonished to receive a visit from whitwell  well sir said the philosopher without giving himself pause for the exchange of reflections upon his presence in boston which might have been agreeable to him on a less momentous occasion its all up with lions head  what do you mean demanded westover with his mind upon the mountain which he electrically figured in an incredible destruction  shes burnt burnt down the day before yistdy aftnoon ant hardly a stick of her left ketehed lord knows how from the kitchen chimney and a high northwest wind blowin that cad the sparks to the barn and set fire to that too hasses gone couldnt get round to em only three of us there and mixed up so about the house till it was so late the critters wouldnt come out folks from over huddle way see the blaze and helped all they could but it want no use i guess all we saved about was the flagpole  but youre all right yourselves cynthia  well there was our misfortune said whitwell while westovers heart stopped in a mere wantonness of apprehension if shed ben there it might ha ben diffent we might ha had more sense or she would anyway but she was over to lovewell stockin up for thanksgivin and i had to make out the best i could with frank and jombateeste why that canuck didnt seem to have no more head on him than a hen i was disgusted but cynthy wouldnt let me say anything to him and i d know as t ould done any good myself weve talked it all over in every light ever since guess weve set up most the time talkin and nothin would do her but i should come down and see you before i took a single step about it  howstep about what asked westover with a remote sense of hardship at being brought in tempered by the fact that it was cynthia who had brought him in  why that devil said whitwell and westover knew that he meant jeff went and piled on all the insurance he could pile on before he left and i dont know what to do about it  i should think the best thing was to collect the insurance westover suggested distractedly  it ant so easy as what that comes to said whitwell i couldnt collect the insurance and heres the point anyway when a hotels made a bad season and shes fully insured shes pootty certain to burn up some time in the winter everybody knows that comical devil wanted lions head to burn up so t he could build new and i presume there ant a man woman or child anywhere round but what believes i set her on fire hired to do it now see jeff off in europe daytime no lives lost propty total loss s a clear case heigh i tell you im afraid ive got trouble ahead  westover tried to protest to say something in derision or defiance but he was shaken himself and he ended by getting his hat and coat whitwell had kept his own on in the excitement well go out and see a lawyer a friend of mine it wont cost you anything he added this assurance at a certain look of reluctance that came into whitwells face and that left it as soon as he had spoken whitwell glanced round the studio even cheerily whod ha thought he said fastening upon the study which westover had made of lions head the winter before that the old place would a gone so soon he did not mean the mountain which he was looking at but the hotel that was present to his minds eye and westover perceived as he had not before that to whitwell the hotel and not the mountain was lions head  he remembered to ask now where whitwell had left his family and whitwell said that frank and cynthia were at home in his own house with jombateeste but he presumed he could not get back to them now before the next day he refused to be interested in any of the aspects of boston which westover casually pointed out but when they had seen the lawyer he came forth a new man vividly interested in everything the lawyer had been able to tell them that though the insurance companies would look sharply into the cause of the fire there was no probability hardly a possibility that they would inculpate him and he need give himself no anxiety about the affair  theres one thing though whitwell said to westover when they got out upon the street hadnt i ought to let jeff know  yes at once youd better cable him have you got his address  whitwell had it and he tasted all the dramatic quality of sending word to jeff which he would receive in florence an hour after it left boston i did hope i could ha cabled once to jackson while he was gone he said regretfully but unless we can fix up a wire with the other world i guess i shant ever do it now i suppose jacksons still hangin round mars someres  he had a sectarian pride in the beauty of the spiritual temple which westover walked him by on his way to see trinity church and the fine arts museum and he sorrowed that he could not attend a service there but he was consoled by the lunch which he had with westover at a restaurant where it was served in courses i presume this is what jeffs goin to give em at lions head when he gits it goin again  how is it hes in florence it occurred to westover to ask i thought he was going to nice for the winter  i dont know thats the address he give in his last letter said whitwell ill be glad when ive done with him for good and all hes all kinds of a devil  it was in westovers mind to say that he wished the whitwells had never had anything to do with durgin after his mothers death he had felt it a want of delicacy in them that they had been willing to stay on in his employ and his ideal of cynthia had suffered a kind of wound from what must have been her decision in the matter he would have expected something altogether different from her pride her selfrespect but he now merely said yes i shall be glad too im afraid hes a bad fellow  his words seemed to appeal to whitwells impartiality well i d know as i should say bad exactly hes a mixture  hes a bad mixture said westover  well i guess youre partly right there whitwell admitted with a laugh after a dreamy moment he asked ever hear anything more about that girl here in boston  westover knew that he meant bessie lynde shes abroad somewhere with her aunt  whitwell had not taken any wine apparently he was afraid of forming instantly the habit of drink if he touched it but he tolerated westovers pint of zinfandel and he seemed to warm sympathetically to a greater confidence as the painter made away with it theres one thing i never told cynthy yet well jombateeste didnt tell me himself till after jeff was gone and then thinks i whats the use but i guess you had better know  he leaned forward across the table and gave jombateestes story of the encounter between jeff and alan lynde in the clearing now what do you suppose was the reason jeff let up on the feller of course he meant to choke the life out of him and his just ketchin sight of jombateestedo you believe that was enough to stop him when hed started in for a thing like that or what was it done it  westover listened with less thought of the fact itself than of another fact that it threw light upon it was clear to him now that the classday scrapping which had left its marks upon jeffs face was with lynde and that when jeff got him in his power he was in such a fury for revenge that no mere motive of prudence could have arrested him in both events it must have been bessie lynde that was the moving cause but what was it that stayed jeff in his vengeance  let him up and let him walk away you say he demanded of whitwell  whitwell nodded thats what jombateeste said said jeff said if he let the feller look back hed shoot him but he didnt haf to  i cant make it out westover sighed  its been too much for me whitwell said i told jombateeste hed better keep it to himself and i guess he done so spose jeff still had a sneakin fondness for the girl  i dont know perhaps westover asserted  whitwell threw his head back in a sudden laugh that showed all the work of his dentist well wouldnt it be a joke if he was there in florence after her be just like jeff  it would be like jeff i dont know whether it would be a joke or not i hope he wont find it a joke if its so said westover gloomily a fantastic apprehension seized him which made him wish for the moment that it might be so and which then passed leaving him simply sorry for any chance that might bring bessie lynde into the fellows way again  for the evening whitwells preference would have been a lecture of some sort but there was none advertised and he consented to go with westover to the theatre he came back to the painter at dinnertime after a wary exploration of the city which had resulted not only in a personal acquaintance with its monuments but an immunity from its dangers and temptations which he prided himself hardly less upon he had seen faneuil hall the old state house bunker hill the public library and the old south church and he had not been sandbagged or buncoed or led astray from the paths of propriety in the comfortable sense of escape he was disposed to moralize upon the civilization of great cities which he now witnessed at first hand for the first time and throughout the evening between the acts of the old homestead which he found a play of some merit but of not so much novelty in its characters as he had somehow led himself to expect he recurred to the difficulties and dangers that must beset a young man in coming to a place like boston westover found him less amusing than he had on his own ground at lions head and tasted a quality of commonplace in his deliverances which made him question whether he had not perhaps always owed more to this environment than he had suspected but they parted upon terms of mutual respect and in the common hope of meeting again whitwell promised to let westover know what he heard of jeff but when the painter had walked the philosopher home to his hotel he found a message awaiting him at his studio from jeff direct     whitwells despatch received wait letter                        durgin  westover raged at the intelligent thrift of this telegram and at the implication that he not only knew all about the business of whitwells despatch but that he was in communication with him and would be sufficiently interested to convey jeffs message to him of course durgin had at once divined that whitwell must have come to him for advice and that he would hear from him whether he was still in boston or not by cabling to westover jeff saved the cost of an elaborate address to whitwell at lions head and had brought the painter in for further consultation and assistance in his affairs what vexed him still more was his own consciousness that he could not defeat this impudent expectation he had indeed some difficulty with himself to keep from going to whitwells hotel with the despatch at once and he slept badly in his fear that he might not get it to him in the morning before he left town  the sum of jeffs letter when it came and it came to westover and not to whitwell was to request the painter to see a lawyer in his behalf and put his insurance policies in his hands with full authority to guard his interests in the matter he told westover where his policies would be found and enclosed the key of his box in the safety vaults with a due demand for westovers admission to it he registered his letter and he jocosely promised westover to do as much for him some day in pleading that there was really no one else he could turn to he put the whole business upon him and westover discharged himself of it as briefly as he could by delivering the papers to the lawyer he had already consulted for whitwell  is this another charity patient asked his friend with a grin  no replied westover you can charge this fellow along the whole line  before he parted with the lawyer he had his misgivings and he said i shouldnt want the blackguard to think i had got a friend a fat job out of him  the lawyer laughed intelligently i shall only make the usual charge then he is a blackguard  there ought to be a more blistering word  one that would imply that he was capable of setting fire to his property  i dont say that but im glad he was away when it took fire said westover  you give him the benefit of the doubt  yes of every kind of doubt     lii  westover once more promised himself to have nothing to do with jeff durgin or his affairs but he did not promise this so confidently as upon former occasions and he instinctively waited for a new complication he could not understand why jeff should not have come home to look after his insurance unless it was because he had become interested in some woman even beyond his concern for his own advantage he believed him capable of throwing away advantages for disadvantages in a thing of that kind but he thought it more probable that he had fallen in love with one whom he would lose nothing by winning it did not seem at all impossible that he should have again met bessie lynde and that they should have made up their quarrel or whatever it was jeff would consider that he had done his whole duty by cynthia and that he was free to renew his suit with bessie and there was nothing in bessies character as westover understood it to prevent her taking him back upon a very small show of repentance if the needed emotions were in prospect he had decided pretty finally that it would be bessie rather than another when he received a letter from mrs vostrand it was dated at florence and after some pretty palaver about their old friendship which she only hoped he remembered half as fondly as she did the letter ran     i am turning to you now in a very strange difficulty but i do not    know that i should turn to you even now and knowing all i do of    your goodness if i were not asked to do so by another     i believe we have not heard from each other since the first days of    my poor genevieves marriage when everything looked so bright and    fair and we little realized the clouds that were to overcast her    happiness it is a long story and i will not go into it fully    the truth is that poor gigi did not treat her very kindly and that    she has not lived with him since the birth of their little girl now    nearly two years old and the sweetest little creature in the world    i wish you could see her i am sure it would inspire your pencil    with the idea of an angelchild at first i hoped that the    separation would be only temporary and that when genevieve had    regained her strength she would be willing to go back to her    husband but nothing would induce her to do so in fact poor gigi    had spent all her money and they would have had nothing to live    upon but his pay and you know that the pay of the italian officers    is very small     gigi made several attempts to see her and he threatened to take    the child from her but he was always willing to compromise for    money i am afraid that he never really loved her and that we were    both deceived by his fervent protestations we managed to get away    from florence without his knowing it and we have spent the last two    years in lausanne very happily though very quietly our dear    checco is in the university there his father having given up the    plan of sending him to harvard and we had him with us while we    were taking measures to secure the divorce even in the simple way    we lived genevieve attracted a great deal of attention as she    always has done and she would have had several eligible offers if    she had been divorced or if her affections had not already been    engaged as i did not know at the time     we were in this state of uncertainty up to the middle of last    summer when the news of poor gigis sudden death came i am sorry    to say that his habits in some respects were not good and that    probably hastened it some it had obliged him to leave the army    genevieve did not feel that she could consistently put on black for    him and i did not urge her under the peculiar circumstances    there is so much mere formality in those kind of things at the best    but we immediately returned to florence to try and see if we could    not get back some of her effects which his family had seized i am    opposed to lawsuits if they can possibly be avoided and we arranged    with poor gigis family by agreeing to let them have genevieves    furniture if they would promise never to molest her with the child    and i must say they have behaved very well we are on the best of    terms with them and they have let us have some of the things back    which were endeared to her by old associations at a very reasonable    rate     this brings me to the romantic part of my letter and i will say at    once that we found your friend mr durgin in florence in the very    hotel we went to we all met in the diningroom at the table    dhote one evening and genevieve and he took to each other at once    he spent the evening with us in our private drawingroom and she    said to me after he went that for the first time in years she felt    rested it seems that she had always secretly fancied him and that    she gave up to me in the matter of marrying poor gigi because she    knew i had my heart set upon it and she was not very certain of her    own feelings when mr d offered himself in boston but the    conviction that she had made a mistake grew upon her more and more    after she had married gigi     well now mr westover i suppose you have guessed by this time    that mr durgin has renewed his offer and genevieve has    conditionally accepted him we do not feel that she is like an    ordinary widow and that she has to fill up a certain season of    mourning she and gigi have been dead to each other for years and    mr durgin is as fond of our dear little bice as her own father    could be and they are together all the time her name is beatrice    de popolani grassi isnt it lovely she has poor gigis black    eyes with the most beautiful golden hair which she gets from our    aide you remember genevieves hair back in the dear old days    before any trouble had come and we were all so happy together and    this brings me to what i wanted to say you are the oldest friend    we have and by a singular coincidence you are the oldest friend of    mr durgin too i cannot bear to risk my childs happiness a    second time and though mr vostrand fully approves of the match    and has cabled his consent from seattle washington still you    know a mothers heart cannot be at rest without some positive    assurance i told mr durgin quite frankly how i felt and he    agreed with me that after our experience with poor gigi we could not    be too careful and he authorized me to write to you and find out    all you knew about him he said you had known him ever since he was    a boy and that if there was anything bad in his record you could    tell it and he did not want you to spire the truth he knows you    will be just and he wants you to write out the facts as they struck    you at the time     i shall be on pins and needles as the saying is till we hear from    you and you know hew genevieve and mr d must be feeling she is    fully resolved not to have him without your endorsement and he is    quite willing to abide by what you say     i could almost wish you to cable me just good or bad but i know    that this will not be wise and i am going to wait for your letter    and get your opinion in full     we all join in the kindest regards mr d is talking with    genevieve while i write and has our darling bice on his knees    you cannot imagine what a picture it makes her childish delicacy    contrasted with his stalwart strength she says to send you a    baciettino and i wish you were here to receive it from her angel    lips yours faithfully                 medora vostrand     p smr d says that he fell in love with genevieve across the    barrier between the first and second cabin when he came over with us    on the aquitaine four years ago and that he has never ceased to    love her though at one time he persuaded himself that he cared for    another because he felt that she was lost to him forever and it was    no use he really did care for the lady he was engaged to and had a    true affection for her which he mistook for a warmer feeling he    says that she was worthy of any mans love and of the highest    respect i tell genevieve that she ought to honor him for it and    that she must never be jealous of a memory we are very happy in    mr vostrands cordial approval of the match he is so glad to    think that mr d is a business man his cable from seattle was    most enthusiastic                    m d  westover did not know whether to laugh or cry when he read this letter which covered several sheets of paper in lines that traversed each other in different directions his old youthful ideal of mrs vostrand finally perished in its presence though still he could not blame her for wishing to see her daughter well married after having seen her married so ill he asked himself without getting any very definite response whether mrs vostrand had always been this kind of a woman or had grown into it by the use of arts which her peculiar plan of life had rendered necessary to her he remembered the intelligent toleration of cynthia in speaking of her and his indignation in behalf of the girl was also thrill of joy for her escape from the fate which mrs vostrand was so eagerly invoking for her daughter but he thought of genevieve with something of the same tenderness and with a compassion that was for her alone she seemed to him a victim who was to be sacrificed a second time and he had clearly a duty to her which he must not evade the only question could be how best to discharge it and westover took some hours from his work to turn the question over in his mind in the end when he was about to give the whole affair up for the present and lose a nights sleep over it later he had an inspiration and he acted upon it at once he perceived that he owed no formal response to the sentimental insincerities of mrs vostrands letter and he decided to write to durgin himself and to put the case altogether in his hands if durgin chose to show the vostrands what he should write very well if he chose not to show it then westovers apparent silence would be a sufficient reply to mrs vostrands appeal     i prefer to address you he began because i do not choose to let    you think that i have any feeling to indulge against you and    because i do not think i have the right to take you out of your own    keeping in any way you would be in my keeping if i did and i do    not wish that not only because it would be a bother to me but    because it would be a wrong to you     mrs vostrand whose letter to me i will leave you to answer by    showing her this or in any other manner you choose tells me you do    not want me to spare the truth concerning you i have never been    quite certain what the truth was concerning you you know that    better than i do and i do not propose to write your biography here    but i will remind you of a few things     the first day i saw you i caught you amusing yourself with the    terror of two little children and i had the pleasure of cuffing you    for it but you were only a boy then and afterward you behaved so    well that i decided you were not so much cruel as thoughtlessly    mischievous when you had done all you could to lead me to this    favorable conclusion you suddenly turned and avenged yourself on    me so far as you could for the help i had given the little ones    against you i never greatly blamed you for that for i decided    that you had a vindictive temperament and that you were not    responsible for your temperament but only for your character     in your first year at harvard your associations were bad and your    conduct generally was so bad that you were suspended you were    arrested with other rowdy students and passed the night in a police    station i believe you were justly acquitted of any specific    offence and i always believed that if you had experienced greater    kindness socially during your first year in college you would have    been a better man     you seem to have told mrs vostrand of your engagement and i will    not speak of that it was creditable to you that so wise and good a    girl as your betrothed should have trusted you and i do not know    that it was against you that another girl who was neither wise nor    good should have trusted you at the same time you broke with the    last because you had to choose between the two and so far as i    know you accepted with a due sense of your faithlessness your    dismissal by the first in this connection i must remind you that    while you were doing your best to make the party to your second    engagement believe that you were in love with her you got her    brother an habitual inebriate drunk and were so far    instrumental in breaking down the weak will with which he was    struggling against his propensity it is only fair to you that i    should add that you persuaded me you got him only a little drunker    than he already got himself and that you meant to have looked after    him but forgot him in your preoccupation with his sister     i do not know what took place between you and these people after    you broke your engagement with the sister until your encounter with    the brother in whitwells clearing and i know of this only at    second hand i can well believe that you had some real or fancied    injury to pay off and i give you all the credit you may wish to    claim for sparing him at last for one of your vindictive    temperament it must have been difficult     i have told you the worst things i know of you and i do not    pretend to know them more than superficially i am not asked to    judge you and i will not you must be your own judge you are to    decide whether these and other acts of yours are the acts of a man    good enough to be intrusted with the happiness of a woman who has    already been very unhappy     you have sometimes howeveroftener than i wishedcome to me for    advice and i now offer you some advice voluntarily do not suppose    that because you love this woman as you believe you are fit to be    the keeper of her future ask yourself how you have dealt hitherto    with those who have loved you and whom in a sort you loved and do    not go further unless the answer is such as you can fully and    faithfully report to the woman you wish to marry what you have    made yourself you will be to the end you once called me an    idealist and perhaps you will call this idealism i will only add    and i will give the last word in your defence you alone know what    you are     liii  as soon as westover had posted his letter he began to blame himself for it he saw that the right and manly thing would have been to write to mrs vostrand and tell her frankly what he thought of durgin her folly her insincerity her vulgarity had nothing to do with the affair so far as he was concerned if she had once been so kind to him as to bind him to her in grateful friendship she certainly had a claim upon his best offices his duty was to her and not at all to durgin he need not have said anything against him because it was against him but because it was true and if he had written he must not have said anything less than the truth  he could have chosen not to write at all he could have said that her mawkish hypocrisy was a little too much that she was really wanting him to whitewash durgin for her and she had no right to put upon him the responsibility for the step she clearly wished to take he could have made either of these decisions and defended them to himself but in what he had done he had altogether shirked while he was writing to durgin and pretending that he could justly leave this affair to him he was simply indulging a bit of sentimental pose far worse than anything in mrs vostrands sham appeal for his help  he felt as the time went by that she had not written of her own impulse but at her daughters urgence and that it was this poor creature whose trust he had paltered with he believed that durgin would not fail to make her unhappy yet he had not done what he might to deliver her out of his hand he had satisfied a wretched pseudomagnanimity toward a faithless scoundrel as he thought durgin at the cost of a woman whose anxious hope of his aid had probably forced her mothers hand  at first he thought his action irrevocable and he bitterly upbraided himself for not taking council with cynthia upon mrs vostrands letter he had thought of doing that and then he had dismissed the thought as involving pain that he had no right to inflict but now he perceived that the pain was such as she must suffer in the event and that he had stupidly refused himself the only means of finding out the right thing to do her true heart and her clear mind would have been infallible in the affair and he had trusted to his own muddled impulse  he began to write other letters to durgin to mrs vostrand to genevieve but none of them satisfied him and he let the days go by without doing anything to retrieve his error or fulfil his duty at last he did what he ought to have done at first he enclosed mrs vostrands letter to cynthia and asked her what she thought he ought to have done while he was waiting cynthias answer to his letter a cable message reached him from florence     kind letter received married today written                           vostrand  the next mail brought cynthias reply which was very brief     i am sorry you had to write at all nothing could have prevented    it perhaps if he cares for her he will be good to her  since the matter was now irremediable westover crept less miserably through the days than he could have believed he should until the letter which mrs vostrands cable promised came to hand     dear friend she wrote your generous and satisfactory answer    came yesterday it was so delicate and highminded and so like    you to write to mr durgin and leave the whole affair to him and    he did not lose a moment in showing us your beautiful letter he    said you were a man after his own heart and i wish you could have    heard how he praised you it made genevieve quite jealous or would    have if it had been any one else but she is so happy in your    approval of her marriage which is to take place before the    sindaco tomorrow we shall only have the civil rite she feels    that it is more american and we are all coming home to lions head    in the spring to live and die true americans i wish you could    spend the summer with us there but until lions head is rebuilt    we cant ask you i dont know exactly how we shall do ourselves    but mr durgin is full of plans and we leave everything to him    he is here making genevieve laugh so that i can hardly write    he joins us in love and thanks and our darling bice sends you a    little kiss          medora vostrand     p s  mr d has told us all about the affairs you alluded to    with miss l we cannot feel that he was to blame but he blames    himself in regard to miss w he says his only excuse is that he was    always in love with genevieve and i think that is quite excuse    enough m v  from time to time during the winter westover wrote to cynthia and had letters from her in which he pleased himself fancying almost a personal effect of that shyness which he thought a charming thing in her but no doubt this was something he read into them on their face they were plain straightforward accounts of the life she led in the little old house at lions head under the shadow of the black ruin on the hill westover had taken to sending her books and magazines and in thanking him for these she would sometimes speak of things she had read in them her criticism related to the spirit rather than the manner of the things she spoke of and it pleased him that she seemed with all her insight to have very little artistic sense of any kind in the world where he lived there were so many women with an artistic sense in every kind that he was rather weary of it  there never was anything about durgin in the letters and westover was both troubled and consoled by this silence it might be from consciousness and it probably was it might be from indifference in the worst event it hid any pain she might have felt with a dignity from which no intimation of his moved her the nearest she came to speaking of jeff was when she said that jombateeste was going to work at the brickyards in cambridge as soon as the spring opened and was not going to stay any longer at lions head  her brother frank she reported had got a place with part work in the drugandbook store at lovewell where he could keep on more easily with his studies he had now fully decided to study for the ministry he had always wanted to be an episcopalian  one day toward the end of april when several weeks had passed without bringing westover any word from cynthia her father presented himself and enjoyed in the painters surprise the sensation of having dropped upon him from the clouds he gave due accounts of the health of each of his household ending with jombateeste you know hes out at the brick as he calls it in cambridge  cynthia said he was coming i didnt know he had come yet said westover i must go out and look him up if you think i could find him among all those canucks  well i dont know but youd better look us up at the same time said whitwell with additional pleasure in the painters additional surprise i guess were out in cambridge too he added at westovers start of question were out there visitin one of our summer folks as you might say remember mis fredericks  why what the deuce kept you from telling me so at once westover demanded indignantly  guess i hadnt got round to it said whitwell with dry relish  do you mean that cynthias there  well i guess they wouldnt cared much for a visit from me  whitwell took advantage of westovers moment of mystification to explain that jeff had written over to him from italy offering him a pretty good rent for his house which he wanted to occupy while he was rebuilding lions head he was going to push the work right through in the summer and be ready for the season the year after that was what whitwell understood and he understood that jeffs family was going to stay in lovewell but jeff himself wanted to be on the ground day and night  so thats kind of turned us out of doors as you may say and cynthias always had this idee of comin down boston way and she didnt know anybody that could advise with her as well as mis fredericks and she wrote to her and mis fredericks answered her to come right down and talk it over westover felt a pang of resentment that cynthia had not turned to him for counsel but he said nothing and whitwell went on she said she was ashamed to bother you youd had the whole neighborhood on your hands so much and so she wrote to mis fredericks  westover had a vague discomfort in it all which ultimately defined itself as a discontent with the willingness of the whitwells to let durgin occupy their house upon any terms for any purpose and a lingering grudge that cynthia should have asked help of any one but himself even from a motive of delicacy  in the evening he went out to see the girl at the house of mrs fredericks whom he found living in the port they had a first moment of intolerable shyness on her part he had been afraid to see her with the jealousy for her dignity he always felt lest she should look as if she had been unhappy about durgin but he found her looking not only very well but very happy and full of peace as soon as that moment of shyness passed it seemed to westover as if she had begun to live on new terms and that a harassing element which had always been in it had gone out of her life and in its absence she was beginning to rejoice in a lasting repose he found himself rejoicing with her and he found himself on simpler and franker terms with her than ever before neither of them spoke of jeff or made any approach to mention him and westover believed that this was not from a morbid feeling in her but from a final and enduring indifference  he saw her alone for mrs fredericks and her daughter had gone into town to a concert which he made her confess she would have gone to herself if it had not been that her father said he was coming out to see her she would not let him joke about the sacrifice he pretended she had made he had a certain pain in fancying that his visit was the highest and finest favor that life could do her she told him of the ambition she had that she might get a school somewhere in the neighborhood of boston and then find something for her brother to do while he began his studies in the theological school at harvard frank was still at lovewell it seemed  at the end of the long call he made he said abruptly when he had risen to go i should like to paint you  who me she cried as if it were the most incredible thing while a glad color rushed over her face  yes while youre waiting to get your school couldnt you come in with your father now and then and sit for me  whats he want me to come fer whitwell demanded when the plan was laid before him he was giving his unlimited leisure to the exploration of boston and his tone expressed something of the injury which he also put into words as a sole objection to the proposed interruption cant you go alone cynthy cynthia said she did not know but when the point was referred to mrs fredericks she was sure cynthia could not go alone and she acquainted them both as far as she could with that mystery of chaperonage which had never touched their lives before whitwell seemed to think that his daughter would give the matter up and perhaps she might have done so though she seemed reluctant if mrs fredericks had not further instructed them that it was the highest possible honor mr westover was offering them and that if he had proposed to paint her daughter she would simply have gone and lived with him while he was doing it  whitwell found some compensation for the time lost to his study of boston in the conversation of the painter which he said was worth a hundred cents on the dollar every time though it dealt less with the metaphysical aspect of the latest facts of science than the philosopher could have wished he did not to be sure take very much stock in the picture as it advanced somewhat fitfully with a good many reversions to its original state of sketch it appeared to him always a slight and feeble representation of cynthia though of course a native politeness forbade him to express his disappointment he avowed a faith in westovers ability to get it right in the end and always bade him go on and take as much time to it as he wanted  he felt less uneasy than at first because he had now found a little furnished house in the woodenest outskirts of north cambridge which he hired cheap from the recently widowed owner and they were keeping house there jombateeste lived with them and worked in the brickyards out of hours he helped cynthia and kept the ugly little place looking trim and neat and left whitwell free for the tramps home to nature which he began to take over the belmont uplands as soon as the spring opened he was not homesick as cynthia was afraid he might be his mind was fully occupied by the vast and varied interests opened to it by the intellectual and material activities of the neighboring city and he found ample scope for his physical energies in doing cynthias errands as well as studying the strange flora of the region he apparently thought that he had made a distinct rise and advance in the world sometimes in the first days of his satisfaction with his establishment he expressed the wish that jackson could only have seen how he was fixed once in his preoccupation with other things he no longer attempted to explore the eternal mysteries with the help of planchette the ungrateful instrument gathered as much dust as cynthia would suffer on the whatnot in the corner of the solemn parlor and after two or three visits to the first spiritual temple in boston he lapsed altogether from an interest in the other world which had perhaps mainly flourished in the absence of pressing subjects of inquiry in this  when at last westover confessed that he had carried his picture of cynthia as far as he could whitwell did his best to hide his disappointment well sir he said tolerantly and even cheeringly i presume were every one of us a different person to whoever looks at us they say that no two men see the same star  you mean that she doesnt look so to you suggested the painter who seemed not at all abashed  well you might saywhy here its like her photograph couldnt get it any better but it makes me thinkwell of a bird that youve come on sudden and it stoops as if it was goin to fly  ah said westover does it make you think of that     liv  the painter could not make out at first whether the girl herself was pleased with the picture or not and in his uncertainty he could not give it her at once as he had hoped and meant to do it was by a kind of accident he found afterward that she had always been passionately proud of his having painted her this was when he returned from the last sojourn he had made in paris whither he went soon after the whitwells settled in north cambridge he left the picture behind him to be framed and then sent to her with a letter he had written begging her to give it houseroom while he was gone he got a short stiff note in reply after he reached paris and he had not tried to continue the correspondence but as soon as he returned he went out to see the whitwells in north cambridge they were still in their little house there the young widower had married again but neither he nor his new wife had cared to take up their joint life in his first home and he had found whitwell such a good tenant that he had not tried to put up the rent on him frank was at home now with an employment that gave him part of his time for his theological studies cynthia had been teaching school ever since the fall after westover went away and they were all as whitwell said in clover he was the only member of the family at home when westover called on the afternoon of a warm summer day and he entertained him with a full account of a visit he had paid lions head earlier in the season  yes sir he said as if he had already stated the fact ive sold my old place there to that devil he said devil without the least rancor with even a smile of goodwill and he enjoyed the astonishment westover expressed in his demand  sold durgin your house  yes i see we never wanted to go back there to live any of us and i went up to pass the papers and close the thing out well i did have an offer for it from a feller that wanted to open a boadinhouse there and get the advantage of jeffs improvements and i couldnt seem to make up my mind till id looked the ground over fust off you know i thought id sell to the other feller because i could see in a minute what a thorn it d be in jeffs flesh but dumn it all when i met the comical devil i couldnt seem to want to pester him why here thinks i if weve made an escape from himand i guess we have about the biggest escapewhat have i got agin him anyway id ought to feel good to him and i guess thats the way i did feel come to boil it down hes got a way with him you know when youre with him that makes you like him he may have a knife in your ribs the whole while but so longs he dont turn it you dont seem to know it and you cant help likin him why i hadnt been with jeff five minutes before i made up my mind to sell to him i told him about the other offerfelt bound to do itand he was all on fire i want that place mr whitwell sd he name your price well i want goin to take an advantage of the feller and i guess he see it youve offered me three thousand sd i n i dont want to be no ways mean about it five thousand buys the place its mine sd he just like that i guess he see he had a gentleman to deal with and we didnt say a word more dont you think i done right to sell to him i couldnt a got moren thirtyfive hundred out the other feller to save me and before jeff begun his improvements i couldnt a realized a thousand dollars on the propty  i think you did right to sell to him said westover saddened somewhat by the proof whitwell alleged of his magnanimity  well sir im glad you do i dont believe in crowdin a man because you got him in a corner an i dont believe in bearin malice never did all i wanted was what the place was wothto him twant woth nothin to me hes got the house and the ten acres around it and hes got the house on lions head includin the clearin that the poottiest picnicground in the mountains think of goin up there this summer  no said westover briefly  well i some wish you did i shd like to know how jeffs improvements struck you of course i cant judge of em so well but i guess hes made a pootty sightly thing of it he told me hed had one of the leadin boston architects to plan the thing out for him and i tell you hes got something nice taint so big as old lions head and jeff wants to cater to a different style of custom anyway the buildins longern what she is deep and she spreads in front sos to give as many rooms a view of the mountain as she can know what runnaysonce is well thats the style jeff said it was its all pillars and pilasters and you ride up to the office through a double row of colyums under a kind of a portico its all painted like them old colonial houses down on brattle street buff and white well it made me think of one of them old pagan temples hes got her shoved along to the southard and hes widened out a piece of level for her to stand on so t that piece o wood up the hill there is just behind her and i tell you she looks nice backin up aginst the trees i tell you jeffs got a head on him i wish you could see that dininroom o his all white colyums and frontin on the view why that devils got a regular little theatyre back o the dininroom for the young folks to act ammyture plays in and the shows that come along and hes got a dancehall besides the parlors aint muchfolks like to set in the office and a good many of the rooms are done off into soots and got their own parlors i tell you its swell as they say you can order what you please for breakfast but for lunch and dinner you got to take what jeff gives you but he treats you well hes a durgin when it comes to that served in couses and dinner at seven oclock i dont know where he got his money for t all but i guess he put in his insurance fust and then he put a mortgage on the buildin be as much as owned it said hed had a splendid season last year and if he done as well for a copule of seasons more hed have the whole propty free o debt  westover could see that the prosperity of the unjust man had corrupted the imagination and confounded the conscience of this simple witness and he asked in the hope of giving his praises pause what has he done about the old family buryingground in the orchard  well there said whitwell that got me more than any other one thing i naturally expected that jeff d had em moved for you know and i know mr westover that a place like that couldnt be very popla with summer folks they dont want to have anything to kind of make em serious as you may say but that devil got his architect to treat the place as he calls it and he put a high stone wall around it and planted it to bushes and evergreens so t looks like a piece of old garden down there in the corner of the orchard and if you didnt hunt for it you wouldnt know it was there jeff said t when folks did happen to find it out he believed they liked it they think its picturesque and ancient why some on em wanted him to put up a little chapel alongside and have services there and jeff said he didnt know but hed do it yet hes got darkcolored stones up for mis durgin and jackson so t they look as old as any of em i tell you he knows how to do things  it seems so said westover with a bitterness apparently lost upon the optimistic philosopher  yes sir i guess its all worked out for the best so longs he didnt marry cynthy i dont care who he married andi guess hes made out fustrate and he treats his wife well and his motherinlaw too you wouldnt hardly know they was in the house theyre so kind of quiet and if a guest wants to see jeff hes got to send and ask for him clerk does everything but i guess jeff keeps an eye out and knows whats goin on hes got an elegant soot of appartments and he lives as private as if he was in his own house him and his wife but when theres anything goin on that needs a head theyre both right on deck  he dont let his wife worry about things a great deal hes got a fustrate of a housekeeper but i guess old mis vostrand keeps the housekeeper as you may say i hear some of the boaders talkin up there and one of em said t the great thing about lions head was t you could feel everywheres in it that it was a ladys house i guess jeff has a pootty good time and a time t suits him he shows up on the coachin parties and hes got himself a reglar english coachmans rig with boots outside his trouses and a long coat and a fuzzy plughat i tell you he looks gay he dont spend his winters at lions head he is off to europe about as soon as the house closes in the fall and he keeps bringin home new dodges guess you couldnt get no boad there for no seven dollars a week now i tell you jeffs the gentleman now and his wifes about the nicest lady i ever saw do know as i care so much about her mother do know as i got anything aginst her either very much but that little girl beechy as they call her shes a beauty and round with jeff all the while he seems full as fond of her as her own mother does and that devil that couldnt seem to get enough of tormentin little children when he was a boy is as good and gentle with that little thing aspie  whitwell seemed to have come to an end of his celebration of jeffs success and westover asked  and what do you make now of planchettes brokenshaft business or dont you believe in planchette any more  whitwells beaming face clouded well sir thats a thing thats always puzzled me if it want that it was jackson workin plantchette that night i shouldnt placed much dependence on what she said but jackson could get the truth out of her if anybody could sence i ben up there i ben figurin it out like this the broken shaft is the old jeff that hes left off bein  whitwell stopped midway in his suggestion with an inquiring eye on the painter who asked you think hes left off being the old jeff  well sir you got me there the philosopher confessed i didnt see anything to the contrary but come to think of it  why couldnt the broken shaft be his unfulfilled destiny on the old lines what reason is there to believe he isnt what hes always been  well come to think of it  people dont change in a day or a year westover went on or two or three years even sometimes i doubt if they ever change  well all that i thought whitwell urged faintly against the hard scepticism of a man ordinarily so yielding is t there must be a moral government of the universe somewheres and if a bad feller is to get along and prosper hand over hand that way dont it look kind of as if  there wasnt any moral government of the universe not the way i see it said westover a tree brings forth of its kind as a man sows he reaps its dead sure pitilessly sure jeff durgin sowed success in a certain way and hes reaping it he once said to me when i tried to waken his conscience that he should get where he was trying to go if he was strong enough and being good had nothing to do with it i believe now he was right but he was wrong too as such a man always is that kind of tree bears dead sea apples after all he sowed evil and he must reap evil he may never know it but he will reap what he has sown the dreadful thing is that others must share in his harvest what do you think  whitwell scratched his head well sir theres something in what you say i guess but here whats the use of thinkin a man cant change want there ever anything in that old idee of a change of heart what do you spose made jeff let up on that feller that jombateeste see him have down that day in my clearin what jeff would natchly done would ben to shake the life out of him but he didnt he let him up and he let him go whats the reason that want the beginnin of a new life for him  we dont know all the ins and outs of that business said westover after a moment ive puzzled over it a good deal the man was the brother of that girl that jeff had jilted in boston ive found out that much i dont know just the size and shape of the trouble between them but jeff may have felt that he had got even with his enemy before that day or he may have felt that if he was going in for full satisfaction there was jombateeste looking on  thats true said whitwell greatly daunted after a while he took refuge in the reflection well hes a comical devil  westover said in a sort of absence perhaps were all broken shafts here perhaps that old hypothesis of another life a world where there is room enough and time enough for all the beginnings of this to complete themselves  well now youre shoutin said whitwell and if plantchette westover rose why ant you goin to wait and see cynthy im expectin her along every minute now shes just gone down to harvard square shell be awfully put out when she knows youve ben here  ill come out again soon said westover tell her  well you must see your picture anyway weve got it in the parlor i dont know what shell say to me keepin you here in the settinroom all the time  whitwell led him into the little dark front hall and into the parlor less dim than it should have been because the afternoon sun was burning full upon its shutters the portrait hung over the mantel in a bad light but the painter could feel everything in it that he could not see  yes it had that look in it  well she hant took wing yet im thankful to think said whitwell and he spoke from his own large mind to the sympathy of an old friend who he felt could almost share his feelings as a father     lv  when westover turned out of the baking little street where the whitwells lived into an elmshaded stretch of north avenue he took off his hat and strolled bareheaded along in the cooler air he was disappointed not to have seen cynthia and yet he found himself hurrying away after his failure with a sense of escape or at least of respite  what he had come to say to do was the effect of long experience and much meditation the time had arrived when he could no longer feign to himself that his feelings toward the girl were not those of a lover but he had his modest fears that she could never imagine him in that character and that if he should ask her to do so he should shock and grieve her and inflict upon himself an incurable wound  during this last absence of his he had let his fancy dwell constantly upon her until life seemed worth having only if she would share it with him he was an artist and he had always been a bohemian but at heart he was philistine and bourgeois his ideal was a settlement a fixed habitation a stated existence a home where he could work constantly in an air of affection and unselfishly do his part to make his home happy it was a very simplehearted ambition and i do not quite know how to keep it from appearing commonplace and almost sordid but such as it was i must confess that it was his he had not married his model because he was mainly a landscapist perhaps and he had not married any of his pupils because he had not been in love with them charming and good and lovely as he had thought some of them and of late he had realized more and more why his fancy had not turned in their direction he perceived that it was already fixed and possibly had long been fixed  he did not blink the fact that there were many disparities and that there would be certain disadvantages which could never be quite overcome the fact had been brought rather strenuously home to him by his interview with cynthias father he perceived as indeed he had always known that with a certain imaginative lift in his thinking and feeling whitwell was irreparably rustic that he was and always must be practically yankee westover was not a yankee and he did not love or honor the type though its struggles against itself touched and amused him it made him a little sick to hear how whitwell had profited by durgins necessity and had taken advantage of him with conscientious and selfapplausive rapacity while he admired his prosperity and tried to account for it by doubt of its injustice for a moment this seemed to him worse than durgins conscientious toughness which was the antithesis of whitwells remorseless selfinterest for the moment this claimed cynthia of its kind and westover beheld her rustic and yankee of her fathers type if she was not that now she would grow into that through the lapse from the personal to the ancestral which we all undergo in the process of the years  the sight of her face as he had pictured it and of the soul which he had imagined for it restored him to a better sense of her but he felt the need of escaping from the suggestion of her fathers presence and taking further thought perhaps he should never again reach the point that he was aware of deflecting from now he filled his lungs with long breaths which he exhaled in sighs of relief it might have been a mistake on the spiritual as well as the worldly side it would certainly not have promoted his career it might have impeded it these misgivings flitted over the surface of thought that more profoundly was occupied with a question of other things in the time since he had seen her last it might very well be that a young and pretty girl had met some one who had taken her fancy and he could not be sure that her fancy had ever been his even if this had not happened he had no proof at all that she had ever cared or could care for him except gratefully respectfully almost reverentially with that mingling of filial and maternal anxiety which had hitherto been the warmest expression of her regard he tried to reason it out and could not he suddenly found himself bitterly disappointed that he had missed seeing her for if they had met he would have known by this time what to think what to hope he felt oldhe felt fully thirtysix years oldas he passed his hand over his crown whose gossamer growth opposed so little resistance to his touch he had begun to lose his hair early but till then he had not much regretted his baldness he entered into a little question of their comparative ages which led him to the conclusion that cynthia must now be about twentyfive  almost at the same moment he saw her coming up the walk toward him from far down the avenue for a reason or rather a motive of his own he pretended to himself that it was not she but he knew instantly that it was and he put on his hat he could see that she did not know him and it was a pretty thing to witness the recognition dawn on her when it had its full effect he was aware of a flutter a pause in her whole figure before she came on toward him and he hurried his steps for the charm of her beautiful blushing face  it was the spiritual effect of figure and face that he had carried in his thought ever since he had arrived at that onesided intimacy through his study of her for the picture he had just seen he had often had to ask himself whether he had really perceived or only imagined the character he had translated into it but here for the moment at least was what he had seen he hurried forward and joyfully took the hand she gave him he thought he should speak of that at once but it was not possible of course there had to come first the unheeded questions and answers about each others health and many other commonplaces he turned and walked home with her and at the gate of the little ugly house she asked him if he would not come in and take tea with them  her father talked with him while she got the tea and when it was ready her brother came in from his walk home out of old cambridge and helped her put it on the table he had grown much taller than westover and he was very ecclesiastical in his manner more so than he would be probably if he ever became a bishop westover decided jombateeste in an interval of suspended work at the brick yard was paying a visit to his people in canada and westover did not see him  all the time while they sat at table and talked together westover realized more and more that for him at least the separation of the last two years had put that space between them which alone made it possible for them to approach each other on new ground a kind of horror of repulsion for her engagement to jeff durgin had ceased from his sense of her it was as if she had been unhappily married and the man who had been unworthy and unkind was like a ghost who could never come to trouble his joy he was more her contemporary he found than formerly she had grown a great deal in the past two years and a certain affliction which her fathers fixity had given him concerning her passed in the assurance of change which she herself gave him  she had changed her world and grown to it but her nature had not changed even her look had not changed and he told her how he had seen his picture in her at the moment of their meeting in the street they all went in to verify his impression from the painting yes that is the way you looked  it seems to me that is the way i felt she asserted  frank went about the housework and left her to their guest when whitwell came back from the postoffice where he said he would only be gone a minute he did not rejoin westover and cynthia in the parlor  the parlor door was shut he had risked his fate and they were talking it over cynthia was not sure she was sure of nothing but that there was no one in the world she cared for so much but she was not sure that was enough she did not pretend that she was surprised she owned that she had sometimes expected it she blamed herself for not expecting it then  westover said that he did not blame her for not knowing her mind he had been fifteen years learning his own fully he asked her to take all the time she wished if she could not make sure after all he should always be sure that she was wise and good she told him everything there was to tell of her breaking with jeff and he thought the last episode a supreme proof of her wisdom and goodness  after a certain time they went for a walk in the warm summer moonlight under the elms where they had met on the avenue  i suppose she said as they drew near her door again that people dont often talk it over as weve done  we only know from the novels he answered perhaps people do oftener than is ever known i dont see why they shouldnt  no  ive never wished to be sure of you so much as since youve wished to be sure of yourself  and ive never been so sure as since you were willing to let me said cynthia  i am glad of that try to think of me if that will help my cause as some one you might have always known in this way we dont really know each other yet im a great deal older than you but still im not so very old  oh i dont care for that all i want to be certain of is that the feeling i have is reallythe feeling  i know dear said westover and his heart surged toward her in his tenderness for her simple conscience her wise question take time dont hurry forget what ive saidor no thats absurd think of it but dont let anything but the truth persuade you now goodnight cynthia  goodnightmr westover  mr westover he reproached her  she stood thinking as if the question were crucial then she said firmly i should always have to call you mr westover  oh well he returned if thats all   pg editors bookmarks       boldest man is commonly a little behind a timid woman      could not imagine the summer life of the
