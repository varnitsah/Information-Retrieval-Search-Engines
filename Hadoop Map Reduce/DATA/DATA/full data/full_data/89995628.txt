bluetinted in the distance between the cliffs of the trees on the grey   green park rests a still line of soldiers red motionless range of   guards smouldering with darkened busbies beneath the bay   onets slant rain  colossal in nearness a blue police sits still on his horse guarding the path his hand relaxed at his thigh and skyward his face is immobile eyelids aslant in tedium and mouth relaxed as if smilingineffable tedium  so so gaily a general canters across the space with white plumes blinking under the evening grey   sky and suddenly as if the ground moved the red range heaves in slow magnetic reply  evolutions of soldiers  the red range heaves and compulsory sways ah see   in the flush of a march softlyimpulsive advancing as water towards a weir   from the arch of shadow emerging as blood emerges from inward   shades of our night encroaching towards a crisis a meeting a spasm and   throb of delight  the wave of soldiers the coming wave the throbbing   red breast of approach upon us dark eyes as here beneath the busbies glit   tering dark threats that broach our beached vessel darkened rencontre inhuman and   closed warm lips and dark mouthhair of soldiers passing above us over the wreck   of our bark  and so it is ebbtime they turn the eyes beneath the   busbies are gone but the blood has suspended its timbre the heart from   out of oblivion knows but the retreat of the burning shoulders the   redswift waves of the sweet fire horizontal declining and ebbing the twilit ebb of   retreat   the little town at evening  the chime of the bells and the church clock   striking eight solemnly and distinctly cries down the babel   of children still playing in the hay the church draws nearer upon us gentle and great in shadow covering us up with her grey  like drowsy children the houses fall asleep under the fleece of shadow as in between tall and dark the church moves anxious to keep their sleeping cover them soft unseen  hardly a murmur comes from the sleeping brood i wish the church had covered me up with the rest in the homeplace why is it she should exclude me so distinctly from sleeping with those i love best   last hours  the cool of an oaks unchequered shade falls on me as i lie in deep grass which rushes upward blade beyond blade while higher the darting grassflowers pass piercing the blue with their crocketed spires and waving flags and the ragged fires of the sorrels cresseta green brave town vegetable new in renown  over the trees edge as over a mountain surges the white of the moon a cloud comes up like the surge of a fountain pressing round and low at first but soon heaving and piling a round white dome how lovely it is to be at home like an insect in the grass letting life pass  theres a scent of clover crept through my hair from the full resource of some purple dome where that lumbering bee who can hardly bear his burden above me never has clomb but not even the scent of insouciant flowers makes pause the hours  down the valley roars a townward train i hear it through the grass dragging the links of my shortening chain southwards alas   town  london used to wear her lights splendidly flinging her shawlfringe over the river tassels in abandon  and up in the sky a twoeyed clock like an owl solemnly used to approve chime chiming approval goggleeyed fowl  there are no gleams on the river no goggling clock no sound from st stephens no lampfringed frock  instead darkness and skinwrapped fleet hurrying limbs softfooted dead  london original wolfwrapped in pelts of wolves all her luminous garments gone  london with hair like a forest darkness like a marsh of rushes ere the romans broke in her lair  it is well that london lair of sudden male and female darknesses has broken her spell   after the opera  down the stone stairs girls with their large eyes wide with tragedy lift looks of shocked and momentous emotion   up at me and i smile  ladies stepping like birds with their bright and pointed feet peer anxiously forth as if for a boat to carry them out   of the wreckage and among the wreck of the theatre crowd i stand and smile  they take tragedy so becomingly which pleases me  but when i meet the weary eyes the reddened aching eyes of the barman with thin   arms i am glad to go back to where i came from   going back  the night turns slowly round swift trains go by in a rush of light slow trains steal past this train beats anxiously outward bound  but i am not here i am away beyond the scope of this turning there where the pivot is the axis of all this gear  i who sit in tears i whose heart is torn with parting who cannot bear to think back to the departure   platform my spirit hears  voices of men sound of artillery aeroplanes presences and more than all the deadsure silence the pivot again  there at the axis pain or love or grief sleep on speed in dead certainty pure relief  there at the pivot time sleeps again no hasbeen no hereafter only the perfected silence of men   on the march  we are out on the open road through the low west window a cold light   flows on the floor where never my numb feet trode before onward the strange road goes  soon the spaces of the western sky with shutters of sombre cloud will close but well still be together this road and i together wherever the long road goes  the wind chases by us and over the corn pale shadows flee from us as if from their foes like a snake we thresh on the long forlorn land as onward the long road goes  from the sky the low tired moon fades out through the poplars the nightwind blows pale sleepy phantoms are tossed about as the wind asks whither the wan road goes  away in the distance wakes a lamp inscrutable small lights glitter in rows but they come no nearer and still we tramp onward wherever the strange road goes  beat after beat falls sombre and dull the wind is unchanging not one of us knows what will be in the final lull when we find the place where this dead road goes  for something must come since we pass and pass along in the coiled convulsive throes of this marching along with the invisible grass that goes wherever this old road goes  perhaps we shall come to oblivion perhaps we shall march till our tired toes tread over the edge of the pit and were gone down the endless slope where the last road goes  if so let us forge ahead straight on if were going to sleep the sleep with those that fall forever knowing none of this land whereon the wrong road goes   bombardment  the town has opened to the sun like a flat red lily with a million petals she unfolds she comes undone  a sharp sky brushes upon the myriad glittering chimneytips as she gently exhales to the sun  hurrying creatures run down the labyrinth of the sinister flower what is it they shun  a dark bird falls from the sun it curves in a rush to the heart of the vast flower the day has begun   winterlull  because of the silent snow we are all hushed           into awe no sound of guns nor overhead no rushed           vibration to draw our attention out of the void wherein we are crushed  a crow floats past on level wings           noiselessly uninterrupted silence swings           invisibly inaudibly to and fro in our misgivings  we do not look at each other we hide           our daunted eyes white earth and ruins ourselves and nothing beside           it all belies our existence we wait and are still denied  we are folded together men and the snowy ground           into nullity there is silence only the silence never a sound           nor a verity to assist us disastrously silencebound   the attack  when we came out of the wood was a great light the night uprisen stood in white  i wondered i looked around it was so fair the bright stubble upon the ground shone white  like any field of snow yet warm the chase of faint nightbreaths did go across my face  whitebodied and warm the night was sweetscented to hold in my throat white and alight the night was a pale stroke smote  the pulse through the whole bland being which was this and me a pulse that still went fleeing yet did not flee  after the terrible rage the death this wonder stood glistening all shapes of wonder with suspended breath arrested listening  in ecstatic reverie the whole white night with wonder every black tree blossomed outright  i saw the transfiguration and the present host transubstantiation of the luminous ghost   obsequial ode  surely youve trodden straight to the very door surely you took your fate faultlessly now its too late to say more      it is evident you were right     that man has a course to go a voyage to sail beyond the charted seas you have passed from out of sight     and my questions blow back from the straight horizon that ends all one sees      now like a vessel in port     you unlade your riches unto death and glad are the eager dead to receive you there     let the dead sort your cargo out breath from breath let them disencumber your bounty let them all share      i imagine dead hands are brighter     their fingers in sunset shine with jewels of passion once broken through you as a   prism breaks light into jewels and dead breasts whiter     for your wrath and yes i opine they anoint their brows with your blood as a perfect   chrism      on your body the beaten anvil     was hammered out that moonlike sword the ascendant dead unsheathe against us sword that no man will     put to rout sword that severs the question from us who breathe  surely youve trodden straight     to the very door you have surely achieved your fate and the perfect dead are elate     to have won once more  now to the dead you are giving     your last allegiance but what of us who are living and fearful yet of believing     in your pitiless legions   shades  shall i tell you then how it is there came a cloven gleam like a tongue of darkened flame to flicker in me  and so i seem to have you still the same in one world with me  in the flicker of a flower in a worm that is blind yet strives in a mouse that pauses to listen  glimmers our shadow yet it deprives them none of their glisten  in every shaken morsel i see our shadow tremble as if it rippled from out of us hand in hand  as if it were part and parcel one shadow and we need not dissemble our darkness do you understand  for i have told you plainly how it is   bread upon the waters  so you are lost to me ah you you ear of corn straight lying what food is this for the darkly flying fowls of the afterwards  white bread afloat on the waters cast out by the hand that scatters food untowards  will you come back when the tide turns after many days my heart yearns to know  will you return after many days to say your say as a traveller says more marvel than woe  drift then for the sightless birds and the fish in shadowwaved herds to approach you  drift then bread cast out drift lest i fall in doubt and reproach you  for you are lost to me   ruination  the sun is bleeding its fires upon the mist that huddles in grey heaps coiling and holding   back like cliffs abutting in shadow a drear grey sea some streetends thrust forward their stack  on the misty wastelands away from the flushing grey of the morning the elms are loftily dimmed and tall as if moving in air towards us tall angels of darkness advancing steadily over us all   rondeau of a conscientious objector  the hours have tumbled their leaden mono   tonous sands and piled them up in a dull grey heap in the   west i carry my patience sullenly through the waste lands tomorrow will pour them all back the dull hours i   detest  i force my cart through the sodden filth that is pressed into ooze and the sombre dirt spouts up at my hands as i make my way in twilight now to rest the hours have tumbled their leaden monotonous   sands  a twisted thorntree still in the evening stands defending the memory of leaves and the happy round   nest but mud has flooded the homes of these weary lands and piled them up in a dull grey heap in the west  all day has the clank of iron on iron distressed the nervebare place now a little silence expands and a gasp of relief but the soul is still compressed i carry my patience sullenly through the waste lands  the hours have ceased to fall and a star commands shadows to cover our stricken manhood and blest sleep to make us forget but he understands tomorrow will pour them all back the dull hours   i detest   tommies in the train  the sun shines the coltsfoot flowers along the railway banks shine like flat coin which jove in thanks strews each side the lines  a steeple in purple elms daffodils sparkle beneath luminous hills beyondand no people  england oh danaë to this spring of cosmic gold that falls on your lap of mould what then are we  what are we claycoloured who roll in fatigue as the train falls league by league from our destiny  a hand is over my face a cold hand i peep between the fingers to watch the world that lingers behind yet keeps pace  always there as i peep between the fingers that cover my face which then is it that falls from its place and rolls down the steep  is it the train that falls like meteorite backward into space to alight never again  or is it the illusory world that falls from reality as we look or are we like a thunderbolt hurled  one or another is lost since we fall apart endlessly in one motion depart from each other   warbaby  the child like mustardseed rolls out of the husk of death    into the womans fertile fathomless lap  look it has taken root see how it flourisheth    see how it rises with magical rosy sap  as for our faith it was there when we did not know did not care    it fell from our husk like a little hasty seed  sing it is all we need sing for the little weed    will flourish its branches in heaven when we      slumber beneath   nostalgia  the waning moon looks upward this    grey night slopes round the heavens in one smooth curve of easy sailing odd red wicks serve to show where the ships at sea move out of sight  the place is palpable me for here i was born of this selfsame darkness yet the shadowy house    below is out of bounds and only the old ghosts know i have come i feel them whimper in welcome and    mourn  my father suddenly died in the harvesting corn and the place is no longer ours watching i hear no sound from the strangers the place is dark and fear opens my eyes till the roots of my vision seems torn  can i go no nearer never towards the door the ghosts and i we mourn together and shrink in the shadow of the cartshed must we hover on    the brink forever and never enter the homestead any more  is it irrevocable can i really not go through the open yardway can i not go past the    sheds and through to the mowieonly the dead in their    beds can know the fearful anguish that this is so  i kiss the stones i kiss the moss on the wall and wish i could pass impregnate into the place i wish i could take it all in a last embrace i wish with my breast i here could annihilate it all    here   ends    bay   a   book   of    poems   by  d h lawrence  the  cover and the decorations   designed by anne estelle rice the typography    and binding arranged  by  cyril w
