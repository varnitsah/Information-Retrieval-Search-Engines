17923094	little travels and roadside sketches   by william makepeace thackeray aka titmarsh     i from richmond in surrey to brussels in belgium  ii ghentbruges  ghent 1840  bruges  iii waterloo     little travels and roadside sketches     ifrom richmond in surrey to brussels in belgium      i quitted the rose cottage hotel at richmond one of the comfortablest quietest cheapest neatest little inns in england and a thousand times preferable in my opinion to the star and garter whither if you go alone a sneering waiter with his hair curled frightens you off the premises and where if you are bold enough to brave the sneering waiter you have to pay ten shillings for a bottle of claret and whence if you look out of the window you gaze on a view which is so rich that it seems to knock you down with its splendora view that has its hair curled like the swaggering waiter i say i quitted the rose cottage hotel with deep regret believing that i should see nothing so pleasant as its gardens and its veal cutlets and its dear little bowlinggreen elsewhere but the time comes when people must go out of town and so i got on the top of the omnibus and the carpetbag was put inside   if i were a great prince and rode outside of coaches as i should if i were a great prince i would whether i smoked or not have a case of the best havanas in my pocketnot for my own smoking but to give them to the snobs on the coach who smoke the vilest cheroots they poison the air with the odor of their filthy weeds a man at all easy in his circumstances would spare himself much annoyance by taking the above simple precaution  a gentleman sitting behind me tapped me on the back and asked for a light he was a footman or rather valet he had no livery but the three friends who accompanied him were tall men in pepperandsalt undress jackets with a dukes coronet on their buttons  after tapping me on the back and when he had finished his cheroot the gentleman produced another windinstrument which he called a kinopium a sort of trumpet on which he showed a great inclination to play he began puffing out of the kinopium a most abominable air which he said was the dukes march it was played by particular request of one of the pepperandsalt gentry  the noise was so abominable that even the coachman objected although my friends brother footmen were ravished with it and said that it was not allowed to play toons on his bus very well said the valet were only of the duke of bs establishment thats all the coachman could not resist that appeal to his fashionable feelings the valet was allowed to play his infernal kinopium and the poor fellow the coachman who had lived in some private families was quite anxious to conciliate the footmen of the duke of bs establishment thats all and told several stories of his having been groom in captain hoskinss family nephew of governor hoskins which stories the footmen received with great contempt  the footmen were like the rest of the fashionable world in this respect i felt for my part that i respected them they were in daily communication with a duke they were not the rose but they had lived beside it there is an odor in the english aristocracy which intoxicates plebeians i am sure that any commoner in england though he would die rather than confess it would have a respect for those great big hulking dukes footmen  the day before her grace the duchess had passed us alone in a chariotandfour with two outriders what better mark of innate superiority could man want here was a slim lady who required foursix horses to herself and four servants kinopium was no doubt one of the number to guard her  we were sixteen inside and out and had consequently an eighth of a horse apiece  a duchess  6 a commoner  18 that is to say  1 duchess  48 commoners  if i were a duchess of the present day i would say to the duke my noble husband my dearest grace i think when i travel alone in my chariot from hammersmith to london i will not care for the outriders in these days when there is so much poverty and so much disaffection in the country we should not eclabousser the canaille with the sight of our preposterous prosperity  but this is very likely only plebeian envy and i dare say if i were a lovely duchess of the realm i would ride in a coachandsix with a coronet on the top of my bonnet and a robe of velvet and ermine even in the dogdays  alas these are the dogdays many dogs are abroadsnarling dogs biting dogs envious dogs mad dogs beware of exciting the fury of such with your flaming red velvet and dazzling ermine it makes ragged lazarus doubly hungry to see dives feasting in clothofgold and so if i were a beauteous duchess    silence vain man can the queen herself make you a duchess be content then nor gibe at thy betters of the duke of bs establishment thats all   on board the antwerpen off everywhere  we have bidden adieu to billingsgate we have passed the thames tunnel it is one oclock and of course people are thinking of being hungry what a merry place a steamer is on a calm sunny summer forenoon and what an appetite every one seems to have we are i assure you no less than 170 noblemen and gentlemen together pacing up and down under the awning or lolling on the sofas in the cabin and hardly have we passed greenwich when the feeding begins the company was at the brandy and sodawater in an instant there is a sort of legend that the beverage is a preservative against seasickness and i admired the penetration of gentlemen who partook of the drink in the first place the steward will put so much brandy into the tumbler that it is fit to choke you and secondly the sodawater being kept as near as possible to the boiler of the engine is of a fine wholesome heat when presented to the hot and thirsty traveller thus he is prevented from catching any sudden cold which might be dangerous to him  the forepart of the vessel is crowded to the full as much as the genteeler quarter there are four carriages each with piles of imperials and aristocratic gimcracks of travel under the wheels of which those personages have to clamber who have a mind to look at the bowsprit and perhaps to smoke a cigar at ease the carriages overcome you find yourself confronted by a huge penful of durham oxen lying on hay and surrounded by a barricade of oars fifteen of these horned monsters maintain an incessant mooing and bellowing beyond the cows come a heap of cottonbags beyond the cottonbags more carriages more pyramids of travelling trunks and valets and couriers bustling and swearing round about them and already and in various corners and niches lying on coils of rope black tarcloths ragged cloaks or hay you see a score of those dubious forecabin passengers who are never shaved who always look unhappy and appear getting ready to be sick  at one dinner begins in the aftercabinboiled salmon boiled beef boiled mutton boiled cabbage boiled potatoes and parboiled wine for any gentlemen who like it and two roastducks between seventy after this knobs of cheese are handed round on a plate and there is a talk of a tart somewhere at some end of the table all this i saw peeping through a sort of meatsafe which ventilates the top of the cabin and very happy and hot did the people seem below  how the deuce can people dine at such an hour say several genteel fellows who are watching the manoeuvres i cant touch a morsel before seven  but somehow at halfpast three oclock we had dropped a long way down the river the air was delightfully fresh the sky of a faultless cobalt the river shining and flashing like quicksilver and at this period steward runs against me bearing two great smoking dishes covered by two great glistening hemispheres of tin fellow says i whats that  he lifted up the cover it was ducks and green pease by jingo  what havent they done yet the greedy creatures i asked have the people been feeding for three hours  law bless you sir its the second dinner make haste or you wont get a place at which words a genteel party with whom i had been conversing instantly tumbled down the hatchway and i find myself one of the second relay of seventy who are attacking the boiled salmon boiled beef boiled cabbage c as for the ducks i certainly had some pease very fine yellow stiff pease that ought to have been split before they were boiled but with regard to the ducks i saw the animals gobbled up before my eyes by an old widow lady and her party just as i was shrieking to the steward to bring a knife and fork to carve them the fellow i mean the widow ladys whiskered companioni saw him eat pease with the very knife with which he had dissected the duck  after dinner as i need not tell the keen observer of human nature who peruses this the human mind if the body be in a decent state expands into gayety and benevolence and the intellect longs to measure itself in friendly converse with the divers intelligences around it we ascend upon deck and after eying each other for a brief space and with a friendly modest hesitation we begin anon to converse about the weather and other profound and delightful themes of english discourse we confide to each other our respective opinions of the ladies round about us look at that charming creature in a pink bonnet and a dress of the pattern of a kilmarnock snuffbox a stalwart irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very agreeable into her ear as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation for her dark eyes kindle her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves and glance brightly in the sun while round the teeth and the lips a number of lovely dimples make their appearance and her whole countenance assumes a look of perfect health and happiness see her companion in shot silk and a dovecolored parasol in what a graceful watteaulike attitude she reclines the tall courier who has been bouncing about the deck in attendance upon these ladies it is his first day of service and he is eager to make a favorable impression on them and the ladysmaids too has just brought them from the carriage a small paper of sweet cakes nothing is prettier than to see a pretty woman eating sweet biscuits and a bottle that evidently contains malmsey madeira how daintily they sip it how happy they seem how that lucky rogue of an irishman prattles away yonder is a noble group indeed an english gentleman and his family children mother grandmother grownup daughters father and domestics twentytwo in all they have a table to themselves on the deck and the consumption of eatables among them is really endless the nurses have been bustling to and fro and bringing first slices of cake then dinner then tea with huge family jugs of milk and the little people have been playing hideandseek round the deck coquetting with the other children and making friends of every soul on board i love to see the kind eyes of women fondly watching them as they gambol about a female face be it ever so plain when occupied in regarding children becomes celestial almost and a man can hardly fail to be good and happy while he is looking on at such sights ah sir says a great big man whom you would not accuse of sentiment i have a couple of those little things at home and he stops and heaves a great big sigh and swallows down a halftumbler of cold something and water we know what the honest fellow means well enough he is saying to himself god bless my girls and their mother but being a briton is too manly to speak out in a more intelligible way perhaps it is as well for him to be quiet and not chatter and gesticulate like those frenchmen a few yards from him who are chirping over a bottle of champagne  there is as you may fancy a number of such groups on the deck and a pleasant occupation it is for a lonely man to watch them and build theories upon them and examine those two personages seated cheek by jowl one is an english youth travelling for the first time who has been hard at his guidebook during the whole journey he has a manuel du voyageur in his pocket a very pretty amusing little oblong work it is too and might be very useful if the foreign people in three languages among whom you travel would but give the answers set down in the book or understand the questions you put to them out of it the other honest gentleman in the fur cap what can his occupation be we know him at once for what he is sir says he in a fine german accent i am a brofessor of languages and will gif you lessons in danish swedish english bortuguese spanish and bersian thus occupied in meditations the rapid hours and the rapid steamer pass quickly on the sun is sinking and as he drops the ingenious luminary sets the thames on fire several worthy gentlemen watch in hand are eagerly examining the phenomena attending his disappearancerich clouds of purple and gold that form the curtains of his bedlittle barks that pass black across his disc his disc every instant dropping nearer and nearer into the water there he goes says one sagacious observer no he doesnt cries another now he is gone and the steward is already threading the deck asking the passengers right and left if they will take a little supper what a grand object is a sunset and what a wonder is an appetite at sea lo the horned moon shines pale over margate and the red beacon is gleaming from distant ramsgate pier    a great rush is speedily made for the mattresses that lie in the boat at the ships side and as the night is delightfully calm many fair ladies and worthy men determine to couch on deck for the night the proceedings of the former especially if they be young and pretty the philosopher watches with indescribable emotion and interest what a number of pretty coquetries do the ladies perform and into what pretty attitudes do they take care to fall all the little children have been gathered up by the nurserymaids and are taken down to roost below balmy sleep seals the eyes of many tired wayfarers as you see in the case of the russian nobleman asleep among the portmanteaus and titmarsh who has been walking the deck for some time with a great mattress on his shoulders knowing full well that were he to relinquish it for an instant some other person would seize on it now stretches his bed upon the deck wraps his cloak about his knees draws his white cotton nightcap tight over his head and ears and as the smoke of his cigar rises calmly upwards to the deep sky and the cheerful twinkling stars he feels himself exquisitely happy and thinks of thee my juliana    why people because they are in a steamboat should get up so deucedly early i cannot understand gentlemen have been walking over my legs ever since three oclock this morning and no doubt have been indulging in personalities which i hate regarding my appearance and manner of sleeping lying snoring let the wags laugh on but a far pleasanter occupation is to sleep until breakfasttime or near it  the tea and ham and eggs which with a beefsteak or two and three or four rounds of toast form the component parts of the abovenamed elegant meal are taken in the river scheldt little neat plumplooking churches and villages are rising here and there among tufts of trees and pastures that are wonderfully green to the right as the guidebook says is walcheren and on the left cadsand memorable for the english expedition of 1809 when lord chatham sir walter manny and henry earl of derby at the head of the english gained a great victory over the flemish mercenaries in the pay of philippe of valois the clothyard shafts of the english archers did great execution flushing was taken and lord chatham returned to england where he distinguished himself greatly in the debates on the american war which he called the brightest jewel of the british crown you see my love that though an artist by profession my education has by no means been neglected and what indeed would be the pleasure of travel unless these charming historical recollections were brought to bear upon it   antwerp  as many hundreds of thousands of english visit this city i have met at least a hundred of them in this halfhour walking the streets guidebook in hand and as the ubiquitous murray has already depicted the place there is no need to enter into a long description of it its neatness its beauty and its stiff antique splendor the tall pale houses have many of them crimped gables that look like queen elizabeths ruffs there are as many people in the streets as in london at three oclock in the morning the marketwomen wear bonnets of a flowerpot shape and have shining brazen milkpots which are delightful to the eyes of a painter along the quays of the lazy scheldt are innumerable goodnatured groups of beerdrinkers smallbeer is the most goodnatured drink in the world along the barriers outside of the town and by the glistening canals are more beershops and more beerdrinkers the city is defended by the queerest fat military the chief traffic is between the hotels and the railroad the hotels give wonderful good dinners and especially at the grand laboureur may be mentioned a peculiar tart which is the best of all tarts that ever a man ate since he was ten years old a moonlight walk is delightful at ten oclock the whole city is quiet and so little changed does it seem to be that you may walk back three hundred years into time and fancy yourself a majestical spaniard or an oppressed and patriotic dutchman at your leisure you enter the inn and the old quentin durward courtyard on which the old towers look down there is a sound of singingsinging at midnight is it don sombrero who is singing an andalusian seguidilla under the window of the flemish burgomasters daughter ah no it is a fat englishman in a zephyr coat he is drinking cold ginandwater in the moonlight and warbling softly       nix my dolly pals fake away      nix my dolly pals fake aaway         in 1844  i wish the good people would knock off the top part of antwerp cathedral spire nothing can be more gracious and elegant than the lines of the first two compartments but near the top there bulges out a little round ugly vulgar dutch monstrosity for which the architects have no doubt a name which offends the eye cruelly take the apollo and set upon him a bobwig and a little cocked hat imagine god save the king ending with a jig fancy a polonaise or procession of slim stately elegant court beauties headed by a buffoon dancing a hornpipe marshal gerard should have discharged a bombshell at that abomination and have given the noble steeple a chance to be finished in the grand style of the early fifteenth century in which it was begun  this style of criticism is base and mean and quite contrary to the orders of the immortal goethe who was only for allowing the eye to recognize the beauties of a great work but would have its defects passed over it is an unhappy luckless organization which will be perpetually faultfinding and in the midst of a grand concert of music will persist only in hearing that unfortunate fiddle out of tune  withinexcept where the rococo architects have introduced their ornaments here is the fiddle out of tune againthe cathedral is noble a rich tender sunshine is streaming in through the windows and gilding the stately edifice with the purest light the admirable stainedglass windows are not too brilliant in their colors the organ is playing a rich solemn music some two hundred of people are listening to the service and there is scarce one of the women kneeling on her chair enveloped in her full majestic black drapery that is not a fine study for a painter these large black mantles of heavy silk brought over the heads of the women and covering their persons fall into such fine folds of drapery that they cannot help being picturesque and noble see kneeling by the side of two of those fine devoutlooking figures is a lady in a little twiddling parisian hat and feather in a little lace mantelet in a tight gown and a bustle she is almost as monstrous as yonder figure of the virgin in a hoop and with a huge crown and a ball and a sceptre and a bambino dressed in a little hoop and in a little crown round which are clustered flowers and pots of orangetrees and before which many of the faithful are at prayer gentle clouds of incense come wafting through the vast edifice and in the lulls of the music you hear the faint chant of the priest and the silver tinkle of the bell  six englishmen with the commissionaires and the murrays guidebooks in their hands are looking at the descent from the cross of this picture the guidebook gives you orders how to judge if it is the end of religious painting to express the religious sentiment a hundred of inferior pictures must rank before rubens who was ever piously affected by any picture of the master he can depict a livid thief writhing upon the cross sometimes a blond magdalen weeping below it but it is a magdalen a very short time indeed after her repentance her yellow brocades and flaring satins are still those which she wore when she was of the world her body has not yet lost the marks of the feasting and voluptuousness in which she used to indulge according to the legend not one of the rubenss pictures among all the scores that decorate chapels and churches here has the least tendency to purify to touch the affections or to awaken the feelings of religious respect and wonder the descent from the cross is vast gloomy and awful but the awe inspired by it is as i take it altogether material he might have painted a picture of any criminal broken on the wheel and the sensation inspired by it would have been precisely similar nor in a religious picture do you want the savoirfaire of the master to be always protruding itself it detracts from the feeling of reverence just as the thumping of cushion and the spouting of tawdry oratory does from a sermon meek religion disappears shouldered out of the desk by the pompous stalwart bigchested freshcolored bushywhiskered pulpiteer rubenss piety has always struck us as of this sort if he takes a pious subject it is to show you in what a fine way he peter paul rubens can treat it he never seems to doubt but that he is doing it a great honor his descent from the cross and its accompanying wings and cover are a set of puns upon the word christopher of which the taste is more odious than that of the hoopedpetticoated virgin yonder with her artificial flowers and her rings and brooches the people who made an offering of that hooped petticoat did their best at any rate they knew no better there is humility in that simple quaint present trustfulness and kind intention looking about at other altars you see much to the horror of pious protestants all sorts of queer little emblems hanging up under little pyramids of penny candles that are sputtering and flaring there here you have a silver arm or a little gold toe or a wax leg or a gilt eye signifying and commemorating cures that have been performed by the supposed intercession of the saint over whose chapel they hang well although they are abominable superstitions yet these queer little offerings seem to me to be a great deal more pious than rubenss big pictures just as is the widow with her poor little mite compared to the swelling pharisee who flings his purse of gold into the plate  a couple of days of rubens and his church pictures makes one thoroughly and entirely sick of him his very genius and splendor pails upon one even taking the pictures as worldly pictures one grows weary of being perpetually feasted with this rich coarse steaming food considering them as church pictures i dont want to go to church to hear however splendid an organ play the british grenadiers   the antwerpians have set up a clumsy bronze statue of their divinity in a square of the town and those who have not enough of rubens in the churches may study him and indeed to much greater advantage in a good welllighted museum here there is one picture a dying saint taking the communion a large piece ten or eleven feet high and painted in an incredibly short space of time which is extremely curious indeed for the painters study the picture is scarcely more than an immense magnificent sketch but it tells the secret of the artists manner which in the midst of its dash and splendor is curiously methodical where the shadows are warm the lights are cold and vice versa and the picture has been so rapidly painted that the tints lie raw by the side of one another the artist not having taken the trouble to blend them  there are two exquisite vandykes whatever sir joshua may say of them and in which the very management of the gray tones which the president abuses forms the principal excellence and charm why after all are we not to have our opinion sir joshua is not the pope the color of one of those vandykes is as fine as fine paul veronese and the sentiment beautifully tender and graceful  i saw too an exhibition of the modern belgian artists 1843 the remembrance of whose pictures after a months absence has almost entirely vanished wapperss hand as i thought seemed to have grown old and feeble verboeckhovens cattlepieces are almost as good as paul potters and keyser has dwindled down into nambypamby prettiness pitiful to see in the gallant young painter who astonished the louvre artists ten years ago by a hand almost as dashing and ready as that of rubens himself there were besides many caricatures of the new german school which are in themselves caricatures of the masters before raphael   an instance of honesty may be mentioned here with applause the writer lost a pocketbook containing a passport and a couple of modest tenpound notes the person who found the portfolio ingeniously put it into the box of the postoffice and it was faithfully restored to the owner but somehow the two tenpound notes were absent it was however a great comfort to get the passport and the pocketbook which must be worth about ninepence   brussels  it was night when we arrived by the railroad from antwerp at brussels the route is very pretty and interesting and the flat countries through which the road passes in the highest state of peaceful smiling cultivation the fields by the roadside are enclosed by hedges as in england the harvest was in part down and an english country gentleman who was of our party pronounced the crops to be as fine as any he had ever seen of this matter a cockney cannot judge accurately but any man can see with what extraordinary neatness and care all these little plots of ground are tilled and admire the richness and brilliancy of the vegetation outside of the moat of antwerp and at every village by which we passed it was pleasant to see the happy congregations of wellclad people that basked in the evening sunshine and soberly smoked their pipes and drank their flemish beer men who love this drink must as i fancy have something essentially peaceful in their composition and must be more easily satisfied than folks on our side of the water the excitement of flemish beer is indeed not great i have tried both the white beer and the brown they are both of the kind which schoolboys denominate swipes very sour and thin to the taste but served to be sure in quaint flemish jugs that do not seem to have changed their form since the days of rubens and must please the lovers of antiquarian knickknacks numbers of comfortablelooking women and children sat beside the head of the family upon the tavernbenches and it was amusing to see one little fellow of eight years old smoking with much gravity his fathers cigar how the worship of the sacred plant of tobacco has spread through all europe i am sure that the persons who cry out against the use of it are guilty of superstition and unreason and that it would be a proper and easy task for scientific persons to write an encomium upon the weed in solitude it is the pleasantest companion possible and in company never de trop to a student it suggests all sorts of agreeable thoughts it refreshes the brain when weary and every sedentary cigarsmoker will tell you how much good he has had from it and how he has been able to return to his labor after a quarter of an hours mild interval of the delightful leaf of havana drinking has gone from among us since smoking came in it is a wicked error to say that smokers are drunkards drink they do but of gentle diluents mostly for fierce stimulants of wine or strong liquors are abhorrent to the real lover of the indian weed ah my juliana join not in the vulgar cry that is raised against us cigars and cool drinks beget quiet conversations goodhumor meditation not hot blood such as mounts into the head of drinkers of apoplectic port or dangerous claret are we not more moral and reasonable than our forefathers indeed i think so somewhat and many improvements of social life and converse must date with the introduction of the pipe  we were a dozen tobaccoconsumers in the wagon of the train that brought us from antwerp nor did the women of the party sensible women make a single objection to the fumigation but enough of this only let me add in conclusion that an excellent israelitish gentleman mr hartog of antwerp supplies cigars for a penny apiece such as are not to be procured in london for four times the sum  through smiling cornfields then and by little woods from which rose here and there the quaint peaked towers of some oldfashioned chateaux our train went smoking along at thirty miles an hour we caught a glimpse of mechlin steeple at first dark against the sunset and afterwards bright as we came to the other side of it and admired long glistening canals or moats that surrounded the queer old town and were lighted up in that wonderful way which the sun only understands and not even mr turner with all his vermilion and gamboge can put down on canvas the verdure was everywhere astonishing and we fancied we saw many golden cuyps as we passed by these quiet pastures  steamengines and their accompaniments blazing forges gaunt manufactories with numberless windows and long black chimneys of course take away from the romance of the place but as we whirled into brussels even these engines had a fine appearance three or four of the snorting galloping monsters had just finished their journey and there was a quantity of flaming ashes lying under the brazen bellies of each that looked properly lurid and demoniacal the men at the station came out with flaming torchesawfullooking fellows indeed presently the different baggage was handed out and in the very worst vehicle i ever entered and at the very slowest pace we were borne to the hotel de suede from which house of entertainment this letter is written  we strolled into the town but though the night was excessively fine and it was not yet eleven oclock the streets of the little capital were deserted and the handsome blazing cafes round about the theatres contained no inmates ah what a pretty sight is the parisian boulevard on a night like this how many pleasant hours has one passed in watching the lights and the hum and the stir and the laughter of those happy idle people there was none of this gayety here nor was there a person to be found except a skulking commissioner or two whose real name in french is that of a fish that is eaten with fennelsauce and who offered to conduct us to certain curiosities in the town what must we english not have done that in every town in europe we are to be fixed upon by scoundrels of this sort and what a pretty reflection it is on our country that such rascals find the means of living on us   early the next morning we walked through a number of streets in the place and saw certain sights the park is very pretty and all the buildings round about it have an air of neatnessalmost of stateliness the houses are tall the streets spacious and the roads extremely clean in the park is a little theatre a cafe somewhat ruinous a little palace for the king of this little kingdom some smart public buildings with s p q b emblazoned on them at which pompous inscription one cannot help laughing and other rows of houses somewhat resembling a little rue de rivoli whether from my own natural greatness and magnanimity or from that handsome share of national conceit that every englishman possesses my impressions of this city are certainly anything but respectful it has an absurd kind of lilliput look with it there are soldiers just as in paris better dressed and doing a vast deal of drumming and bustle and yet somehow far from being frightened at them i feel inclined to laugh in their faces there are little ministers who work at their little bureaux and to read the journals how fierce they are a great thundering times could hardly talk more big one reads about the rascally ministers the miserable opposition the designs of tyrants the eyes of europe c just as one would in real journals the moniteur of ghent belabors the independent of brussels the independent falls foul of the lynx and really it is difficult not to suppose sometimes that these worthy people are in earnest and yet how happy were they sua si bona norint think what a comfort it would be to belong to a little state like this not to abuse their privilege but philosophically to use it if i were a belgian i would not care one single fig about politics i would not read thundering leadingarticles i would not have an opinion whats the use of an opinion here happy fellows do not the french the english and the prussians spare them the trouble of thinking and make all their opinions for them think of living in a country free easy respectable wealthy and with the nuisance of talking politics removed from out of it all this might the belgians have and a part do they enjoy but not the best part no these people will be brawling and by the ears and parties run as high here as at stoke pogis or little pedlington  these sentiments were elicited by the reading of a paper at the cafe in the park where we sat under the trees for a while and sipped our cool lemonade numbers of statues decorate the place the very worst i ever saw these cupids must have been erected in the time of the dutch dynasty as i judge from the immense posterior developments indeed the arts of the country are very low the statues here and the lions before the prince of oranges palace would disgrace almost the figurehead of a ship  of course we paid our visit to this little lion of brussels the princes palace i mean the architecture of the building is admirably simple and firm and you remark about it and all other works here a high finish in doors woodworks paintings c that one does not see in france where the buildings are often rather sketched than completed and the artist seems to neglect the limbs as it were and extremities of his figures  the finish of this little place is exquisite we went through some dozen of staterooms paddling along over the slippery floors of inlaid woods in great slippers without which we must have come to the ground how did his royal highness the prince of orange manage when he lived here and her imperial highness the princess and their excellencies the chamberlains and the footmen they must have been on their tails many times a day thats certain and must have cut queer figures  the ballroom is beautifulall marble and yet with a comfortable cheerful look the other apartments are not less agreeable and the people looked with intense satisfaction at some great lapislazuli tables which the guide informed us were worth four millions more or less adding with a very knowing look that they were un peu plus cher que lor this speech has a tremendous effect on visitors and when we met some of our steamboat companions in the park or elsewherein so small a place as this one falls in with them a dozen times a dayhave you seen the tables was the general question prodigious tables are they indeed fancy a table my deara table four feet widea table with legs ye heavens the mind can hardly picture to itself anything so beautiful and so tremendous  there are some good pictures in the palace too but not so extraordinarily good as the guidebooks and the guide would have us to think the latter like most men of his class is an ignoramus who showed us an andrea del sarto copy or original and called it a correggio and made other blunders of a like nature as is the case in england you are hurried through the rooms without being allowed time to look at the pictures and consequently to pronounce a satisfactory judgment on them  in the museum more time was granted me and i spent some hours with pleasure there it is an absurd little gallery absurdly imitating the louvre with just such compartments and pillars as you see in the noble paris gallery only here the pillars and capitals are stucco and white in place of marble and gold and plasterofparis busts of great belgians are placed between the pillars an artist of the country has made a picture containing them and you will be ashamed of your ignorance when you hear many of their names old tilly of magdeburg figures in one corner rubens the endless rubens stands in the midst what a noble countenance it is and what a manly swaggering consciousness of power  the picture to see here is a portrait by the great peter paul of one of the governesses of the netherlands it is just the finest portrait that ever was seen only a halflength but such a majesty such a force such a splendor such a simplicity about it the woman is in a stiff black dress with a ruff and a few pearls a yellow curtain is behind herthe simplest arrangement that can be conceived but this great man knew how to rise to his occasion and no better proof can be shown of what a fine gentleman he was than this his homage to the vicequeen a common bungler would have painted her in her best clothes with crown and sceptre just as our queen has been painted bybut comparisons are odious here stands this majestic woman in her everyday workingdress of black satin looking your hat off as it were another portrait of the same personage hangs elsewhere in the gallery and it is curious to observe the difference between the two and see how a man of genius paints a portrait and how a common limner executes it  many more pictures are there here by rubens or rather from rubenss manufactoryodious and vulgar most of them are fat magdalens coarse saints vulgar virgins with the scenepainters tricks far too evident upon the canvas by the side of one of the most astonishing colorpieces in the world the worshipping of the magi is a famous picture of paul veronese that cannot be too much admired as rubens sought in the first picture to dazzle and astonish by gorgeous variety paul in his seems to wish to get his effect by simplicity and has produced the most noble harmony that can be conceived many more works are there that merit noticea singularly clever brilliant and odious jordaens for example some curious costumepieces one or two works by the belgian raphael who was a very belgian raphael indeed and a long gallery of pictures of the very oldest school that doubtless afford much pleasure to the amateurs of ancient art i confess that i am inclined to believe in very little that existed before the time of raphael there is for instance the prince of oranges picture by perugino very pretty indeed up to a certain point but all the heads are repeated all the drawing is bad and affected and this very badness and affectation is what the socalled catholic school is always anxious to imitate nothing can be more juvenile or paltry than the works of the native belgians here exhibited tin crowns are suspended over many of them showing that the pictures are prize compositions and pretty things indeed they are have you ever read an oxford prizepoem well these pictures are worse even than the oxford poemsan awful assertion to make  in the matter of eating dear sir which is the next subject of the fine arts a subject that after many hours walking attracts a gentleman very much let me attempt to recall the transactions of this very day at the tabledhote 1 green peasoup 2 boiled salmon 3 mussels 4 crimped skate 5 roastmeat 6 patties 7 melons 8 carp stewed with mushrooms and onions 9 roastturkey 10 cauliflower and butter 11 fillets of venison piques with asafoetida sauce 12 stewed calfsear 13 roastveal 14 roastlamb 15 stewed cherries 16 ricepudding 17 gruyere cheese and about twentyfour cakes of different kinds except 5 13 and 14 i give you my word i ate of all written down here with three rolls of bread and a score of potatoes what is the meaning of it how is the stomach of man to be brought to desire and to receive all this quantity do not gastronomists complain of heaviness in london after eating a couple of muttonchops do not respectable gentlemen fall asleep in their armchairs are they fit for mental labor far from it but look at the difference here after dinner here one is as light as a gossamer one walks with pleasure reads with pleasure writes with pleasurenay there is the supperbell going at ten oclock and plenty of eaters too let lord mayors and aldermen look to it this fact of the extraordinary increase of appetite in belgium and instead of steaming to blackwall come a little further to antwerp  of ancient architectures in the place there is a fine old port de halle which has a tall gloomy bastille look a most magnificent townhall that has been sketched a thousand of times and opposite it a building that i think would be the very model for a conservative clubhouse in london oh how charming it would be to be a great painter and give the character of the building and the numberless groups round about it the booths lighted up by the sun the marketwomen in their gowns of brilliant hue each group having a character and telling its little story the troops of men lolling in all sorts of admirable attitudes of ease round the great lamp half a dozen lightblue dragoons are lounging about and peeping over the artist as the drawing is made and the sky is more bright and blue than one sees it in a hundred years in london  the priests of the country are a remarkably wellfed and respectable race without that scowling hangdog look which one has remarked among reverend gentlemen in the neighboring country of france their reverences wear buckles to their shoes lightblue neckcloths and huge threecornered hats in good condition today strolling by the cathedral i heard the tinkling of a bell in the street and beheld certain persons male and female suddenly plump down on their knees before a little procession that was passing two men in black held a tawdry red canopy a priest walked beneath it holding the sacrament covered with a cloth and before him marched a couple of little altarboys in short white surplices such as you see in rubens and holding lacquered lamps a small train of streetboys followed the procession cap in hand and the clergyman finally entered a hospital for old women near the church the canopy and the lampbearers remaining without  it was a touching scene and as i stayed to watch it i could not but think of the poor old soul who was dying within listening to the last words of prayer led by the hand of the priest to the brink of the black fathomless grave how bright the sun was shining without all the time and how happy and careless every thing around us looked   the duke darenberg has a picturegallery worthy of his princely house it does not contain great pieces but titbits of pictures such as suit an aristocratic epicure for such persons a great huge canvas is too much it is like sitting down alone to a roasted ox and they do wisely i think to patronize small highflavored delicate morceaux such as the duke has here  among them may be mentioned with special praise a magnificent small rembrandt a paul potter of exceeding minuteness and beauty an ostade which reminds one of wilkies early performances and a dusart quite as good as ostade there is a berghem much more unaffected than that artists works generally are and what is more precious in the eyes of many ladies as an object of art there is in one of the grand saloons some needlework done by the dukes own grandmother which is looked at with awe by those admitted to see the palace  the chief curiosity if not the chief ornament of a very elegant library filled with vases and bronzes is a marble head supposed to be the original head of the laocoon it is unquestionably a finer head than that which at present figures upon the shoulders of the famous statue the expression of woe is more manly and intense in the group as we know it the head of the principal figure has always seemed to me to be a grimace of grief as are the two accompanying young gentlemen with their pretty attitudes and their little silly openmouthed despondency it has always had upon me the effect of a trick that statue and not of a piece of true art it would look well in the vista of a garden it is not august enough for a temple with all its jerks and twirls and polite convulsions but who knows what susceptibilities such a confession may offend let us say no more about the laocoon nor its head nor its tail the duke was offered its weight in gold they say for this head and refused it would be a shame to speak ill of such a treasure but i have my opinion of the man who made the offer  in the matter of sculpture almost all the brussels churches are decorated with the most laborious wooden pulpits which may be worth their weight in gold too for what i know including his reverence preaching inside at st gudule the preacher mounts into no less a place than the garden of eden being supported by adam and eve by sin and death and numberless other animals he walks up to his desk by a rustic railing of flowers fruits and vegetables with wooden peacocks paroquets monkeys biting apples and many more of the birds and beasts of the field in another church the clergyman speaks from out a hermitage in a third from a carved palmtree which supports a set of oak clouds that form the canopy of the pulpit and are indeed not much heavier in appearance than so many huge sponges a priest however tall or stout must be lost in the midst of all these queer gimcracks in order to be consistent they ought to dress him up too in some odd fantastical suit i can fancy the cure of meudon preaching out of such a place or the rev sydney smith or that famous clergyman of the time of the league who brought all paris to laugh and listen to him   but let us not be too supercilious and ready to sneer it is only bad taste it may have been very true devotion which erected these strange edifices     iighentbruges   ghent 1840   the beguine college or village is one of the most extraordinary sights that all europe can show on the confines of the town of ghent you come upon an oldfashioned brick gate that seems as if it were one of the city barriers but on passing it one of the prettiest sights possible meets the eye at the porters lodge you see an old lady in black and a white hood occupied over her book before you is a red church with a tall roof and fantastical dutch pinnacles and all around it rows upon rows of small houses the queerest neatest nicest that ever were seen a dolls house is hardly smaller or prettier right and left on each side of little alleys these little mansions rise they have a courtlet before them in which some green plants or hollyhocks are growing and to each house is a gate that has mostly a picture or queercarved ornament upon or about it and bears the name not of the beguine who inhabits it but of the saint to whom she may have devoted itthe house of st stephen the house of st donatus the english or angel convent and so on old ladies in black are pacing in the quiet alleys here and there and drop the stranger a curtsy as he passes them and takes off his hat never were such patterns of neatness seen as these old ladies and their houses i peeped into one or two of the chambers of which the windows were open to the pleasant evening sun and saw beds scrupulously plain a quaint old chair or two and little pictures of favorite saints decorating the spotless white walls the old ladies kept up a quick cheerful clatter as they paused to gossip at the gates of their little domiciles and with a great deal of artifice and lurking behind walls and looking at the church as if i intended to design that i managed to get a sketch of a couple of them   but what white paper can render the whiteness of their linen what black ink can do justice to the lustre of their gowns and shoes both of the ladies had a neat ankle and a tight stocking and i fancy that heaven is quite as well served in this costume as in the dress of a scowling stockingless friar whom i had seen passing just before the look and dress of the man made me shudder his great red feet were bound up in a shoe open at the toes a kind of compromise for a sandal i had just seen him and his brethren at the dominican church where a mass of music was sung and orangetrees flags and banners decked the aisle of the church  one begins to grow sick of these churches and the hideous exhibitions of bodily agonies that are depicted on the sides of all the chapels into one wherein we went this morning was what they called a calvary a horrible ghastly image of a christ in a tomb the figure of the natural size and of the livid color of death gaping red wounds on the body and round the brows the whole piece enough to turn one sick and fit only to brutalize the beholder of it the virgin is commonly represented with a dozen swords stuck in her heart bleeding throats of headless john baptists are perpetually thrust before your eyes at the cathedral gate was a papiermache churchornament shopmost of the carvings and reliefs of the same dismal character one for instance represented a heart with a great gash in it and a double row of large blooddrops dribbling from it nails and a knife were thrust into the heart round the whole was a crown of thorns such things are dreadful to think of the same gloomy spirit which made a religion of them and worked upon the people by the grossest of all means terror distracted the natural feelings of man to maintain its powershut gentle women into lonely pitiless conventsfrightened poor peasants with tales of tormenttaught that the end and labor of life was silence wretchedness and the scourgemurdered those by fagot and prison who thought otherwise how has the blind and furious bigotry of man perverted that which god gave us as our greatest boon and bid us hate where god bade us love thank heaven that monk has gone out of sight it is pleasant to look at the smiling cheerful old beguine and think no more of yonder livid face  one of the many convents in this little religious city seems to be the specimenhouse which is shown to strangers for all the guides conduct you thither and i saw in a book kept for the purpose the names of innumerable smiths and joneses registered  a very kind sweetvoiced smiling nun i wonder do they always choose the most agreeable and besthumored sister of the house to show it to strangers came tripping down the steps and across the flags of the little gardencourt and welcomed us with much courtesy into the neat little oldfashioned redbricked gableended shiningwindowed convent of the angels first she showed us a whitewashed parlor decorated with a grim picture or two and some crucifixes and other religious emblems where upon stiff old chairs the sisters sit and work three or four of them were still there pattering over their laces and bobbins but the chief part of the sisterhood were engaged in an apartment hard by from which issued a certain odor which i must say resembled onions it was in fact the kitchen of the establishment  every beguine cooks her own little dinner in her own little pipkin and there was half a score of them sure enough busy over their pots and crockery cooking a repast which when ready was carried off to a neighboring room the refectory where at a ledgetable which is drawn out from under her own particular cupboard each nun sits down and eats her meal in silence more religious emblems ornamented the carved cupboarddoors and within everything was as neat as neat could be shining pewterewers and glasses snug baskets of eggs and pats of butter and little bowls with about a farthingsworth of green tea in themfor some great day of fete doubtless the old ladies sat round as we examined these things each eating soberly at her ledge and never looking round there was a bell ringing in the chapel hard by hark said our guide that is one of the sisters dying will you come up and see the cells  the cells it need not be said are the snuggest little nests in the world with sergecurtained beds and snowy linen and saints and martyrs pinned against the wall we may sit up till twelve oclock if we like said the nun but we have no fire and candle and so whats the use of sitting up when we have said our prayers we are glad enough to go to sleep  i forget although the good soul told us how many times in the day in public and in private these devotions are made but fancy that the morning service in the chapel takes place at too early an hour for most easy travellers we did not fail to attend in the evening when likewise is a general muster of the seven hundred minus the absent and sick and the sight is not a little curious and striking to a stranger  the chapel is a very big whitewashed place of worship supported by half a dozen columns on either side over each of which stands the statue of an apostle with his emblem of martyrdom nobody was as yet at the distant altar which was too far off to see very distinctly but i could perceive two statues over it one of which st laurence no doubt was leaning upon a huge gilt gridiron that the sun lighted up in a blazea painful but not a romantic instrument of death a couple of old ladies in white hoods were tugging and swaying about at two bellropes that came down into the middle of the church and at least five hundred others in white veils were seated all round about us in mute contemplation until the service began looking very solemn and white and ghastly like an army of tombstones by moonlight  the service commenced as the clock finished striking seven the organ pealed out a very cracked and old one and presently some weak old voice from the choir overhead quavered out a canticle which done a thin old voice of a priest at the altar far off and which had now become quite gloomy in the sunset chanted feebly another part of the service then the nuns warbled once more overhead and it was curious to hear in the intervals of the most lugubrious chants how the organ went off with some extremely cheerful military or profane air at one time was a march at another a quick tune which ceasing the old nuns began again and so sung until the service was ended  in the midst of it one of the whiteveiled sisters approached us with a very mysterious air and put down her white veil close to our ears and whispered were we doing anything wrong i wondered were they come to that part of the service where heretics and infidels ought to quit the church what have you to ask o sacred whiteveiled maid  all she said was deux centiemes pour les suisses which sum was paid and presently the old ladies rising from their chairs one by one came in face of the altar where they knelt down and said a short prayer then rising unpinned their veils and folded them up all exactly in the same folds and fashion and laid them square like napkins on their heads and tucked up their long black outer dresses and trudged off to their convents  the novices wear black veils under one of which i saw a young sad handsome face it was the only thing in the establishment that was the least romantic or gloomy and for the sake of any reader of a sentimental turn let us hope that the poor soul has been crossed in love and that over some soulstirring tragedy that black curtain has fallen  ghent has i believe been called a vulgar venice it contains dirty canals and old houses that must satisfy the most eager antiquary though the buildings are not quite in so good preservation as others that may be seen in the netherlands the commercial bustle of the place seems considerable and it contains more beershops than any city i ever saw  these beershops seem the only amusement of the inhabitants until at least the theatre shall be built of which the elevation is now complete a very handsome and extensive pile there are beershops in the cellars of the houses which are frequented it is to be presumed by the lower sort there are beershops at the barriers where the citizens and their families repair and beershops in the town glaring with gas with long gauze blinds however to hide what i hear is a rather questionable reputation  our inn the hotel of the post a spacious and comfortable residence is on a little place planted round with trees and that seems to be the palais royal of the town three clubs which look from without to be very comfortable ornament this square with their gaslamps here stands too the theatre that is to be there is a cafe and on evenings a military band plays the very worst music i ever remember to have heard i went out tonight to take a quiet walk upon this place and the horrid brazen discord of these trumpeters set me half mad  i went to the cafe for refuge passing on the way a subterraneous beershop where men and women were drinking to the sweet music of a cracked barrelorgan they take in a couple of french papers at this cafe and the same number of belgian journals you may imagine how well the latter are informed when you hear that the battle of boulogne fought by the immortal louis napoleon was not known here until some gentlemen out of norfolk brought the news from london and until it had travelled to paris and from paris to brussels for a whole hour i could not get a newspaper at the cafe the horrible brass band in the meantime had quitted the place and now to amuse the ghent citizens a couple of little boys came to the cafe and set up a small concert one played ill on the guitar but sang very sweetly plaintive french ballads the other was the comic singer he carried about with him a queer long damplooking mouldy white hat with no brim ecoutez said the waiter to me il va faire langlais cest tres drole the little rogue mounted his immense brimless hat and thrusting his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat began to faire langlais with a song in which swearing was the principal joke we all laughed at this and indeed the little rascal seemed to have a good deal of humor  how they hate us these foreigners in belgium as much as in france what lies they tell of us how gladly they would see us humiliated honest folks at home over their portwine say ay ay and very good reason they have too national vanity sir woundedwe have beaten them so often my dear sir there is not a greater error in the world than this they hate you because you are stupid hard to please and intolerably insolent and airgiving i walked with an englishman yesterday who asked the way to a street of which he pronounced the name very badly to a little flemish boy the flemish boy did not answer and there was my englishman quite in a rage shrieking in the childs ear as if he must answer he seemed to think that it was the duty of the snob as he called him to obey the gentleman this is why we are hatedfor pride in our free country a tradesman a lackey or a waiter will submit to almost any given insult from a gentleman in these benighted lands one man is as good as another and pray god it may soon be so with us of all european people which is the nation that has the most haughtiness the strongest prejudices the greatest reserve the greatest dulness i say an englishman of the genteel classes an honest groom jokes and hobsandnobs and makes his way with the kitchenmaids for there is good social nature in the man his master dare not unbend look at him how he scowls at you on your entering an innroom think how you scowl yourself to meet his scowl today as we were walking and staring about the place a worthy old gentleman in a carriage seeing a pair of strangers took off his hat and bowed very gravely with his old powdered head out of the window i am sorry to say that our first impulse was to burst out laughingit seemed so supremely ridiculous that a stranger should notice and welcome another  as for the notion that foreigners hate us because we have beaten them so often my dear sir this is the greatest error in the world welleducated frenchmen do not believe that we have beaten them a man was once ready to call me out in paris because i said that we had beaten the french in spain and here before me is a french paper with a london correspondent discoursing about louis buonaparte and his jackass expedition to boulogne he was received at eglintoun it is true says the correspondent but what do you think was the reason because the english nobility were anxious to revenge upon his person with some coups de lance the checks which the grand homme his uncle had inflicted on us in spain  this opinion is so general among the french that they would laugh at you with scornful incredulity if you ventured to assert any other foys history of the spanish war does not unluckily go far enough i have read a french history which hardly mentions the war in spain and calls the battle of salamanca a french victory you know how the other day and in the teeth of all evidence the french swore to their victory of toulouse and so it is with the rest and you may set it down as pretty certain 1st that only a few people know the real state of things in france as to the matter in dispute between us 2nd that those who do keep the truth to themselves and so it is as if it had never been  these belgians have caught up and quite naturally the french tone we are perfide albion with them still here is the ghent paper which declares that it is beyond a doubt that louis napoleon was sent by the english and lord palmerston and though it states in another part of the journal from english authority that the prince had never seen lord palmerston yet the lie will remain uppermostthe people and the editor will believe it to the end of time    see to what a digression yonder little fellow in the tall hat has given rise let us make his picture and have done with him   i could not understand in my walks about this place which is certainly picturesque enough and contains extraordinary charms in the shape of old gables quaint spires and broad shining canalsi could not at first comprehend why for all this the town was especially disagreeable to me and have only just hit on the reason why sweetest juliana you will never guess it it is simply this that i have not seen a single decentlooking woman in the whole place they look all ugly with coarse mouths vulgar figures mean mercantile faces and so the traveller walking among them finds the pleasure of his walk excessively damped and the impressions made upon him disagreeable  in the academy there are no pictures of merit but sometimes a secondrate picture is as pleasing as the best and one may pass an hour here very pleasantly there is a room appropriated to belgian artists of which i never saw the like they are like all the rest of the things in this country miserable imitations of the french schoolgreat nude venuses and junos a la david with the drawing left out   bruges  the change from vulgar ghent with its ugly women and coarse bustle to this quiet old halfdeserted cleanly bruges was very pleasant i have seen old men at versailles with shabby coats and pigtails sunning themselves on the benches in the walls they had seen better days to be sure but they were gentlemen still and so we found this morning old dowager bruges basking in the pleasant august sun and looking if not prosperous at least cheerful and wellbred it is the quaintest and prettiest of all the quaint and pretty towns i have seen a painter might spend months here and wander from church to church and admire old towers and pinnacles tall gables bright canals and pretty little patches of green garden and mossgrown wall that reflect in the clear quiet water before the innwindow is a garden from which in the early morning issues a most wonderful odor of stocks and wallflowers next comes a road with trees of admirable green numbers of little children are playing in this road the place is so clean that they may roll in it all day without soiling their pinafores and on the other side of the trees are little oldfashioned dumpy whitewashed redtiled houses a poorer landscape to draw never was known nor a pleasanter to seethe children especially who are inordinately fat and rosy let it be remembered too that here we are out of the country of ugly women the expression of the face is almost uniformly gentle and pleasing and the figures of the women wrapped in long black monklike cloaks and hoods very picturesque no wonder there are so many children the guidebook omniscient mr murray says there are fifteen thousand paupers in the town and we know how such multiply how the deuce do their children look so fat and rosy by eating dirtpies i suppose i saw a couple making a very nice savory one and another employed in gravely sticking strips of stick betwixt the pebbles at the housedoor and so making for herself a stately garden the men and women dont seem to have much more to do there are a couple of tall chimneys at either suburb of the town where no doubt manufactories are at work but within the walls everybody seems decently idle  we have been of course abroad to visit the lions the tower in the grand place is very fine and the bricks of which it is built do not yield a whit in color to the best stone the great building round this tower is very like the pictures of the ducal palace at venice and there is a long market area with columns down the middle from which hung shreds of rather leanlooking meat that would do wonders under the hands of cattermole or haghe in the tower there is a chime of bells that keep ringing perpetually they not only play tunes of themselves and every quarter of an hour but an individual performs selections from popular operas on them at certain periods of the morning afternoon and evening i have heard today suoni la tromba son vergin vezzosa from the puritani and other airs and very badly they were played too for such a great monster as a towerbell cannot be expected to imitate madame grisi or even signor lablache other churches indulge in the same amusement so that one may come here and live in melody all day or night like the young woman in moores lalla rookh  in the matter of art the chief attractions of bruges are the pictures of hemling that are to be seen in the churches the hospital and the picturegallery of the place there are no more pictures of rubens to be seen and indeed in the course of a fortnight one has had quite enough of the great man and his magnificent swaggering canvases what a difference is here with simple hemling and the extraordinary creations of his pencil the hospital is particularly rich in them and the legend there is that the painter who had served charles the bold in his war against the swiss and his last battle and defeat wandered back wounded and penniless to bruges and here found cure and shelter  this hospital is a noble and curious sight the great hall is almost as it was in the twelfth century it is spanned by saxon arches and lighted by a multiplicity of gothic windows of all sizes it is very lofty clean and perfectly well ventilated a screen runs across the middle of the room to divide the male from the female patients and we were taken to examine each ward where the poor people seemed happier than possibly they would have been in health and starvation without it great yellow blankets were on the iron beds the linen was scrupulously clean glittering pewterjugs and goblets stood by the side of each patient and they were provided with godly books to judge from the binding in which several were reading at leisure honest old comfortable nuns in queer dresses of blue black white and flannel were bustling through the room attending to the wants of the sick i saw about a dozen of these kind womens faces one was youngall were healthy and cheerful one came with bare blue arms and a great pile of linen from an outhousesuch a grange as cedric the saxon might have given to a guest for the night a couple were in a laboratory a tall bright clean room 500 years old at least we saw you were not very religious said one of the old ladies with a red wrinkled goodhumored face by your behavior yesterday in chapel and yet we did not laugh and talk as we used at college but were profoundly affected by the scene that we saw there it was a feteday a mass of mozart was sung in the eveningnot well sung and yet so exquisitely tender and melodious that it brought tears into our eyes there were not above twenty people in the church all save three or four were women in long black cloaks i took them for nuns at first they were however the common people of the town very poor indeed doubtless for the priests box that was brought round was not added to by most of them and their contributions were but twocent piecesfive of these go to a penny but we know the value of such and can tell the exact worth of a poor womans mite the boxbearer did not seem at first willing to accept our donationwe were strangers and heretics however i held out my hand and he came perforce as it were indeed it had only a franc in it but que voulezvous i had been drinking a bottle of rhine wine that day and how was i to afford more the rhine wine is dear in this country and costs four francs a bottle  well the service proceeded twenty poor women two englishmen four ragged beggars cowering on the steps and there was the priest at the altar in a great robe of gold and damask two little boys in white surplices serving him holding his robe as he rose and bowed and the moneygatherer swinging his censer and filling the little chapel with smoke the music pealed with wonderful sweetness you could see the prim white heads of the nuns in their gallery the evening light streamed down upon old statues of saints and carved brown stalls and lighted up the head of the goldenhaired magdalen in a picture of the entombment of christ over the gallery and as it were a kind protectress to the poor below stood the statue of the virgin     iiiwaterloo   it is my dear the happy privilege of your sex in england to quit the dinnertable after the winebottles have once or twice gone round it and you are thereby saved though to be sure i cant tell what the ladies do up stairsyou are saved two or three hours excessive dulness which the men are obliged to go through  i ask any gentleman who reads thisthe letters to my juliana being written with an eye to publicationto remember especially how many times how many hundred times how many thousand times in his hearing the battle of waterloo has been discussed after dinner and to call to mind how cruelly he has been bored by the discussion ah it was lucky for us that the prussians came up says one little gentleman looking particularly wise and ominous hang the prussians or perhaps something stronger the prussians says a stout old major on halfpay we beat the french without them sir as beaten them we always have we were thundering down the hill of belle alliance sir at the backs of them and the french were crying sauve qui peut long before the prussians ever touched them and so the battle opens and for many mortal hours amid rounds of claret rages over and over again  i thought to myself considering the above things what a fine thing it will be in afterdays to say that i have been to brussels and never seen the field of waterloo indeed that i am such a philosopher as not to care a fig about the battlenay to regret rather that when napoleon came back the british government had not spared their men and left him alone  but this pitch of philosophy was unattainable this morning after having seen the park the fashionable boulevard the pictures the cafeshaving sipped i say the sweets of every flower that grows in this paradise of brussels quite weary of the place we mounted on a namur diligence and jingled off at four miles an hour for waterloo  the road is very neat and agreeable the forest of soignies here and there interposes pleasantly to give your vehicle a shade the country as usual is vastly fertile and well cultivated a farmer and the conducteur were my companions in the imperial and could i have understood their conversation my dear you should have had certainly a report of it the jargon which they talked was indeed most queer and puzzlingfrench i believe strangely hashed up and pronounced for here and there one could catch a few words of it now and anon however they condescended to speak in the purest french they could muster and indeed nothing is more curious than to hear the french of the country you cant understand why all the people insist upon speaking it so badly i asked the conductor if he had been at the battle he burst out laughing like a philosopher as he was and said pas si bete i asked the farmer whether his contributions were lighter now than in king williams time and lighter than those in the time of the emperor he vowed that in wartime he had not more to pay than in time of peace and this strange fact is vouched for by every person of every nation and being asked wherefore the king of holland had been ousted from his throne replied at once parceque cetoit un voleur for which accusation i believe there is some show of reason his majesty having laid hands on much belgian property before the lamented outbreak which cost him his crown a vast deal of laughing and roaring passed between these two worldly people and the postilion whom they called baron and i thought no doubt that this talk was one of the many jokes that my companions were in the habit of making but not so the postilion was an actual baron the bearer of an ancient name the descendant of gallant gentlemen good heavens what would mrs trollope say to see his lordship here his father the old baron had dissipated the family fortune and here was this young nobleman at about fiveandforty compelled to bestride a clattering flemish stallion and bump over dusty pavements at the rate of five miles an hour but see the beauty of high blood with what a calm grace the man of family accommodates himself to fortune far from being cast down his lordship met his fate like a man he swore and laughed the whole of the journey and as we changed horses condescended to partake of half a pint of louvain beer to which the farmer treated himindeed the worthy rustic treated me to a glass too  much delight and instruction have i had in the course of the journey from my guide philosopher and friend the author of murrays handbook he has gathered together indeed a store of information and must to make his single volume have gutted many hundreds of guidebooks how the continental ciceroni must hate him whoever he is every english party i saw had this infallible red book in their hands and gained a vast deal of historical and general information from it thus i heard in confidence many remarkable anecdotes of charles v the duke of alva count egmont all of which i had before perceived with much satisfaction not only in the handbook but even in other works  the laureate is among the english poets evidently the great favorite of our guide the choice does honor to his head and heart a man must have a very strong bent for poetry indeed who carries southeys works in his portmanteau and quotes them in proper time and occasion of course at waterloo a spirit like our guides cannot fail to be deeply moved and to turn to his favorite poet for sympathy hark how the laureated bard sings about the tombstones at waterloo           that temple to our hearts was hallowd now             for many a wounded briton there was laid           with such for help as time might then allow             from the fresh carnage of the field conveyed           and they whom human succor could not save             here in its precincts found a hasty grave           and here on marble tablets set on high             in english lines by foreign workmen traced           the names familiar to an english eye             their brethren here the fit memorial placed           whose unadorned inscriptions briefly tell             their gallant comrades rank and where they fell           the stateliest monument of human pride             enriched with all magnificence of art           to honor chieftains who in victory died             would wake no stronger feeling in the heart           than these plain tablets by the soldiers hand             raised to his comrades in a foreign land  there are lines for you wonderful for justice rich in thought and novel ideas the passage concerning their gallant comrades rank should be specially remarked there indeed they lie sure enough the honorable colonel this of the guards captain that of the hussars major soandso of the dragoons brave men and good who did their duty by their country on that day and died in the performance of it  amen but i confess fairly that in looking at these tablets i felt very much disappointed at not seeing the names of the men as well as the officers are they to be counted for nought a few more inches of marble to each monument would have given space for all the names of the men and the men of that day were the winners of the battle we have a right to be as grateful individually to any given private as to any given officer their duties were very much the same why should the country reserve its gratitude for the genteel occupiers of the armylist and forget the gallant fellows whose humble names were written in the regimental books in reading of the wellington wars and the conduct of the men engaged in them i dont know whether to respect them or to wonder at them most they have death wounds and poverty in contemplation in possession poverty hard labor hard fare and small thanks if they do wrong they are handed over to the inevitable provostmarshal if they are heroes heroes they may be but they remain privates still handling the old brownbess starving on the old twopence a day they grow gray in battle and victory and after thirty years of bloody service a young gentleman of fifteen fresh from a preparatory school who can scarcely read and came but yesterday with a pinafore in to papas dessertsuch a young gentleman i say arrives in a spickandspan red coat and calmly takes the command over our veteran who obeys him as if god and nature had ordained that so throughout time it should be  that privates should obey and that they should be smartly punished if they disobey this one can understand very well but to say obey for ever and everto say that private john styles is by some physical disproportion hopelessly inferior to cornet snooksto say that snooks shall have honors epaulets and a marble tablet if he dies and that styles shall fight his fight and have his twopence a day and when shot down shall be shovelled into a hole with other styleses and so forgotten and to think that we had in the course of the last war some 400000 of these styleses and some 10000 say of the snooks sortstyles being by nature exactly as honest clever and brave as snooksand to think that the 400000 should bear this is the wonder  suppose snooks makes a speech look at these frenchmen british soldiers says he and remember who they are twoandtwenty years since they hurled their king from his throne and murdered him groans they flung out of their country their ancient and famous nobilitythey published the audacious doctrine of equalitythey made a cadet of artillery a beggarly lawyers son into an emperor and took ignoramuses from the ranksdrummers and privates by joveof whom they made kings generals and marshals is this to be borne cries of no no upon them my boys down with these godless revolutionists and rally round the british lion  so saying ensign snooks whose flag which he cant carry is held by a huge grizzly colorsergeant draws a little sword and pipes out a feeble huzza the men of his company roaring curses at the frenchmen prepare to receive and repel a thundering charge of french cuirassiers the men fight and snooks is knighted because the men fought so well  but live or die win or lose what do they get english glory is too genteel to meddle with those humble fellows she does not condescend to ask the names of the poor devils whom she kills in her service why was not every private mans name written upon the stones in waterloo church as well as every officers five hundred pounds to the stonecutters would have served to carve the whole catalogue and paid the poor compliment of recognition to men who died in doing their duty if the officers deserved a stone the men did but come let us away and drop a tear over the marquis of angleseas leg  as for waterloo has it not been talked of enough after dinner here are some oats that were plucked before hougoumont where grow not only oats but flourishing crops of grapeshot bayonets and legionofhonor crosses in amazing profusion  well though i made a vow not to talk about waterloo either here or after dinner there is one little secret admission that one must make after seeing it let an englishman go and see that field and he never forgets it the sight is an event in his life and though it has been seen by millions of peaceable gentsgrocers from bond street meek attorneys from chancery lane and timid tailors from piccadillyi will wager that there is not one of them but feels a glow as he looks at the place and remembers that he too is an englishman  it is a wrong egotistical savage unchristian feeling and thats the truth of it a man of peace has no right to be dazzled by that redcoated glory and to intoxicate his vanity with those remembrances of carnage and triumph the same sentence which tells us that on earth there ought to be peace and goodwill amongst men tells us to whom glory belongs
