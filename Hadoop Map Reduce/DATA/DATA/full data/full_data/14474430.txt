the light somehow i ave seen them when they was a brownbrownishgold  and she smiles with er eyes  hasnt she got a mouth  ses ginger wot was getting a bit tired of it  youve been crossed in love ses the nevy staring at im  thats wots the matter with you  and looking at you i dont wonder at it  ginger arf got up but sam gave him a look and e sat down agin and then they all sat quiet while the nevy went on telling them about is gal  i should like to see er ses his uncle at last  call round for me at seven tomorrow night ses the young un and ill introduce you  we might look in on our way ses sam arter ginger and peter ad both made eyes at im  were going out to spend the evening  the more the merrier ses his nevy  well so long i expect shes waiting for me  he got up and said goodbye and arter he ad gorn sam and the other two shook their leads together and said what a pity it was to be twenty one ginger said it made im sad to think of it and peter said ow any gal could look at a man under thirty e couldnt think  they all went round to the nevys the next evening  they was a little bit early owing to gingers watch aving been set right by guesswork and they ad to sit in a row on the nevys bed waiting while e cleaned imself and changed his clothes  although it was only wednesday e changed his collar and he was so long making up is mind about his necktie that is uncle tried to make it up for him  by the time he ad finished sam said it made im think it was sunday  miss gill was at ome when they got there and all three of em was very much surprised that such a goodlooking gal should take up with sams nevy  ginger nearly said so but peter gave im a dig in the back just in time and e called him something under is breath instead  why shouldnt we all make an evening of it ses ginger arter they ad been talking for about ten minutes and the nevy ad looked at the clock three or four times  because twos company ses mrs gill  why you was young yourself once  cant you remember  hes young now mother ses the gal giving ginger a nice smile  i tell you wot we might do ses mrs gill putting er finger to her forehead and considering  you and joe go out and ave your evening and me and these gentlemenll go off together somewhere  i shall enjoy an outing i aint ad one for a long time  ginger said it would be very nice if she thought it wouldnt make er too tired and afore sam or peter could think of anything to say she was upstairs putting er bonnet on  they thought o plenty to say while they was sitting alone with ginger waiting for er  my idea was for the gal and your nevy to come too ses pore ginger then i thought we might lose im and i would ave a little chat with the gal and show er ow foolish she was  well youve done it now ses sam  spoilt our evening  praps good will come out of it ses ginger  if the old lady takes a fancy to us we shall be able to come agin and then to please you sam ill have a go to cut your nevy out  sam stared at im and peter stared too and then they looked at each other and began to laugh till ginger forgot where e was and offered to put sam through the winder  they was still quarrelling under their breath and saying wot theyd like to do to each other when mrs gill came downstairs  dressed up to the nines she was and they walked down the street with a feeling that everybody was looking at em  one thing that elped to spoil the evening was that mrs gill wouldnt go into publicouses but to make up for it she went into sweetstuff shops three times and ad ices while they stood and watched er and wondered ow she could do it  and arter that she stopped at a place poplar way where there was a few swings and roundabouts and things she was as skittish as a schoolgal and arter taking pore sam on the roundabout till e didnt know whether he was on his eels or his ead she got im into a boatswing and swung im till he felt like a boy on is fust vyge  arter that she took im to the rifle gallery and afore he had ad three shots the man took the gun away from im and threatened to send for the police  it was an expensive evening for all of them but as ginger said when they got ome they ad broken the ice and he bet peter russet arf a dollar that afore two days ad passed hed take the nevys gal for a walk  he stepped round by imself the next arternoon and made imself agreeable to mrs gill and the day arter they was both so nice and kind that e plucked up is courage and offered to take miss gill to the zoo  she said no at fust of course but arter ginger ad pointed out that joe was at work all day and couldnt take er imself and that e was joes uncles best pal she began to think better of it  why not  ses her mother  joe wouldnt mind  he wouldnt be so silly as to be jealous o mr ginger dick  of course not ses the gal  theres nothing to be jealous of  she let er mother and ginger persuade er arter a time and then she went upstairs to clean herself and put on a little silver brooch that ginger said he ad picked up coming along  she took about threequarters of an hour to get ready but when she came down ginger felt that it was quite worth it  he couldnt take is eyes off er as the saying goes and e sat by er side on the top of the omnibus like a man in a dream  this is better than being at sea he ses at last  dont you like the sea  ses the gal  i should like to go to sea myself  i shouldnt mind the sea if you was there ses ginger  miss gill turned her ead away  you mustnt talk to me like that she ses in a soft voice  still  still wot ses ginger arter waiting a long time  i mean if i did go to sea it would be nice to have a friend on board she ses  i suppose you aint afraid of storms are you  i like em ses ginger  you look as if you would ses the gal giving im a little look under er eyelashes  it must be nice to be a man and be brave  i wish i was a man  i dont ses ginger  why not  ses the gal turning her ead away agin  ginger didnt answer he gave er elbow a little squeeze instead  she took it away at once and ginger was just wishing he adnt been so foolish when it came back agin and they sat for a long time without speaking a word  the sea is all right for some things ses ginger at last but suppose a man married  the gal shook her ead  it would be hard on is wife she ses with another little look at im butbut  ginger pinched er elbow agin  but praps he could get a job ashore she ses and then he could take his wife out for a busride every day  they ad to change buses arter a time and they got on a wrong bus and went miles out o their way but neither of em seemed to mind  ginger said he was thinking of something else and the gal said she was too they got to the zoological gardens at last and ginger said he ad never enjoyed himself so much  when the lions roared she squeezed his arm and when they ad an elephant ride she was holding on to im with both ands  i am enjoying myself she ses as ginger elped her down and said whoa to the elephant  i know its wicked but i cant elp it and wots more im afraid i dont want to elp it  she let ginger take er arm when she nearly tripped up over a peppermint ball some kid ad dropped and arter a little persuasion she ad a bottle of lemonade and six bathbuns at a refreshment stall for dinner  she was as nice as she could be to him but by the time they started for ome she ad turned so quiet that ginger began to think e must ave offended er in some way  are you tired  he ses  no ses the gal shaking her ead ive enjoyed myself very much  i thought you seemed a bit tired ses ginger arter waiting a long time  im not tired ses the gal giving im a sad sort o little smile but im a little bit worried thats all  worried ses ginger very tender  wots worrying you  oh i cant tell you ses miss gill  it doesnt matter ill try and cheer up  wot a lovely day it is isnt it  i shall remember it all my life  wot is it worrying you  ses ginger in a determined voice  cant you tell me  no ses the gal shaking her ead i cant tell you because you might want to elp me and i couldnt allow that  why shouldnt i elp you  ses ginger  its wot we was put ere for to elp one another  i couldnt tell you ses the gal just dabbing ater eyeswith a lace pocketankercher about one and a arf times the size of er nose  not if i ask you to  ses ginger  miss gill shook er ead and then she tried her ardest to turn the conversation  she talked about the weather and the monkeyouse and a gal in er street whose air changed from red to black in a single night but it was all no good ginger wouldnt be put off and at last she ses  well she ses if you must know im in a difficulty i ave got to get three pounds and where to get it i dont know any more than the man in the moon  now lets talk about something else  do you owe it  ses ginger  i cant tell you any more ses miss gill and i wouldnt ave told you that only you asked me and somehow i feel as though i ave to tell you things when you want me to  three pounds aint much ses pore ginger wot ad just been paid off arter a long vyge  i can let you ave it and welcome  miss gill started away from im as though she ad been stung and it took im all his time to talk er round agin  when he ad she begged is pardon and said he was the most generous man she ad ever met but it couldnt be  i dont know when i could pay it back she ses but i thank you all the same for offering it  pay it back when you like ses ginger and if you never pay it back it dont matter  he offered er the money four or five times but she wouldnt take it but at last just as they got near her ouse he forced it in her and and put his own ands in his pockets when she tried to make im take it back  you are good to me she ses arter they ad gone inside and er mother ad gone upstairs arter giving ginger a bottle o beer to amuse imself with i shall never forget you  never  i ope not ses ginger starting  are you coming out agin to morrow  im afraid i cant ses miss gill shaking her ead and looking sorrowful  not with me  ses ginger sitting down beside her on the sofa and putting is arm so that she could lean against it if she wanted to  i dont think i can ses the gal leaning back very gentle  think agin ses ginger squeezing er waist a little  miss gill shook her ead and then turned and looked at im  her face was so close to his that thinking that she ad put it there apurpose he kissed it and the next moment e got a clout that made his ead ring  ow dare you she ses jumping up with a scream  ow dare you  ow dare  wots the matter  ses her mother coming downstairs like a runaway barrel of treacle  hehes insulted me ses miss gill taking out her little ankercher and sobbing  hekkissed me  wot  ses mrs gill  well id never ave believed it  never  why e ought to be taken up  wot dye mean by it  she ses turning on pore ginger  ginger tried to explain but it was all no good and two minutes arterwards e was walking back to is lodgings like a dog with its tail between its legs  his ead was going round and round with astonishment and e was in such a temper that e barged into a man twice as big as himself and then offered to knock his ead off when e objected  and when sam and peter asked him ow he ad got on he was in such a state of mind it was all e could do to answer em  and ill trouble you for my arf dollar peter he ses ive been out with er all day and ive won my bet  peter paid it over like a lamb and then e sat thinking ard for a bit  are you going out with er agin tomorrow ginger  he ses arter a time  i dont know ses ginger carelesslike i aint made up my mind yet  peter looked at im and then e looked at sam and winked  let me ave a try he ses ill bet you another arf dollar that i take er out praps i shall come ome in a better temper than wot you ave  old sam said it wasnt right to play with a gals art in that way but arter a lot o talking and telling sam to shut up ginger took the bet he was quite certain in his own mind that miss gill would slam the door in peters face and arter he ad started off next morning ginger and sam waited in to ave the pleasure of laughing in is face  they got tired of waiting at last and went out to enjoy themselves and breathe the fresh air in a pub down poplar way  they got back at seven oclock and ten minutes arterwards peter came in and sat down on his bed and began to smoke without a word  had a good time  ses ginger  rippin ses peter holding is pipe tight between is teeth  you owe me arf a dollar ginger  whered you go  ses ginger passing it over  crystal pallis ses peter  are you going to take er out tomorrow  ses sam  i

ginger  praps wed better let sams nevy ave er  arter all its a bit rough on im when you come to think of it  youre quite right ses peter jumping up  its sams business and why we should go out of our way and inconvenience ourselves to do im a good turn i dont know  its sam all over ses ginger hes always been like that and the more you try to oblige im the more you may  they went on abusing sam till he got sick and tired of it and arter telling em wot he thought of em he slammed the door and went out and spent the evening by imself  he would ardly speak to them next day but arter tea he brightened up a bit and they went off together as if nothing ad happened and the fust thing they saw as they turned out of their street was sams nevy coming along smiling till it made their faces ache to look at him  i was just coming to see you he ses  were just off on business ses ginger  i wasnt going to stop ses the nevy my young lady just told me to step along and show uncle wot she has bought me  a silver watch and chain and a gold ring  look at it  he held his and under gingers nose and ginger stood there looking at it and opening and shutting is mouth like a dying fish  then he took peter by the arm and ledim away while the nevy was opening is new watch and showing sam the works  ow much did she get out of you peter  ses ginger looking at im very hard  i dont want any lies  three
