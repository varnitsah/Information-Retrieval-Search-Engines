96661371	the lost continent was originally published     under the title beyond thirty     the lost continent   by  edgar rice burroughs   jtable 3 9 1    1   since earliest childhood i have been strangely fascinated by the mystery surrounding the history of the last days of twentieth century europe  my interest is keenest perhaps not so much in relation to known facts as to speculation upon the unknowable of the two centuries that have rolled by since human intercourse between the western and eastern hemispheres ceasedthe mystery of europes state following the termination of the great warprovided of course that the war had been terminated  from out of the meagerness of our censored histories we learned that for fifteen years after the cessation of diplomatic relations between the united states of north america and the belligerent nations of the old world news of more or less doubtful authenticity filtered from time to time into the western hemisphere from the eastern  then came the fruition of that historic propaganda which is best described by its own slogan the east for the eastthe west for the west and all further intercourse was stopped by statute  even prior to this transoceanic commerce had practically ceased owing to the perils and hazards of the minestrewn waters of both the atlantic and pacific oceans  just when submarine activities ended we do not know but the last vessel of this type sighted by a panamerican merchantman was the huge q 138 which discharged twentynine torpedoes at a brazilian tank steamer off the bermudas in the fall of 1972  a heavy sea and the excellent seamanship of the master of the brazilian permitted the panamerican to escape and report this last of a long series of outrages upon our commerce  god alone knows how many hundreds of our ancient ships fell prey to the roving steel sharks of bloodfrenzied europe  countless were the vessels and men that passed over our eastern and western horizons never to return but whether they met their fates before the belching tubes of submarines or among the aimlessly drifting mine fields no man lived to tell  and then came the great panamerican federation which linked the western hemisphere from pole to pole under a single flag which joined the navies of the new world into the mightiest fighting force that ever sailed the seven seasthe greatest argument for peace the world had ever known  since that day peace had reigned from the western shores of the azores to the western shores of the hawaiian islands nor has any man of either hemisphere dared cross 30dw or 175dw  from 30d to 175d is oursfrom 30d to 175d is peace prosperity and happiness  beyond was the great unknown  even the geographies of my boyhood showed nothing beyond  we were taught of nothing beyond  speculation was discouraged  for two hundred years the eastern hemisphere had been wiped from the maps and histories of panamerica  its mention in fiction even was forbidden  our ships of peace patrol thirty and one hundred seventyfive  what ships from beyond they have warned only the secret archives of government show but a naval officer myself i have gathered from the traditions of the service that it has been fully two hundred years since smoke or sail has been sighted east of 30d or west of 175d  the fate of the relinquished provinces which lay beyond the dead lines we could only speculate upon  that they were taken by the military power which rose so suddenly in china after the fall of the republic and which wrested manchuria and korea from russia and japan and also absorbed the philippines is quite within the range of possibility  it was the commander of a chinese manofwar who received a copy of the edict of 1972 from the hand of my illustrious ancestor admiral turck on one hundred seventyfive two hundred and six years ago and from the yellowed pages of the admirals diary i learned that the fate of the philippines was even then presaged by these chinese naval officers  yes for over two hundred years no man crossed 30d to 175d and lived to tell his storynot until chance drew me across and back again and public opinion revolting at last against the drastic regulations of our longdead forbears demanded that my story be given to the world and that the narrow interdict which commanded peace prosperity and happiness to halt at 30d and 175d be removed forever  i am glad that it was given to me to be an instrument in the hands of providence for the uplifting of benighted europe and the amelioration of the suffering degradation and abysmal ignorance in which i found her  i shall not live to see the complete regeneration of the savage hordes of the eastern hemispherethat is a work which will require many generations perhaps ages so complete has been their reversion to savagery but i know that the work has been started and i am proud of the share in it which my generous countrymen have placed in my hands  the government already possesses a complete official report of my adventures beyond thirty  in the narrative i purpose telling my story in a less formal and i hope a more entertaining style though being only a naval officer and without claim to the slightest literary ability i shall most certainly fall far short of the possibilities which are inherent in my subject  that i have passed through the most wondrous adventures that have befallen a civilized man during the past two centuries encourages me in the belief that however ill the telling the facts themselves will command your interest to the final page  beyond thirty  romance adventure strange peoples fearsome beastsall the excitement and scurry of the lives of the twentieth century ancients that have been denied us in these dull days of peace and prosaic prosperityall all lay beyond thirty the invisible barrier between the stupid commercial present and the carefree barbarous past  what boy has not sighed for the good old days of wars revolutions and riots how i used to pore over the chronicles of those old days those dear old days when workmen went armed to their labors when they fell upon one another with gun and bomb and dagger and the streets ran red with blood  ah but those were the times when life was worth the living when a man who went out by night knew not at which dark corner a footpad might leap upon and slay him when wild beasts roamed the forest and the jungles and there were savage men and countries yet unexplored  now in all the western hemisphere dwells no man who may not find a school house within walking distance of his home or at least within flying distance  the wildest beast that roams our waste places lairs in the frozen north or the frozen south within a government reserve where the curious may view him and feed him bread crusts from the hand with perfect impunity  but beyond thirty  and i have gone there and come back and now you may go there for no longer is it high treason punishable by disgrace or death to cross 30d or 175d  my name is jefferson turck  i am a lieutenant in the navyin the great panamerican navy the only navy which now exists in all the world  i was born in arizona in the united states of north america in the year of our lord 2116  therefore i am twentyone years old  in early boyhood i tired of the teeming cities and overcrowded rural districts of arizona  every generation of turcks for over two centuries has been represented in the navy  the navy called to me as did the free wide unpeopled spaces of the mighty oceans  and so i joined the navy coming up from the ranks as we all must learning our craft as we advance  my promotion was rapid for my family seems to inherit naval lore  we are born officers and i reserve to myself no special credit for an early advancement in the service  at twenty i found myself a lieutenant in command of the aerosubmarine coldwater of the ss96 class  the coldwater was one of the first of the air and underwater craft which have been so greatly improved since its launching and was possessed of innumerable weaknesses which fortunately have been eliminated in more recent vessels of similar type  even when i took command she was fit only for the junk pile but the worldold parsimony of government retained her in active service and sent two hundred men to sea in her with myself a mere boy in command of her to patrol thirty from iceland to the azores  much of my service had been spent aboard the great merchantmenofwar these are the utility naval vessels that have transformed the navies of old which burdened the peoples with taxes for their support into the present day fleets of selfsupporting ships that find ample time for target practice and gun drill while they bear freight and the mails from the continents to the farscattered island of panamerica  this change in service was most welcome to me especially as it brought with it coveted responsibilities of sole command and i was prone to overlook the deficiencies of the coldwater in the natural pride i felt in my first ship  the coldwater was fully equipped for two months patrollingthe ordinary length of assignment to this serviceand a month had already passed its monotony entirely unrelieved by sight of another craft when the first of our misfortunes befell  we had been riding out a storm at an altitude of about three thousand feet  all night we had hovered above the tossing billows of the moonlight clouds  the detonation of the thunder and the glare of lightning through an occasional rift in the vaporous wall proclaimed the continued fury of the tempest upon the surface of the sea but we far above it all rode in comparative ease upon the upper gale  with the coming of dawn the clouds beneath us became a glorious sea of gold and silver soft and beautiful but they could not deceive us as to the blackness and the terrors of the stormlashed ocean which they hid  i was at breakfast when my chief engineer entered and saluted  his face was grave and i thought he was even a trifle paler than usual  well i asked  he drew the back of his forefinger nervously across his brow in a gesture that was habitual with him in moments of mental stress  the gravitationscreen generators sir he said  number one went to the bad about an hour and a half ago  we have been working upon it steadily since but i have to report sir that it is beyond repair  number two will keep us supplied i answered  in the meantime we will send a wireless for relief  but that is the trouble sir he went on  number two has stopped i knew it would come sir  i made a report on these generators three years ago  i advised then that they both be scrapped  their principle is entirely wrong  theyre done for  and with a grim smile i shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing my report was accurate  have we sufficient reserve screen to permit us to make land or at least meet our relief halfway i asked  no sir he replied gravely we are sinking now  have you anything further to report i asked  no sir he said  very good i replied and as i dismissed him i rang for my wireless operator  when he appeared i gave him a message to the secretary of the navy to whom all vessels in service on thirty and one hundred seventyfive report direct  i explained our predicament and stated that with what screening force remained i should continue in the air making as rapid headway toward st johns as possible and that when we were forced to take to the water i should continue in the same direction  the accident occurred directly over 30d and about 52d n  the surface wind was blowing a tempest from the west  to attempt to ride out such a storm upon the surface seemed suicidal for the coldwater was not designed for surface navigation except under fair weather conditions submerged or in the air she was tractable enough in any sort of weather when under control but without her screen generators she was almost helpless since she could not fly and if submerged could not rise to the surface  all these defects have been remedied in later models but the knowledge did not help us any that day aboard the slowly settling coldwater with an angry sea roaring beneath a tempest raging out of the west and 30d only a few knots astern  to cross thirty or one hundred seventyfive has been as you know the direst calamity that could befall a naval commander  courtmartial and degradation follow swiftly unless as is often the case the unfortunate man takes his own life before this unjust and heartless regulation can hold him up to public scorn  there has been in the past no excuse no circumstance that could palliate the offense  he was in command and he took his ship across thirty that was sufficient  it might not have been in any way his fault as in the case of the coldwater it could not possibly have been justly charged to my account that the gravitationscreen generators were worthless but well i knew that should chance have it that we were blown across thirty todayas we might easily be before the terrific west wind that we could hear howling below us the responsibility would fall upon my shoulders  in a way the regulation was a good one for it certainly accomplished that for which it was intended  we all fought shy of 30d on the east and 175d on the west and though we had to skirt them pretty close nothing but an act of god ever drew one of us across  you all are familiar with the naval tradition that a good officer could sense proximity to either line and for my part i am firmly convinced of the truth of this as i am that the compass finds the north without recourse to tedious processes of reasoning  old admiral sanchez was wont to maintain that he could smell thirty and the men of the first ship in which i sailed claimed that coburn the navigating officer knew by name every wave along thirty from 60dn to 60ds  however id hate to vouch for this  well to get back to my narrative we kept on dropping slowly toward the surface the while we bucked the west wind clawing away from thirty as fast as we could  i was on the bridge and as we dropped from the brilliant sunlight into the dense vapor of clouds and on down through them to the wild dark storm strata beneath it seemed that my spirits dropped with the falling ship and the buoyancy of hope ran low in sympathy  the waves were running to tremendous heights and the coldwater was not designed to meet such waves head on  her elements were the blue ether far above the raging storm or the greater depths of ocean which no storm could ruffle  as i stood speculating upon our chances once we settled into the frightful maelstrom beneath us and at the same time mentally computing the hours which must elapse before aid could reach us the wireless operator clambered up the ladder to the bridge and disheveled and breathless stood before me at salute  it needed but a glance at him to assure me that something was amiss  what now i asked  the wireless sir he cried  my god sir i cannot send  but the emergency outfit i asked  i have tried everything sir  i have exhausted every resource  we cannot send and he drew himself up and saluted again  i dismissed him with a few kind words for i knew that it was through no fault of his that the mechanism was antiquated and worthless in common with the balance of the coldwaters equipment  there was no finer operator in panamerica than he  the failure of the wireless did not appear as momentous to me as to him which is not unnatural since it is but human to feel that when our own little cog slips the entire universe must necessarily be put out of gear  i knew that if this storm were destined to blow us across thirty or send us to the bottom of the ocean no help could reach us in time to prevent it  i had ordered the message sent solely because regulations required it and not with any particular hope that we could benefit by it in our present extremity  i had little time to dwell upon the coincidence of the simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy generators since very shortly after the coldwater had dropped so low over the waters that all my attention was necessarily centered upon the delicate business of settling upon the waves without breaking my ships back  with our buoyancy generators in commission it would have been a simple thing to enter the water since then it would have been but a trifling matter of a fortyfive degree dive into the base of a huge wave  we should have cut into the water like a hot knife through butter and have been totally submerged with scarce a jari have done it a thousand timesbut i did not dare submerge the coldwater for fear that it would remain submerged to the end of timea condition far from conducive to the longevity of commander or crew  most of my officers were older men than i  john alvarez my first officer is twenty years my senior  he stood at my side on the bridge as the ship glided closer and closer to those stupendous waves  he watched my every move but he was by far too fine an officer and gentleman to embarrass me by either comment or suggestion  when i saw that we soon would touch i ordered the ship brought around broadside to the wind and there we hovered a moment until a huge wave reached up and seized us upon its crest and then i gave the order that suddenly reversed the screening force and let us into the ocean  down into the trough we went wallowing like the carcass of a dead whale and then began the fight with rudder and propellers to force the coldwater back into the teeth of the gale and drive her on and on farther and farther from relentless thirty  i think that we should have succeeded even though the ship was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings she received and though she were half submerged the greater part of the time had no further accident befallen us  we were making headway though slowly and it began to look as though we were going to pull through  alvarez never left my side though i all but ordered him below for muchneeded rest  my second officer porfirio johnson was also often on the bridge  he was a good officer but a man for whom i had conceived a rather unreasoning aversion almost at the first moment of meeting him an aversion which was not lessened by the knowledge which i subsequently gained that he looked upon my rapid promotion with jealousy  he was ten years my senior both in years and service and i rather think he could never forget the fact that he had been an officer when i was a green apprentice  as it became more and more apparent that the coldwater under my seamanship was weathering the tempest and giving promise of pulling through safely i could have sworn that i perceived a shade of annoyance and disappointment growing upon his dark countenance  he left the bridge finally and went below  i do not know that he is directly responsible for what followed so shortly after but i have always had my suspicions and alvarez is even more prone to place the blame upon him than i  it was about six bells of the forenoon watch that johnson returned to the bridge after an absence of some thirty minutes  he seemed nervous and ill at easea fact which made little impression on me at the time but which both alvarez and i recalled subsequently  not three minutes after his reappearance at my side the coldwater suddenly commenced to lose headway  i seized the telephone at my elbow pressing upon the button which would call the chief engineer to the instrument in the bowels of the ship only to find him already at the receiver attempting to reach me  numbers one two and five engines have broken down sir he called shall we force the remaining three  we can do nothing else i bellowed into the transmitter  they wont stand the gaff sir he returned  can you suggest a better plan i asked  no sir he replied  then give them the gaff lieutenant i shouted back and hung up the receiver  for twenty minutes the coldwater bucked the great seas with her three engines  i doubt if she advanced a foot but it was enough to keep her nose in the wind and at least we were not drifting toward thirty  johnson and alvarez were at my side when without warning the bow swung swiftly around and the ship fell into the trough of the sea  the other three have gone i said and i happened to be looking at johnson as i spoke  was it the shadow of a satisfied smile that crossed his thin lips  i do not know but at least he did not weep  you always have been curious sir about the great unknown beyond thirty he said  you are in a good way to have your curiosity satisfied  and then i could not mistake the slight sneer that curved his upper lip  there must have been a trace of disrespect in his tone or manner which escaped me for alvarez turned upon him like a flash  when lieutenant turck crosses thirty he said we shall all cross with him and god help the officer or the man who reproaches him  i shall not be a party to high treason snapped johnson  the regulations are explicit and if the coldwater crosses thirty it devolves upon you to place lieutenant turck under arrest and immediately exert every endeavor to bring the ship back into panamerican waters  i shall not know replied alvarez that the coldwater passes thirty nor shall any other man aboard know it and with his words he drew a revolver from his pocket and before either i or johnson could prevent it had put a bullet into every instrument upon the bridge ruining them beyond repair  and then he saluted me and strode from the bridge a martyr to loyalty and friendship for though no man might know that lieutenant jefferson turck had taken his ship across thirty every man aboard would know that the first officer had committed a crime that was punishable by both degradation and death  johnson turned and eyed me narrowly  shall i place him under arrest he asked  you shall not i replied  nor shall anyone else  you become a party to his crime he cried angrily  you may go below mr johnson i said and attend to the work of unpacking the extra instruments and having them properly set upon the bridge  he saluted and left me and for some time i stood gazing out upon the angry waters my mind filled with unhappy reflections upon the unjust fate that had overtaken me and the sorrow and disgrace that i had unwittingly brought down upon my house  i rejoiced that i should leave neither wife nor child to bear the burden of my shame throughout their lives  as i thought upon my misfortune i considered more clearly than ever before the unrighteousness of the regulation which was to prove my doom and in the natural revolt against its injustice my anger rose and there mounted within me a feeling which i imagine must have paralleled that spirit that once was prevalent among the ancients called anarchy  for the first time in my life i found my sentiments arraying themselves against custom tradition and even government  the wave of rebellion swept over me in an instant beginning with an heretical doubt as to the sanctity of the established order of thingsthat fetish which has ruled panamericans for two centuries and which is based upon a blind faith in the infallibility of the prescience of the longdead framers of the articles of panamerican federationand ending in an adamantine determination to defend my honor and my life to the last ditch against the blind and senseless regulation which assumed the synonymity of misfortune and treason  i would replace the destroyed instruments upon the bridge every officer and man should know when we crossed thirty  but then i should assert the spirit which dominated me i should resist arrest and insist upon bringing my ship back across the dead line remaining at my post until we had reached new york  then i should make a full report and with it a demand upon public opinion that the dead lines be wiped forever from the seas  i knew that i was right  i knew that no more loyal officer wore the uniform of the navy  i knew that i was a good officer and sailor and i didnt propose submitting to degradation and discharge because a lot of old preglacial fossils had declared over two hundred years before that no man should cross thirty  even while these thoughts were passing through my mind i was busy with the details of my duties  i had seen to it that a sea anchor was rigged and even now the men had completed their task and the coldwater was swinging around rapidly her nose pointing once more into the wind and the frightful rolling consequent upon her wallowing in the trough was happily diminishing  it was then that johnson came hurrying to the bridge  one of his eyes was swollen and already darkening and his lip was cut and bleeding without even the formality of a salute he burst upon me white with fury  lieutenant alvarez attacked me he cried  i demand that he be placed under arrest  i found him in the act of destroying the reserve instruments and when i would have interfered to protect them he fell upon me and beat me  i demand that you arrest him  you forget yourself mr johnson i said  you are not in command of the ship  i deplore the action of lieutenant alvarez but i cannot expunge from my mind the loyalty and selfsacrificing friendship which has prompted him to his acts  were i you sir i should profit by the example he has set  further mr johnson i intend retaining command of the ship even though she crosses thirty and i shall demand implicit obedience from every officer and man aboard until i am properly relieved from duty by a superior officer in the port of new york  you mean to say that you will cross thirty without submitting to arrest he almost shouted  i do sir i replied  and now you may go below and when again you find it necessary to address me you will please be so good as to bear in mind the fact that i am your commanding officer and as such entitled to a salute  he flushed hesitated a moment and then saluting turned upon his heel and left the bridge  shortly after alvarez appeared  he was pale and seemed to have aged ten years in the few brief minutes since i last had seen him  saluting he told me very simply what he had done and asked that i place him under arrest  i put my hand on his shoulder and i guess that my voice trembled a trifle as while reproving him for his act i made it plain to him that my gratitude was no less potent a force than his loyalty to me  then it was that i outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines and to take my ship back to new york myself  i did not ask him to share the responsibility with me  i merely stated that i should refuse to submit to arrest and that i should demand of him and every other officer and man implicit obedience to my every command until we docked at home  his face brightened at my words and he assured me that i would find him as ready to acknowledge my command upon the wrong side of thirty as upon the right an assurance which i hastened to tell him i did not need  the storm continued to rage for three days and as far as the wind scarce varied a point during all that time i knew that we must be far beyond thirty drifting rapidly east by south  all this time it had been impossible to work upon the damaged engines or the gravityscreen generators but we had a full set of instruments upon the bridge for alvarez after discovering my intentions had fetched the reserve instruments from his own cabin where he had hidden them  those which johnson had seen him destroy had been a third set which only alvarez had known was aboard the coldwater  we waited impatiently for the sun that we might determine our exact location and upon the fourth day our vigil was rewarded a few minutes before noon  every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous excitement as we awaited the result of the reading  the crew had known almost as soon as i that we were doomed to cross thirty and i am inclined to believe that every man jack of them was tickled to death for the spirits of adventure and romance still live in the hearts of men of the twentysecond century even though there be little for them to feed upon between thirty and one hundred seventyfive  the men carried none of the burdens of responsibility  they might cross thirty with impunity and doubtless they would return to be heroes at home but how different the homecoming of their commanding officer  the wind had dropped to a steady blow still from west by north and the sea had gone down correspondingly  the crew with the exception of those whose duties kept them below were ranged on deck below the bridge  when our position was definitely fixed i personally announced it to the eager waiting men  men i said stepping forward to the handrail and looking down into their upturned bronzed faces you are anxiously awaiting information as to the ships position  it has been determined at latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north longitude twenty degrees sixteen minutes west  i paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through the massed men beneath me  beyond thirty  but there will be no change in commanding officers in routine or in discipline until after we have docked again in new york  as i ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail there was a roar of applause from the deck such as i never before had heard aboard a ship of peace  it recalled to my mind tales that i had read of the good old days when naval vessels were built to fight when ships of peace had been manofwar and guns had flashed in other than futile target practice and decks had run red with blood  with the subsistence of the sea we were able to go to work upon the damaged engines to some effect and i also set men to examining the gravitationscreen generators with a view to putting them in working order should it prove not beyond our resources  for two weeks we labored at the engines which indisputably showed evidence of having been tampered with  i appointed a board to investigate and report upon the disaster  but it accomplished nothing other than to convince me that there were several officers upon it who were in full sympathy with johnson for though no charges had been preferred against him the board went out of its way specifically to exonerate him in its findings  all this time we were drifting almost due east  the work upon the engines had progressed to such an extent that within a few hours we might expect to be able to proceed under our own power westward in the direction of panamerican waters  to relieve the monotony i had taken to fishing and early that morning i had departed from the coldwater in one of the boats on such an excursion  a gentle west wind was blowing  the sea shimmered in the sunlight  a cloudless sky canopied the west for our sport as i had made it a point never voluntarily to make an inch toward the east that i could avoid  at least they should not be able to charge me with a willful violation of the dead lines regulation  i had with me only the boats ordinary complement of menthree in all and more than enough to handle any small power boat  i had not asked any of my officers to accompany me as i wished to be alone and very glad am i now that i had not  my only regret is that in view of what befell us it had been necessary to bring the three brave fellows who manned the boat  our fishing which proved excellent carried us so far to the west that we no longer could see the coldwater  the day wore on until at last about midafternoon i gave the order to return to the ship  we had proceeded but a short distance toward the east when one of the men gave an exclamation of excitement at the same time pointing eastward  we all looked on in the direction he had indicated and there a short distance above the horizon we saw the outlines of the coldwater silhouetted against the sky  theyve repaired the engines and the generators both exclaimed one of the men  it seemed impossible but yet it had evidently been done  only that morning lieutenant johnson had told me that he feared that it would be impossible to repair the generators  i had put him in charge of this work since he always had been accounted one of the best gravitationscreen men in the navy  he had invented several of the improvements that are incorporated in the later models of these generators and i am convinced that he knows more concerning both the theory and the practice of screening gravitation than any living panamerican  at the sight of the coldwater once more under control the three men burst into a glad cheer  but for some reason which i could not then account i was strangely overcome by a premonition of personal misfortune  it was not that i now anticipated an early return to panamerica and a board of inquiry for i had rather looked forward to the fight that must follow my return  no there was something else something indefinable and vague that cast a strange gloom upon me as i saw my ship rising farther above the water and making straight in our direction  i was not long in ascertaining a possible explanation of my depression for though we were plainly visible from the bridge of the aerosubmarine and to the hundreds of men who swarmed her deck the ship passed directly above us not five hundred feet from the water and sped directly westward  we all shouted and i fired my pistol to attract their attention though i knew full well that all who cared to had observed us but the ship moved steadily away growing smaller and smaller to our view until at last she passed completely out of sight    2   what could it mean  i had left alvarez in command  he was my most loyal subordinate  it was absolutely beyond the pale of possibility that alvarez should desert me  no there was some other explanation something occurred to place my second officer porfirio johnson in command  i was sure of it but why speculate  the futility of conjecture was only too palpable  the coldwater had abandoned us in midocean  doubtless none of us would survive to know why  the young man at the wheel of the power boat had turned her nose about as it became evident that the ship intended passing over us and now he still held her in futile pursuit of the coldwater  bring her about snider i directed and hold her due east  we cant catch the coldwater and we cant cross the atlantic in this our only hope lies in making the nearest land which unless i am mistaken is the scilly islands off the southwest coast of england ever heard of england snider  theres a part of the united states of north america that used to be known to the ancients as new england he replied  is that where you mean sir  no snider i replied  the england i refer to was an island off the continent of europe  it was the seat of a very powerful kingdom that flourished over two hundred years ago  a part of the united states of north america and all of the federated states of canada once belonged to this ancient england  europe breathed one of the men his voice tense with excitement my grandfather used to tell me stories of the world beyond thirty  he had been a great student and he had read much from forbidden books  in which i resemble your grandfather i said for i too have read more even than naval officers are supposed to read and as you men know we are permitted a greater latitude in the study of geography and history than men of other professions  among the books and papers of admiral porter turck who lived two hundred years ago and from whom i am descended many volumes still exist and are in my possession which deal with the history and geography of ancient europe  usually i bring several of these books with me upon a cruise and this time among others i have maps of europe and her surrounding waters  i was studying them as we came away from the coldwater this morning and luckily i have them with me  you are going to try to make europe sir asked taylor the young man who had last spoken  it is the nearest land i replied  i have always wanted to explore the forgotten lands of the eastern hemisphere  heres our chance  to remain at sea is to perish  none of us ever will see home again  let us make the best of it and enjoy while we do live that which is forbidden the balance of our racethe adventure and the mystery which lie beyond thirty  taylor and delcarte seized the spirit of my mood but snider i think was a trifle sceptical  it is treason sir i replied but there is no law which compels us to visit punishment upon ourselves  could we return to panamerica i should be the first to insist that we face it  but we know thats not possible  even if this craft would carry us so far we havent enough water or food for more than three days  we are doomed snider to die far from home and without ever again looking upon the face of another fellow countryman than those who sit here now in this boat  isnt that punishment sufficient for even the most exacting judge  even snider had to admit that it was  very well then let us live while we live and enjoy to the fullest whatever of adventure or pleasure each new day brings since any day may be our last and we shall be dead for a considerable while  i could see that snider was still fearful but taylor and delcarte responded with a hearty aye aye sir  they were of different mold  both were sons of naval officers  they represented the aristocracy of birth and they dared to think for themselves  snider was in the minority and so we continued toward the east beyond thirty and separated from my ship my authority ceased  i held leadership if i was to hold it at all by virtue of personal qualifications only but i did not doubt my ability to remain the director of our destinies in so far as they were amenable to human agencies  i have always led  while my brain and brawn remain unimpaired i shall continue always to lead  following is an art which turcks do not easily learn  it was not until the third day that we raised land dead ahead which i took from my map to be the isles of scilly  but such a gale was blowing that i did not dare attempt to land and so we passed to the north of them skirted lands end and entered the english channel  i think that up to that moment i had never experienced such a thrill as passed through me when i realized that i was navigating these historic waters  the lifelong dreams that i never had dared hope to see fulfilled were at last a realitybut under what forlorn circumstances  never could i return to my native land  to the end of my days i must remain in exile  yet even these thoughts failed to dampen my ardor  my eyes scanned the waters  to the north i could see the rockbound coast of cornwall  mine were the first american eyes to rest upon it for more than two hundred years  in vain i searched for some sign of ancient commerce that if history is to be believed must have dotted the bosom of the channel with white sails and blackened the heavens with the smoke of countless funnels but as far as eye could reach the tossing waters of the channel were empty and deserted  toward midnight the wind and sea abated so that shortly after dawn i determined to make inshore in an attempt to effect a landing for we were sadly in need of fresh water and food  according to my observations we were just off ram head and it was my intention to enter plymouth bay and visit plymouth  from my map it appeared that this city lay back from the coast a short distance and there was another city given as devonport which appeared to lie at the mouth of the river tamar  however i knew that it would make little difference which city we entered as the english people were famed of old for their hospitality toward visiting mariners  as we approached the mouth of the bay i looked for the fishing craft which i expected to see emerging thus early in the day for their labors  but even after we rounded ram head and were well within the waters of the bay i saw no vessel  neither was there buoy nor light nor any other mark to show larger ships the channel and i wondered much at this  the coast was densely overgrown nor was any building or sign of man apparent from the water  up the bay and into the river tamar we motored through a solitude as unbroken as that which rested upon the waters of the channel  for all we could see there was no indication that man had ever set his foot upon this silent coast  i was nonplused and then for the first time there crept over me an intuition of the truth  here was no sign of war  as far as this portion of the devon coast was concerned that seemed to have been over for many years but neither were there any people  yet i could not find it within myself to believe that i should find no inhabitants in england  reasoning thus i discovered that it was improbable that a state of war still existed and that the people all had been drawn from this portion of england to some other where they might better defend themselves against an invader  but what of their ancient coast defenses  what was there here in plymouth bay to prevent an enemy landing in force and marching where they wished  nothing  i could not believe that any enlightened military nation such as the ancient english are reputed to have been would have voluntarily so deserted an exposed coast and an excellent harbor to the mercies of an enemy  i found myself becoming more and more deeply involved in quandary  the puzzle which confronted me i could not unravel  we had landed and i now stood upon the spot where according to my map a large city should rear its spires and chimneys  there was nothing but rough broken ground covered densely with weeds and brambles and tall rank grass  had a city ever stood there no sign of it remained  the roughness and unevenness of the ground suggested something of a great mass of debris hidden by the accumulation of centuries of undergrowth  i drew the short cutlass with which both officers and men of the navy are as you know armed out of courtesy to the traditions and memories of the past and with its point dug into the loam about the roots of the vegetation growing at my feet  the blade entered the soil for a matter of seven inches when it struck upon something stonelike  digging about the obstacle i presently loosened it and when i had withdrawn it from its sepulcher i found the thing to be an ancient brick of clay baked in an oven  delcarte we had left in charge of the boat but snider and taylor were with me and following my example each engaged in the fascinating sport of prospecting for antiques  each of us uncovered a great number of these bricks until we commenced to weary of the monotony of it when snider suddenly gave an exclamation of excitement and as i turned to look he held up a human skull for my inspection  i took it from him and examined it  directly in the center of the forehead was a small round hole  the gentleman had evidently come to his end defending his country from an invader  snider again held aloft another trophy of the searcha metal spike and some tarnished and corroded metal ornaments  they had lain close beside the skull  with the point of his cutlass snider scraped the dirt and verdigris from the face of the larger ornament  an inscription he said and handed the thing to me  they were the spike and ornaments of an ancient german helmet  before long we had uncovered many other indications that a great battle had been fought upon the ground where we stood  but i was then and still am at loss to account for the presence of german soldiers upon the english coast so far from london which history suggests would have been the natural goal of an invader  i can only account for it by assuming that either england was temporarily conquered by the teutons or that an invasion of so vast proportions was undertaken that german troops were hurled upon the england coast in huge numbers and that landings were necessarily effected at many places simultaneously  subsequent discoveries tend to strengthen this view  we dug about for a short time with our cutlasses until i became convinced that a city had stood upon the spot at some time in the past and that beneath our feet crumbled and dead lay ancient devonport  i could not repress a sigh at the thought of the havoc war had wrought in this part of england at least  farther east nearer london we should find things very different  there would be the civilization that two centuries must have wrought upon our english cousins as they had upon us  there would be mighty cities cultivated fields happy people  there we would be welcomed as longlost brothers  there would we find a great nation anxious to learn of the world beyond their side of thirty as i had been anxious to learn of that which lay beyond our side of the dead line  i turned back toward the boat  come men i said  we will go up the river and fill our casks with fresh water search for food and fuel and then tomorrow be in readiness to push on toward the east  i am going to london    3   the report of a gun blasted the silence of a dead devonport with startling abruptness  it came from the direction of the launch and in an instant we three were running for the boat as fast as our legs would carry us  as we came in sight of it we saw delcarte a hundred yards inland from the launch leaning over something which lay upon the ground  as we called to him he waved his cap and stooping lifted a small deer for our inspection  i was about to congratulate him on his trophy when we were startled by a horrid halfhuman halfbestial scream a little ahead and to the right of us  it seemed to come from a clump of rank and tangled bush not far from where delcarte stood  it was a horrid fearsome sound the like of which never had fallen upon my ears before  we looked in the direction from which it came  the smile had died from delcartes lips  even at the distance we were from him i saw his face go suddenly white and he quickly threw his rifle to his shoulder  at the same moment the thing that had given tongue to the cry moved from the concealing brushwood far enough for us too to see it  both taylor and snider gave little gasps of astonishment and dismay  what is it sir asked the latter  the creature stood about the height of a tall mans waist and was long and gaunt and sinuous with a tawny coat striped with black and with white throat and belly  in conformation it was similar to a cata huge cat exaggerated colossal cat with fiendish eyes and the most devilish cast of countenance as it wrinkled its bristling snout and bared its great yellow fangs  it was pacing or rather slinking straight for delcarte who had now leveled his rifle upon it  what is it sir mumbled snider again and then a halfforgotten picture from an old natural history sprang to my mind and i recognized in the frightful beast the felis tigris of ancient asia specimens of which had in former centuries been exhibited in the western hemisphere  snider and taylor were armed with rifles and revolvers while i carried only a revolver  seizing sniders rifle from his trembling hands i called to taylor to follow me and together we ran forward shouting to attract the beasts attention from delcarte until we should all be quite close enough to attack with the greatest assurance of success  i cried to delcarte not to fire until we reached his side for i was fearful lest our small caliber steeljacketed bullets should far from killing the beast tend merely to enrage it still further  but he misunderstood me thinking that i had ordered him to fire  with the report of his rifle the tiger stopped short in apparent surprise then turned and bit savagely at its shoulder for an instant after which it wheeled again toward delcarte issuing the most terrific roars and screams and launched itself with incredible speed toward the brave fellow who now stood his ground pumping bullets from his automatic rifle as rapidly as the weapon would fire  taylor and i also opened up on the creature and as it was broadside to us it offered a splendid target though for all the impression we appeared to make upon the great cat we might as well have been launching soap bubbles at it  straight as a torpedo it rushed for delcarte and as taylor and i stumbled on through the tall grass toward our unfortunate comrade we saw the tiger rear upon him and crush him to the earth  not a backward step had the noble delcarte taken  two hundred years of peace had not sapped the red blood from his courageous line  he went down beneath that avalanche of bestial savagery still working his gun and with his face toward his antagonist  even in the instant that i thought him dead i could not help but feel a thrill of pride that he was one of my men one of my class a panamerican gentleman of birth and that he had demonstrated one of the principal contentions of the armyandnavy adherentsthat military training was necessary for the salvation of personal courage in the panamerican race which for generations had had to face no dangers more grave than those incident to ordinary life in a highly civilized community safeguarded by every means at the disposal of a perfectly organized and allpowerful government utilizing the best that advanced science could suggest  as we ran toward delcarte both taylor and i were struck by the fact that the beast upon him appeared not to be mauling him but lay quiet and motionless upon its prey and when we were quite close and the muzzles of our guns were at the animals head i saw the explanation of this sudden cessation of hostilitiesfelis tigris was dead  one of our bullets or one of the last that delcarte fired had penetrated the heart and the beast had died even as it sprawled forward crushing delcarte to the ground  a moment later with our assistance the man had scrambled from beneath the carcass of his wouldbe slayer without a scratch to indicate how close to death he had been  delcartes buoyance was entirely unruffled  he came from under the tiger with a broad grin on his handsome face nor could i perceive that a muscle trembled or that his voice showed the least indication of nervousness or excitement  with the termination of the adventure we began to speculate upon the explanation of the presence of this savage brute at large so great a distance from its native habitat  my readings had taught me that it was practically unknown outside of asia and that so late as the twentieth century at least there had been no savage beasts outside captivity in england  as we talked snider joined us and i returned his rifle to him taylor and delcarte picked up the slain deer and we all started down toward the launch walking slowly  delcarte wanted to fetch the tigers skin but i had to deny him permission since we had no means to properly cure it  upon the beach we skinned the deer and cut away as much meat as we thought we could dispose of and as we were again embarking to continue up the river for fresh water and fuel we were startled by a series of screams from the bushes a short distance away  another felis tigris said taylor  or a dozen of them supplemented delcarte and even as he spoke there leaped into sight one after another eight of the beasts full grownmagnificent specimens  at the sight of us they came charging down like infuriated demons  i saw that three rifles would be no match for them and so i gave the word to put out from shore hoping that the tiger as the ancients called him could not swim  sure enough they all halted at the beach pacing back and forth uttering fiendish cries and glaring at us in the most malevolent manner  as we motored away we presently heard the calls of similar animals far inland  they seemed to be answering the cries of their fellows at the waters edge and from the wide distribution and great volume of the sound we came to the conclusion that enormous numbers of these beasts must roam the adjacent country  they have eaten up the inhabitants murmured snider shuddering  i imagine you are right i agreed for their extreme boldness and fearlessness in the presence of man would suggest either that man is entirely unknown to them or that they are extremely familiar with him as their natural and most easily procured prey  but where did they come from asked delcarte  could they have traveled here from asia  i shook my head  the thing was a puzzle to me  i knew that it was practically beyond reason to imagine that tigers had crossed the mountain ranges and rivers and all the great continent of europe to travel this far from their native lairs and entirely impossible that they should have crossed the english channel at all  yet here they were and in great numbers  we continued up the tamar several miles filled our casks and then landed to cook some of our deer steak and have the first square meal that had fallen to our lot since the coldwater deserted us  but scarce had we built our fire and prepared the meat for cooking than snider whose eyes had been constantly roving about the landscape from the moment that we left the launch touched me on the arm and pointed to a clump of bushes which grew a couple of hundred yards away  half concealed behind their screening foliage i saw the yellow and black of a big tiger and as i looked the beast stalked majestically toward us  a moment later he was followed by another and another and it is needless to state that we beat a hasty retreat to the launch  the country was apparently infested by these huge carnivora for after three other attempts to land and cook our food we were forced to abandon the idea entirely as each time we were driven off by hunting tigers  it was also equally impossible to obtain the necessary ingredients for our chemical fuel and as we had very little left aboard we determined to step our folding mast and proceed under sail hoarding our fuel supply for use in emergencies  i may say that it was with no regret that we bid adieu to tigerland as we rechristened the ancient devon and beating out into the channel turned the launchs nose southeast to round bolt head and continue up the coast toward the strait of dover and the north sea  i was determined to reach london as soon as possible that we might obtain fresh clothing meet with cultured people and learn from the lips of englishmen the secrets of the two centuries since the east had been divorced from the west  our first stopping place was the isle of wight  we entered the solent about ten oclock one morning and i must confess that my heart sank as we came close to shore  no lighthouse was visible though one was plainly indicated upon my map  upon neither shore was sign of human habitation  we skirted the northern shore of the island in fruitless search for man and then at last landed upon an eastern point where newport should have stood but where only weeds and great trees and tangled wild wood rioted and not a single manmade thing was visible to the eye  before landing i had the men substitute soft bullets for the steeljacketed projectiles with which their belts and magazines were filled  thus equipped we felt upon more even terms with the tigers but there was no sign of the tigers and i decided that they must be confined to the mainland  after eating we set out in search of fuel leaving taylor to guard the launch  for some reason i could not trust snider alone  i knew that he looked with disapproval upon my plan to visit england and i did not know but what at his first opportunity he might desert us taking the launch with him and attempt to return to panamerica  that he would be fool enough to venture it i did not doubt  we had gone inland for a mile or more and were passing through a parklike wood when we came suddenly upon the first human beings we had seen since we sighted the english coast  there were a score of men in the party  hairy halfnaked men they were resting in the shade of a great tree  at the first sight of us they sprang to their feet with wild yells seizing long spears that had lain beside them as they rested  for a matter of fifty yards they ran from us as rapidly as they could and then they turned and surveyed us for a moment  evidently emboldened by the scarcity of our numbers they commenced to advance upon us brandishing their spears and shouting horribly  they were short and muscular of build with long hair and beards tangled and matted with filth  their heads however were shapely and their eyes though fierce and warlike were intelligent  appreciation of these physical attributes came later of course when i had better opportunity to study the men at close range and under circumstances less fraught with danger and excitement  at the moment i saw and with unmixed wonder only a score of wild savages charging down upon us where i had expected to find a community of civilized and enlightened people  each of us was armed with rifle revolver and cutlass but as we stood shoulder to shoulder facing the wild men i was loath to give the command to fire upon them inflicting death or suffering upon strangers with whom we had no quarrel and so i attempted to restrain them for the moment that we might parley with them  to this end i raised my left hand above my head with the palm toward them as the most natural gesture indicative of peaceful intentions which occurred to me  at the same time i called aloud to them that we were friends though from their appearance there was nothing to indicate that they might understand panamerican or ancient english which are of course practically identical  at my gesture and words they ceased their shouting and came to a halt a few paces from us  then in deep tones one who was in advance of the others and whom i took to be the chief or leader of the party replied in a tongue which while intelligible to us was so distorted from the english language from which it evidently had sprung that it was with difficulty that we interpreted it  who are you he asked and from what country  i told him that we were from panamerica but he only shook his head and asked where that was  he had never heard of it or of the atlantic ocean which i told him separated his country from mine  it has been two hundred years i told him since a panamerican visited england  england he asked  what is england  why this is a part of england i exclaimed  this is grubitten he assured me  i know nothing about england and i have lived here all my life  it was not until long after that the derivation of grubitten occurred to me  unquestionably it is a corruption of great britain a name formerly given to the large island comprising england scotland and wales  subsequently we heard it pronounced grabrittin and grubritten  i then asked the fellow if he could direct us to ryde or newport but again he shook his head and said that he never had heard of such countries  and when i asked him if there were any cities in this country he did not know what i meant never having heard the word cities  i explained my meaning as best i could by stating that by city i referred to a place where many people lived together in houses  oh he exclaimed you mean a camp  yes there are two great camps here east camp and west camp  we are from east camp  the use of the word camp to describe a collection of habitations naturally suggested war to me and my next question was as to whether the war was over and who had been victorious  no he replied to this question  the war is not yet over  but it soon will be and it will end as it always does with the westenders running away  we the eastenders are always victorious  no i said seeing that he referred to the petty tribal wars of his little island i mean the great war the war with germany  is it endedand who was victorious  he shook his head impatiently  i never heard he said of any of these strange countries of which you speak  it seemed incredible and yet it was true  these people living at the very seat of the great war knew nothing of it though but two centuries had passed since to our knowledge it had been running in the height of its titanic frightfulness all about them and to us upon the far side of the atlantic still was a subject of keen interest  here was a lifelong inhabitant of the isle of wight who never had heard of either germany or england  i turned to him quite suddenly with a new question  what people live upon the mainland i asked and pointed in the direction of the hants coast  no one lives there he replied  long ago it is said my people dwelt across the waters upon that other land but the wild beasts devoured them in such numbers that finally they were driven here paddling across upon logs and driftwood nor has any dared return since because of the frightful creatures which dwell in that horrid country  do no other peoples ever come to your country in ships i asked  he never heard the word ship before and did not know its meaning  but he assured me that until we came he had thought that there were no other peoples in the world other than the grubittens who consist of the eastenders and the westenders of the ancient isle of wight  assured that we were inclined to friendliness our new acquaintances led us to their village or as they call it camp  there we found a thousand people perhaps dwelling in rude shelters and living upon the fruits of the chase and such sea food as is obtainable close to shore for they had no boats nor any knowledge of such things  their weapons were most primitive consisting of rude spears tipped with pieces of metal pounded roughly into shape  they had no literature no religion and recognized no law other than the law of might  they produced fire by striking a bit of flint and steel together but for the most part they ate their food raw  marriage is unknown among them and while they have the word mother they did not know what i meant by father  the males fight for the favor of the females  they practice infanticide and kill the aged and physically unfit  the family consists of the mother and the children the men dwelling sometimes in one hut and sometimes in another  owing to their bloody duels they are always numerically inferior to the women so there is shelter for them all  we spent several hours in the village where we were objects of the greatest curiosity  the inhabitants examined our clothing and all our belongings and asked innumerable questions concerning the strange country from which we had come and the manner of our coming  i questioned many of them concerning past historical events but they knew nothing beyond the narrow limits of their island and the savage primitive life they led there  london they had never heard of and they assured me that i would find no human beings upon the mainland  much saddened by what i had seen i took my departure from them and the three of us made our way back to the launch accompanied by about five hundred men women girls and boys  as we sailed away after procuring the necessary ingredients of our chemical fuel the grubittens lined the shore in silent wonder at the strange sight of our dainty craft dancing over the sparkling waters and watched us until we were lost to their sight    4   it was during the morning of july 6 2137 that we entered the mouth of the thamesto the best of my knowledge the first western keel to cut those historic waters for two hundred and twentyone years  but where were the tugs and the lighters and the barges the lightships and the buoys and all those countless attributes which went to make up the myriad life of the ancient thames  gone  all gone  only silence and desolation reigned where once the commerce of the world had centered  i could not help but compare this once great waterway with the waters about our new york or rio or san diego or valparaiso  they had become what they are today during the two centuries of the profound peace which we of the navy have been prone to deplore  and what during this same period had shorn the waters of the thames of their pristine grandeur  militarist that i am i could find but a single word of explanationwar  i bowed my head and turned my eyes downward from the lonely and depressing sight and in a silence which none of us seemed willing to break we proceeded up the deserted river  we had reached a point which from my map i imagined must have been about the former site of erith when i discovered a small band of antelope a short distance inland  as we were now entirely out of meat once more and as i had given up all expectations of finding a city upon the site of ancient london i determined to land and bag a couple of the animals  assured that they would be timid and easily frightened i decided to stalk them alone telling the men to wait at the boat until i called to them to come and carry the carcasses back to the shore  crawling carefully through the vegetation making use of such trees and bushes as afforded shelter i came at last almost within easy range of my quarry when the antlered head of the buck went suddenly into the air and then as though in accordance with a prearranged signal the whole band moved slowly off farther inland  as their pace was leisurely i determined to follow them until i came again within range as i was sure that they would stop and feed in a short time  they must have led me a mile or more at least before they again halted and commenced to browse upon the rank luxuriant grasses  all the time that i had followed them i had kept both eyes and ears alert for sign or sound that would indicate the presence of felis tigris but so far not the slightest indication of the beast had been apparent  as i crept closer to the antelope sure this time of a good shot at a large buck i suddenly saw something that caused me to forget all about my prey in wonderment  it was the figure of an immense greyblack creature rearing its colossal shoulders twelve or fourteen feet above the ground  never in my life had i seen such a beast nor did i at first recognize it so different in appearance is the live reality from the stuffed unnatural specimens preserved to us in our museums  but presently i guessed the identity of the mighty creature as elephas africanus or as the ancients commonly described it african elephant  the antelope although in plain view of the huge beast paid not the slightest attention to it and i was so wrapped up in watching the mighty pachyderm that i quite forgot to shoot at the buck and presently and in quite a startling manner it became impossible to do so  the elephant was browsing upon the young and tender shoots of some low bushes waving his great ears and switching his short tail  the antelope scarce twenty paces from him continued their feeding when suddenly from close beside the latter there came a most terrifying roar and i saw a great tawny body shoot from the concealing verdure beyond the antelope full upon the back of a small buck  instantly the scene changed from one of quiet and peace to indescribable chaos  the startled and terrified buck uttered cries of agony  his fellows broke and leaped off in all directions  the elephant raised his trunk and trumpeting loudly lumbered off through the wood crushing down small trees and trampling bushes in his mad flight  growling horribly a huge lion stood across the body of his preysuch a creature as no panamerican of the twentysecond century had ever beheld until my eyes rested upon this lordly specimen of the king of beasts  but what a different creature was this fierceeyed demon palpitating with life and vigor glossy of coat alert growling magnificent from the dingy motheaten replicas beneath their glass cases in the stuffy halls of our public museums  i had never hoped or expected to see a living lion tiger or elephantusing the common terms that were familiar to the ancients since they seem to me less unwieldy than those now in general use among usand so it was with sentiments not unmixed with awe that i stood gazing at this regal beast as above the carcass of his kill he roared out his challenge to the world  so enthralled was i by the spectacle that i quite forgot myself and the better to view him the great lion i had risen to my feet and stood not fifty paces from him in full view  for a moment he did not see me his attention being directed toward the retreating elephant and i had ample time to feast my eyes upon his splendid proportions his great head and his thick black mane  ah what thoughts passed through my mind in those brief moments as i stood there in rapt fascination  i had come to find a wondrous civilization and instead i found a wildbeast monarch of the realm where english kings had ruled  a lion reigned undisturbed within a few miles of the seat of one of the greatest governments the world has ever known his domain a howling wilderness where yesterday fell the shadows of the largest city in the world  it was appalling but my reflections upon this depressing subject were doomed to sudden extinction  the lion had discovered me  for an instant he stood silent and motionless as one of the mangy effigies at home but only for an instant  then with a most ferocious roar and without the slightest hesitancy or warning he charged upon me  he forsook the prey already dead beneath him for the pleasures of the delectable tidbit man  from the remorselessness with which the great carnivora of modern england hunted man i am constrained to believe that whatever their appetites in times past they have cultivated a gruesome taste for human flesh  as i threw my rifle to my shoulder i thanked god the ancient god of my ancestors that i had replaced the hardjacketed bullets in my weapon with softnosed projectiles for though this was my first experience with felis leo i knew the moment that i faced that charge that even my wonderfully perfected firearm would be as futile as a peashooter unless i chanced to place my first bullet in a vital spot  unless you had seen it you could not believe credible the speed of a charging lion  apparently the animal is not built for speed nor can he maintain it for long  but for a matter of forty or fifty yards there is i believe no animal on earth that can overtake him  like a bolt he bore down upon me but fortunately for me i did not lose my head  i guessed that no bullet would kill him instantly  i doubted that i could pierce his skull  there was hope though in finding his heart through his exposed chest or better yet of breaking his shoulder or foreleg and bringing him up long enough to pump more bullets into him and finish him  i covered his left shoulder and pulled the trigger as he was almost upon me  it stopped him  with a terrific howl of pain and rage the brute rolled over and over upon the ground almost to my feet  as he came i pumped two more bullets into him and as he struggled to rise clawing viciously at me i put a bullet in his spine  that finished him and i am free to admit that i was mighty glad of it there was a great tree close behind me and stepping within its shade i leaned against it wiping the perspiration from my face for the day was hot and the exertion and excitement left me exhausted  i stood there resting for a moment preparatory to turning and retracing my steps to the launch when without warning something whizzed through space straight toward me  there was a dull thud of impact as it struck the tree and as i dodged to one side and turned to look at the thing i saw a heavy spear imbedded in the wood not three inches from where my head had been  the thing had come from a little to one side of me and without waiting to investigate at the instant i leaped behind the tree and circling it peered around the other side to get a sight of my wouldbe murderer  this time i was pitted against menthe spear told me that all too plainlybut so long as they didnt take me unawares or from behind i had little fear of them  cautiously i edged about the far side of the trees until i could obtain a view of the spot from which the spear must have come and when i did i saw the head of a man just emerging from behind a bush  the fellow was quite similar in type to those i had seen upon the isle of wight  he was hairy and unkempt and as he finally stepped into view i saw that he was garbed in the same primitive fashion  he stood for a moment gazing about in search of me and then he advanced  as he did so a number of others precisely like him stepped from the concealing verdure of nearby bushes and followed in his wake keeping the trees between them and me i ran back a short distance until i found a clump of underbrush that would effectually conceal me for i wished to discover the strength of the party and its armament before attempting to parley with it  the useless destruction of any of these poor creatures was the farthest idea from my mind  i should have liked to have spoken with them but i did not care to risk having to use my highpowered rifle upon them other than in the last extremity  once in my new place of concealment i watched them as they approached the tree  there were about thirty men in the party and one womana girl whose hands seemed to be bound behind her and who was being pulled along by two of the men  they came forward warily peering cautiously into every bush and halting often  at the body of the lion they paused and i could see from their gesticulations and the higher pitch of their voices that they were much excited over my kill  but presently they resumed their search for me and as they advanced i became suddenly aware of the unnecessary brutality with which the girls guards were treating her  she stumbled once not far from my place of concealment and after the balance of the party had passed me as she did so one of the men at her side jerked her roughly to her feet and struck her across the mouth with his fist  instantly my blood boiled and forgetting every consideration of caution i leaped from my concealment and springing to the mans side felled him with a blow  so unexpected had been my act that it found him and his fellow unprepared but instantly the latter drew the knife that protruded from his belt and lunged viciously at me at the same time giving voice to a wild cry of alarm  the girl shrank back at sight of me her eyes wide in astonishment and then my antagonist was upon me  i parried his first blow with my forearm at the same time delivering a powerful blow to his jaw that sent him reeling back but he was at me again in an instant though in the brief interim i had time to draw my revolver  i saw his companion crawling slowly to his feet and the others of the party racing down upon me  there was no time to argue now other than with the weapons we wore and so as the fellow lunged at me again with the wickedlooking knife i covered his heart and pulled the trigger  without a sound he slipped to the earth and then i turned the weapon upon the other guard who was now about to attack me  he too collapsed and i was alone with the astonished girl  the balance of the party was some twenty paces from us but coming rapidly  i seized her arm and drew her after me behind a nearby tree for i had seen that with both their comrades down the others were preparing to launch their spears  with the girl safe behind the tree i stepped out in sight of the advancing foe shouting to them that i was no enemy and that they should halt and listen to me  but for answer they only yelled in derision and launched a couple of spears at me both of which missed  i saw then that i must fight yet still i hated to slay them and it was only as a final resort that i dropped two of them with my rifle bringing the others to a temporary halt  again i appealed to them to desist  but they only mistook my solicitude for them for fear and with shouts of rage and derision leaped forward once again to overwhelm me  it was now quite evident that i must punish them severely ormyselfdie and relinquish the girl once more to her captors neither of these things had i the slightest notion of doing and so i again stepped from behind the tree and with all the care and deliberation of target practice i commenced picking off the foremost of my assailants  one by one the wild men dropped yet on came the others fierce and vengeful until only a few remaining these seemed to realize the futility of combating my modern weapon with their primitive spears and still howling wrathfully withdrew toward the west  now for the first time i had an opportunity to turn my attention toward the girl who had stood silent and motionless behind me as i pumped death into my enemies and hers from my automatic rifle  she was of medium height well formed and with fine clearcut features  her forehead was high and her eyes both intelligent and beautiful  exposure to the sun had browned a smooth and velvety skin to a shade which seemed to enhance rather than mar an altogether lovely picture of youthful femininity  a trace of apprehension marked her expressioni cannot call it fear since i have learned to know herand astonishment was still apparent in her eyes  she stood quite erect her hands still bound behind her and met my gaze with level proud return  what language do you speak i asked  do you understand mine  yes she replied  it is similar to my own  i am grabritin  what are you  i am a panamerican i answered  she shook her head  what is that  i pointed toward the west  far away across the ocean  her expression altered a trifle  a slight frown contracted her brow the expression of apprehension deepened  take off your cap she said and when to humor her strange request i did as she bid she appeared relieved  then she edged to one side and leaned over seemingly to peer behind me  i turned quickly to see what she discovered but finding nothing wheeled about to see that her expression was once more altered  you are not from there and she pointed toward the east  it was a half question  you are not from across the water there  no i assured her  i am from panamerica far away to the west have you ever heard of panamerica  she shook her head in negation  i do not care where you are from she explained if you are not from there and i am sure you are not for the men from there have horns and tails  it was with difficulty that i restrained a smile  who are the men from there i asked  they are bad men she replied  some of my people do not believe that there are such creatures  but we have a legenda very old old legend that once the men from there came across to grabritin  they came upon the water and under the water and even in the air  they came in great numbers so that they rolled across the land like a great gray fog  they brought with them thunder and lightning and smoke that killed and they fell upon us and slew our people by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands  but at last we drove them back to the waters edge back into the sea where many were drowned  some escaped and these our people followedmen women and even children we followed them back  that is all  the legend says our people never returned  maybe they were all killed  maybe they are still there but this also is in the legend that as we drove the men back across the water they swore that they would return and that when they left our shores they would leave no human being alive behind them  i was afraid that you were from there  by what name were these men called i asked  we call them only the men from there she replied pointing toward the east  i have never heard that they had another name  in the light of what i knew of ancient history it was not difficult for me to guess the nationality of those she described simply as the men from over there  but what utter and appalling devastation the great war must have wrought to have erased not only every sign of civilization from the face of this great land but even the name of the enemy from the knowledge and language of the people  i could only account for it on the hypothesis that the country had been entirely depopulated except for a few scattered and forgotten children who in some marvelous manner had been preserved by providence to repopulate the land  these children had doubtless been too young to retain in their memories to transmit to their children any but the vaguest suggestion of the cataclysm which had overwhelmed their parents  professor cortoran since my return to panamerica has suggested another theory which is not entirely without claim to serious consideration  he points out that it is quite beyond the pale of human instinct to desert little children as my theory suggests the ancient english must have done  he is more inclined to believe that the expulsion of the foe from england was synchronous with widespread victories by the allies upon the continent and that the people of england merely emigrated from their ruined cities and their devastated blooddrenched fields to the mainland in the hope of finding in the domain of the conquered enemy cities and farms which would replace those they had lost  the learned professor assumes that while a longcontinued war had strengthened rather than weakened the instinct of paternal devotion it had also dulled other humanitarian instincts and raised to the first magnitude the law of the survival of the fittest with the result that when the exodus took place the strong the intelligent and the cunning together with their offspring crossed the waters of the channel or the north sea to the continent leaving in unhappy england only the helpless inmates of asylums for the feebleminded and insane  my objections to this that the present inhabitants of england are mentally fit and could therefore not have descended from an ancestry of undiluted lunacy he brushes aside with the assertion that insanity is not necessarily hereditary and that even though it was in many cases a return to natural conditions from the state of high civilization which is thought to have induced mental disease in the ancient world would after several generations have thoroughly expunged every trace of the affliction from the brains and nerves of the descendants of the original maniacs  personally i do not place much stock in professor cortorans theory though i admit that i am prejudiced  naturally one does not care to believe that the object of his greatest affection is descended from a gibbering idiot and a raving maniac  but i am forgetting the continuity of my narrativea continuity which i desire to maintain though i fear that i shall often be led astray so numerous and varied are the bypaths of speculation which lead from the present day story of the grabritins into the mysterious past of their forbears  as i stood talking with the girl i presently recollected that she still was bound and with a word of apology i drew my knife and cut the rawhide thongs which confined her wrists at her back  she thanked me and with such a sweet smile that i should have been amply repaid by it for a much more arduous service  and now i said let me accompany you to your home and see you safely again under the protection of your friends  no she said with a hint of alarm in her voice you must not come with mebuckingham will kill you  buckingham  the name was famous in ancient english history  its survival with many other illustrious names is one of the strongest arguments in refutal of professor cortorans theory yet it opens no new doors to the past and on the whole rather adds to than dissipates the mystery  and who is buckingham i asked and why should he wish to kill me  he would think that you had stolen me she replied and as he wishes me for himself he will kill any other whom he thinks desires me  he killed wettin a few days ago  my mother told me once that wettin was my father  he was king  now buckingham is king  here evidently were a people slightly superior to those of the isle of wight  these must have at least the rudiments of civilized government since they recognized one among them as ruler with the title king  also they retained the word father  the girls pronunciation while far from identical with ours was much closer than the tortured dialect of the eastenders of the isle of wight  the longer i talked with her the more hopeful i became of finding here among her people some records or traditions which might assist in clearing up the historic enigma of the past two centuries  i asked her if we were far from the city of london but she did not know what i meant  when i tried to explain describing mighty buildings of stone and brick broad avenues parks palaces and countless people she but shook her head sadly  there is no such place near by she said  only the camp of the lions has places of stone where the beasts lair but there are no people in the camp of the lions  who would dare go there  and she shuddered  the camp of the lions i repeated  and where is that and what  it is there she said pointing up the river toward the west  i have seen it from a great distance but i have never been there  we are much afraid of the lions for this is their country and they are angry that man has come to live here  far away there and she pointed toward the southwest is the land of tigers which is even worse than this the land of the lions for the tigers are more numerous than the lions and hungrier for human flesh  there were tigers here long ago but both the lions and the men set upon them and drove them off  where did these savage beasts come from i asked  oh she replied they have been here always  it is their country  do they not kill and eat your people i asked  often when we meet them by accident and we are too few to slay them or when one goes too close to their camp  but seldom do they hunt us for they find what food they need among the deer and wild cattle and too we make them gifts for are we not intruders in their country really we live upon good terms with them though i should not care to meet one were there not many spears in my party  i should like to visit this camp of the lions i said  oh no you must not cried the girl  that would be terrible  they would eat you  for a moment then she seemed lost in thought but presently she turned upon me with you must go now for any minute buckingham may come in search of me  long since should they have learned that i am gone from the campthey watch over me very closelyand they will set out after me  go  i shall wait here until they come in search of me  no i told her  ill not leave you alone in a land infested by lions and other wild beasts  if you wont let me go as far as your camp with you then ill wait here until they come in search of you  please go she begged  you have saved me and i would save you but nothing will save you if buckingham gets his hands on you  he is a bad man  he wishes to have me for his woman so that he may be king  he would kill anyone who befriended me for fear that i might become anothers  didnt you say that buckingham is already the king i asked  he is  he took my mother for his woman after he had killed wettin but my mother will die soonshe is very oldand then the man to whom i belong will become king  finally after much questioning i got the thing through my head  it appears that the line of descent is through the women  a man is merely head of his wifes familythat is all  if she chances to be the oldest female member of the royal house he is king  very naively the girl explained that there was seldom any doubt as to whom a childs mother was  this accounted for the girls importance in the community and for buckinghams anxiety to claim her though she told me that she did not wish to become his woman for he was a bad man and would make a bad king  but he was powerful and there was no other man who dared dispute his wishes  why not come with me i suggested if you do not wish to become buckinghams  where would you take me she asked  where indeed  i had not thought of that  but before i could reply to her question she shook her head and said no i cannot leave my people  i must stay and do my best even if buckingham gets me but you must go at once  do not wait until it is too late  the lions have had no offering for a long time and buckingham would seize upon the first stranger as a gift to them  i did not perfectly understand what she meant and was about to ask her when a heavy body leaped upon me from behind and great arms encircled my neck  i struggled to free myself and turn upon my antagonist but in another instant i was overwhelmed by a half dozen powerful halfnaked men while a score of others surrounded me a couple of whom seized the girl  i fought as best i could for my liberty and for hers but the weight of numbers was too great though i had the satisfaction at least of giving them a good fight  when they had overpowered me and i stood my hands bound behind me at the girls side she gazed commiseratingly at me  it is too bad that you did not do as i bid you she said for now it has happened just as i fearedbuckingham has you  which is buckingham i asked  i am buckingham growled a burly unwashed brute swaggering truculently before me  and who are you who would have stolen my woman  the girl spoke up then and tried to explain that i had not stolen her but on the contrary i had saved her from the men from the elephant country who were carrying her away  buckingham only sneered at her explanation and a moment later gave the command that started us all off toward the west  we marched for a matter of an hour or so coming at last to a collection of rude huts fashioned from branches of trees covered with skins and grasses and sometimes plastered with mud  all about the camp they had erected a wall of saplings pointed at the tops and fire hardened  this palisade was a protection against both man and beasts and within it dwelt upward of two thousand persons the shelters being built very close together and sometimes partially underground like deep trenches with the poles and hides above merely as protection from the sun and rain  the older part of the camp consisted almost wholly of trenches as though this had been the original form of dwellings which was slowly giving way to the drier and airier surface domiciles  in these trench habitations i saw a survival of the military trenches which formed so famous a part of the operation of the warring nations during the twentieth century  the women wore a single light deerskin about their hips for it was summer and quite warm  the men too were clothed in a single garment usually the pelt of some beast of prey  the hair of both men and women was confined by a rawhide thong passing about the forehead and tied behind  in this leathern band were stuck feathers flowers or the tails of small mammals  all wore necklaces of the teeth or claws of wild beasts and there were numerous metal wristlets and anklets among them  they wore in fact every indication of a most primitive peoplea race which had not yet risen to the heights of agriculture or even the possession of domestic animals  they were huntersthe lowest plane in the evolution of the human race of which science takes cognizance  and yet as i looked at their well shaped heads their handsome features and their intelligent eyes it was difficult to believe that i was not among my own  it was only when i took into consideration their mode of living their scant apparel the lack of every least luxury among them that i was forced to admit that they were in truth but ignorant savages  buckingham had relieved me of my weapons though he had not the slightest idea of their purpose or uses and when we reached the camp he exhibited both me and my arms with every indication of pride in this great capture  the inhabitants flocked around me examining my clothing and exclaiming in wonderment at each new discovery of button buckle pocket and flap  it seemed incredible that such a thing could be almost within a stones throw of the spot where but a brief two centuries before had stood the greatest city of the world  they bound me to a small tree that grew in the middle of one of their crooked streets but the girl they released as soon as we had entered the enclosure  the people greeted her with every mark of respect as she hastened to a large hut near the center of the camp  presently she returned with a fine looking whitehaired woman who proved to be her mother  the older woman carried herself with a regal dignity that seemed quite remarkable in a place of such primitive squalor  the people fell aside as she approached making a wide way for her and her daughter  when they had come near and stopped before me the older woman addressed me  my daughter has told me she said of the manner in which you rescued her from the men of the elephant country  if wettin lived you would be well treated but buckingham has taken me now and is king you can hope for nothing from such a beast as buckingham  the fact that buckingham stood within a pace of us and was an interested listener appeared not to temper her expressions in the slightest  buckingham is a pig she continued  he is a coward  he came upon wettin from behind and ran his spear through him  he will not be king for long  some one will make a face at him and he will run away and jump into the river  the people began to titter and clap their hands  buckingham became red in the face  it was evident that he was far from popular  if he dared went on the old lady he would kill me now but he does not dare  he is too great a coward  if i could help you i should gladly do so  but i am only queenthe vehicle that has helped carry down unsullied the royal blood from the days when grabritin was a mighty country  the old queens words had a noticeable effect upon the mob of curious savages which surrounded me  the moment they discovered that the old queen was friendly to me and that i had rescued her daughter they commenced to accord me a more friendly interest and i heard many words spoken in my behalf and demands were made that i not be harmed  but now buckingham interfered  he had no intention of being robbed of his prey  blustering and storming he ordered the people back to their huts at the same time directing two of his warriors to confine me in a dugout in one of the trenches close to his own shelter  here they threw me upon the ground binding my ankles together and trussing them up to my wrists behind  there they left me lying upon my stomacha most uncomfortable and strained position to which was added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh  just a few days ago my mind had been filled with the anticipation of the friendly welcome i should find among the cultured englishmen of london  today i should be sitting in the place of honor at the banquet board of one of londons most exclusive clubs feted and lionized  the actuality  here i lay bound hand and foot doubtless almost upon the very site of a part of ancient london yet all about me was a primeval wilderness and i was a captive of halfnaked wild men  i wondered what had become of delcarte and taylor and snider  would they search for me  they could never find me i feared yet if they did what could they accomplish against this horde of savage warriors  would that i could warn them  i thought of the girldoubtless she could get word to them but how was i to communicate with her  would she come to see me before i was killed  it seemed incredible that she should not make some slight attempt to befriend me yet as i recalled she had made no effort to speak with me after we had reached the village  she had hastened to her mother the moment she had been liberated  though she had returned with the old queen she had not spoken to me even then  i began to have my doubts  finally i came to the conclusion that i was absolutely friendless except for the old queen  for some unaccountable reason my rage against the girl for her ingratitude rose to colossal proportions  for a long time i waited for some one to come to my prison whom i might ask to bear word to the queen but i seemed to have been forgotten the strained position in which i lay became unbearable  i wriggled and twisted until i managed to turn myself partially upon my side where i lay half facing the entrance to the dugout  presently my attention was attracted by the shadow of something moving in the trench without and a moment later the figure of a child appeared creeping upon all fours as wideeyed and prompted by childish curiosity a little girl crawled to the entrance of my hut and peered cautiously and fearfully in  i did not speak at first for fear of frightening the little one away but when i was satisfied that her eyes had become sufficiently accustomed to the subdued light of the interior i smiled  instantly the expression of fear faded from her eyes to be replaced with an answering smile  who are you little girl i asked  my name is mary she replied  i am victorys sister  and who is victory  you do not know who victory is she asked in astonishment  i shook my head in negation  you saved her from the elephant country people and yet you say you do not know her she exclaimed  oh so she is victory and you are her sister  i have not heard her name before  that is why i did not know whom you meant i explained here was just the messenger for me  fate was becoming more kind  will you do something for me mary i asked  if i can  go to your mother the queen and ask her to come to me i said  i have a favor to ask  she said that she would and with a parting smile she left me  for what seemed many hours i awaited her return chafing with impatience  the afternoon wore on and night came and yet no one came near me  my captors brought me neither food nor water  i was suffering considerable pain where the rawhide thongs cut into my swollen flesh  i thought that they had either forgotten me or that it was their intention to leave me here to die of starvation  once i heard a great uproar in the village  men were shoutingwomen were screaming and moaning  after a time this subsided and again there was a long interval of silence  half the night must have been spent when i heard a sound in the trench near the hut  it resembled muffled sobs  presently a figure appeared silhouetted against the lesser darkness beyond the doorway  it crept inside the hut  are you here whispered a childlike voice  it was mary  she had returned  the thongs no longer hurt me  the pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared  i realized that it had been loneliness from which i suffered most  mary i exclaimed  you are a good girl  you have come back after all  i had commenced to think that you would not  did you give my message to the queen  will she come  where is she  the childs sobs increased and she flung herself upon the dirt floor of the hut apparently overcome by grief  what is it i asked  why do you cry  the queen my mother will not come to you she said between sobs she is dead  buckingham has killed her  now he will take victory for victory is queen  he kept us fastened up in our shelter for fear that victory would escape him but i dug a hole beneath the back wall and got out  i came to you because you saved victory once before and i thought that you might save her again and me also  tell me that you will  i am bound and helpless mary i replied  otherwise i would do what i could to save you and your sister  i will set you free cried the girl creeping up to my side  i will set you free and then you may come and slay buckingham  gladly i assented  we must hurry she went on as she fumbled with the hard knots in the stiffened rawhide for buckingham will be after you soon  he must make an offering to the lions at dawn before he can take victory  the taking of a queen requires a human offering  and i am to be the offering i asked  yes she said tugging at a knot  buckingham has been wanting a sacrifice ever since he killed wettin that he might slay my mother and take victory  the thought was horrible not solely because of the hideous fate to which i was condemned but from the contemplation it engendered of the sad decadence of a once enlightened race  to these depths of ignorance brutality and superstition had the vaunted civilization of twentieth century england been plunged and by what  war  i felt the structure of our timehonored militaristic arguments crumbling about me  mary labored with the thongs that confined me  they proved refractorydefying her tender childish fingers  she assured me however that she would release me if they did not come too soon  but alas they came  we heard them coming down the trench and i bade mary hide in a corner lest she be discovered and punished  there was naught else she could do and so she crawled away into the stygian blackness behind me  presently two warriors entered  the leader exhibited a unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness  he advanced slowly kicking out viciously before him  finally he kicked me in the face then he knew where i was  a moment later i had been jerked roughly to my feet  one of the fellows stopped and severed the bonds that held my ankles  i could scarcely stand alone  the two pulled and hauled me through the low doorway and along the trench  a party of forty or fifty warriors were awaiting us at the brink of the excavation some hundred yards from the hut  hands were lowered to us and we were dragged to the surface  then commenced a long march  we stumbled through the underbrush wet with dew our way lighted by a score of torchbearers who surrounded us  but the torches were not to light the waythat was but incidental  they were carried to keep off the huge carnivora that moaned and coughed and roared about us  the noises were hideous  the whole country seemed alive with lions yellowgreen eyes blazed wickedly at us from out the surrounding darkness  my escort carried long heavy spears  these they kept ever pointed toward the beast of prey and i learned from snatches of the conversation i overheard that occasionally there might be a lion who would brave even the terrors of fire to leap in upon human prey  it was for such that the spears were always couched  but nothing of the sort occurred during this hideous death march and with the first pale heralding of dawn we reached our goalan open place in the midst of a tangled wildwood  here rose in crumbling grandeur the first evidences i had seen of the ancient civilization which once had graced fair albiona single timeworn arch of masonry  the entrance to the camp of the lions murmured one of the party in a voice husky with awe  here the party knelt while buckingham recited a weird prayerlike chant  it was rather long and i recall only a portion of it which ran if my memory serves me somewhat as follows          lord of grabritin we         fall on our knees to thee         this gift to bring         greatest of kings are thou         to thee we humbly bow         peace to our camp allow         god save thee king   then the party rose and dragging me to the crumbling arch made me fast to a huge corroded copper ring which was dangling from an eyebolt imbedded in the masonry  none of them not even buckingham seemed to feel any personal animosity toward me  they were naturally rough and brutal as primitive men are supposed to have been since the dawn of humanity but they did not go out of their way to maltreat me  with the coming of dawn the number of lions about us seemed to have greatly diminishedat least they made less noiseand as buckingham and his party disappeared into the woods leaving me alone to my terrible fate i could hear the grumblings and growlings of the beasts diminishing with the sound of the chant which the party still continued  it appeared that the lions had failed to note that i had been left for their breakfast and had followed off after their worshippers instead  but i knew the reprieve would be but for a short time and though i had no wish to die i must confess that i rather wished the ordeal over and the peace of oblivion upon me  the voices of the men and the lions receded in the distance until finally quiet reigned about me broken only by the sweet voices of birds and the sighing of the summer wind in the trees  it seemed impossible to believe that in this peaceful woodland setting the frightful thing was to occur which must come with the passing of the next lion who chanced within sight or smell of the crumbling arch  i strove to tear myself loose from my bonds but succeeded only in tightening them about my arms  then i remained passive for a long time letting the scenes of my lifetime pass in review before my minds eye  i tried to imagine the astonishment incredulity and horror with which my family and friends would be overwhelmed if for an instant space could be annihilated and they could see me at the gates of london  the gates of london  where was the multitude hurrying to the marts of trade after a night of pleasure or rest  where was the clang of tramcar gongs the screech of motor horns the vast murmur of a dense throng  where were they  and as i asked the question a lone gaunt lion strode from the tangled jungle upon the far side of the clearing majestically and noiselessly upon his padded feet the king of beasts moved slowly toward the gates of london and toward me  was i afraid  i fear that i was almost afraid  i know that i thought that fear was coming to me and so i straightened up and squared my shoulders and looked the lion straight in the eyesand waited  it is not a nice way to diealone with ones hands fast bound beneath the fangs and talons of a beast of prey  no it is not a nice way to die not a pretty way  the lion was halfway across the clearing when i heard a slight sound behind me  the great cat stopped in his tracks  he lashed his tail against his sides now instead of simply twitching its tip and his low moan became a thunderous roar  as i craned my neck to catch a glimpse of the thing that had aroused the fury of the beast before me it sprang through the arched gateway and was at my sidewith parted lips and heaving bosom and disheveled haira bronzed and lovely vision to eyes that had never harbored hope of rescue  it was victory and in her arms she clutched my rifle and revolver  a long knife was in the doeskin belt that supported the doeskin skirt tightly about her lithe limbs  she dropped my weapons at my feet and snatching the knife from its resting place severed the bonds that held me  i was free and the lion was preparing to charge  run i cried to the girl as i bent and seized my rifle  but she only stood there at my side her bared blade ready in her hand  the lion was bounding toward us now in prodigious leaps  i raised the rifle and fired  it was a lucky shot for i had no time to aim carefully and when the beast crumpled and rolled lifeless to the ground i went upon my knees and gave thanks to the god of my ancestors  and still upon my knees i turned and taking the girls hand in mine i kissed it  she smiled at that and laid her other hand upon my head  you have strange customs in your country she said  i could not but smile at that when i thought how strange it would seem to my countrymen could they but see me kneeling there on the site of london kissing the hand of englands queen  and now i said as i rose you must return to the safety of your camp  i will go with you until you are near enough to continue alone in safety  then i shall try to return to my comrades  i will not return to the camp she replied  but what shall you do i asked  i do not know  only i shall never go back while buckingham lives  i should rather die than go back to him  mary came to me after they had taken you from the camp and told me  i found your strange weapons and followed with them  it took me a little longer for often i had to hide in the trees that the lions might not get me but i came in time and now you are free to go back to your friends  and leave you here i exclaimed  she nodded but i could see through all her brave front that she was frightened at the thought  i could not leave her of course but what in the world i was to do cumbered with the care of a young woman and a queen at that i was at a loss to know  i pointed out that phase of it to her but she only shrugged her shapely shoulders and pointed to her knife  it was evident that she felt entirely competent to protect herself  as we stood there we heard the sound of voices  they were coming from the forest through which we had passed when we had come from camp  they are searching for me said the girl  where shall we hide  i didnt relish hiding  but when i thought of the innumerable dangers which surrounded us and the comparatively small amount of ammunition that i had with me i hesitated to provoke a battle with buckingham and his warriors when by flight i could avoid them and preserve my cartridges against emergencies which could not be escaped  would they follow us there i asked pointing through the archway into the camp of the lions  never she replied for in the first place they would know that we would not dare go there and in the second they themselves would not dare  then we shall take refuge in the camp of the lions i said  she shuddered and drew closer to me  you dare she asked  why not i returned  we shall be safe from buckingham and you have seen for the second time in two days that lions are harmless before my weapons  then too i can find my friends easiest in this direction for the river thames runs through this place you call the camp of the lions and it is farther down the thames that my friends are awaiting me  do you not dare come with me  i dare follow wherever you lead she answered simply  and so i turned and passed beneath the great arch into the city of london    5   as we entered deeper into what had once been the city the evidences of mans past occupancy became more frequent  for a mile from the arch there was only a riot of weeds and undergrowth and trees covering small mounds and little hillocks that i was sure were formed of the ruins of stately buildings of the dead past  but presently we came upon a district where shattered walls still raised their crumbling tops in sad silence above the grassgrown sepulchers of their fallen fellows  softened and mellowed by ancient ivy stood these sentinels of sorrow their scarred faces still revealing the rents and gashes of shrapnel and of bomb  contrary to our expectations we found little indication that lions in any great numbers laired in this part of ancient london  wellworn pathways molded by padded paws led through the cavernous windows or doorways of a few of the ruins we passed and once we saw the savage face of a great blackmaned lion scowling down upon us from a shattered stone balcony  we followed down the bank of the thames after we came upon it  i was anxious to look with my own eyes upon the famous bridge and i guessed too that the river would lead me into the part of london where stood westminster abbey and the tower  realizing that the section through which we had been passing was doubtless outlying and therefore not so built up with large structures as the more centrally located part of the old town i felt sure that farther down the river i should find the ruins larger  the bridge would be there in part at least and so would remain the walls of many of the great edifices of the past  there would be no such complete ruin of large structures as i had seen among the smaller buildings  but when i had come to that part of the city which i judged to have contained the relics i sought i found havoc that had been wrought there even greater than elsewhere  at one point upon the bosom of the thames there rises a few feet above the water a single disintegrating mound of masonry  opposite it upon either bank of the river are tumbled piles of ruins overgrown with vegetation  these i am forced to believe are all that remain of london bridge for nowhere else along the river is there any other slightest sign of pier or abutment  rounding the base of a large pile of grasscovered debris we came suddenly upon the best preserved ruin we had yet discovered  the entire lower story and part of the second story of what must once have been a splendid public building rose from a great knoll of shrubbery and trees while ivy thick and luxuriant clambered upward to the summit of the broken walls  in many places the gray stone was still exposed its smoothly chiseled face pitted with the scars of battle  the massive portal yawned somber and sorrowful before us giving a glimpse of marble halls within  the temptation to enter was too great  i wished to explore the interior of this one remaining monument of civilization now dead beyond recall  through this same portal within these very marble halls had gray and chamberlin and kitchener and shaw perhaps come and gone with the other great ones of the past  i took victorys hand in mine  come i said  i do not know the name by which this great pile was known nor the purposes it fulfilled  it may have been the palace of your sires victory  from some great throne within your forebears may have directed the destinies of half the world  come  i must confess to a feeling of awe as we entered the rotunda of the great building  pieces of massive furniture of another day still stood where man had placed them centuries ago  they were littered with dust and broken stone and plaster but otherwise so perfect was their preservation i could hardly believe that two centuries had rolled by since human eyes were last set upon them  through one great room after another we wandered hand in hand while victory asked many questions and for the first time i began to realize something of the magnificence and power of the race from whose loins she had sprung  splendid tapestries now mildewed and rotting hung upon the walls there were mural paintings too depicting great historic events of the past  for the first time victory saw the likeness of a horse and she was much affected by a huge oil which depicted some ancient cavalry charge against a battery of field guns  in other pictures there were steamships battleships submarines and quaint looking railway trainsall small and antiquated in appearance to me but wonderful to victory  she told me that she would like to remain for the rest of her life where she could look at those pictures daily  from room to room we passed until presently we emerged into a mighty chamber dark and gloomy for its high and narrow windows were choked and clogged by ivy  along one paneled wall we groped our eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the darkness  a rank and pungent odor pervaded the atmosphere  we had made our way about half the distance across one end of the great apartment when a low growl from the far end brought us to a startled halt  straining my eyes through the gloom i made out a raised dais at the extreme opposite end of the hall  upon the dais stood two great chairs highbacked and with great arms  the throne of england  but what were those strange forms about it  victory gave my hand a quick excited little squeeze  the lions she whispered  yes lions indeed  sprawled about the dais were a dozen huge forms while upon the seat of one of the thrones a small cub lay curled in slumber  as we stood there for a moment spellbound by the sight of those fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the sovereigns of england the low growl was repeated and a great male rose slowly to his feet  his devilish eyes bored straight through the semidarkness toward us he had discovered the interloper  what right had man within this palace of the beasts again he opened his giant jaws and this time there rumbled forth a warning roar  instantly eight or ten of the other beasts leaped to their feet already the great fellow who had spied us was advancing slowly in our direction  i held my rifle ready but how futile it appeared in the face of this savage horde  the foremost beast broke into a slow trot and at his heels came the others  all were roaring now and the din of their great voices reverberating through the halls and corridors of the palace formed the most frightful chorus of thunderous savagery imaginable to the mind of man  and then the leader charged and upon the hideous pandemonium broke the sharp crack of my rifle once twice thrice  three lions rolled struggling and biting to the floor  victory seized my arm with a quick this way  here is a door and a moment later we were in a tiny antechamber at the foot of a narrow stone staircase  up this we backed victory just behind me as the first of the remaining lions leaped from the throne room and sprang for the stairs again i fired but others of the ferocious beasts leaped over their fallen fellows and pursued us  the stairs were very narrowthat was all that saved usfor as i backed slowly upward but a single lion could attack me at a time and the carcasses of those i slew impeded the rushes of the others  at last we reached the top  there was a long corridor from which opened many doorways  one directly behind us was tight closed  if we could open it and pass into the chamber behind we might find a respite from attack  the remaining lions were roaring horribly  i saw one sneaking very slowly up the stairs toward us  try that door i called to victory  see if it will open  she ran up to it and pushed  turn the knob i cried seeing that she did not know how to open a door but neither did she know what i meant by knob  i put a bullet in the spine of the approaching lion and leaped to victorys side  the door resisted my first efforts to swing it inward rusted hinges and swollen wood held it tightly closed  but at last it gave and just as another lion mounted to the top of the stairway it swung in and i pushed victory across the threshold  then i turned to meet the renewed attack of the savage foe  one lion fell in his tracks another stumbled to my very feet and then i leaped within and slammed the portal to  a quick glance showed me that this was the only door to the small apartment in which we had found sanctuary and with a sigh of relief i leaned for a moment against the panels of the stout barrier that separated us from the ramping demons without  across the room between two windows stood a flattopped desk  a little pile of white and brown lay upon it close to the opposite edge after a moment of rest i crossed the room to investigate  the white was the bleached human bonesthe skull collar bones arms and a few of the upper ribs of a man  the brown was the dust of a decayed military cap and blouse  in a chair before the desk were other bones while more still strewed the floor beneath the desk and about the chair  a man had died sitting there with his face buried in his armstwo hundred years ago  beneath the desk were a pair of spurred military boots green and rotten with decay  in them were the leg bones of a man  among the tiny bones of the hands was an ancient fountain pen as good apparently as the day it was made and a metal covered memoranda book closed over the bones of an index finger  it was a gruesome sighta pitiful sightthis lone inhabitant of mighty london  i picked up the metal covered memoranda book  its pages were rotten and stuck together  only here and there was a sentence or a part of a sentence legible  the first that i could read was near the middle of the little volume  his majesty left for tunbridge wells today he  jesty was stricken  terday  god give she does not die  am military governor of lon   and farther on  it is awful  hundred deaths today  worse than the bombardm   nearer the end i picked out the following  i promised his maj  e will find me here when he ret  alone  the most legible passage was on the next page  thank god we drove them out  there is not a single  man on british soil today but at what awful cost  i tried to persuade sir phillip to urge the people to remain  but they are mad with fear of the death and rage at our enemies  he tells me that the coast cities are packed  waiting to be taken across  what will become of england with none left to rebuild her shattered cities  and the last entry   alone  only the wild beasts   a lion is roaring now beneath the palace windows  i think the people feared the beasts even more than they did the death  but they are gone all gone and to what  how much better conditions will they find on the continent all goneonly i remain  i promised his majesty and when he returns he will find that i was true to my trust for i shall be awaiting him god save the king  that was all  this brave and forever nameless officer died nobly at his posttrue to his country and his king  it was the death no doubt that took him  some of the entries had been dated  from the few legible letters and figures which remained i judge the end came some time in august 1937 but of that i am not at all certain  the diary has cleared up at least one mystery that had puzzled me not a little and now i am surprised that i had not guessed its solution myselfthe presence of african and asiatic beasts in england  acclimated by years of confinement in the zoological gardens they were fitted to resume in england the wild existence for which nature had intended them and once free had evidently bred prolifically in marked contrast to the captive exotics of twentieth century panamerica which had gradually become fewer until extinction occurred some time during the twentyfirst century  the palace if such it was lay not far from the banks of the thames the room in which we were imprisoned overlooked the river and i determined to attempt to escape in this direction  to descend through the palace was out of the question but outside we could discover no lions  the stems of the ivy which clambered upward past the window of the room were as large around as my arm  i knew that they would support our weight and as we could gain nothing by remaining longer in the palace i decided to descend by way of the ivy and follow along down the river in the direction of the launch  naturally i was much handicapped by the presence of the girl  but i could not abandon her though i had no idea what i should do with her after rejoining my companions  that she would prove a burden and an embarrassment i was certain but she had made it equally plain to me that she would never return to her people to mate with buckingham  i owed my life to her and all other considerations aside that was sufficient demand upon my gratitude and my honor to necessitate my suffering every inconvenience in her service  too she was queen of england  but by far the most potent argument in her favor she was a woman in distressand a young and very beautiful one  and so though i wished a thousand times that she was back in her camp i never let her guess it but did all that lay within my power to serve and protect her  i thank god now that i did so  with the lions still padding back and forth beyond the closed door victory and i crossed the room to one of the windows  i had outlined my plan to her and she had assured me that she could descend the ivy without assistance  in fact she smiled a trifle at my question  swinging myself outward i began the descent and had come to within a few feet of the ground being just opposite a narrow window when i was startled by a savage growl almost in my ear and then a great taloned paw darted from the aperture to seize me and i saw the snarling face of a lion within the embrasure  releasing my hold upon the ivy i dropped the remaining distance to the ground saved from laceration only because the lions paw struck the thick stem of ivy  the creature was making a frightful racket now leaping back and forth from the floor at the broad window ledge tearing at the masonry with his claws in vain attempts to reach me  but the opening was too narrow and the masonry too solid  victory had commenced the descent but i called to her to stop just above the window and as the lion reappeared growling and snarling i put a 33 bullet in his face and at the same moment victory slipped quickly past him dropping into my upraised arms that were awaiting her  the roaring of the beasts that had discovered us together with the report of my rifle had set the balance of the fierce inmates of the palace into the most frightful uproar i have ever heard  i feared that it would not be long before intelligence or instinct would draw them from the interiors and set them upon our trail the river  nor had we much more than reached it when a lion bounded around the corner of the edifice we had just quitted and stood looking about as though in search of us  following came others while victory and i crouched in hiding behind a clump of bushes close to the bank of the river  the beasts sniffed about the ground for a while but they did not chance to go near the spot where we had stood beneath the window that had given us escape  presently a blackmaned male raised his head and with cocked ears and glaring eyes gazed straight at the bush behind which we lay  i could have sworn that he had discovered us and when he took a few short and stately steps in our direction i raised my rifle and covered him  but after a long tense moment he looked away and turned to glare in another direction  i breathed a sigh of relief and so did victory  i could feel her body quiver as she lay pressed close to me our cheeks almost touching as we both peered through the same small opening in the foliage  i turned to give her a reassuring smile as the lion indicated that he had not seen us and as i did so she too turned her face toward mine for the same purpose doubtless  anyway as our heads turned simultaneously our lips brushed together  a startled expression came into victorys eyes as she drew back in evident confusion  as for me the strangest sensation that i have ever experienced claimed me for an instant  a peculiar tingling thrill ran through my veins and my head swam  i could not account for it  naturally being a naval officer and consequently in the best society of the federation i have seen much of women  with others i have laughed at the assertions of the savants that modern man is a cold and passionless creation in comparison with the males of former agesin a word that love as the one grand passion had ceased to exist  i do not know now but that they were more nearly right than we have guessed at least in so far as modern civilized woman is concerned  i have kissed many womenyoung and beautiful and middle aged and old and many that i had no business kissingbut never before had i experienced that remarkable and altogether delightful thrill that followed the accidental brushing of my lips against the lips of victory  the occurrence interested me and i was tempted to experiment further but when i would have essayed it another new and entirely unaccountable force restrained me  for the first time in my life i felt embarrassment in the presence of a woman  what further might have developed i cannot say for at that moment a perfect shedevil of a lioness with keener eyes than her lord and master discovered us  she came trotting toward our place of concealment growling and baring her yellow fangs  i waited for an instant hoping that i might be mistaken and that she would turn off in some other direction  but noshe increased her trot to a gallop and then i fired at her but the bullet though it struck her full in the breast didnt stop her  screaming with pain and rage the creature fairly flew toward us behind her came other lions  our case looked hopeless  we were upon the brink of the river  there seemed no avenue of escape and i knew that even my modern automatic rifle was inadequate in the face of so many of these fierce beasts  to remain where we were would have been suicidal  we were both standing now victory keeping her place bravely at my side when i reached the only decision open to me  seizing the girls hand i turned just as the lioness crashed into the opposite side of the bushes and dragging victory after me leaped over the edge of the bank into the river  i did not know that lions are not fond of water nor did i know if victory could swim but death immediate and terrible stared us in the face if we remained and so i took the chance  at this point the current ran close to the shore so that we were immediately in deep water and to my intense satisfaction victory struck out with a strong overhand stroke and set all my fears on her account at rest  but my relief was shortlived  that lioness as i have said before was a veritable devil  she stood for a moment glaring at us then like a shot she sprang into the river and swam swiftly after us  victory was a length ahead of me  swim for the other shore i called to her  i was much impeded by my rifle having to swim with one hand while i clung to my precious weapon with the other  the girl had seen the lioness take to the water and she had also seen that i was swimming much more slowly than she and what did she do  she started to drop back to my side  go on i cried  make for the other shore and then follow down until you find my friends  tell them that i sent you and with orders that they are to protect you  go on  go on  but she only waited until we were again swimming side by side and i saw that she had drawn her long knife and was holding it between her teeth  do as i tell you i said to her sharply but she shook her head  the lioness was overhauling us rapidly  she was swimming silently her chin just touching the water but blood was streaming from between her lips  it was evident that her lungs were pierced  she was almost upon me  i saw that in a moment she would take me under her forepaws or seize me in those great jaws  i felt that my time had come but i meant to die fighting  and so i turned and treading water raised my rifle above my head and awaited her  victory animated by a bravery no less ferocious than that of the dumb beast assailing us swam straight for me  it all happened so swiftly that i cannot recall the details of the kaleidoscopic action which ensued  i knew that i rose high out of the water and with clubbed rifle dealt the animal a terrific blow upon the skull that i saw victory her long blade flashing in her hand close striking upon the beast that a great paw fell upon her shoulder and that i was swept beneath the surface of the water like a straw before the prow of a freighter  still clinging to my rifle i rose again to see the lioness struggling in her death throes but an arms length from me  scarcely had i risen than the beast turned upon her side struggled frantically for an instant and then sank    6   victory was nowhere in sight  alone i floated upon the bosom of the thames  in that brief instant i believe that i suffered more mental anguish than i have crowded into all the balance of my life before or since  a few hours before i had been wishing that i might be rid of her and now that she was gone i would have given my life to have her back again  wearily i turned to swim about the spot where she had disappeared hoping that she might rise once at least and i would be given the opportunity to save her and as i turned the water boiled before my face and her head shot up before me  i was on the point of striking out to seize her when a happy smile illumined her features  you are not dead she cried  i have been searching the bottom for you  i was sure that the blow she gave you must have disabled you and she glanced about for the lioness  she has gone she asked  dead i replied  the blow you struck her with the thing you call rifle stunned her she explained and then i swam in close enough to get my knife into her heart  ah such a girl  i could not but wonder what one of our own panamerican women would have done under like circumstances  but then of course they have not been trained by stern necessity to cope with the emergencies and dangers of savage primeval life  along the bank we had just quitted a score of lions paced to and fro growling menacingly  we could not return and we struck out for the opposite shore  i am a strong swimmer and had no doubt as to my ability to cross the river but i was not so sure about victory so i swam close behind her to be ready to give her assistance should she need it  she did not however reaching the opposite bank as fresh apparently as when she entered the water  victory is a wonder  each day that we were together brought new proofs of it  nor was it her courage or vitality only which amazed me  she had a head on those shapely shoulders of hers and dignity  my but she could be regal when she chose  she told me that the lions were fewer upon this side of the river but that there were many wolves running in great packs later in the year now they were north somewhere and we should have little to fear from them though we might meet with a few  my first concern was to take my weapons apart and dry them which was rather difficult in the face of the fact that every rag about me was drenched  but finally thanks to the sun and much rubbing i succeeded though i had no oil to lubricate them  we ate some wild berries and roots that victory found and then we set off again down the river keeping an eye open for game on one side and the launch on the other for i thought that delcarte who would be the natural leader during my absence might run up the thames in search of me  the balance of that day we sought in vain for game or for the launch and when night came we lay down our stomachs empty to sleep beneath the stars  we were entirely unprotected from attack from wild beasts and for this reason i remained awake most of the night on guard  but nothing approached us though i could hear the lions roaring across the river and once i thought i heard the howl of a beast north of usit might have been a wolf  altogether it was a most unpleasant night and i determined then that if we were forced to sleep out again that i should provide some sort of shelter which would protect us from attack while we slept  toward morning i dozed and the sun was well up when victory aroused me by gently shaking my shoulder  antelope she whispered in my ear and as i raised my head she pointed upriver  crawling to my knees i looked in the direction she indicated to see a buck standing upon a little knoll some two hundred yards from us  there was good cover between the animal and me and so though i might have hit him at two hundred yards i preferred to crawl closer to him and make sure of the meat we both so craved  i had covered about fifty yards of the distance and the beast was still feeding peacefully so i thought that i would make even surer of a hit by going ahead another fifty yards when the animal suddenly raised his head and looked away upriver  his whole attitude proclaimed that he was startled by something beyond him that i could not see  realizing that he might break and run and that i should then probably miss him entirely i raised my rifle to my shoulder  but even as i did so the animal leaped into the air and simultaneously there was a sound of a shot from beyond the knoll  for an instant i was dumbfounded  had the report come from downriver i should have instantly thought that one of my own men had fired  but coming from upriver it puzzled me considerably  who could there be with firearms in primitive england other than we of the coldwater  victory was directly behind me and i motioned for her to lie down as i did behind the bush from which i had been upon the point of firing at the antelope  we could see that the buck was quite dead and from our hiding place we waited to discover the identity of his slayer when the latter should approach and claim his kill  we had not long to wait and when i saw the head and shoulders of a man appear above the crest of the knoll i sprang to my feet with a heartfelt cry of joy for it was delcarte  at the sound of my voice delcarte half raised his rifle in readiness for the attack of an enemy but a moment later he recognized me and was coming rapidly to meet us  behind him was snider  they both were astounded to see me upon the north bank of the river and much more so at the sight of my companion  then i introduced them to victory and told them that she was queen of england  they thought at first that i was joking  but when i had recounted my adventures and they realized that i was in earnest they believed me  they told me that they had followed me inshore when i had not returned from the hunt that they had met the men of the elephant country and had had a short and onesided battle with the fellows  and that afterward they had returned to the launch with a prisoner from whom they had learned that i had probably been captured by the men of the lion country  with the prisoner as a guide they had set off upriver in search of me but had been much delayed by motor trouble and had finally camped after dark a half mile above the spot where victory and i had spent the night  they must have passed us in the dark and why i did not hear the sound of the propeller i do not know unless it passed me at a time when the lions were making an unusually earsplitting din upon the opposite side  taking the antelope with us we all returned to the launch where we found taylor as delighted to see me alive again as delcarte had been i cannot say truthfully that snider evinced much enthusiasm at my rescue  taylor had found the ingredients for chemical fuel and the distilling of them had with the motor trouble accounted for their delay in setting out after me  the prisoner that delcarte and snider had taken was a powerful young fellow from the elephant country  notwithstanding the fact that they had all assured him to the contrary he still could not believe that we would not kill him  he assured us that his name was thirtysix and as he could not count above ten i am sure that he had no conception of the correct meaning of the word and that it may have been handed down to him either from the military number of an ancestor who had served in the english ranks during the great war or that originally it was the number of some famous regiment with which a forbear fought  now that we were reunited we held a council to determine what course we should pursue in the immediate future  snider was still for setting out to sea and returning to panamerica but the better judgment of delcarte and taylor ridiculed the suggestionwe should not have lived a fortnight  to remain in england constantly menaced by wild beasts and men equally as wild seemed about as bad  i suggested that we cross the channel and ascertain if we could not discover a more enlightened and civilized people upon the continent  i was sure that some trace of the ancient culture and greatness of europe must remain  germany probably would be much as it was during the twentieth century for in common with most panamericans i was positive that germany had been victorious in the great war  snider demurred at the suggestion  he said that it was bad enough to have come this far  he did not want to make it worse by going to the continent  the outcome of it was that i finally lost my patience and told him that from then on he would do what i thought bestthat i proposed to assume command of the party and that they might all consider themselves under my orders as much so as though we were still aboard the coldwater and in panamerican waters  delcarte and taylor immediately assured me that they had not for an instant assumed anything different and that they were as ready to follow and obey me here as they would be upon the other side of thirty  snider said nothing but he wore a sullen scowl  and i wished then as i had before and as i did to a much greater extent later that fate had not decreed that he should have chanced to be a member of the launchs party upon that memorable day when last we quitted the coldwater  victory who was given a voice in our councils was all for going to the continent or anywhere else in fact where she might see new sights and experience new adventures  afterward we can come back to grabritin she said and if buckingham is not dead and we can catch him away from his men and kill him then i can return to my people and we can all live in peace and happiness  she spoke of killing buckingham with no greater concern than one might evince in the contemplated destruction of a sheep yet she was neither cruel nor vindictive  in fact victory is a very sweet and womanly woman  but human life is of small account beyond thirtya legacy from the bloody days when thousands of men perished in the trenches between the rising and the setting of a sun when they laid them lengthwise in these same trenches and sprinkled dirt over them when the germans corded their corpses like wood and set fire to them when women and children and old men were butchered and great passenger ships were torpedoed without warning  thirtysix finally assured that we did not intend slaying him was as keen to accompany us as was victory  the crossing to the continent was uneventful its monotony being relieved however by the childish delight of victory and thirtysix in the novel experience of riding safely upon the bosom of the water and of being so far from land  with the possible exception of snider the little party appeared in the best of spirits laughing and joking or interestedly discussing the possibilities which the future held for us what we should find upon the continent and whether the inhabitants would be civilized or barbarian peoples  victory asked me to explain the difference between the two and when i had tried to do so as clearly as possible she broke into a gay little laugh  oh she cried then i am a barbarian  i could not but laugh too as i admitted that she was indeed a barbarian  she was not offended taking the matter as a huge joke but some time thereafter she sat in silence apparently deep in thought  finally she looked up at me her strong white teeth gleaming behind her smiling lips  should you take that thing you call razor she said and cut the hair from the face of thirtysix and exchange garments with him you would be the barbarian and thirtysix the civilized man  there is no other difference between you except your weapons  clothe you in a wolfskin give you a knife and a spear and set you down in the woods of grabritinof what service would your civilization be to you  delcarte and taylor smiled at her reply but thirtysix and snider laughed uproariously  i was not surprised at thirtysix but i thought that snider laughed louder than the occasion warranted  as a matter of fact snider it seemed to me was taking advantage of every opportunity however slight to show insubordination and i determined then that at the first real breach of discipline i should take action that would remind snider ever after that i was still his commanding officer  i could not help but notice that his eyes were much upon victory and i did not like it for i knew the type of man he was  but as it would not be necessary ever to leave the girl alone with him i felt no apprehension for her safety  after the incident of the discussion of barbarians i thought that victorys manner toward me changed perceptibly  she held aloof from me and when snider took his turn at the wheel sat beside him upon the pretext that she wished to learn how to steer the launch  i wondered if she had guessed the mans antipathy for me and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing me  snider was too taking full advantage of his opportunity  often he leaned toward the girl to whisper in her ear and he laughed much which was unusual with snider  of course it was nothing at all to me yet for some unaccountable reason the sight of the two of them sitting there so close to one another and seeming to be enjoying each others society to such a degree irritated me tremendously and put me in such a bad humor that i took no pleasure whatsoever in the last few hours of the crossing  we aimed to land near the site of ancient ostend  but when we neared the coast we discovered no indication of any human habitations whatever let alone a city  after we had landed we found the same howling wilderness about us that we had discovered on the british isle there was no slightest indication that civilized man had ever set a foot upon that portion of the continent of europe  although i had feared as much since our experience in england i could not but own to a feeling of marked disappointment and to the gravest fears of the future which induced a mental depression that was in no way dissipated by the continued familiarity between victory and snider  i was angry with myself that i permitted that matter to affect me as it had  i did not wish to admit to myself that i was angry with this uncultured little savage that it made the slightest difference to me what she did or what she did not do or that i could so lower myself as to feel personal enmity towards a common sailor  and yet to be honest i was doing both  finding nothing to detain us about the spot where ostend once had stood we set out up the coast in search of the mouth of the river rhine which i purposed ascending in search of civilized man  it was my intention to explore the rhine as far up as the launch would take us  if we found no civilization there we would return to the north sea continue up the coast to the elbe and follow that river and the canals of berlin  here at least i was sure that we should find what we soughtand if not then all europe had reverted to barbarism  the weather remained fine and we made excellent progress but everywhere along the rhine we met with the same disappointmentno sign of civilized man in fact no sign of man at all  i was not enjoying the exploration of modern europe as i had anticipatedi was unhappy  victory seemed changed too  i had enjoyed her company at first but since the trip across the channel i had held aloof from her  her chin was in the air most of the time and yet i rather think that she regretted her friendliness with snider for i noticed that she avoided him entirely  he on the contrary emboldened by her former friendliness sought every opportunity to be near her  i should have liked nothing better than a reasonably good excuse to punch his head yet paradoxically i was ashamed of myself for harboring him any ill will  i realized that there was something the matter with me but i did not know what it was  matters remained thus for several days and we continued our journey up the rhine  at cologne i had hoped to find some reassuring indications but there was no cologne  and as there had been no other cities along the river up to that point the devastation was infinitely greater than time alone could have wrought  great guns bombs and mines must have leveled every building that man had raised and then nature unhindered had covered the ghastly evidence of human depravity with her beauteous mantle of verdure  splendid trees reared their stately tops where splendid cathedrals once had reared their domes and sweet wild flowers blossomed in simple serenity in soil that once was drenched with human blood  nature had reclaimed what man had once stolen from her and defiled  a herd of zebras grazed where once the german kaiser may have reviewed his troops  an antelope rested peacefully in a bed of daisies where perhaps two hundred years ago a big gun belched its terrorladen messages of death of hate of destruction against the works of man and god alike  we were in need of fresh meat yet i hesitated to shatter the quiet and peaceful serenity of the view with the crack of a rifle and the death of one of those beautiful creatures before us  but it had to be donewe must eat  i left the work to delcarte however and in a moment we had two antelope and the landscape to ourselves  after eating we boarded the launch and continued up the river  for two days we passed through a primeval wilderness  in the afternoon of the second day we landed upon the west bank of the river and leaving snider and thirtysix to guard victory and the launch delcarte taylor and i set out after game  we tramped away from the river for upwards of an hour before discovering anything and then only a small red deer which taylor brought down with a neat shot of two hundred yards  it was getting too late to proceed farther so we rigged a sling and the two men carried the deer back toward the launch while i walked a hundred yards ahead in the hope of bagging something further for our larder  we had covered about half the distance to the river when i suddenly came face to face with a man  he was as primitive and uncouth in appearance as the grabritinsa shaggy unkempt savage clothed in a shirt of skin cured with the head on the latter surmounting his own head to form a bonnet and giving to him a most fearful and ferocious aspect  the fellow was armed with a long spear and a club the latter dangling down his back from a leathern thong about his neck  his feet were incased in hide sandals  at sight of me he halted for an instant then turned and dove into the forest and though i called reassuringly to him in english he did not return nor did i again see him  the sight of the wild man raised my hopes once more that elsewhere we might find men in a higher state of civilizationit was the society of civilized man that i cravedand so with a lighter heart i continued on toward the river and the launch  i was still some distance ahead of delcarte and taylor when i came in sight of the rhine again  but i came to the waters edge before i noticed that anything was amiss with the party we had left there a few hours before  my first intimation of disaster was the absence of the launch from its former moorings  and then a moment lateri discovered the body of a man lying upon the bank  running toward it i saw that it was thirtysix and as i stopped and raised the grabritins head in my arms i heard a faint moan break from his lips  he was not dead but that he was badly injured was all too evident  delcarte and taylor came up a moment later and the three of us worked over the fellow hoping to revive him that he might tell us what had happened and what had become of the others  my first thought was prompted by the sight i had recently had of the savage native  the little party had evidently been surprised and in the attack thirtysix had been wounded and the others taken prisoners  the thought was almost like a physical blow in the faceit stunned me  victory in the hands of these abysmal brutes  it was frightful  i almost shook poor thirtysix in my efforts to revive him  i explained my theory to the others and then delcarte shattered it by a single movement of the hand  he drew aside the lions skin that covered half of the grabritins breast revealing a neat round hole in thirtysixs chesta hole that could have been made by no other weapon than a rifle  snider i exclaimed  delcarte nodded  at about the same time the eyelids of the wounded man fluttered and raised  he looked up at us and very slowly the light of consciousness returned to his eyes  what happened thirtysix i asked him  he tried to reply but the effort caused him to cough bringing about a hemorrhage of the lungs and again he fell back exhausted  for several long minutes he lay as one dead then in an almost inaudible whisper he spoke  snider  he paused tried to speak again raised a hand and pointed downriver  theywentback and then he shuddered convulsively and died  none of us voiced his belief  but i think they were all alike victory and snider had stolen the launch and deserted us    7   we stood there grouped about the body of the dead grabritin looking futilely down the river to where it made an abrupt curve to the west a quarter of a mile below us and was lost to sight as though we expected to see the truant returning to us with our precious launchthe thing that meant life or death to us in this unfriendly savage world  i felt rather than saw taylor turn his eyes slowly toward my profile and as mine swung to meet them the expression upon his face recalled me to my duty and responsibility as an officer  the utter hopelessness that was reflected in his face must have been the counterpart of what i myself felt but in that brief instant i determined to hide my own misgivings that i might bolster up the courage of the others  we are lost was written as plainly upon taylors face as though his features were the printed words upon an open book  he was thinking of the launch and of the launch alone  was i  i tried to think that i was  but a greater grief than the loss of the launch could have engendered in me filled my hearta sullen gnawing misery which i tried to denywhich i refused to admitbut which persisted in obsessing me until my heart rose and filled my throat and i could not speak when i would have uttered words of reassurance to my companions  and then rage came to my reliefrage against the vile traitor who had deserted three of his fellow countrymen in so frightful a position  i tried to feel an equal rage against the woman but somehow i could not and kept searching for excuses for herher youth her inexperience her savagery  my rising anger swept away my temporary helplessness  i smiled and told taylor not to look so glum  we will follow them i said and the chances are that we shall overtake them  they will not travel as rapidly as snider probably hopes  he will be forced to halt for fuel and for food and the launch must follow the windings of the river we can take short cuts while they are traversing the detour  i have my mapthank god i always carry it upon my personand with that and the compass we will have an advantage over them  my words seemed to cheer them both and they were for starting off at once in pursuit  there was no reason why we should delay and we set forth down the river  as we tramped along we discussed a question that was uppermost in the mind of eachwhat we should do with snider when we had captured him for with the action of pursuit had come the optimistic conviction that we should succeed  as a matter of fact we had to succeed  the very thought of remaining in this utter wilderness for the rest of our lives was impossible  we arrived at nothing very definite in the matter of sniders punishment since taylor was for shooting him delcarte insisting that he should be hanged while i although fully conscious of the gravity of his offense could not bring myself to give the death penalty  i fell to wondering what charm victory had found in such a man as snider and why i insisted upon finding excuses for her and trying to defend her indefensible act  she was nothing to me  aside from the natural gratitude i felt for her since she had saved my life i owed her nothing  she was a halfnaked little savagei a gentleman and an officer in the worlds greatest navy  there could be no close bonds of interest between us  this line of reflection i discovered to be as distressing as the former but though i tried to turn my mind to other things it persisted in returning to the vision of an oval face suntanned of smiling lips revealing white and even teeth of brave eyes that harbored no shadow of guile and of a tumbling mass of wavy hair that crowned the loveliest picture on which my eyes had ever rested  every time this vision presented itself i felt myself turn cold with rage and hate against snider  i could forgive the launch but if he had wronged her he should diehe should die at my own hands in this i was determined  for two days we followed the river northward cutting off where we could but confined for the most part to the game trails that paralleled the stream  one afternoon we cut across a narrow neck of land that saved us many miles where the river wound to the west and back again  here we decided to halt for we had had a hard day of it and if the truth were known i think that we had all given up hope of overtaking the launch other than by the merest accident  we had shot a deer just before our halt and as taylor and delcarte were preparing it i walked down to the water to fill our canteens  i had just finished and was straightening up when something floating around a bend above me caught my eye  for a moment i could not believe the testimony of my own senses  it was a boat  i shouted to delcarte and taylor who came running to my side  the launch cried delcarte and indeed it was the launch floating downriver from above us  where had it been  how had we passed it and how were we to reach it now should snider and the girl discover us  its drifting said taylor  i see no one in it  i was stripping off my clothes and delcarte soon followed my example i told taylor to remain on shore with the clothing and rifles  he might also serve us better there since it would give him an opportunity to take a shot at snider should the man discover us and show himself  with powerful strokes we swam out in the path of the oncoming launch being a stronger swimmer than delcarte i soon was far in the lead reaching the center of the channel just as the launch bore down upon me  it was drifting broadside on  i seized the gunwale and raised myself quickly so that my chin topped the side  i expected a blow the moment that i came within the view of the occupants but no blow fell  snider lay upon his back in the bottom of the boat alone  even before i had clambered in and stooped above him i knew that he was dead without examining him further i ran forward to the control board and pressed the starting button  to my relief the mechanism respondedthe launch was uninjured  coming about i picked up delcarte  he was astounded at the sight that met his eyes and immediately fell to examining sniders body for signs of life or an explanation of the manner in which he met his death  the fellow had been dead for hourshe was cold and still  but delcartes search was not without results for above sniders heart was a wound a slit about an inch in lengthsuch a slit as a sharp knife would make and in the dead fingers of one hand was clutched a strand of long brown hairvictorys hair was brown  they say that dead men tell no tales but snider told the story of his end as clearly as though the dead lips had parted and poured forth the truth  the beast had attacked the girl and she had defended her honor  we buried snider beside the rhine and no stone marks his last resting place  beasts do not require headstones  then we set out in the launch turning her nose upstream  when i had told delcarte and taylor that i intended searching for the girl neither had demurred  we had her wrong in our thoughts said delcarte and the least that we can do in expiation is to find and rescue her  we called her name aloud every few minutes as we motored up the river but though we returned all the way to our former camping place we did not find her  i then decided to retrace our journey letting taylor handle the launch while delcarte and i upon opposite sides of the river searched for some sign of the spot where victory had landed  we found nothing until we had reached a point a few miles above the spot where i had first seen the launch drifting down toward us and there i discovered the remnants of a recent camp fire  that victory carried flint and steel i was aware and that it was she who built the fire i was positive  but which way had she gone since she stopped here  would she go on down the river that she might thus bring herself nearer her own grabritin or would she have sought to search for us upstream where she had seen us last  i had hailed taylor and sent him across the river to take in delcarte that the two might join me and discuss my discovery and our future plans  while waiting for them i stood looking out over the river my back toward the woods that stretched away to the east behind me  delcarte was just stepping into the launch upon the opposite side of the stream when without the least warning i was violently seized by both arms and about the waistthree or four men were upon me at once my rifle was snatched from my hands and my revolver from my belt  i struggled for an instant but finding my efforts of no avail i ceased them and turned my head to have a look at my assailants  at the same time several others of them walked around in front of me and to my astonishment i found myself looking upon uniformed soldiery armed with rifles revolvers and sabers but with faces as black as coal    8   delcarte and taylor were now in midstream coming toward us and i called to them to keep aloof until i knew whether the intentions of my captors were friendly or otherwise  my good men wanted to come on and annihilate the blacks  but there were upward of a hundred of the latter all well armed and so i commanded delcarte to keep out of harms way and stay where he was till i needed him  a young officer called and beckoned to them  but they refused to come and so he gave orders that resulted in my hands being secured at my back after which the company marched away straight toward the east  i noticed that the men wore spurs which seemed strange to me  but when late in the afternoon we arrived at their encampment i discovered that my captors were cavalrymen  in the center of a plain stood a log fort with a blockhouse at each of its four corners  as we approached i saw a herd of cavalry horses grazing under guard outside the walls of the post  they were small stocky horses but the telltale saddle galls proclaimed their calling the flag flying from a tall staff inside the palisade was one which i had never before seen nor heard of  we marched directly into the compound where the company was dismissed with the exception of a guard of four privates who escorted me in the wake of the young officer  the latter led us across a small parade ground where a battery of light field guns was parked and toward a log building in front of which rose the flagstaff  i was escorted within the building into the presence of an old negro a fine looking man with a dignified and military bearing  he was a colonel i was to learn later and to him i owe the very humane treatment that was accorded me while i remained his prisoner  he listened to the report of his junior and then turned to question me but with no better results than the former had accomplished  then he summoned an orderly and gave some instructions  the soldier saluted and left the room returning in about five minutes with a hairy old white manjust such a savage primevallooking fellow as i had discovered in the woods the day that snider had disappeared with the launch  the colonel evidently expected to use the fellow as interpreter but when the savage addressed me it was in a language as foreign to me as was that of the blacks  at last the old officer gave it up and shaking his head gave instructions for my removal  from his office i was led to a guardhouse in which i found about fifty halfnaked whites clad in the skins of wild beasts  i tried to converse with them but not one of them could understand panamerican nor could i make head or tail of their jargon  for over a month i remained a prisoner there working from morning until night at odd jobs about the headquarters building of the commanding officer  the other prisoners worked harder than i did and i owe my better treatment solely to the kindliness and discrimination of the old colonel  what had become of victory of delcarte of taylor i could not know nor did it seem likely that i should ever learn  i was most depressed but i whiled away my time in performing the duties given me to the best of my ability and attempting to learn the language of my captors  who they were or where they came from was a mystery to me  that they were the outpost of some powerful black nation seemed likely yet where the seat of that nation lay i could not guess  they looked upon the whites as their inferiors and treated us accordingly  they had a literature of their own and many of the men even the common soldiers were omnivorous readers  every two weeks a dustcovered trooper would trot his jaded mount into the post and deliver a bulging sack of mail at headquarters  the next day he would be away again upon a fresh horse toward the south carrying the soldiers letters to friends in the far off land of mystery from whence they all had come  troops sometimes mounted and sometimes afoot left the post daily for what i assumed to be patrol duty  i judged the little force of a thousand men were detailed here to maintain the authority of a distant government in a conquered country  later i learned that my surmise was correct and this was but one of a great chain of similar posts that dotted the new frontier of the black nation into whose hands i had fallen  slowly i learned their tongue so that i could understand what was said before me and make myself understood  i had seen from the first that i was being treated as a slavethat all whites that fell into the hands of the blacks were thus treated  almost daily new prisoners were brought in and about three weeks after i was brought in to the post a troop of cavalry came from the south to relieve one of the troops stationed there  there was great jubilation in the encampment after the arrival of the newcomers old friendships were renewed and new ones made  but the happiest men were those of the troop that was to be relieved  the next morning they started away and as they were forced upon the parade ground we prisoners were marched from our quarters and lined up before them  a couple of long chains were brought with rings in the links every few feet  at first i could not guess the purpose of these chains  but i was soon to learn  a couple of soldiers snapped the first ring around the neck of a powerful white slave and one by one the rest of us were herded to our places and the work of shackling us neck to neck commenced  the colonel stood watching the procedure  presently his eyes fell upon me and he spoke to a young officer at his side  the latter stepped toward me and motioned me to follow him  i did so and was led back to the colonel  by this time i could understand a few words of their strange language and when the colonel asked me if i would prefer to remain at the post as his body servant i signified my willingness as emphatically as possible for i had seen enough of the brutality of the common soldiers toward their white slaves to have no desire to start out upon a march of unknown length chained by the neck and driven on by the great whips that a score of the soldiers carried to accelerate the speed of their charges  about three hundred prisoners who had been housed in six prisons at the post marched out of the gates that morning toward what fate and what future i could not guess  neither had the poor devils themselves more than the most vague conception of what lay in store for them except that they were going elsewhere to continue in the slavery that they had known since their capture by their black conquerorsa slavery that was to continue until death released them  my position was altered at the post  from working about the headquarters office i was transferred to the colonels living quarters  i had greater freedom and no longer slept in one of the prisons but had a little room to myself off the kitchen of the colonels log house  my master was always kind to me and under him i rapidly learned the language of my captors and much concerning them that had been a mystery to me before  his name was abu belik  he was a colonel in the cavalry of abyssinia a country of which i do not remember ever hearing but which colonel belik assured me is the oldest civilized country in the world  colonel belik was born in adis abeba the capital of the empire and until recently had been in command of the emperors palace guard jealousy and the ambition and intrigue of another officer had lost him the favor of his emperor and he had been detailed to this frontier post as a mark of his sovereigns displeasure  some fifty years before the young emperor menelek xiv was ambitious he knew that a great world lay across the waters far to the north of his capital  once he had crossed the desert and looked out upon the blue sea that was the northern boundary of his dominions  there lay another world to conquer  menelek busied himself with the building of a great fleet though his people were not a maritime race his army crossed into europe  it met with little resistance and for fifty years his soldiers had been pushing his boundaries farther and farther toward the north  the yellow men from the east and north are contesting our rights here now said the colonel but we shall winwe shall conquer the world carrying christianity to all the benighted heathen of europe and asia as well  you are a christian people i asked  he looked at me in surprise nodding his head affirmatively  i am a christian i said  my people are the most powerful on earth  he smiled and shook his head indulgently as a father to a child who sets up his childish judgment against that of his elders  then i set out to prove my point  i told him of our cities of our army of our great navy  he came right back at me asking for figures and when he was done i had to admit that only in our navy were we numerically superior  menelek xiv is the undisputed ruler of all the continent of africa of all of ancient europe except the british isles scandinavia and eastern russia and has large possessions and prosperous colonies in what once were arabia and turkey in asia  he has a standing army of ten million men and his people possess slaveswhite slavesto the number of ten or fifteen million  colonel belik was much surprised however upon his part to learn of the great nation which lay across the ocean and when he found that i was a naval officer he was inclined to accord me even greater consideration than formerly  it was difficult for him to believe my assertion that there were but few blacks in my country and that these occupied a lower social plane than the whites  just the reverse is true in colonel beliks land  he considered whites inferior beings creatures of a lower order and assuring me that even the few white freemen of abyssinia were never accorded anything approximating a position of social equality with the blacks  they live in the poorer districts of the cities in little white colonies and a black who marries a white is socially ostracized  the arms and ammunition of the abyssinians are greatly inferior to ours yet they are tremendously effective against the illarmed barbarians of europe  their rifles are of a type similar to the magazine rifles of twentieth century panamerica but carrying only five cartridges in the magazine in addition to the one in the chamber they are of extraordinary length even those of the cavalry and are of extreme accuracy  the abyssinians themselves are a fine looking race of black mentall muscular with fine teeth and regular features which incline distinctly toward semitic moldi refer to the fullblooded natives of abyssinia  they are the patriciansthe aristocracy  the army is officered almost exclusively by them  among the soldiery a lower type of negro predominates with thicker lips and broader flatter noses these men are recruited so the colonel told me from among the conquered tribes of africa  they are good soldiersbrave and loyal they can read and write and they are endowed with a selfconfidence and pride which from my readings of the words of ancient african explorers must have been wanting in their earliest progenitors  on the whole it is apparent that the black race has thrived far better in the past two centuries under men of its own color than it had under the domination of whites during all previous history  i had been a prisoner at the little frontier post for over a month when orders came to colonel belik to hasten to the eastern frontier with the major portion of his command leaving only one troop to garrison the fort  as his body servant i accompanied him mounted upon a fiery little abyssinian pony  we marched rapidly for ten days through the heart of the ancient german empire halting when night found us in proximity to water  often we passed small posts similar to that at which the colonels regiment had been quartered finding in each instance that only a single company or troop remained for defence the balance having been withdrawn toward the northeast in the same direction in which we were moving  naturally the colonel had not confided to me the nature of his orders but the rapidity of our march and the fact that all available troops were being hastened toward the northeast assured me that a matter of vital importance to the dominion of menelek xiv in that part of europe was threatening or had already broken  i could not believe that a simple rising of the savage tribes of whites would necessitate the mobilizing of such a force as we presently met with converging from the south into our trail  there were large bodies of cavalry and infantry endless streams of artillery wagons and guns and countless horsedrawn covered vehicles laden with camp equipage munitions and provisions  here for the first time i saw camels great caravans of them bearing all sorts of heavy burdens and miles upon miles of elephants doing similar service  it was a scene of wondrous and barbaric splendor for the men and beasts from the south were gaily caparisoned in rich colors in marked contrast to the gray uniformed forces of the frontier with which i had been familiar  the rumor reached us that menelek himself was coming and the pitch of excitement to which this announcement raised the troops was little short of miraculousat least to one of my race and nationality whose rulers for centuries had been but ordinary men holding office at the will of the people for a few brief years  as i witnessed it i could not but speculate upon the moral effect upon his troops of a sovereigns presence in the midst of battle  all else being equal in war between the troops of a republic and an empire could not this exhilarated mental state amounting almost to hysteria on the part of the imperial troops weigh heavily against the soldiers of a president  i wonder  but if the emperor chanced to be absent  what then again i wonder  on the eleventh day we reached our destinationa walled frontier city of about twenty thousand  we passed some lakes and crossed some old canals before entering the gates  within beside the frame buildings were many built of ancient brick and wellcut stone  these i was told were of material taken from the ruins of the ancient city which once had stood upon the site of the present town  the name of the town translated from the abyssinian is new gondar it stands i am convinced upon the ruins of ancient berlin the one time capital of the old german empire but except for the old building material used in the new town there is no sign of the former city  the day after we arrived the town was gaily decorated with flags streamers gorgeous rugs and banners for the rumor had proved truethe emperor was coming  colonel belik had accorded me the greatest liberty permitting me to go where i pleased after my few duties had been performed  as a result of his kindness i spent much time wandering about new gondar talking with the inhabitants and exploring the city of black men  as i had been given a semimilitary uniform which bore insignia indicating that i was an officers body servant even the blacks treated me with a species of respect though i could see by their manner that i was really as the dirt beneath their feet  they answered my questions civilly enough but they would not enter into conversation with me  it was from other slaves that i learned the gossip of the city  troops were pouring in from the west and south and pouring out toward the east  i asked an old slave who was sweeping the dirt into little piles in the gutters of the street where the soldiers were going  he looked at me in surprise  why to fight the yellow men of course he said  they have crossed the border and are marching toward new gondar  who will win i asked  he shrugged his shoulders  who knows he said  i hope it will be the yellow men but menelek is powerfulit will take many yellow men to defeat him  crowds were gathering along the sidewalks to view the emperors entry into the city  i took my place among them although i hate crowds and i am glad that i did for i witnessed such a spectacle of barbaric splendor as no other panamerican has ever looked upon  down the broad main thoroughfare which may once have been the historic unter den linden came a brilliant cortege  at the head rode a regiment of redcoated hussarsenormous men black as night  there were troops of riflemen mounted on camels  the emperor rode in a golden howdah upon the back of a huge elephant so covered with rich hangings and embellished with scintillating gems that scarce more than the beasts eyes and feet were visible  menelek was a rather grosslooking man well past middle age but he carried himself with an air of dignity befitting one descended in unbroken line from the prophetas was his claim  his eyes were bright but crafty and his features denoted both sensuality and cruelness  in his youth he may have been a rather fine looking black but when i saw him his appearance was revoltingto me at least  following the emperor came regiment after regiment from the various branches of the service among them batteries of field guns mounted on elephants  in the center of the troops following the imperial elephant marched a great caravan of slaves  the old street sweeper at my elbow told me that these were the gifts brought in from the far outlying districts by the commanding officers of the frontier posts  the majority of them were women destined i was told for the harems of the emperor and his favorites  it made my old companion clench his fists to see those poor white women marching past to their horrid fates and though i shared his sentiments i was as powerless to alter their destinies as he  for a week the troops kept pouring in and out of new gondarin always from the south and west but always toward the east  each new contingent brought its gifts to the emperor  from the south they brought rugs and ornaments and jewels from the west slaves for the commanding officers of the western frontier posts had naught else to bring  from the number of women they brought i judged that they knew the weakness of their imperial master  and then soldiers commenced coming in from the east but not with the gay assurance of those who came from the south and westno these others came in covered wagons bloodsoaked and suffering  they came at first in little parties of eight or ten and then they came in fifties in hundreds and one day a thousand maimed and dying men were carted into new gondar  it was then that menelek xiv became uneasy  for fifty years his armies had conquered wherever they had marched  at first he had led them in person lately his presence within a hundred miles of the battle line had been sufficient for large engagementsfor minor ones only the knowledge that they were fighting for the glory of their sovereign was necessary to win victories  one morning new gondar was awakened by the booming of cannon  it was the first intimation that the townspeople had received that the enemy was forcing the imperial troops back upon the city  dust covered couriers galloped in from the front  fresh troops hastened from the city and about noon menelek rode out surrounded by his staff  for three days thereafter we could hear the cannonading and the spitting of the small arms for the battle line was scarce two leagues from new gondar  the city was filled with wounded  just outside soldiers were engaged in throwing up earthworks  it was evident to the least enlightened that menelek expected further reverses  and then the imperial troops fell back upon these new defenses or rather they were forced back by the enemy  shells commenced to fall within the city  menelek returned and took up his headquarters in the stone building that was called the palace  that night came a lull in the hostilitiesa truce had been arranged  colonel belik summoned me about seven oclock to dress him for a function at the palace  in the midst of death and defeat the emperor was about to give a great banquet to his officers  i was to accompany my master and wait upon himi jefferson turck lieutenant in the panamerican navy  in the privacy of the colonels quarters i had become accustomed to my menial duties lightened as they were by the natural kindliness of my master but the thought of appearing in public as a common slave revolted every fine instinct within me  yet there was nothing for it but to obey  i cannot even now bring myself to a narration of the humiliation which i experienced that night as i stood behind my black master in silent servility now pouring his wine now cutting up his meats for him now fanning him with a large plumed fan of feathers  as fond as i had grown of him i could have thrust a knife into him so keenly did i feel the affront that had been put upon me  but at last the long banquet was concluded  the tables were removed  the emperor ascended a dais at one end of the room and seated himself upon a throne and the entertainment commenced  it was only what ancient history might have led me to expectmusicians dancing girls jugglers and the like  near midnight the master of ceremonies announced that the slave women who had been presented to the emperor since his arrival in new gondar would be exhibited that the royal host would select such as he wished after which he would present the balance of them to his guests  ah what royal generosity  a small door at one side of the room opened and the poor creatures filed in and were ranged in a long line before the throne  their backs were toward me  i saw only an occasional profile as now and then a bolder spirit among them turned to survey the apartment and the gorgeous assemblage of officers in their brilliant dress uniforms they were profiles of young girls and pretty but horror was indelibly stamped upon them all  i shuddered as i contemplated their sad fate and turned my eyes away  i heard the master of ceremonies command them to prostrate themselves before the emperor and the sounds as they went upon their knees before him touching their foreheads to the floor  then came the officials voice again in sharp and peremptory command  down slave he cried  make obeisance to your sovereign  i looked up attracted by the tone of the mans voice to see a single straight slim figure standing erect in the center of the line of prostrate girls her arms folded across her breast and little chin in the air  her back was toward mei could not see her face though i should like to see the countenance of this savage young lioness standing there defiant among that herd of terrified sheep  down  down shouted the master of ceremonies taking a step toward her and half drawing his sword  my blood boiled  to stand there inactive while a negro struck down that brave girl of my own race  instinctively i took a forward step to place myself in the mans path  but at the same instant menelek raised his hand in a gesture that halted the officer  the emperor seemed interested but in no way angered at the girls attitude  let us inquire he said in a smooth pleasant voice why this young woman refuses to do homage to her sovereign and he put the question himself directly to her  she answered him in abyssinian but brokenly and with an accent that betrayed how recently she had acquired her slight knowledge of the tongue  i go on my knees to no one she said  i have no sovereign  i myself am sovereign in my own country  menelek at her words leaned back in his throne and laughed uproariously  following his example which seemed always the correct procedure the assembled guests vied with one another in an effort to laugh more noisily than the emperor  the girl but tilted her chin a bit higher in the aireven her back proclaimed her utter contempt for her captors  finally menelek restored quiet by the simple expedient of a frown whereupon each loyal guest exchanged his mirthful mien for an emulative scowl  and who asked menelek are you and by what name is your country called  i am victory queen of grabritin replied the girl so quickly and so unexpectedly that i gasped in astonishment    9   victory  she was here a slave to these black conquerors  once more i started toward her but better judgment held me backi could do nothing to help her other than by stealth  could i even accomplish aught by this means  i did not know  it seemed beyond the pale of possibility and yet i should try  and you will not bend the knee to me continued menelek after she had spoken  victory shook her head in a most decided negation  you shall be my first choice then said the emperor  i like your spirit for the breaking of it will add to my pleasure in you and never fear but that it shall be brokenthis very night  take her to my apartments and he motioned to an officer at his side  i was surprised to see victory follow the man off in apparent quiet submission  i tried to follow that i might be near her against some opportunity to speak with her or assist in her escape  but after i had followed them from the throne room through several other apartments and down a long corridor i found my further progress barred by a soldier who stood guard before a doorway through which the officer conducted victory  almost immediately the officer reappeared and started back in the direction of the throne room  i had been hiding in a doorway after the guard had turned me back having taken refuge there while his back was turned and as the officer approached me i withdrew into the room beyond which was in darkness  there i remained for a long time watching the sentry before the door of the room in which victory was a prisoner and awaiting some favorable circumstance which would give me entry to her  i have not attempted to fully describe my sensations at the moment i recognized victory because i can assure you they were entirely indescribable  i should never have imagined that the sight of any human being could affect me as had this unexpected discovery of victory in the same room in which i was while i had thought of her for weeks either as dead or at best hundreds of miles to the west and as irretrievably lost to me as though she were in truth dead  i was filled with a strange mad impulse to be near her  it was not enough merely to assist her or protect heri desired to touch herto take her in my arms  i was astounded at myself  another thing puzzled meit was my incomprehensible feeling of elation since i had again seen her  with a fate worse than death staring her in the face and with the knowledge that i should probably die defending her within the hour i was still happier than i had been for weeksand all because i had seen again for a few brief minutes the figure of a little heathen maiden  i couldnt account for it and it angered me i had never before felt any such sensations in the presence of a woman and i had made love to some very beautiful ones in my time  it seemed ages that i stood in the shadow of that doorway in the illlit corridor of the palace of menelek xiv  a sickly gas jet cast a sad pallor upon the black face of the sentry  the fellow seemed rooted to the spot  evidently he would never leave or turn his back again  i had been in hiding but a short time when i heard the sound of distant cannon  the truce had ended and the battle had been resumed  very shortly thereafter the earth shook to the explosion of a shell within the city and from time to time thereafter other shells burst at no great distance from the palace  the yellow men were bombarding new gondar again  presently officers and slaves commenced to traverse the corridor on matters pertaining to their duties and then came the emperor scowling and wrathful  he was followed by a few personal attendants whom he dismissed at the doorway to his apartmentsthe same doorway through which victory had been taken  i chafed to follow him but the corridor was filled with people  at last they betook themselves to their own apartments which lay upon either side of the corridor  an officer and a slave entered the very room in which i hid forcing me to flatten myself to one side in the darkness until they had passed then the slave made a light and i knew that i must find another hiding place  stepping boldly into the corridor i saw that it was now empty save for the single sentry before the emperors door  he glanced up as i emerged from the room the occupants of which had not seen me  i walked straight toward the soldier my mind made up in an instant  i tried to simulate an expression of cringing servility and i must have succeeded for i entirely threw the man off his guard so that he permitted me to approach within reach of his rifle before stopping me then it was too latefor him  without a word or a warning i snatched the piece from his grasp and at the same time struck him a terrific blow between the eyes with my clenched fist  he staggered back in surprise too dumbfounded even to cry out and then i clubbed his rifle and felled him with a single mighty blow  a moment later i had burst into the room beyond  it was empty  i gazed about mad with disappointment  two doors opened from this to other rooms  i ran to the nearer and listened  yes voices were coming from beyond and one was a womans level and cold and filled with scorn  there was no terror in it  it was victorys  i turned the knob and pushed the door inward just in time to see menelek seize the girl and drag her toward the far end of the apartment  at the same instant there was a deafening roar just outside the palacea shell had struck much nearer than any of its predecessors  the noise of it drowned my rapid rush across the room  but in her struggles victory turned menelek about so that he saw me she was striking him in the face with her clenched fist and now he was choking her  at sight of me he gave voice to a roar of anger  what means this slave he cried  out of here out of here  quick before i kill you  but for answer i rushed upon him striking him with the butt of the rifle  he staggered back dropping victory to the floor and then he cried aloud for the guard and came at me  again and again i struck him but his thick skull might have been armor plate for all the damage i did it  he tried to close with me seizing the rifle but i was stronger than he and wrenching the weapon from his grasp tossed it aside and made for his throat with my bare hands  i had not dared fire the weapon for fear that its report would bring the larger guard stationed at the farther end of the corridor  we struggled about the room striking one another knocking over furniture and rolling upon the floor  menelek was a powerful man and he was fighting for his life  continually he kept calling for the guard until i succeeded in getting a grip upon his throat but it was too late  his cries had been heard and suddenly the door burst open and a score of armed guardsmen rushed into the apartment  victory seized the rifle from the floor and leaped between me and them i had the black emperor upon his back and both my hands were at his throat choking the life from him  the rest happened in the fraction of a second  there was a rending crash above us then a deafening explosion within the chamber  smoke and powder fumes filled the room  half stunned i rose from the lifeless body of my antagonist just in time to see victory stagger to her feet and turn toward me  slowly the smoke cleared to reveal the shattered remnants of the guard  a shell had fallen through the palace roof and exploded just in the rear of the detachment of guardsmen who were coming to the rescue of their emperor  why neither victory nor i were struck is a miracle  the room was a wreck  a great jagged hole was torn in the ceiling and the wall toward the corridor had been blown entirely out  as i rose victory had risen too and started toward me  but when she saw that i was uninjured she stopped and stood there in the center of the demolished apartment looking at me  her expression was inscrutablei could not guess whether she was glad to see me or not  victory i cried  thank god that you are safe and i approached her a greater gladness in my heart than i had felt since the moment that i knew the coldwater must be swept beyond thirty  there was no answering gladness in her eyes  instead she stamped her little foot in anger  why did it have to be you who saved me she exclaimed  i hate you  hate me i asked  why should you hate me victory  i do not hate you  ii  what was i about to say  i was very close to her as a great light broke over me  why had i never realized it before  the truth accounted for a great many hitherto inexplicable moods that had claimed me from time to time since first i had seen victory  why should i hate you she repeated  because snider told mehe told me that you had promised me to him but he did not get me  i killed him as i should like to kill you  snider lied i cried  and then i seized her and held her in my arms and made her listen to me though she struggled and fought like a young lioness  i love you victory  you must know that i love youthat i have always loved you and that i never could have made so base a promise  she ceased her struggles just a trifle but still tried to push me from her  you called me a barbarian she said  ah so that was it  that still rankled  i crushed her to me  you could not love a barbarian she went on but she had ceased to struggle  but i do love a barbarian victory i cried the dearest barbarian in the world  she raised her eyes to mine and then her smooth brown arms encircled my neck and drew my lips down to hers  i love youi have loved you always she said and then she buried her face upon my shoulder and sobbed  i have been so unhappy she said but i could not die while i thought that you might live  as we stood there momentarily forgetful of all else than our new found happiness the ferocity of the bombardment increased until scarce thirty seconds elapsed between the shells that rained about the palace  to remain long would be to invite certain death  we could not escape the way that we had entered the apartment for not only was the corridor now choked with debris but beyond the corridor there were doubtless many members of the emperors household who would stop us  upon the opposite side of the room was another door and toward this i led the way  it opened into a third apartment with windows overlooking an inner court  from one of these windows i surveyed the courtyard apparently it was empty and the rooms upon the opposite side were unlighted  assisting victory to the open i followed and together we crossed the court discovering upon the opposite side a number of wide wooden doors set in the wall of the palace with small windows between  as we stood close behind one of the doors listening a horse within neighed  the stables i whispered and a moment later had pushed back a door and entered  from the city about us we could hear the din of great commotion and quite close the sounds of battlethe crack of thousands of rifles the yells of the soldiers the hoarse commands of officers and the blare of bugles  the bombardment had ceased as suddenly as it had commenced  i judged that the enemy was storming the city for the sounds we heard were the sounds of handtohand combat  within the stables i groped about until i had found saddles and bridles for two horses  but afterward in the darkness i could find but a single mount  the doors of the opposite side leading to the street were open and we could see great multitudes of men women and children fleeing toward the west  soldiers afoot and mounted were joining the mad exodus  now and then a camel or an elephant would pass bearing some officer or dignitary to safety  it was evident that the city would fall at any momenta fact which was amply proclaimed by the terrorstricken haste of the fearmad mob  horse camel and elephant trod helpless women and children beneath their feet  a common soldier dragged a general from his mount and leaping to the animals back fled down the packed street toward the west  a woman seized a gun and brained a court dignitary whose horse had trampled her child to death  shrieks curses commands supplications filled the air  it was a frightful sceneone that will be burned upon my memory forever  i had saddled and bridled the single horse which had evidently been overlooked by the royal household in its flight and standing a little back in the shadow of the stables interior victory and i watched the surging throng without  to have entered it would have been to have courted greater danger than we were already in  we decided to wait until the stress of blacks thinned and for more than an hour we stood there while the sounds of battle raged upon the eastern side of the city and the population flew toward the west  more and more numerous became the uniformed soldiers among the fleeing throng until toward the last the street was packed with them  it was no orderly retreat but a rout complete and terrible  the fighting was steadily approaching us now until the crack of rifles sounded in the very street upon which we were looking  and then came a handful of brave mena little rear guard backing slowly toward the west working their smoking rifles in feverish haste as they fired volley after volley at the foe we could not see  but these were pressed back and back until the first line of the enemy came opposite our shelter  they were men of medium height with olive complexions and almond eyes  in them i recognized the descendants of the ancient chinese race  they were well uniformed and superbly armed and they fought bravely and under perfect discipline  so rapt was i in the exciting events transpiring in the street that i did not hear the approach of a body of men from behind  it was a party of the conquerors who had entered the palace and were searching it  they came upon us so unexpectedly that we were prisoners before we realized what had happened  that night we were held under a strong guard just outside the eastern wall of the city and the next morning were started upon a long march toward the east  our captors were not unkind to us and treated the women prisoners with respect  we marched for many daysso many that i lost count of themand at last we came to another citya chinese city this timewhich stands upon the site of ancient moscow  it is only a small frontier city but it is well built and well kept here a large military force is maintained and here also is a terminus of the railroad that crosses modern china to the pacific  there was every evidence of a high civilization in all that we saw within the city which in connection with the humane treatment that had been accorded all prisoners upon the long and tiresome march encouraged me to hope that i might appeal to some high officer here for the treatment which my rank and birth merited  we could converse with our captors only through the medium of interpreters who spoke both chinese and abyssinian  but there were many of these and shortly after we reached the city i persuaded one of them to carry a verbal message to the officer who had commanded the troops during the return from new gondar asking that i might be given a hearing by some high official  the reply to my request was a summons to appear before the officer to whom i had addressed my appeal  a sergeant came for me along with the interpreter and i managed to obtain his permission to let victory accompany mei had never left her alone with the prisoners since we had been captured  to my delight i found that the officer into whose presence we were conducted spoke abyssinian fluently  he was astounded when i told him that i was a panamerican  unlike all others whom i had spoken with since my arrival in europe he was well acquainted with ancient historywas familiar with twentieth century conditions in panamerica and after putting a half dozen questions to me was satisfied that i spoke the truth  when i told him that victory was queen of england he showed little surprise telling me that in their recent explorations in ancient russia they had found many descendants of the old nobility and royalty  he immediately set aside a comfortable house for us furnished us with servants and with money and in other ways showed us every attention and kindness  he told me that he would telegraph his emperor at once and the result was that we were presently commanded to repair to peking and present ourselves before the ruler  we made the journey in a comfortable railway carriage through a country which as we traveled farther toward the east showed increasing evidence of prosperity and wealth  at the imperial court we were received with great kindness the emperor being most inquisitive about the state of modern panamerica  he told me that while he personally deplored the existence of the strict regulations which had raised a barrier between the east and the west he had felt as had his predecessors that recognition of the wishes of the great panamerican federation would be most conducive to the continued peace of the world  his empire includes all of asia and the islands of the pacific as far east as 175dw  the empire of japan no longer exists having been conquered and absorbed by china over a hundred years ago  the philippines are well administered and constitute one of the most progressive colonies of the chinese empire  the emperor told me that the building of this great empire and the spreading of enlightenment among its diversified and savage peoples had required all the best efforts of nearly two hundred years  upon his accession to the throne he had found the labor well nigh perfected and had turned his attention to the reclamation of europe  his ambition is to wrest it from the hands of the blacks and then to attempt the work of elevating its fallen peoples to the high estate from which the great war precipitated them  i asked him who was victorious in that war and he shook his head sadly as he replied  panamerica perhaps and china with the blacks of abyssinia he said  those who did not fight were the only ones to reap any of the rewards that are supposed to belong to victory  the combatants reaped naught but annihilation  you have seenbetter than any man you must realize that there was no victory for any nation embroiled in that frightful war  when did it end i asked him  again he shook his head  it has not ended yet  there has never been a formal peace declared in europe  after a while there were none left to make peace and the rude tribes which sprang from the survivors continued to fight among themselves because they knew no better condition of society  war razed the works of manwar and pestilence razed man  god give that there shall never be such another war  you all know how porfirio johnson returned to panamerica with john alvarez in chains how alvarezs trial raised a popular demonstration that the government could not ignore  his eloquent appealnot for himself but for meis historic as are its results  you know how a fleet was sent across the atlantic to search for me how the restrictions against crossing thirty to one hundred seventyfive were removed forever and how the officers were brought to peking arriving upon the very day that victory and i were married at the imperial court  my return to panamerica was very different from anything i could possibly have imagined a year before  instead of being received as a traitor to my country i was acclaimed a hero  it was good to get back again good to witness the kindly treatment that was accorded my dear victory and when i learned that delcarte and taylor had been found at the mouth of the rhine and were already back in panamerica my joy was unalloyed  and now we are going back victory and i with the men and the munitions and power to reclaim england for her queen  again i shall cross thirty but under what altered conditions  a new epoch for europe is inaugurated with enlightened china on the east and enlightened panamerica on the westthe two great peace powers whom god has preserved to regenerate chastened and forgiven europe  i have been through muchi have suffered much but i have won two great laurel wreaths beyond thirty  one is the opportunity to rescue europe from barbarism the other is a little barbarian and the greater of these isvictory
