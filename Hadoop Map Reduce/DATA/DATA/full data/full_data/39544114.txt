39544114	areopagitica   a speech for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the parliament of england       this is true liberty when freeborn men      having to advise the public may speak free      which he who can and will deserves high praise      who neither can nor will may hold his peace      what can be juster in a state than this       euripid  hicetid   they who to states and governors of the commonwealth direct their speech high court of parliament or wanting such access in a private condition write that which they foresee may advance the public good i suppose them as at the beginning of no mean endeavour not a little altered and moved inwardly in their minds some with doubt of what will be the success others with fear of what will be the censure some with hope others with confidence of what they have to speak and me perhaps each of these dispositions as the subject was whereon i entered may have at other times variously affected and likely might in these foremost expressions now also disclose which of them swayed most but that the very attempt of this address thus made and the thought of whom it hath recourse to hath got the power within me to a passion far more welcome than incidental to a preface  which though i stay not to confess ere any ask i shall be blameless if it be no other than the joy and gratulation which it brings to all who wish and promote their countrys liberty whereof this whole discourse proposed will be a certain testimony if not a trophy for this is not the liberty which we can hope that no grievance ever should arise in the commonwealththat let no man in this world expect but when complaints are freely heard deeply considered and speedily reformed then is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise men look for to which if i now manifest by the very sound of this which i shall utter that we are already in good part arrived and yet from such a steep disadvantage of tyranny and superstition grounded into our principles as was beyond the manhood of a roman recovery it will be attributed first as is most due to the strong assistance of god our deliverer next to your faithful guidance and undaunted wisdom lords and commons of england neither is it in gods esteem the diminution of his glory when honourable things are spoken of good men and worthy magistrates which if i now first should begin to do after so fair a progress of your laudable deeds and such a long obligement upon the whole realm to your indefatigable virtues i might be justly reckoned among the tardiest and the unwillingest of them that praise ye  nevertheless there being three principal things without which all praising is but courtship and flattery first when that only is praised which is solidly worth praise next when greatest likelihoods are brought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are ascribed the other when he who praises by showing that such his actual persuasion is of whom he writes can demonstrate that he flatters not the former two of these i have heretofore endeavoured rescuing the employment from him who went about to impair your merits with a trivial and malignant encomium the latter as belonging chiefly to mine own acquittal that whom i so extolled i did not flatter hath been reserved opportunely to this occasion  for he who freely magnifies what hath been nobly done and fears not to declare as freely what might be done better gives ye the best covenant of his fidelity and that his loyalest affection and his hope waits on your proceedings his highest praising is not flattery and his plainest advice is a kind of praising for though i should affirm and hold by argument that it would fare better with truth with learning and the commonwealth if one of your published orders which i should name were called in yet at the same time it could not but much redound to the lustre of your mild and equal government whenas private persons are hereby animated to think ye better pleased with public advice than other statists have been delighted heretofore with public flattery and men will then see what difference there is between the magnanimity of a triennial parliament and that jealous haughtiness of prelates and cabin counsellors that usurped of late whenas they shall observe ye in the midst of your victories and successes more gently brooking written exceptions against a voted order than other courts which had produced nothing worth memory but the weak ostentation of wealth would have endured the least signified dislike at any sudden proclamation  if i should thus far presume upon the meek demeanour of your civil and gentle greatness lords and commons as what your published order hath directly said that to gainsay i might defend myself with ease if any should accuse me of being new or insolent did they but know how much better i find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant humanity of greece than the barbaric pride of a hunnish and norwegian stateliness and out of those ages to whose polite wisdom and letters we owe that we are not yet goths and jutlanders i could name him who from his private house wrote that discourse to the parliament of athens that persuades them to change the form of democracy which was then established such honour was done in those days to men who professed the study of wisdom and eloquence not only in their own country but in other lands that cities and signiories heard them gladly and with great respect if they had aught in public to admonish the state thus did dion prusaeus a stranger and a private orator counsel the rhodians against a former edict and i abound with other like examples which to set here would be superfluous  but if from the industry of a life wholly dedicated to studious labours and those natural endowments haply not the worst for two and fifty degrees of northern latitude so much must be derogated as to count me not equal to any of those who had this privilege i would obtain to be thought not so inferior as yourselves are superior to the most of them who received their counsel and how far you excel them be assured lords and commons there can no greater testimony appear than when your prudent spirit acknowledges and obeys the voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard speaking and renders ye as willing to repeal any act of your own setting forth as any set forth by your predecessors  if ye be thus resolved as it were injury to think ye were not i know not what should withhold me from presenting ye with a fit instance wherein to show both that love of truth which ye eminently profess and that uprightness of your judgment which is not wont to be partial to yourselves by judging over again that order which ye have ordained to regulate printingthat no book pamphlet or paper shall be henceforth printed unless the same be first approved and licensed by such or at least one of such as shall be thereto appointed for that part which preserves justly every mans copy to himself or provides for the poor i touch not only wish they be not made pretences to abuse and persecute honest and painful men who offend not in either of these particulars but that other clause of licensing books which we thought had died with his brother quadragesimal and matrimonial when the prelates expired i shall now attend with such a homily as shall lay before ye first the inventors of it to be those whom ye will be loath to own next what is to be thought in general of reading whatever sort the books be and that this order avails nothing to the suppressing of scandalous seditious and libellous books which were mainly intended to be suppressed last that it will be primely to the discouragement of all learning and the stop of truth not only by disexercising and blunting our abilities in what we know already but by hindering and cropping the discovery that might be yet further made both in religious and civil wisdom  i deny not but that it is of greatest concernment in the church and commonwealth to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as well as men and thereafter to confine imprison and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors for books are not absolutely dead things but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are nay they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them i know they are as lively and as vigorously productive as those fabulous dragons teeth and being sown up and down may chance to spring up armed men and yet on the other hand unless wariness be used as good almost kill a man as kill a good book who kills a man kills a reasonable creature gods image but he who destroys a good book kills reason itself kills the image of god as it were in the eye many a man lives a burden to the earth but a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life tis true no age can restore a life whereof perhaps there is no great loss and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth for the want of which whole nations fare the worse  we should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living labours of public men how we spill that seasoned life of man preserved and stored up in books since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed sometimes a martyrdom and if it extend to the whole impression a kind of massacre whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life but strikes at that ethereal and fifth essence the breath of reason itself slays an immortality rather than a life but lest i should be condemned of introducing license while i oppose licensing i refuse not the pains to be so much historical as will serve to show what hath been done by ancient and famous commonwealths against this disorder till the very time that this project of licensing crept out of the inquisition was catched up by our prelates and hath caught some of our presbyters  in athens where books and wits were ever busier than in any other part of greece i find but only two sorts of writings which the magistrate cared to take notice of those either blasphemous and atheistical or libellous thus the books of protagoras were by the judges of areopagus commanded to be burnt and himself banished the territory for a discourse begun with his confessing not to know whether there were gods or whether not and against defaming it was decreed that none should be traduced by name as was the manner of vetus comoedia whereby we may guess how they censured libelling and this course was quick enough as cicero writes to quell both the desperate wits of other atheists and the open way of defaming as the event showed of other sects and opinions though tending to voluptuousness and the denying of divine providence they took no heed  therefore we do not read that either epicurus or that libertine school of cyrene or what the cynic impudence uttered was ever questioned by the laws neither is it recorded that the writings of those old comedians were suppressed though the acting of them were forbid and that plato commended the reading of aristophanes the loosest of them all to his royal scholar dionysius is commonly known and may be excused if holy chrysostom as is reported nightly studied so much the same author and had the art to cleanse a scurrilous vehemence into the style of a rousing sermon  that other leading city of greece lacedaemon considering that lycurgus their lawgiver was so addicted to elegant learning as to have been the first that brought out of ionia the scattered works of homer and sent the poet thales from crete to prepare and mollify the spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes the better to plant among them law and civility it is to be wondered how museless and unbookish they were minding nought but the feats of war there needed no licensing of books among them for they disliked all but their own laconic apophthegms and took a slight occasion to chase archilochus out of their city perhaps for composing in a higher strain than their own soldierly ballads and roundels could reach to or if it were for his broad verses they were not therein so cautious but they were as dissolute in their promiscuous conversing whence euripides affirms in andromache that their women were all unchaste thus much may give us light after what sort of books were prohibited among the greeks  the romans also for many ages trained up only to a military roughness resembling most the lacedaemonian guise knew of learning little but what their twelve tables and the pontific college with their augurs and flamens taught them in religion and law so unacquainted with other learning that when carneades and critolaus with the stoic diogenes coming ambassadors to rome took thereby occasion to give the city a taste of their philosophy they were suspected for seducers by no less a man than cato the censor who moved it in the senate to dismiss them speedily and to banish all such attic babblers out of italy but scipio and others of the noblest senators withstood him and his old sabine austerity honoured and admired the men and the censor himself at last in his old age fell to the study of that whereof before he was so scrupulous and yet at the same time naevius and plautus the first latin comedians had filled the city with all the borrowed scenes of menander and philemon then began to be considered there also what was to be done to libellous books and authors for naevius was quickly cast into prison for his unbridled pen and released by the tribunes upon his recantation we read also that libels were burnt and the makers punished by augustus the like severity no doubt was used if aught were impiously written against their esteemed gods except in these two points how the world went in books the magistrate kept no reckoning  and therefore lucretius without impeachment versifies his epicurism to memmius and had the honour to be set forth the second time by cicero so great a father of the commonwealth although himself disputes against that opinion in his own writings nor was the satirical sharpness or naked plainness of lucilius or catullus or flaccus by any order prohibited and for matters of state the story of titus livius though it extolled that part which pompey held was not therefore suppressed by octavius caesar of the other faction but that naso was by him banished in his old age for the wanton poems of his youth was but a mere covert of state over some secret cause and besides the books were neither banished nor called in from hence we shall meet with little else but tyranny in the roman empire that we may not marvel if not so often bad as good books were silenced i shall therefore deem to have been large enough in producing what among the ancients was punishable to write save only which all other arguments were free to treat on  by this time the emperors were become christians whose discipline in this point i do not find to have been more severe than what was formerly in practice the books of those whom they took to be grand heretics were examined refuted and condemned in the general councils and not till then were prohibited or burnt by authority of the emperor as for the writings of heathen authors unless they were plain invectives against christianity as those of porphyrius and proclus they met with no interdict that can be cited till about the year 400 in a carthaginian council wherein bishops themselves were forbid to read the books of gentiles but heresies they might read while others long before them on the contrary scrupled more the books of heretics than of gentiles and that the primitive councils and bishops were wont only to declare what books were not commendable passing no further but leaving it to each ones conscience to read or to lay by till after the year 800 is observed already by padre paolo the great unmasker of the trentine council  after which time the popes of rome engrossing what they pleased of political rule into their own hands extended their dominion over mens eyes as they had before over their judgments burning and prohibiting to be read what they fancied not yet sparing in their censures and the books not many which they so dealt with till martin v by his bull not only prohibited but was the first that excommunicated the reading of heretical books for about that time wickliffe and huss growing terrible were they who first drove the papal court to a stricter policy of prohibiting which course leo x and his successors followed until the council of trent and the spanish inquisition engendering together brought forth or perfected those catalogues and expurging indexes that rake through the entrails of many an old good author with a violation worse than any could be offered to his tomb nor did they stay in matters heretical but any subject that was not to their palate they either condemned in a prohibition or had it straight into the new purgatory of an index  to fill up the measure of encroachment their last invention was to ordain that no book pamphlet or paper should be printed as if st peter had bequeathed them the keys of the press also out of paradise unless it were approved and licensed under the hands of two or three glutton friars for example       let the chancellor cini be pleased to see if in this present      work be contained aught that may withstand the printing       vincent rabbatta  vicar of florence        i have seen this present work and find nothing athwart the      catholic faith and good manners in witness whereof i      have given etc       nicolo gini  chancellor of florence        attending the precedent relation it is allowed that this      present work of davanzati may be printed       vincent rabbatta  etc        it may be printed july 15       friar simon mompei damelia      chancellor of the holy office in florence  sure they have a conceit if he of the bottomless pit had not long since broke prison that this quadruple exorcism would bar him down i fear their next design will be to get into their custody the licensing of that which they say claudius intended but went not through with vouchsafe to see another of their forms the roman stamp       imprimatur if it seem good to the reverend master of the      holy palace       belcastro  vicegerent        imprimatur friar nicolo rodolphi master of the holy palace  sometimes five imprimaturs are seen together dialoguewise in the piazza of one titlepage complimenting and ducking each to other with their shaven reverences whether the author who stands by in perplexity at the foot of his epistle shall to the press or to the sponge these are the pretty responsories these are the dear antiphonies that so bewitched of late our prelates and their chaplains with the goodly echo they made and besotted us to the gay imitation of a lordly imprimatur one from lambeth house another from the west end of pauls so apishly romanizing that the word of command still was set down in latin as if the learned grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no ink without latin or perhaps as they thought because no vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure conceit of an imprimatur but rather as i hope for that our english the language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements of liberty will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a dictatory presumption english  and thus ye have the inventors and the original of booklicensing ripped up and drawn as lineally as any pedigree we have it not that can be heard of from any ancient state or polity or church nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later nor from the modern custom of any reformed city or church abroad but from the most antichristian council and the most tyrannous inquisition that ever inquired till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb no envious juno sat crosslegged over the nativity of any mans intellectual offspring but if it proved a monster who denies but that it was justly burnt or sunk into the sea but that a book in worse condition than a peccant soul should be to stand before a jury ere it be born to the world and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of radamanth and his colleagues ere it can pass the ferry backward into light was never heard before till that mysterious iniquity provoked and troubled at the first entrance of reformation sought out new limbos and new hells wherein they might include our books also within the number of their damned and this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up and so illfavouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops and the attendant minorites their chaplains that ye like not now these most certain authors of this licensing order and that all sinister intention was far distant from your thoughts when ye were importuned the passing it all men who know the integrity of your actions and how ye honour truth will clear ye readily  but some will say what though the inventors were bad the thing for all that may be good it may so yet if that thing be no such deep invention but obvious and easy for any man to light on and yet best and wisest commonwealths through all ages and occasions have forborne to use it and falsest seducers and oppressors of men were the first who took it up and to no other purpose but to obstruct and hinder the first approach of reformation i am of those who believe it will be a harder alchemy than lullius ever knew to sublimate any good use out of such an invention yet this only is what i request to gain from this reason that it may be held a dangerous and suspicious fruit as certainly it deserves for the tree that bore it until i can dissect one by one the properties it has but i have first to finish as was propounded what is to be thought in general of reading books whatever sort they be and whether be more the benefit or the harm that thence proceeds  not to insist upon the examples of moses daniel and paul who were skilful in all the learning of the egyptians chaldeans and greeks which could not probably be without reading their books of all sorts in paul especially who thought it no defilement to insert into holy scripture the sentences of three greek poets and one of them a tragedian the question was notwithstanding sometimes controverted among the primitive doctors but with great odds on that side which affirmed it both lawful and profitable as was then evidently perceived when julian the apostate and subtlest enemy to our faith made a decree forbidding christians the study of heathen learning for said he they wound us with our own weapons and with our own arts and sciences they overcome us and indeed the christians were put so to their shifts by this crafty means and so much in danger to decline into all ignorance that the two apollinarii were fain as a man may say to coin all the seven liberal sciences out of the bible reducing it into divers forms of orations poems dialogues even to the calculating of a new christian grammar but saith the historian socrates the providence of god provided better than the industry of apollinarius and his son by taking away that illiterate law with the life of him who devised it so great an injury they then held it to be deprived of hellenic learning and thought it a persecution more undermining and secretly decaying the church than the open cruelty of decius or diocletian  and perhaps it was the same politic drift that the devil whipped st jerome in a lenten dream for reading cicero or else it was a phantasm bred by the fever which had then seized him for had an angel been his discipliner unless it were for dwelling too much upon ciceronianisms and had chastised the reading not the vanity it had been plainly partial first to correct him for grave cicero and not for scurril plautus whom he confesses to have been reading not long before next to correct him only and let so many more ancient fathers wax old in those pleasant and florid studies without the lash of such a tutoring apparition insomuch that basil teaches how some good use may be made of margites a sportful poem not now extant writ by homer and why not then of morgante an italian romance much to the same purpose  but if it be agreed we shall be tried by visions there is a vision recorded by eusebius far ancienter than this tale of jerome to the nun eustochium and besides has nothing of a fever in it dionysius alexandrinus was about the year 240 a person of great name in the church for piety and learning who had wont to avail himself much against heretics by being conversant in their books until a certain presbyter laid it scrupulously to his conscience how he durst venture himself among those defiling volumes the worthy man loath to give offence fell into a new debate with himself what was to be thought when suddenly a vision sent from god it is his own epistle that so avers it confirmed him in these words read any books whatever come to thy hands for thou art sufficient both to judge aright and to examine each matter to this revelation he assented the sooner as he confesses because it was answerable to that of the apostle to the thessalonians prove all things hold fast that which is good and he might have added another remarkable saying of the same author to the pure all things are pure not only meats and drinks but all kind of knowledge whether of good or evil the knowledge cannot defile nor consequently the books if the will and conscience be not defiled  for books are as meats and viands are some of good some of evil substance and yet god in that unapocryphal vision said without exception rise peter kill and eat leaving the choice to each mans discretion wholesome meats to a vitiated stomach differ little or nothing from unwholesome and best books to a naughty mind are not unappliable to occasions of evil bad meats will scarce breed good nourishment in the healthiest concoction but herein the difference is of bad books that they to a discreet and judicious reader serve in many respects to discover to confute to forewarn and to illustrate whereof what better witness can ye expect i should produce than one of your own now sitting in parliament the chief of learned men reputed in this land mr selden whose volume of natural and national laws proves not only by great authorities brought together but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative that all opinions yea errors known read and collated are of main service and assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest i conceive therefore that when god did enlarge the universal diet of mans body saving ever the rules of temperance he then also as before left arbitrary the dieting and repasting of our minds as wherein every mature man might have to exercise his own leading capacity  how great a virtue is temperance how much of moment through the whole life of man yet god commits the managing so great a trust without particular law or prescription wholly to the demeanour of every grown man and therefore when he himself tabled the jews from heaven that omer which was every mans daily portion of manna is computed to have been more than might have well sufficed the heartiest feeder thrice as many meals for those actions which enter into a man rather than issue out of him and therefore defile not god uses not to captivate under a perpetual childhood of prescription but trusts him with the gift of reason to be his own chooser there were but little work left for preaching if law and compulsion should grow so fast upon those things which heretofore were governed only by exhortation solomon informs us that much reading is a weariness to the flesh but neither he nor other inspired author tells us that such or such reading is unlawful yet certainly had god thought good to limit us herein it had been much more expedient to have told us what was unlawful than what was wearisome as for the burning of those ephesian books by st pauls converts tis replied the books were magic the syriac so renders them it was a private act a voluntary act and leaves us to a voluntary imitation the men in remorse burnt those books which were their own the magistrate by this example is not appointed these men practised the books another might perhaps have read them in some sort usefully  good and evil we know in the field of this world grow up together almost inseparably and the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven with the knowledge of evil and in so many cunning resemblances hardly to be discerned that those confused seeds which were imposed upon psyche as an incessant labour to cull out and sort asunder were not more intermixed it was from out the rind of one apple tasted that the knowledge of good and evil as two twins cleaving together leaped forth into the world and perhaps this is that doom which adam fell into of knowing good and evil that is to say of knowing good by evil as therefore the state of man now is what wisdom can there be to choose what continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil he that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures and yet abstain and yet distinguish and yet prefer that which is truly better he is the true warfaring christian  i cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and unbreathed that never sallies out and sees her adversary but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for not without dust and heat assuredly we bring not innocence into the world we bring impurity much rather that which purifies us is trial and trial is by what is contrary that virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evil and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers and rejects it is but a blank virtue not a pure her whiteness is but an excremental whiteness which was the reason why our sage and serious poet spenser whom i dare be known to think a better teacher than scotus or aquinas describing true temperance under the person of guion brings him in with his palmer through the cave of mammon and the bower of earthly bliss that he might see and know and yet abstain since therefore the knowledge and survey of vice is in this world so necessary to the constituting of human virtue and the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth how can we more safely and with less danger scout into the regions of sin and falsity than by reading all manner of tractates and hearing all manner of reason and this is the benefit which may be had of books promiscuously read  but of the harm that may result hence three kinds are usually reckoned first is feared the infection that may spread but then all human learning and controversy in religious points must remove out of the world yea the bible itself for that ofttimes relates blasphemy not nicely it describes the carnal sense of wicked men not unelegantly it brings in holiest men passionately murmuring against providence through all the arguments of epicurus in other great disputes it answers dubiously and darkly to the common reader and ask a talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal keri that moses and all the prophets cannot persuade him to pronounce the textual chetiv for these causes we all know the bible itself put by the papist must be next removed as clement of alexandria and that eusebian book of evangelic preparation transmitting our ears through a hoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the gospel who finds not that irenaeus epiphanius jerome and others discover more heresies than they well confute and that oft for heresy which is the truer opinion  nor boots it to say for these and all the heathen writers of greatest infection if it must be thought so with whom is bound up the life of human learning that they writ in an unknown tongue so long as we are sure those languages are known as well to the worst of men who are both most able and most diligent to instil the poison they suck first into the courts of princes acquainting them with the choicest delights and criticisms of sin as perhaps did that petronius whom nero called his arbiter the master of his revels and the notorious ribald of arezzo dreaded and yet dear to the italian courtiers i name not him for posteritys sake whom henry viii named in merriment his vicar of hell by which compendious way all the contagion that foreign books can infuse will find a passage to the people far easier and shorter than an indian voyage though it could be sailed either by the north of cataio eastward or of canada westward while our spanish licensing gags the english press never so severely  but on the other side that infection which is from books of controversy in religion is more doubtful and dangerous to the learned than to the ignorant and yet those books must be permitted untouched by the licenser it will be hard to instance where any ignorant man hath been ever seduced by papistical book in english unless it were commended and expounded to him by some of that clergy and indeed all such tractates whether false or true are as the prophecy of isaiah was to the eunuch not to be understood without a guide but of our priests and doctors how many have been corrupted by studying the comments of jesuits and sorbonists and how fast they could transfuse that corruption into the people our experience is both late and sad it is not forgot since the acute and distinct arminius was perverted merely by the perusing of a nameless discourse written at delft which at first he took in hand to confute  seeing therefore that those books and those in great abundance which are likeliest to taint both life and doctrine cannot be suppressed without the fall of learning and of all ability in disputation and that these books of either sort are most and soonest catching to the learned from whom to the common people whatever is heretical or dissolute may quickly be conveyed and that evil manners are as perfectly learnt without books a thousand other ways which cannot be stopped and evil doctrine not with books can propagate except a teacher guide which he might also do without writing and so beyond prohibiting i am not able to unfold how this cautelous enterprise of licensing can be exempted from the number of vain and impossible attempts and he who were pleasantly disposed could not well avoid to liken it to the exploit of that gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by shutting his park gate  besides another inconvenience if learned men be the first receivers out of books and dispreaders both of vice and error how shall the licensers themselves be confided in unless we can confer upon them or they assume to themselves above all others in the land the grace of infallibility and uncorruptedness and again if it be true that a wise man like a good refiner can gather gold out of the drossiest volume and that a fool will be a fool with the best book yea or without book there is no reason that we should deprive a wise man of any advantage to his wisdom while we seek to restrain from a fool that which being restrained will be no hindrance to his folly for if there should be so much exactness always used to keep that from him which is unfit for his reading we should in the judgment of aristotle not only but of solomon and of our saviour not vouchsafe him good precepts and by consequence not willingly admit him to good books as being certain that a wise man will make better use of an idle pamphlet than a fool will do of sacred scripture  tis next alleged we must not expose ourselves to temptations without necessity and next to that not employ our time in vain things to both these objections one answer will serve out of the grounds already laid that to all men such books are not temptations nor vanities but useful drugs and materials wherewith to temper and compose effective and strong medicines which mans life cannot want the rest as children and childish men who have not the art to qualify and prepare these working minerals well may be exhorted to forbear but hindered forcibly they cannot be by all the licensing that sainted inquisition could ever yet contrive which is what i promised to deliver next that this order of licensing conduces nothing to the end for which it was framed and hath almost prevented me by being clear already while thus much hath been explaining see the ingenuity of truth who when she gets a free and willing hand opens herself faster than the pace of method and discourse can overtake her  it was the task which i began with to show that no nation or wellinstituted state if they valued books at all did ever use this way of licensing and it might be answered that this is a piece of prudence lately discovered to which i return that as it was a thing slight and obvious to think on so if it had been difficult to find out there wanted not among them long since who suggested such a course which they not following leave us a pattern of their judgment that it was not the rest knowing but the not approving which was the cause of their not using it  plato a man of high authority indeed but least of all for his commonwealth in the book of his laws which no city ever yet received fed his fancy by making many edicts to his airy burgomasters which they who otherwise admire him wish had been rather buried and excused in the genial cups of an academic night sitting by which laws he seems to tolerate no kind of learning but by unalterable decree consisting most of practical traditions to the attainment whereof a library of smaller bulk than his own dialogues would be abundant and there also enacts that no poet should so much as read to any private man what he had written until the judges and lawkeepers had seen it and allowed it but that plato meant this law peculiarly to that commonwealth which he had imagined and to no other is evident why was he not else a lawgiver to himself but a transgressor and to be expelled by his own magistrates both for the wanton epigrams and dialogues which he made and his perpetual reading of sophron mimus and aristophanes books of grossest infamy and also for commending the latter of them though he were the malicious libeller of his chief friends to be read by the tyrant dionysius who had little need of such trash to spend his time on but that he knew this licensing of poems had reference and dependence to many other provisos there set down in his fancied republic which in this world could have no place and so neither he himself nor any magistrate or city ever imitated that course which taken apart from those other collateral injunctions must needs be vain and fruitless for if they fell upon one kind of strictness unless their care were equal to regulate all other things of like aptness to corrupt the mind that single endeavour they knew would be but a fond labour to shut and fortify one gate against corruption and be necessitated to leave others round about wide open  if we think to regulate printing thereby to rectify manners we must regulate all recreation and pastimes all that is delightful to man no music must be heard no song be set or sung but what is grave and doric there must be licensing dancers that no gesture motion or deportment be taught our youth but what by their allowance shall be thought honest for such plato was provided of it will ask more than the work of twenty licensers to examine all the lutes the violins and the guitars in every house they must not be suffered to prattle as they do but must be licensed what they may say and who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers the windows also and the balconies must be thought on there are shrewd books with dangerous frontispieces set to sale who shall prohibit them shall twenty licensers the villages also must have their visitors to inquire what lectures the bagpipe and the rebeck reads even to the ballatry and the gamut of every municipal fiddler for these are the countrymans arcadias and his monte mayors  next what more national corruption for which england hears ill abroad than household gluttony who shall be the rectors of our daily rioting and what shall be done to inhibit the multitudes that frequent those houses where drunkenness is sold and harboured our garments also should be referred to the licensing of some more sober workmasters to see them cut into a less wanton garb who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth male and female together as is the fashion of this country who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed what presumed and no further lastly who shall forbid and separate all idle resort all evil company these things will be and must be but how they shall be least hurtful how least enticing herein consists the grave and governing wisdom of a state  to sequester out of the world into atlantic and utopian polities which never can be drawn into use will not mend our condition but to ordain wisely as in this world of evil in the midst whereof god hath placed us unavoidably nor is it platos licensing of books will do this which necessarily pulls along with it so many other kinds of licensing as will make us all both ridiculous and weary and yet frustrate but those unwritten or at least unconstraining laws of virtuous education religious and civil nurture which plato there mentions as the bonds and ligaments of the commonwealth the pillars and the sustainers of every written statute these they be which will bear chief sway in such matters as these when all licensing will be easily eluded impunity and remissness for certain are the bane of a commonwealth but here the great art lies to discern in what the law is to bid restraint and punishment and in what things persuasion only is to work  if every action which is good or evil in man at ripe years were to be under pittance and prescription and compulsion what were virtue but a name what praise could be then due to welldoing what gramercy to be sober just or continent many there be that complain of divine providence for suffering adam to transgress foolish tongues when god gave him reason he gave him freedom to choose for reason is but choosing he had been else a mere artificial adam such an adam as he is in the motions we ourselves esteem not of that obedience or love or gift which is of force god therefore left him free set before him a provoking object ever almost in his eyes herein consisted his merit herein the right of his reward the praise of his abstinence wherefore did he create passions within us pleasures round about us but that these rightly tempered are the very ingredients of virtue  they are not skilful considerers of human things who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin for besides that it is a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing though some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons it cannot from all in such a universal thing as books are and when this is done yet the sin remains entire though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure he has yet one jewel left ye cannot bereave him of his covetousness banish all objects of lust shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised in any hermitage ye cannot make them chaste that came not hither so such great care and wisdom is required to the right managing of this point suppose we could expel sin by this means look how much we thus expel of sin so much we expel of virtue for the matter of them both is the same remove that and ye remove them both alike  this justifies the high providence of god who though he command us temperance justice continence yet pours out before us even to a profuseness all desirable things and gives us minds that can wander beyond all limit and satiety why should we then affect a rigour contrary to the manner of god and of nature by abridging or scanting those means which books freely permitted are both to the trial of virtue and the exercise of truth it would be better done to learn that the law must needs be frivolous which goes to restrain things uncertainly and yet equally working to good and to evil and were i the chooser a dream of welldoing should be preferred before many times as much the forcible hindrance of evildoing for god sure esteems the growth and completing of one virtuous person more than the restraint of ten vicious  and albeit whatever thing we hear or see sitting walking travelling or conversing may be fitly called our book and is of the same effect that writings are yet grant the thing to be prohibited were only books it appears that this order hitherto is far insufficient to the end which it intends do we not see not once or oftener but weekly that continued courtlibel against the parliament and city printed as the wet sheets can witness and dispersed among us for all that licensing can do yet this is the prime service a man would think wherein this order should give proof of itself if it were executed youll say but certain if execution be remiss or blindfold now and in this particular what will it be hereafter and in other books if then the order shall not be vain and frustrate behold a new labour lords and commons ye must repeal and proscribe all scandalous and unlicensed books already printed and divulged after ye have drawn them up into a list that all may know which are condemned and which not and ordain that no foreign books be delivered out of custody till they have been read over this office will require the whole time of not a few overseers and those no vulgar men there be also books which are partly useful and excellent partly culpable and pernicious this work will ask as many more officials to make expurgations and expunctions that the commonwealth of learning be not damnified in fine when the multitude of books increase upon their hands ye must be fain to catalogue all those printers who are found frequently offending and forbid the importation of their whole suspected typography in a word that this your order may be exact and not deficient ye must reform it perfectly according to the model of trent and seville which i know ye abhor to do  yet though ye should condescend to this which god forbid the order still would be but fruitless and defective to that end whereto ye meant it if to prevent sects and schisms who is so unread or so uncatechized in story that hath not heard of many sects refusing books as a hindrance and preserving their doctrine unmixed for many ages only by unwritten traditions the christian faith for that was once a schism is not unknown to have spread all over asia ere any gospel or epistle was seen in writing if the amendment of manners be aimed at look into italy and spain whether those places be one scruple the better the honester the wiser the chaster since all the inquisitional rigour that hath been executed upon books  another reason whereby to make it plain that this order will miss the end it seeks consider by the quality which ought to be in every licenser it cannot be denied but that he who is made judge to sit upon the birth or death of books whether they may be wafted into this world or not had need to be a man above the common measure both studious learned and judicious there may be else no mean mistakes in the censure of what is passable or not which is also no mean injury if he be of such worth as behooves him there cannot be a more tedious and unpleasing journeywork a greater loss of time levied upon his head than to be made the perpetual reader of unchosen books and pamphlets ofttimes huge volumes there is no book that is acceptable unless at certain seasons but to be enjoined the reading of that at all times and in a hand scarce legible whereof three pages would not down at any time in the fairest print is an imposition which i cannot believe how he that values time and his own studies or is but of a sensible nostril should be able to endure in this one thing i crave leave of the present licensers to be pardoned for so thinking who doubtless took this office up looking on it through their obedience to the parliament whose command perhaps made all things seem easy and unlaborious to them but that this short trial hath wearied them out already their own expressions and excuses to them who make so many journeys to solicit their licence are testimony enough seeing therefore those who now possess the employment by all evident signs wish themselves well rid of it and that no man of worth none that is not a plain unthrift of his own hours is ever likely to succeed them except he mean to put himself to the salary of a press corrector we may easily foresee what kind of licensers we are to expect hereafter either ignorant imperious and remiss or basely pecuniary this is what i had to show wherein this order cannot conduce to that end whereof it bears the intention  i lastly proceed from the no good it can do to the manifest hurt it causes in being first the greatest discouragement and affront that can be offered to learning and to learned men  it was the complaint and lamentation of prelates upon every least breath of a motion to remove pluralities and distribute more equally church revenues that then all learning would be for ever dashed and discouraged but as for that opinion i never found cause to think that the tenth part of learning stood or fell with the clergy nor could i ever but hold it for a sordid and unworthy speech of any churchman who had a competency left him if therefore ye be loath to dishearten utterly and discontent not the mercenary crew of false pretenders to learning but the free and ingenuous sort of such as evidently were born to study and love learning for itself not for lucre or any other end but the service of god and of truth and perhaps that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise which god and good men have consented shall be the reward of those whose published labours advance the good of mankind then know that so far to distrust the judgment and the honesty of one who hath but a common repute in learning and never yet offended as not to count him fit to print his mind without a tutor and examiner lest he should drop a schism or something of corruption is the greatest displeasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him  what advantage is it to be a man over it is to be a boy at school if we have only escaped the ferula to come under the fescue of an imprimatur if serious and elaborate writings as if they were no more than the theme of a grammarlad under his pedagogue must not be uttered without the cursory eyes of a temporizing and extemporizing licenser he who is not trusted with his own actions his drift not being known to be evil and standing to the hazard of law and penalty has no great argument to think himself reputed in the commonwealth wherein he was born for other than a fool or a foreigner when a man writes to the world he summons up all his reason and deliberation to assist him he searches meditates is industrious and likely consults and confers with his judicious friends after all which done he takes himself to be informed in what he writes as well as any that writ before him if in this the most consummate act of his fidelity and ripeness no years no industry no former proof of his abilities can bring him to that state of maturity as not to be still mistrusted and suspected unless he carry all his considerate diligence all his midnight watchings and expense of palladian oil to the hasty view of an unleisured licenser perhaps much his younger perhaps his inferior in judgment perhaps one who never knew the labour of bookwriting and if he be not repulsed or slighted must appear in print like a puny with his guardian and his censors hand on the back of his title to be his bail and surety that he is no idiot or seducer it cannot be but a dishonour and derogation to the author to the book to the privilege and dignity of learning  and what if the author shall be one so copious of fancy as to have many things well worth the adding come into his mind after licensing while the book is yet under the press which not seldom happens to the best and diligentest writers and that perhaps a dozen times in one book the printer dares not go beyond his licensed copy so often then must the author trudge to his leavegiver that those his new insertions may be viewed and many a jaunt will be made ere that licenser for it must be the same man can either be found or found at leisure meanwhile either the press must stand still which is no small damage or the author lose his accuratest thoughts and send the book forth worse than he had made it which to a diligent writer is the greatest melancholy and vexation that can befall  and how can a man teach with authority which is the life of teaching how can he be a doctor in his book as he ought to be or else had better be silent whenas all he teaches all he delivers is but under the tuition under the correction of his patriarchal licenser to blot or alter what precisely accords not with the hidebound humour which he calls his judgment when every acute reader upon the first sight of a pedantic licence will be ready with these like words to ding the book a quoits distance from him i hate a pupil teacher i endure not an instructor that comes to me under the wardship of an overseeing fist i know nothing of the licenser but that i have his own hand here for his arrogance who shall warrant me his judgment the state sir replies the stationer but has a quick return the state shall be my governors but not my critics they may be mistaken in the choice of a licenser as easily as this licenser may be mistaken in an author this is some common stuff and he might add from sir francis bacon that such authorized books are but the language of the times for though a licenser should happen to be judicious more than ordinary which will be a great jeopardy of the next succession yet his very office and his commission enjoins him to let pass nothing but what is vulgarly received already  nay which is more lamentable if the work of any deceased author though never so famous in his lifetime and even to this day come to their hands for licence to be printed or reprinted if there be found in his book one sentence of a venturous edge uttered in the height of zeal and who knows whether it might not be the dictate of a divine spirit yet not suiting with every low decrepit humour of their own though it were knox himself the reformer of a kingdom that spake it they will not pardon him their dash the sense of that great man shall to all posterity be lost for the fearfulness or the presumptuous rashness of a perfunctory licenser and to what an author this violence hath been lately done and in what book of greatest consequence to be faithfully published i could now instance but shall forbear till a more convenient season  yet if these things be not resented seriously and timely by them who have the remedy in their power but that such ironmoulds as these shall have authority to gnaw out the choicest periods of exquisitest books and to commit such a treacherous fraud against the orphan remainders of worthiest men after death the more sorrow will belong to that hapless race of men whose misfortune it is to have understanding henceforth let no man care to learn or care to be more than worldlywise for certainly in higher matters to be ignorant and slothful to be a common steadfast dunce will be the only pleasant life and only in request  and it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive and most injurious to the written labours and monuments of the dead so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole nation i cannot set so light by all the invention the art the wit the grave and solid judgment which is in england as that it can be comprehended in any twenty capacities how good soever much less that it should not pass except their superintendence be over it except it be sifted and strained with their strainers that it should be uncurrent without their manual stamp truth and understanding are not such wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and statutes and standards we must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land to mark and licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks what is it but a servitude like that imposed by the philistines not to be allowed the sharpening of our own axes and coulters but we must repair from all quarters to twenty licensing forges had anyone written and divulged erroneous things and scandalous to honest life misusing and forfeiting the esteem had of his reason among men if after conviction this only censure were adjudged him that he should never henceforth write but what were first examined by an appointed officer whose hand should be annexed to pass his credit for him that now he might be safely read it could not be apprehended less than a disgraceful punishment whence to include the whole nation and those that never yet thus offended under such a diffident and suspectful prohibition may plainly be understood what a disparagement it is so much the more whenas debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper but unoffensive books must not stir forth without a visible jailer in their title  nor is it to the common people less than a reproach for if we be so jealous over them as that we dare not trust them with an english pamphlet what do we but censure them for a giddy vicious and ungrounded people in such a sick and weak state of faith and discretion as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licenser that this is care or love of them we cannot pretend whenas in those popish places where the laity are most hated and despised the same strictness is used over them wisdom we cannot call it because it stops but one breach of licence nor that neither whenas those corruptions which it seeks to prevent break in faster at other doors which cannot be shut  and in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our ministers also of whose labours we should hope better and of the proficiency which their flock reaps by them than that after all this light of the gospel which is and is to be and all this continual preaching they should still be frequented with such an unprincipled unedified and laic rabble as that the whiff of every new pamphlet should stagger them out of their catechism and christian walking this may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their exhortations and the benefiting of their hearers as that they are not thought fit to be turned loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser that all the sermons all the lectures preached printed vented in such numbers and such volumes as have now well nigh made all other books unsaleable should not be armour enough against one single enchiridion without the castle of st angelo of an imprimatur  and lest some should persuade ye lords and commons that these arguments of learned mens discouragement at this your order are mere flourishes and not real i could recount what i have seen and heard in other countries where this kind of inquisition tyrannizes when i have sat among their learned men for that honour i had and been counted happy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom as they supposed england was while themselves did nothing but bemoan the servile condition into which learning amongst them was brought that this was it which had damped the glory of italian wits that nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian there it was that i found and visited the famous galileo grown old a prisoner to the inquisition for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the franciscan and dominican licensers thought and though i knew that england then was groaning loudest under the prelatical yoke nevertheless i took it as a pledge of future happiness that other nations were so persuaded of her liberty yet was it beyond my hope that those worthies were then breathing in her air who should be her leaders to such a deliverance as shall never be forgotten by any revolution of time that this world hath to finish when that was once begun it was as little in my fear that what words of complaint i heard among learned men of other parts uttered against the inquisition the same i should hear by as learned men at home uttered in time of parliament against an order of licensing and that so generally that when i had disclosed myself a companion of their discontent i might say if without envy that he whom an honest quaestorship had endeared to the sicilians was not more by them importuned against verres than the favourable opinion which i had among many who honour ye and are known and respected by ye loaded me with entreaties and persuasions that i would not despair to lay together that which just reason should bring into my mind toward the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon learning that this is not therefore the disburdening of a particular fancy but the common grievance of all those who had prepared their minds and studies above the vulgar pitch to advance truth in others and from others to entertain it thus much may satisfy  and in their name i shall for neither friend nor foe conceal what the general murmur is that if it come to inquisitioning again and licensing and that we are so timorous of ourselves and so suspicious of all men as to fear each book and the shaking of every leaf before we know what the contents are if some who but of late were little better than silenced from preaching shall come now to silence us from reading except what they please it cannot be guessed what is intended by some but a second tyranny over learning and will soon put it out of controversy that bishops and presbyters are the same to us both name and thing that those evils of prelaty which before from five or six and twenty sees were distributively charged upon the whole people will now light wholly upon learning is not obscure to us whenas now the pastor of a small unlearned parish on the sudden shall be exalted archbishop over a large diocese of books and yet not remove but keep his other cure too a mystical pluralist he who but of late cried down the sole ordination of every novice bachelor of art and denied sole jurisdiction over the simplest parishioner shall now at home in his private chair assume both these over worthiest and excellentest books and ablest authors that write them  this is not ye covenants and protestations that we have made this is not to put down prelaty this is but to chop an episcopacy this is but to translate the palace metropolitan from one kind of dominion into another this is but an old canonical sleight of commuting our penance to startle thus betimes at a mere unlicensed pamphlet will after a while be afraid of every conventicle and a while after will make a conventicle of every christian meeting but i am certain that a state governed by the rules of justice and fortitude or a church built and founded upon the rock of faith and true knowledge cannot be so pusillanimous while things are yet not constituted in religion that freedom of writing should be restrained by a discipline imitated from the prelates and learnt by them from the inquisition to shut us up all again into the breast of a licenser must needs give cause of doubt and discouragement to all learned and religious men  who cannot but discern the fineness of this politic drift and who are the contrivers that while bishops were to be baited down then all presses might be open it was the peoples birthright and privilege in time of parliament it was the breaking forth of light but now the bishops abrogated and voided out of the church as if our reformation sought no more but to make room for others into their seats under another name the episcopal arts begin to bud again the cruse of truth must run no more oil liberty of printing must be enthralled again under a prelatical commission of twenty the privilege of the people nullified and which is worse the freedom of learning must groan again and to her old fetters all this the parliament yet sitting although their own late arguments and defences against the prelates might remember them that this obstructing violence meets for the most part with an event utterly opposite to the end which it drives at instead of suppressing sects and schisms it raises them and invests them with a reputation the punishing of wits enhances their authority saith the viscount st albans and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain spark of truth that flies up in the faces of them who seek to tread it out this order therefore may prove a nursingmother to sects but i shall easily show how it will be a stepdame to truth and first by disenabling us to the maintenance of what is known already  well knows he who uses to consider that our faith and knowledge thrives by exercise as well as our limbs and complexion truth is compared in scripture to a streaming fountain if her waters flow not in a perpetual progression they sicken into a muddy pool of conformity and tradition a man may be a heretic in the truth and if he believe things only because his pastor says so or the assembly so determines without knowing other reason though his belief be true yet the very truth he holds becomes his heresy  there is not any burden that some would gladlier post off to another than the charge and care of their religion there bewho knows not that there beof protestants and professors who live and die in as arrant an implicit faith as any lay papist of loretto a wealthy man addicted to his pleasure and to his profits finds religion to be a traffic so entangled and of so many piddling accounts that of all mysteries he cannot skill to keep a stock going upon that trade what should he do fain he would have the name to be religious fain he would bear up with his neighbours in that what does he therefore but resolves to give over toiling and to find himself out some factor to whose care and credit he may commit the whole managing of his religious affairs some divine of note and estimation that must be to him he adheres resigns the whole warehouse of his religion with all the locks and keys into his custody and indeed makes the very person of that man his religion esteems his associating with him a sufficient evidence and commendatory of his own piety so that a man may say his religion is now no more within himself but is become a dividual movable and goes and comes near him according as that good man frequents the house he entertains him gives him gifts feasts him lodges him his religion comes home at night prays is liberally supped and sumptuously laid to sleep rises is saluted and after the malmsey or some wellspiced brewage and better breakfasted than he whose morning appetite would have gladly fed on green figs between bethany and jerusalem his religion walks abroad at eight and leaves his kind entertainer in the shop trading all day without his religion  another sort there be who when they hear that all things shall be ordered all things regulated and settled nothing written but what passes through the customhouse of certain publicans that have the tonnaging and poundaging of all freespoken truth will straight give themselves up into your hands make em and cut em out what religion ye please there be delights there be recreations and jolly pastimes that will fetch the day about from sun to sun and rock the tedious year as in a delightful dream what need they torture their heads with that which others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own purveying these are the fruits which a dull ease and cessation of our knowledge will bring forth among the people how goodly and how to be wished were such an obedient unanimity as this what a fine conformity would it starch us all into doubtless a staunch and solid piece of framework as any january could freeze together  nor much better will be the consequence even among the clergy themselves it is no new thing never heard of before for a parochial minister who has his reward and is at his hercules pillars in a warm benefice to be easily inclinable if he have nothing else that may rouse up his studies to finish his circuit in an english concordance and a topic folio the gatherings and savings of a sober graduateship a harmony and a catena treading the constant round of certain common doctrinal heads attended with their uses motives marks and means out of which as out of an alphabet or solfa by forming and transforming joining and disjoining variously a little bookcraft and two hours meditation might furnish him unspeakably to the performance of more than a weekly charge of sermoning not to reckon up the infinite helps of interlinearies breviaries synopses and other loitering gear but as for the multitude of sermons ready printed and piled up on every text that is not difficult our london trading st thomas in his vestry and add to boot st martin and st hugh have not within their hallowed limits more vendible ware of all sorts ready made so that penury he never need fear of pulpit provision having where so plenteously to refresh his magazine but if his rear and flanks be not impaled if his back door be not secured by the rigid licenser but that a bold book may now and then issue forth and give the assault to some of his old collections in their trenches it will concern him then to keep waking to stand in watch to set good guards and sentinels about his received opinions to walk the round and counterround with his fellow inspectors fearing lest any of his flock be seduced who also then would be better instructed better exercised and disciplined and god send that the fear of this diligence which must then be used do not make us affect the laziness of a licensing church  for if we be sure we are in the right and do not hold the truth guiltily which becomes not if we ourselves condemn not our own weak and frivolous teaching and the people for an untaught and irreligious gadding rout what can be more fair than when a man judicious learned and of a conscience for aught we know as good as theirs that taught us what we know shall not privily from house to house which is more dangerous but openly by writing publish to the world what his opinion is what his reasons and wherefore that which is now thought cannot be sound christ urged it as wherewith to justify himself that he preached in public yet writing is more public than preaching and more easy to refutation if need be there being so many whose business and profession merely it is to be the champions of truth which if they neglect what can be imputed but their sloth or unability  thus much we are hindered and disinured by this course of licensing toward the true knowledge of what we seem to know for how much it hurts and hinders the licensers themselves in the calling of their ministry more than any secular employment if they will discharge that office as they ought so that of necessity they must neglect either the one duty or the other i insist not because it is a particular but leave it to their own conscience how they will decide it there  there is yet behind of what i purposed to lay open the incredible loss and detriment that this plot of licensing puts us to more than if some enemy at sea should stop up all our havens and ports and creeks it hinders and retards the importation of our richest merchandise truth nay it was first established and put in practice by antichristian malice and mystery on set purpose to extinguish if it were possible the light of reformation and to settle falsehood little differing from that policy wherewith the turk upholds his alcoran by the prohibition of printing tis not denied but gladly confessed we are to send our thanks and vows to heaven louder than most of nations for that great measure of truth which we enjoy especially in those main points between us and the pope with his appurtenances the prelates but he who thinks we are to pitch our tent here and have attained the utmost prospect of reformation that the mortal glass wherein we contemplate can show us till we come to beatific vision that man by this very opinion declares that he is yet far short of truth  truth indeed came once into the world with her divine master and was a perfect shape most glorious to look on but when he ascended and his apostles after him were laid asleep then straight arose a wicked race of deceivers who as that story goes of the egyptian typhon with his conspirators how they dealt with the good osiris took the virgin truth hewed her lovely form into a thousand pieces and scattered them to the four winds from that time ever since the sad friends of truth such as durst appear imitating the careful search that isis made for the mangled body of osiris went up and down gathering up limb by limb still as they could find them we have not yet found them all lords and commons nor ever shall do till her masters second coming he shall bring together every joint and member and shall mould them into an immortal feature of loveliness and perfection suffer not these licensing prohibitions to stand at every place of opportunity forbidding and disturbing them that continue seeking that continue to do our obsequies to the torn body of our martyred saint  we boast our light but if we look not wisely on the sun itself it smites us into darkness who can discern those planets that are oft combust and those stars of brightest magnitude that rise and set with the sun until the opposite motion of their orbs bring them to such a place in the firmament where they may be seen evening or morning the light which we have gained was given us not to be ever staring on but by it to discover onward things more remote from our knowledge it is not the unfrocking of a priest the unmitring of a bishop and the removing him from off the presbyterian shoulders that will make us a happy nation no if other things as great in the church and in the rule of life both economical and political be not looked into and reformed we have looked so long upon the blaze that zuinglius and calvin hath beaconed up to us that we are stark blind there be who perpetually complain of schisms and sects and make it such a calamity that any man dissents from their maxims tis their own pride and ignorance which causes the disturbing who neither will hear with meekness nor can convince yet all must be suppressed which is not found in their syntagma they are the troublers they are the dividers of unity who neglect and permit not others to unite those dissevered pieces which are yet wanting to the body of truth to be still searching what we know not by what we know still closing up truth to truth as we find it for all her body is homogeneal and proportional this is the golden rule in theology as well as in arithmetic and makes up the best harmony in a church not the forced and outward union of cold and neutral and inwardly divided minds  lords and commons of england consider what nation it is whereof ye are and whereof ye are the governors a nation not slow and dull but of a quick ingenious and piercing spirit acute to invent subtle and sinewy to discourse not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capacity can soar to therefore the studies of learning in her deepest sciences have been so ancient and so eminent among us that writers of good antiquity and ablest judgment have been persuaded that even the school of pythagoras and the persian wisdom took beginning from the old philosophy of this island and that wise and civil roman julius agricola who governed once here for caesar preferred the natural wits of britain before the laboured studies of the french nor is it for nothing that the grave and frugal transylvanian sends out yearly from as far as the mountainous borders of russia and beyond the hercynian wilderness not their youth but their staid men to learn our language and our theologic arts  yet that which is above all this the favour and the love of heaven we have great argument to think in a peculiar manner propitious and propending towards us why else was this nation chosen before any other that out of her as out of sion should be proclaimed and sounded forth the first tidings and trumpet of reformation to all europe and had it not been the obstinate perverseness of our prelates against the divine and admirable spirit of wickliff to suppress him as a schismatic and innovator perhaps neither the bohemian huns and jerome no nor the name of luther or of calvin had been ever known the glory of reforming all our neighbours had been completely ours but now as our obdurate clergy have with violence demeaned the matter we are become hitherto the latest and the backwardest scholars of whom god offered to have made us the teachers now once again by all concurrence of signs and by the general instinct of holy and devout men as they daily and solemnly express their thoughts god is decreeing to begin some new and great period in his church even to the reforming of reformation itself what does he then but reveal himself to his servants and as his manner is first to his englishmen i say as his manner is first to us though we mark not the method of his counsels and are unworthy  behold now this vast city a city of refuge the mansion house of liberty encompassed and surrounded with his protection the shop of war hath not there more anvils and hammers waking to fashion out the plates and instruments of armed justice in defence of beleaguered truth than there be pens and heads there sitting by their studious lamps musing searching revolving new notions and ideas wherewith to present as with their homage and their fealty the approaching reformation others as fast reading trying all things assenting to the force of reason and convincement what could a man require more from a nation so pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge what wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soil but wise and faithful labourers to make a knowing people a nation of prophets of sages and of worthies we reckon more than five months yet to harvest there need not be five weeks had we but eyes to lift up the fields are white already  where there is much desire to learn there of necessity will be much arguing much writing many opinions for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making under these fantastic terrors of sect and schism we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst after knowledge and understanding which god hath stirred up in this city what some lament of we rather should rejoice at should rather praise this pious forwardness among men to reassume the illdeputed care of their religion into their own hands again a little generous prudence a little forbearance of one another and some grain of charity might win all these diligences to join and unite in one general and brotherly search after truth could we but forgo this prelatical tradition of crowding free consciences and christian liberties into canons and precepts of men i doubt not if some great and worthy stranger should come among us wise to discern the mould and temper of a people and how to govern it observing the high hopes and aims the diligent alacrity of our extended thoughts and reasonings in the pursuance of truth and freedom but that he would cry out as pyrrhus did admiring the roman docility and courage if such were my epirots i would not despair the greatest design that could be attempted to make a church or kingdom happy  yet these are the men cried out against for schismatics and sectaries as if while the temple of the lord was building some cutting some squaring the marble others hewing the cedars there should be a sort of irrational men who could not consider there must be many schisms and many dissections made in the quarry and in the timber ere the house of god can be built and when every stone is laid artfully together it cannot be united into a continuity it can but be contiguous in this world neither can every piece of the building be of one form nay rather the perfection consists in this that out of many moderate varieties and brotherly dissimilitudes that are not vastly disproportional arises the goodly and the graceful symmetry that commends the whole pile and structure  let us therefore be more considerate builders more wise in spiritual architecture when great reformation is expected for now the time seems come wherein moses the great prophet may sit in heaven rejoicing to see that memorable and glorious wish of his fulfilled when not only our seventy elders but all the lords people are become prophets no marvel then though some men and some good men too perhaps but young in goodness as joshua then was envy them they fret and out of their own weakness are in agony lest these divisions and subdivisions will undo us the adversary again applauds and waits the hour when they have branched themselves out saith he small enough into parties and partitions then will be our time fool he sees not the firm root out of which we all grow though into branches nor will beware until he see our small divided maniples cutting through at every angle of his illunited and unwieldy brigade and that we are to hope better of all these supposed sects and schisms and that we shall not need that solicitude honest perhaps though overtimorous of them that vex in this behalf but shall laugh in the end at those malicious applauders of our differences i have these reasons to persuade me  first when a city shall be as it were besieged and blocked about her navigable river infested inroads and incursions round defiance and battle oft rumoured to be marching up even to her walls and suburb trenches that then the people or the greater part more than at other times wholly taken up with the study of highest and most important matters to be reformed should be disputing reasoning reading inventing discoursing even to a rarity and admiration things not before discoursed or written of argues first a singular goodwill contentedness and confidence in your prudent foresight and safe government lords and commons and from thence derives itself to a gallant bravery and wellgrounded contempt of their enemies as if there were no small number of as great spirits among us as his was who when rome was nigh besieged by hannibal being in the city bought that piece of ground at no cheap rate whereon hannibal himself encamped his own regiment  next it is a lively and cheerful presage of our happy success and victory for as in a body when the blood is fresh the spirits pure and vigorous not only to vital but to rational faculties and those in the acutest and the pertest operations of wit and subtlety it argues in what good plight and constitution the body is so when the cheerfulness of the people is so sprightly up as that it has not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and safety but to spare and to bestow upon the solidest and sublimest points of controversy and new invention it betokens us not degenerated nor drooping to a fatal decay but casting off the old and wrinkled skin of corruption to outlive these pangs and wax young again entering the glorious ways of truth and prosperous virtue destined to become great and honourable in these latter ages methinks i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks methinks i see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam purging and unscaling her longabused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds with those also that love the twilight flutter about amazed at what she means and in their envious gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms  what would ye do then should ye suppress all this flowery crop of knowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing daily in this city should ye set an oligarchy of twenty engrossers over it to bring a famine upon our minds again when we shall know nothing but what is measured to us by their bushel believe it lords and commons they who counsel ye to such a suppressing do as good as bid ye suppress yourselves and i will soon show how if it be desired to know the immediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking there cannot be assigned a truer than your own mild and free and humane government it is the liberty lords and commons which your own valorous and happy counsels have purchased us liberty which is the nurse of all great wits this is that which hath rarefied and enlightened our spirits like the influence of heaven this is that which hath enfranchised enlarged and lifted up our apprehensions degrees above themselves  ye cannot make us now less capable less knowing less eagerly pursuing of the truth unless ye first make yourselves that made us so less the lovers less the founders of our true liberty we can grow ignorant again brutish formal and slavish as ye found us but you then must first become that which ye cannot be oppressive arbitrary and tyrannous as they were from whom ye have freed us that our hearts are now more capacious our thoughts more erected to the search and expectation of greatest and exactest things is the issue of your own virtue propagated in us ye cannot suppress that unless ye reinforce an abrogated and merciless law that fathers may dispatch at will their own children and who shall then stick closest to ye and excite others not he who takes up arms for coat and conduct and his four nobles of danegelt although i dispraise not the defence of just immunities yet love my peace better if that were all give me the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties  what would be best advised then if it be found so hurtful and so unequal to suppress opinions for the newness or the unsuitableness to a customary acceptance will not be my task to say i only shall repeat what i have learned from one of your own honourable number a right noble and pious lord who had he not sacrificed his life and fortunes to the church and commonwealth we had not now missed and bewailed a worthy and undoubted patron of this argument ye know him i am sure yet i for honours sake and may it be eternal to him shall name him the lord brook he writing of episcopacy and by the way treating of sects and schisms left ye his vote or rather now the last words of his dying charge which i know will ever be of dear and honoured regard with ye so full of meekness and breathing charity that next to his last testament who bequeathed love and peace to his disciples i cannot call to mind where i have read or heard words more mild and peaceful he there exhorts us to hear with patience and humility those however they be miscalled that desire to live purely in such a use of gods ordinances as the best guidance of their conscience gives them and to tolerate them though in some disconformity to ourselves the book itself will tell us more at large being published to the world and dedicated to the parliament by him who both for his life and for his death deserves that what advice he left be not laid by without perusal  and now the time in special is by privilege to write and speak what may help to the further discussing of matters in agitation the temple of janus with his two controversial faces might now not unsignificantly be set open and though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth so truth be in the field we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength let her and falsehood grapple who ever knew truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter her confuting is the best and surest suppressing he who hears what praying there is for light and clearer knowledge to be sent down among us would think of other matters to be constituted beyond the discipline of geneva framed and fabricked already to our hands yet when the new light which we beg for shines in upon us there be who envy and oppose if it come not first in at their casements what a collusion is this whenas we are exhorted by the wise man to use diligence to seek for wisdom as for hidden treasures early and late that another order shall enjoin us to know nothing but by statute when a man hath been labouring the hardest labour in the deep mines of knowledge hath furnished out his findings in all their equipage drawn forth his reasons as it were a battle ranged scattered and defeated all objections in his way calls out his adversary into the plain offers him the advantage of wind and sun if he please only that he may try the matter by dint of argument for his opponents then to skulk to lay ambushments to keep a narrow bridge of licensing where the challenger should pass though it be valour enough in soldiership is but weakness and cowardice in the wars of truth  for who knows not that truth is strong next to the almighty she needs no policies nor stratagems nor licensings to make her victorious those are the shifts and the defences that error uses against her power give her but room and do not bind her when she sleeps for then she speaks not true as the old proteus did who spake oracles only when he was caught and bound but then rather she turns herself into all shapes except her own and perhaps tunes her voice according to the time as micaiah did before ahab until she be adjured into her own likeness yet is it not impossible that she may have more shapes than one what else is all that rank of things indifferent wherein truth may be on this side or on the other without being unlike herself what but a vain shadow else is the abolition of those ordinances that handwriting nailed to the cross what great purchase is this christian liberty which paul so often boasts of his doctrine is that he who eats or eats not regards a day or regards it not may do either to the lord how many other things might be tolerated in peace and left to conscience had we but charity and were it not the chief stronghold of our hypocrisy to be ever judging one another  i fear yet this iron yoke of outward conformity hath left a slavish print upon our necks the ghost of a linen decency yet haunts us we stumble and are impatient at the least dividing of one visible congregation from another though it be not in fundamentals and through our forwardness to suppress and our backwardness to recover any enthralled piece of truth out of the gripe of custom we care not to keep truth separated from truth which is the fiercest rent and disunion of all we do not see that while we still affect by all means a rigid external formality we may as soon fall again into a gross conforming stupidity a stark and dead congealment of wood and hay and stubble forced and frozen together which is more to the sudden degenerating of a church than many subdichotomies of petty schisms  not that i can think well of every light separation or that all in a church is to be expected gold and silver and precious stones it is not possible for man to sever the wheat from the tares the good fish from the other fry that must be the angels ministry at the end of mortal things yet if all cannot be of one mindas who looks they should bethis doubtless is more wholesome more prudent and more christian that many be tolerated rather than all compelled i mean not tolerated popery and open superstition which as it extirpates all religions and civil supremacies so itself should be extirpate provided first that all charitable and compassionate means be used to win and regain the weak and the misled that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or manners no law can possibly permit that intends not to unlaw itself but those neighbouring differences or rather indifferences are what i speak of whether in some point of doctrine or of discipline which though they may be many yet need not interrupt the unity of spirit if we could but find among us the bond of peace  in the meanwhile if any one would write and bring his helpful hand to the slowmoving reformation which we labour under if truth have spoken to him before others or but seemed at least to speak who hath so bejesuited us that we should trouble that man with asking license to do so worthy a deed and not consider this that if it come to prohibiting there is not aught more likely to be prohibited than truth itself whose first appearance to our eyes bleared and dimmed with prejudice and custom is more unsightly and unplausible than many errors even as the person is of many a great man slight and contemptuous to see to and what do they tell us vainly of new opinions when this very opinion of theirs that none must be heard but whom they like is the worst and newest opinion of all others and is the chief cause why sects and schisms do so much abound and true knowledge is kept at distance from us besides yet a greater danger which is in it  for when god shakes a kingdom with strong and healthful commotions to a general reforming tis not untrue that many sectaries and false teachers are then busiest in seducing but yet more true it is that god then raises to his own work men of rare abilities and more than common industry not only to look back and revise what hath been taught heretofore but to gain further and go on some new enlightened steps in the discovery of truth for such is the order of gods enlightening his church to dispense and deal out by degrees his beam so as our earthly eyes may best sustain it  neither is god appointed and confined where and out of what place these his chosen shall be first heard to speak for he sees not as man sees chooses not as man chooses lest we should devote ourselves again to set places and assemblies and outward callings of men planting our faith one while in the old convocation house and another while in the chapel at westminster when all the faith and religion that shall be there canonized is not sufficient without plain convincement and the charity of patient instruction to supple the least bruise of conscience to edify the meanest christian who desires to walk in the spirit and not in the letter of human trust for all the number of voices that can be there made no though harry vii himself there with all his liege tombs about him should lend them voices from the dead to swell their number  and if the men be erroneous who appear to be the leading schismatics what withholds us but our sloth our selfwill and distrust in the right cause that we do not give them gentle meetings and gentle dismissions that we debate not and examine the matter thoroughly with liberal and frequent audience if not for their sakes yet for our own seeing no man who hath tasted learning but will confess the many ways of profiting by those who not contented with stale receipts are able to manage and set forth new positions to the world and were they but as the dust and cinders of our feet so long as in that notion they may yet serve to polish and brighten the armoury of truth even for that respect they were not utterly to be cast away but if they be of those whom god hath fitted for the special use of these times with eminent and ample gifts and those perhaps neither among the priests nor among the pharisees and we in the haste of a precipitant zeal shall make no distinction but resolve to stop their mouths because we fear they come with new and dangerous opinions as we commonly forejudge them ere we understand them no less than woe to us while thinking thus to defend the gospel we are found the persecutors  there have been not a few since the beginning of this parliament both of the presbytery and others who by their unlicensed books to the contempt of an imprimatur first broke that triple ice clung about our hearts and taught the people to see day i hope that none of those were the persuaders to renew upon us this bondage which they themselves have wrought so much good by contemning but if neither the check that moses gave to young joshua nor the countermand which our saviour gave to young john who was so ready to prohibit those whom he thought unlicensed be not enough to admonish our elders how unacceptable to god their testy mood of prohibiting is if neither their own remembrance what evil hath abounded in the church by this set of licensing and what good they themselves have begun by transgressing it be not enough but that they will persuade and execute the most dominican part of the inquisition over us and are already with one foot in the stirrup so active at suppressing it would be no unequal distribution in the first place to suppress the suppressors themselves whom the change of their condition hath puffed up more than their late experience of harder times hath made wise  and as for regulating the press let no man think to have the honour of advising ye better than yourselves have done in that order published next before this that no book be printed unless the printers and the authors name or at least the printers be registered those which otherwise come forth if they be found mischievous and libellous the fire and the executioner will be the timeliest and the most effectual remedy that mans prevention can use for this authentic spanish policy of licensing books if i have said aught will prove the most unlicensed book itself within a short while and was the immediate image of a star chamber decree to that purpose made in those very times when that court did the rest of those her pious works for which she is now fallen from the stars with lucifer whereby ye may guess what kind of state prudence what love of the people what care of religion or good manners there was at the contriving although with singular hypocrisy it pretended to bind books to their good behaviour and how it got the upper hand of your precedent order so well constituted before if we may believe those men whose profession gives them cause to inquire most it may be doubted there was in it the fraud of some old patentees and monopolizers in the trade of bookselling who under pretence of the poor in their company not to be defrauded and the just retaining of each man his several copy which god forbid should be gainsaid brought divers glossing colours to the house which were indeed but colours and serving to no end except it be to exercise a superiority over their neighbours men who do not therefore labour in an honest profession to which learning is indebted that they should be made other mens vassals another end is thought was aimed at by some of them in procuring by petition this order that having power in their hands malignant books might the easier scape abroad as the event shows  but of these sophisms and elenchs of merchandise i skill not this i know that errors in a good government and in a bad are equally almost incident for what magistrate may not be misinformed and much the sooner if liberty of printing be reduced into the power of a few but to redress willingly and speedily what hath been erred and in highest authority to esteem a plain advertisement more than others have done a sumptuous bride is a virtue honoured lords and commons answerable to your highest actions and whereof none can participate but greatest and wisest men
