29190169	nonsense novels  by stephen leacock   preface  the author of this book offers it to the public without apology  the reviewers of his previous work of this character have presumed on inductive grounds that he must be a young man from the most westerly part of the western states to whom many things might be pardoned as due to the exuberant animal spirits of youth  they were good enough to express the thought that when the author grew up and became educated there might be hope for his intellect  this expectation is of no avail  all that education could do in this case has been tried and has failed  as a professor of political economy in a great university the author admits that he ought to know better but he will feel amply repaid for his humiliation if there are any to whom this little book may bring some passing amusement in hours of idleness or some brief respite when the sadness of the heart or the sufferings of the body forbid the perusal of worthier things

asbestos an allegory of the future    i  maddened by mystery or the defective detective   the great detective sat in his office  he wore a long green gown and half a dozen secret badges pinned to the outside of it  three or four pairs of false whiskers hung on a whiskerstand beside him  goggles blue spectacles and motor glasses lay within easy reach  he could completely disguise himself at a seconds notice  half a bucket of cocaine and a dipper stood on a chair at his elbow  his face was absolutely impenetrable  a pile of cryptograms lay on the desk  the great detective hastily tore them open one after the other solved them and threw them down the cryptogramshute at his side  there was a rap at the door  the great detective hurriedly wrapped himself in a pink domino adjusted a pair of false black whiskers and cried  come in  his secretary entered  ha said the detective it is you  he laid aside his disguise  sir said the young man in intense excitement a mystery has been committed  ha said the great detective his eye kindling is it such as to completely baffle the police of the entire continent  they are so completely baffled with it said the secretary that they are lying collapsed in heaps many of them have committed suicide  so said the detective and is the mystery one that is absolutely unparalleled in the whole recorded annals of the london police  it is  and i suppose said the detective that it involves names which you would scarcely dare to breathe at least without first using some kind of atomiser or throatgargle  exactly  and it is connected i presume with the highest diplomatic consequences so that if we fail to solve it england will be at war with the whole world in sixteen minutes  his secretary still quivering with excitement again answered yes  and finally said the great detective i presume that it was committed in broad daylight in some such place as the entrance of the bank of england or in the cloakroom of the house of commons and under the very eyes of the police  those said the secretary are the very conditions of the mystery  good said the great detective now wrap yourself in this disguise put on these brown whiskers and tell me what it is  the secretary wrapped himself in a blue domino with lace insertions then bending over he whispered in the ear of the great detective  the prince of wurttemberg has been kidnapped  the great detective bounded from his chair as if he had been kicked from below  a prince stolen  evidently a bourbon  the scion of one of the oldest families in europe kidnapped  here was a mystery indeed worthy of his analytical brain  his mind began to move like lightning  stop he said how do you know this  the secretary handed him a telegram  it was from the prefect of police of paris  it read  the prince of wurttemberg stolen  probably forwarded to london  must have him here for the opening day of exhibition  1000 pounds reward  so  the prince had been kidnapped out of paris at the very time when his appearance at the international exposition would have been a political event of the first magnitude  with the great detective to think was to act and to act was to think frequently he could do both together  wire to paris for a description of the prince  the secretary bowed and left  at the same moment there was slight scratching at the door  a visitor entered  he crawled stealthily on his hands and knees  a hearthrug thrown over his head and shoulders disguised his identity  he crawled to the middle of the room  then he rose  great heaven  it was the prime minister of england  you said the detective  me said the prime minister  you have come in regard the kidnapping of the prince of wurttemberg  the prime minister started  how do you know he said  the great detective smiled his inscrutable smile  yes said the prime minister  i will use no concealment  i am interested deeply interested  find the prince of wurttemberg get him safe back to paris and i will add 500 pounds to the reward already offered  but listen he said impressively as he left the room see to it that no attempt is made to alter the marking of the prince or to clip his tail  so  to clip the princes tail  the brain of the great detective reeled  so a gang of miscreants had conspired tobut no the thing was not possible  there was another rap at the door  a second visitor was seen  he wormed his way in lying almost prone upon his stomach and wriggling across the floor  he was enveloped in a long purple cloak he stood up and peeped over the top of it  great heaven  it was the archbishop of canterbury  your grace exclaimed the detective in amazementpray do not stand i beg you  sit down lie down anything rather than stand  the archbishop took off his mitre and laid it wearily on the whiskerstand  you are here in regard to the prince of wurttemberg  the archbishop started and crossed himself  was the man a magician  yes he said much depends on getting him back  but i have only come to say this my sister is desirous of seeing you  she is coming here  she has been extremely indiscreet and her fortune hangs upon the prince  get him back to paris or i fear she will be ruined  the archbishop regained his mitre uncrossed himself wrapped his cloak about him and crawled stealthily out on his hands and knees purring like a cat  the face of the great detective showed the most profound sympathy it ran up and down in furrows  so he muttered the sister of the archbishop the countess of dashleigh  accustomed as he was to the life of the aristocracy even the great detective felt that there was here intrigue of more than customary complexity  there was a loud rapping at the door  there entered the countess of dashleigh  she was all in furs  she was the most beautiful woman in england  she strode imperiously into the room  she seized a chair imperiously and seated herself on it imperial side up  she took off her tiara of diamonds and put it on the tiaraholder beside her and uncoiled her boa of pearls and put it on the pearlstand  you have come said the great detective about the prince of wurttemberg  wretched little pup said the countess of dashleigh in disgust  so  a further complication  far from being in love with the prince the countess denounced the young bourbon as a pup  you are interested in him i believe  interested said the countess  i should rather say so why i bred him  you which gasped the great detective his usually impassive features suffused with a carmine blush  i bred him said the countess and ive got 10000 pounds upon his chances so no wonder i want him back in paris  only listen she said if theyve got hold of the prince and cut his tail or spoiled the markings of his stomach it would be far better to have him quietly put out of the way here  the great detective reeled and leaned up against the side of the room  so  the coldblooded admission of the beautiful woman for the moment took away his breath  herself the mother of the young bourbon misallied with one of the greatest families of europe staking her fortune on a royalist plot and yet with so instinctive a knowledge of european politics as to know that any removal of the hereditary birthmarks of the prince would forfeit for him the sympathy of the french populace  the countess resumed her tiara  she left  the secretary reentered  i have three telegrams from paris he said they are completely baffling  he handed over the first telegram  it read  the prince of wurttemberg has a long wet snout broad ears very long body and short hind legs  the great detective looked puzzled  he read the second telegram  the prince of wurttemberg is easily recognised by his deep bark  and then the third  the prince of wurttemberg can be recognised by a patch of white hair across the centre of his back  the two men looked at one another  the mystery was maddening impenetrable  the great detective spoke  give me my domino he said  these clues must be followed up then pausing while his quick brain analysed and summed up the evidence before hima young man he muttered evidently young since described as a pup with a long wet snout ha addicted obviously to drinking a streak of white hair across his back a first sign of the results of his abandoned lifeyes yes he continued with this clue i shall find him easily  the great detective rose  he wrapped himself in a long black cloak with white whiskers and blue spectacles attached  completely disguised he issued forth  he began the search  for four days he visited every corner of london  he entered every saloon in the city  in each of them he drank a glass of rum  in some of them he assumed the disguise of a sailor in others he entered as a solider  into others he penetrated as a clergyman  his disguise was perfect  nobody paid any attention to him as long as he had the price of a drink  the search proved fruitless  two young men were arrested under suspicion of being the prince only to be released  the identification was incomplete in each case  one had a long wet snout but no hair on his back  the other had hair on his back but couldnt bark  neither of them was the young bourbon  the great detective continued his search  he stopped at nothing  secretly after nightfall he visited the home of the prime minister  he examined it from top to bottom  he measured all the doors and windows  he took up the flooring  he inspected the plumbing  he examined the furniture  he found nothing  with equal secrecy he penetrated into the palace of the archbishop he examined it from top to bottom  disguised as a choirboy he took part in the offices of the church  he found nothing  still undismayed the great detective made his way into the home of the countess of dashleigh  disguised as a housemaid he entered the service of the countess  then at last a clue came which gave him a solution of the mystery  on the wall of the countesss boudoir was a large framed engraving  it was a portrait  under it was a printed legend                        the prince of wurttemberg  the portrait was that of a dachshund  the long body the broad ears the unclipped tail the short hind legsall was there  in a fraction of a second the lightning mind of the great detective had penetrated the whole mystery  the prince was a dog  hastily throwing a domino over his housemaids dress he rushed to the street  he summoned a passing hansom and in a few moments was at his house  i have it he gasped to his secretary  the mystery is solved i have pieced it together  by sheer analysis i have reasoned it out listenhind legs hair on back wet snout pupeh what does that suggest nothing to you  nothing said the secretary it seems perfectly hopeless  the great detective now recovered from his excitement smiled faintly  it means simply this my dear fellow  the prince of wurttemberg is a dog a prize dachshund  the countess of dashleigh bred him and he is worth some 25000 pounds in addition to the prize of 10000 pounds offered at the paris dog show  can you wonder that  at that moment the great detective was interrupted by the scream of a woman  great heaven  the countess of dashleigh dashed into the room  her face was wild  her tiara was in disorder  her pearls were dripping all over the place  she wrung her hands and moaned  they have cut his tail she gasped and taken all the hair off his back  what can i do  i am undone  madame said the great detective calm as bronze do yourself up i can save you yet  you  me  how  listen  this is how  the prince was to have been shown at paris  the countess nodded  your fortune was staked on him  the countess nodded again  the dog was stolen carried to london his tail cut and his marks disfigured  amazed at the quiet penetration of the great detective the countess kept on nodding and nodding  and you are ruined  i am she gasped and sank to the floor in a heap of pearls  madame said the great detective all is not lost  he straightened himself up to his full height  a look of inflinchable unflexibility flickered over his features  the honour of england the fortune of the most beautiful woman in england was at stake  i will do it he murmured  rise dear lady he continued  fear nothing  i will impersonate the dog  that night the great detective might have been seen on the deck of the calais packet boat with his secretary  he was on his hands and knees in a long black cloak and his secretary had him on a short chain  he barked at the waves exultingly and licked the secretarys hand  what a beautiful dog said the passengers  the disguise was absolutely complete  the great detective had been coated over with mucilage to which dog hairs had been applied  the markings on his back were perfect his tail adjusted with an automatic coupler moved up and down responsive to every thought  his deep eyes were full of intelligence  next day he was exhibited in the dachshund class at the international show  he won all hearts  quel beau chien cried the french people  ach was ein dog cried the spanish  the great detective took the first prize  the fortune of the countess was saved  unfortunately as the great detective had neglected to pay the dog tax he was caught and destroyed by the dogcatchers  but that is of course quite outside of the present narrative and is only mentioned as an odd fact in conclusion   ii  q a psychic pstory of the psupernatural   i cannot expect that any of my readers will believe the story which i am about to narrate  looking back upon it i scarcely believe it myself  yet my narrative is so extraordinary and throws such light upon the nature of our communications with beings of another world that i feel i am not entitled to withhold it from the public  i had gone over to visit annerly at his rooms  it was saturday october 31  i remember the date so precisely because it was my pay day and i had received six sovereigns and ten shillings  i remembered the sum so exactly because i had put the money into my pocket and i remember into which pocket i had put it because i had no money in any other pocket  my mind is perfectly clear on all these points  annerly and i sat smoking for some time  then quite suddenly  do you believe in the supernatural he asked  i started as if i had been struck  at the moment when annerly spoke of the supernatural i had been thinking of something entirely different  the fact that he should speak of it at the very instant when i was thinking of something else struck me as at least a very singular coincidence  for a moment i could only stare  what i mean is said annerly do you believe in phantasms of the dead  phantasms i repeated  yes phantasms or if you prefer the word phanograms or say if you will phanogrammatical manifestations or more simply psychophantasmal phenomena  i looked at annerly with a keener sense of interest than i had ever felt in him before  i felt that he was about to deal with events and experiences of which in the two or three months that i had known him he had never seen fit to speak  i wondered now that it had never occurred to me that a man whose hair at fiftyfive was already streaked with grey must have passed through some terrible ordeal  presently annerly spoke again  last night i saw q he said  good heavens i ejaculated  i did not in the least know who q was but it struck me with a thrill of indescribable terror that annerly had seen q  in my own quiet and measured existence such a thing had never happened  yes said annerly i saw q as plainly as if he were standing here but perhaps i had better tell you something of my past relationship with q and you will understand exactly what the present situation is  annerly seated himself in a chair on the other side of the fire from me lighted a pipe and continued  when first i knew q he lived not very far from a small town in the south of england which i will call x and was betrothed to a beautiful and accomplished girl whom i will name m  annerly had hardly begun to speak before i found myself listening with riveted attention  i realised that it was no ordinary experience that he was about to narrate  i more than suspected that q and m were not the real names of his unfortunate acquaintances but were in reality two letters of the alphabet selected almost at random to disguise the names of his friends  i was still pondering over the ingenuity of the thing when annerly went on  when q and i first became friends he had a favourite dog which if necessary i might name z and which followed him in and out of x on his daily walk  in and out of x i repeated in astonishment  yes said annerly in and out  my senses were now fully alert  that z should have followed q out of x i could readily understand but that he should first have followed him in seemed to pass the bounds of comprehension  well said annerly q and miss m were to be married  everything was arranged  the wedding was to take place on the last day of the year  exactly six months and four days before the appointed day i remember the date because the coincidence struck me as peculiar at the time q came to me late in the evening in great distress  he had just had he said a premonition of his own death  that evening while sitting with miss m on the verandah of her house he had distinctly seen a projection of the dog r pass along the road  stop a moment i said  did you not say that the dogs name was z  annerly frowned slightly  quite so he replied  z or more correctly z r since q was in the habit perhaps from motives of affection of calling him r as well as z  well then the projection or phanogram of the dog passed in front of them so plainly that miss m swore that she could have believed that it was the dog himself  opposite the house the phantasm stopped for a moment and wagged its tail  then it passed on and quite suddenly disappeared around the corner of a stone wall as if hidden by the bricks  what made the thing still more mysterious was that miss ms mother who is partially blind had only partially seen the dog  annerly paused a moment  then he went on  this singular occurrence was interpreted by q no doubt correctly to indicate his own approaching death  i did what i could to remove this feeling but it was impossible to do so and he presently wrung my hand and left me firmly convinced that he would not live till morning  good heavens i exclaimed and he died that night  no he did not said annerly quietly that is the inexplicable part of it  tell me about it i said  he rose that morning as usual dressed himself with his customary care omitting none of his clothes and walked down to his office at the usual hour  he told me afterwards that he remembered the circumstances so clearly from the fact that he had gone to the office by the usual route instead of taking any other direction  stop a moment i said  did anything unusual happen to mark that particular day  i anticipated that you would ask that question said annerly but as far as i can gather absolutely nothing happened  q returned from his work and ate his dinner apparently much as usual and presently went to bed complaining of a slight feeling of drowsiness but nothing more  his stepmother with whom he lived said afterwards that she could hear the sound of his breathing quite distinctly during the night  and did he die that night i asked breathless with excitement  no said annerly he did not  he rose next morning feeling about as before except that the sense of drowsiness had apparently passed and that the sound of his breathing was no longer audible  annerly again fell into silence  anxious as i was to hear the rest of his astounding narrative i did not like to press him with questions  the fact that our relations had hitherto been only of a formal character and that this was the first occasion on which he had invited me to visit him at his rooms prevented me from assuming too great an intimacy  well he continued q went to his office each day after that with absolute regularity  as far as i can gather there was nothing either in his surroundings or his conduct to indicate that any peculiar fate was impending over him  he saw miss m regularly and the time fixed for their marriage drew nearer each day  each day i repeated in astonishment  yes said annerly every day  for some time before his marriage i saw but little of him  but two weeks before that event was due to happen i passed q one day in the street  he seemed for a moment about to stop then he raised his hat smiled and passed on  one moment i said if you will allow me a question that seems of importancedid he pass on and then smile and raise his hat or did he smile into his hat raise it and then pass on afterwards  your question is quite justified said annerly though i think i can answer with perfect accuracy that he first smiled then stopped smiling and raised his hat and then stopped raising his hat and passed on  however he continued the essential fact is this on the day appointed for the wedding q and miss m were duly married  impossible i gasped duly married both of them  yes said annerly both at the same time  after the wedding mr and mrs q  mr and mrs q i repeated in perplexity  yes he answered mr and mrs q for after the wedding miss m took the name of q left england and went out to australia where they were to reside  stop one moment i said and let me be quite clearin going out to settle in australia it was their intention to reside there  yes said annerly that at any rate was generally understood  i myself saw them off on the steamer and shook hands with q standing at the same time quite close to him  well i said and since the two qs as i suppose one might almost call them went to australia have you heard anything from them  that replied annerly is a matter that has shown the same singularity as the rest of my experience  it is now four years since q and his wife went to australia  at first i heard from him quite regularly and received two letters each month  presently i only received one letter every two months and later two letters every six months and then only one letter every twelve months  then until last night i heard nothing whatever of q for a year and a half  i was now on the tiptoe of expectancy  last night said annerly very quietly q appeared in this room or rather a phantasm or psychic manifestation of him  he seemed in great distress made gestures which i could not understand and kept turning his trouser pockets inside out  i was too spellbound to question him and tried in vain to divine his meaning  presently the phantasm seized a pencil from the table and wrote the words two sovereigns tomorrow night urgent  annerly was again silent  i sat in deep thought  how do you interpret the meaning which qs phanogram meant to convey  i think he announced it means this  q who is evidently dead meant to visualise that fact meant so to speak to deatomise the idea that he was demonetised and that he wanted two sovereigns tonight  and how i asked amazed at annerlys instinctive penetration into the mysteries of the psychic world how do you intend to get it to him  i intend he announced to try a bold a daring experiment which if it succeeds will bring us into immediate connection with the world of spirits  my plan is to leave two sovereigns here upon the edge of the table during the night  if they are gone in the morning i shall know that q has contrived to deastralise himself and has taken the sovereigns  the only question is do you happen to have two sovereigns  i myself unfortunately have nothing but small change about me  here was a piece of rare good fortune the coincidence of which seemed to add another link to the chain of circumstance  as it happened i had with me the six sovereigns which i had just drawn as my weeks pay  luckily i said i am able to arrange that  i happen to have money with me  and i took two sovereigns from my pocket  annerly was delighted at our good luck  our preparations for the experiment were soon made  we placed the table in the middle of the room in such a way that there could be no fear of contact or collision with any of the furniture  the chairs were carefully set against the wall and so placed that no two of them occupied the same place as any other two while the pictures and ornaments about the room were left entirely undisturbed  we were careful not to remove any of the wallpaper from the wall nor to detach any of the windowpanes from the window  when all was ready the two sovereigns were laid side by side upon the table with the heads up in such a way that the lower sides or tails were supported by only the table itself we then extinguished the light  i said good night to annerly and groped my way out into the dark feverish with excitement  my readers may well imagine my state of eagerness to know the result of the experiment  i could scarcely sleep for anxiety to know the issue  i had of course every faith in the completeness of our preparations but was not without misgivings that the experiment might fail as my own mental temperament and disposition might not be of the precise kind needed for the success of these experiments  on this score however i need have had no alarm  the event showed that my mind was a media or if the word is better a transparency of the very first order for psychic work of this character  in the morning annerly came rushing over to my lodgings his face beaming with excitement  glorious glorious he almost shouted we have succeeded  the sovereigns are gone  we are in direct monetary communication with q  i need not dwell on the exquisite thrill of happiness which went through me  all that day and all the following day the sense that i was in communication with q was ever present with me  my only hope was that an opportunity might offer for the renewal of our intercommunication with the spirit world  the following night my wishes were gratified  late in the evening annerly called me up on the telephone  come over at once to my lodgings he said  qs phanogram is communicating with us  i hastened over and arrived almost breathless  q has been here again said annerly and appeared in the same distress as before a projection of him stood in the room and kept writing with its finger on the table  i could distinguish the word sovereigns but nothing more  do you not suppose i said that q for some reason which we cannot fathom wishes us to again leave two sovereigns for him  by jove said annerly enthusiastically i believe youve hit it at any rate let us try we can but fail  that night we placed again two of my sovereigns on the table and arranged the furniture with the same scrupulous care as before  still somewhat doubtful of my own psychic fitness for the work in which i was engaged i endeavoured to keep my mind so poised as to readily offer a mark for any astral disturbance that might be about the result showed that it had offered just such a mark  our experiment succeeded completely  the two coins had vanished in the morning  for nearly two months we continued our experiments on these lines at times annerly himself so he told me would leave money often considerable sums within reach of the phantasm which never failed to remove them during the night  but annerly being a man of strict honour never carried on these experiments alone except when it proved impossible to communicate with me in time for me to come  at other times he would call me up with the simple message q is here or would send me a telegram or a written note saying q needs money bring any that you have but no more  on my own part i was extremely anxious to bring our experiments prominently before the public or to interest the society for psychic research and similar bodies in the daring transit which we had effected between the world of sentience and the psychoastric or pseudoethereal existence  it seemed to me that we alone had succeeded in thus conveying money directly and without mediation from one world to another  others indeed had done so by the interposition of a medium or by subscription to an occult magazine but we had performed the feat with such simplicity that i was anxious to make our experience public for the benefit of others like myself  annerly however was averse from this course being fearful that it might break off our relations with q  it was some three months after our first interastral psychomonetary experiment that there came the culmination of my experiencesso mysterious as to leave me still lost in perplexity  annerly had come in to see me one afternoon  he looked nervous and depressed  i have just had a psychic communication from q he said in answer to my inquiries which i can hardly fathom  as far as i can judge q has formed some plan for interesting other phantasms in the kind of work that we are doing  he proposes to form on his side of the gulf an association that is to work in harmony with us for monetary dealings on a large scale between the two worlds  my reader may well imagine that my eyes almost blazed with excitement at the magnitude of the prospect opened up  q wishes us to gather together all the capital that we can and to send it across to him in order that he may be able to organise with him a corporate association of phanograms or perhaps in this case one would more correctly call them phantoids  i had no sooner grasped annerlys meaning than i became enthusiastic over it  we decided to try the great experiment that night  my own worldly capital was unfortunately no great amount  i had however some 500 pounds in bank stock left to me at my fathers decease which i could of course realise within a few hours i was fearful however lest it might prove too small to enable q to organise his fellow phantoids with it  i carried the money in notes and sovereigns to annerlys room where it was laid on the table  annerly was fortunately able to contribute a larger sum which however he was not to place beside mine until after i had withdrawn in order that conjunction of our monetary personalities might not dematerialise the astral phenomenon  we made our preparations this time with exceptional care annerly quietly confident i it must be confessed extremely nervous and fearful of failure  we removed our boots and walked about on our stockinged feet and at annerlys suggestion not only placed the furniture as before but turned the coalscuttle upside down and laid a wet towel over the top of the wastepaper basket  all complete i wrung annerlys hand and went out into the darkness  i waited next morning in vain  nine oclock came ten oclock and finally eleven and still no word of him  then feverish with anxiety i sought his lodgings  judge of my utter consternation to find that annerly had disappeared he had vanished as if off the face of the earth  by what awful error in our preparations by what neglect of some necessary psychic precautions he had met his fate i cannot tell  but the evidence was only too clear that annerly had been engulfed into the astral world carrying with him the money for the transfer of which he had risked his mundane existence  the proof of his disappearance was easy to find  as soon as i dared do so with discretion i ventured upon a few inquiries  the fact that he had been engulfed while still owing four months rent for his rooms and that he had vanished without even having time to pay such bills as he had outstanding with local tradesmen showed that he must have been devisualised at a moments notice  the awful fear that i might be held accountable for his death prevented me from making the affair public  till that moment i had not realised the risks that he had incurred in our reckless dealing with the world of spirits  annerly fell a victim to the great cause of psychic science and the record of our experiments remains in the face of prejudice as a witness to its truth   iii  guido the gimlet of ghent a romance of chivalry  it was in the floodtide of chivalry  knighthood was in the pod  the sun was slowly setting in the east rising and falling occasionally as it subsided and illuminating with its dying beams the towers of the grim castle of buggensberg  isolde the slender stood upon an embattled turret of the castle her arms were outstretched to the empty air and her face upturned as if in colloquy with heaven was distraught with yearning  anon she murmured guidoand bewhiles a deep sigh rent her breast  sylphlike and ethereal in her beauty she scarcely seemed to breathe  in fact she hardly did  willowy and slender in form she was as graceful as a meridian of longitude  her body seemed almost too frail for motion while her features were of a mould so delicate as to preclude all thought of intellectual operation  she was begirt with a flowing kirtle of deep blue bebound with a belt bebuckled with a silvern clasp while about her waist a stomacher of point lace ended in the ruffled farthingale at her throat  on her head she bore a sugarloaf hat shaped like an extinguisher and pointing backward at an angle of 45 degrees  guido she murmured guido  and erstwhile she would wring her hands as one distraught and mutter he cometh not  the sun sank and night fell enwrapping in shadow the frowning castle of buggensberg and the ancient city of ghent at its foot  and as the darkness gathered the windows of the castle shone out with fiery red for it was yuletide and it was wassail all in the great hall of the castle and this night the margrave of buggensberg made him a feast and celebrated the betrothal of isolde his daughter with tancred the tenspot  and to the feast he had bidden all his liege lords and vassals hubert the husky edward the earwig rollo the rumbottle and many others  in the meantime the lady isolde stood upon the battlements and mourned for the absent guido  the love of guido and isolde was of that pure and almost divine type found only in the middle ages  they had never seen one another  guido had never seen isolde isolde had never seen guido  they had never heard one another speak  they had never been together  they did not know one another  yet they loved  their love had sprung into being suddenly and romantically with all the mystic charm which is loves greatest happiness  years before guido had seen the name of isolde the slender painted on a fence  he had turned pale fallen into a swoon and started at once for jerusalem  on the very same day isolde in passing through the streets of ghent had seen the coat of arms of guido hanging on a clothes line  she had fallen back into the arms of her tirewomen more dead than alive  since that day they had loved  isolde would wander forth from the castle at earliest morn with the name of guido on her lips  she told his name to the trees  she whispered it to the flowers  she breathed it to the birds  quite a lot of them knew it  at times she would ride her palfrey along the sands of the sea and call guido to the waves  at other times she would tell it to the grass or even to a stick of cordwood or a ton of coal  guido and isolde though they had never met cherished each the features of the other  beneath his coat of mail guido carried a miniature of isolde carven on ivory  he had found it at the bottom of the castle crag between the castle and the old town of ghent at its foot  how did he know that it was isolde  there was no need for him to ask  his heart had spoken  the eye of love cannot be deceived  and isolde  she too cherished beneath her stomacher a miniature of guido the gimlet  she had it of a travelling chapman in whose pack she had discovered it and had paid its price in pearls  how had she known that he it was that is that it was he  because of the coat of arms emblazoned beneath the miniature  the same heraldic design that had first shaken her to the heart  sleeping or waking it was ever before her eyes a lion proper quartered in a field of gules and a dog improper threequarters in a field of buckwheat  and if the love of isolde burned thus purely for guido the love of guido burned for isolde with a flame no less pure  no sooner had love entered guidos heart than he had determined to do some great feat of emprise or adventure some high achievement of deringdo which should make him worthy to woo her  he placed himself under a vow that he would eat nothing save only food and drink nothing save only liquor till such season as he should have performed his feat  for this cause he had at once set out for jerusalem to kill a saracen for her  he killed one quite a large one  still under his vow he set out again at once to the very confines of pannonia determined to kill a turk for her  from pannonia he passed into the highlands of britain where he killed her a caledonian  every year and every month guido performed for isolde some new achievement of emprise  and in the meantime isolde waited  it was not that suitors were lacking  isolde the slender had suitors in plenty ready to do her lightest hest  feats of arms were done daily for her sake  to win her love suitors were willing to vow themselves to perdition  for isoldes sake otto the otter had cast himself into the sea  conrad the cocoanut had hurled himself from the highest battlement of the castle head first into the mud hugo the hopeless had hanged himself by the waistband to a hickory tree and had refused all efforts to dislodge him for her sake sickfried the susceptible had swallowed sulphuric acid  but isolde the slender was heedless of the court thus paid to her  in vain her stepmother agatha the angular urged her to marry  in vain her father the margrave of buggensberg commanded her to choose the one or the other of the suitors  her heart remained unswervingly true to the gimlet  from time to time love tokens passed between the lovers  from jerusalem guido had sent to her a stick with a notch in it to signify his undying constancy  from pannonia he sent a piece of board and from venetia about two feet of scantling  all these isolde treasured at night they lay beneath her pillow  then after years of wandering guido had determined to crown his love with a final achievement for isoldes sake  it was his design to return to ghent to scale by night the castle cliff and to prove his love for isolde by killing her father for her casting her stepmother from the battlements burning the castle and carrying her away  this design he was now hastening to put into execution  attended by fifty trusty followers under the lead of carlo the corkscrew and beowulf the bradawl he had made his way to ghent  under cover of night they had reached the foot of the castle cliff and now on their hands and knees in single file they were crawling round and round the spiral path that led up to the gate of the fortress  at six of the clock they had spiralled once  at seven of the clock they had reappeared at the second round and as the feast in the hall reached its height they reappeared on the fourth lap  guido the gimlet was in the lead  his coat of mail was hidden beneath a particoloured cloak and he bore in his hand a horn  by arrangement he was to penetrate into the castle by the postern gate in disguise steal from the margrave by artifice the key of the great door and then by a blast of his horn summon his followers to the assault  alas there was need for haste for at this very yuletide on this very night the margrave wearied of isoldes resistance had determined to bestow her hand upon tancred the tenspot  it was wassail all in the great hall  the huge margrave seated at the head of the board drained flagon after flagon of wine and pledged deep the health of tancred the tenspot who sat plumed and armoured beside him  great was the merriment of the margrave for beside him crouched upon the floor was a new jester whom the seneschal had just admitted by the postern gate and the novelty of whose jests made the huge sides of the margrave shake and shake again  odds bodikins he roared but the tale is as rare as it is new and so the wagoner said to the pilgrim that sith he had asked him to put him off the wagon at that town put him off he must albeit it was but the small of the nightby st pancras whence hath the fellow so novel a talenay tell it me but once more haply i may remember itand the baron fell back in a perfect paroxysm of merriment  as he fell back guidofor the disguised jester was none other than he that is than himsprang forward and seized from the girdle of the margrave the key of the great door that dangled at his waist  then casting aside the jesters cloak and cap he rose to his full height standing in his coat of mail  in one hand he brandished the doubleheaded mace of the crusader and in the other a horn  the guests sprang to their feet their hands upon their daggers  guido the gimlet they cried  hold said guido i have you in my power  then placing the horn to his lips and drawing a deep breath he blew with his utmost force  and then again he blewblew like anything  not a sound came  the horn wouldnt blow  seize him cried the baron  stop said guido i claim the laws of chivalry  i am here to seek the lady isolde betrothed by you to tancred  let me fight tancred in single combat man to man  a shout of approbation gave consent  the combat that followed was terrific  first guido raising his mace high in the air with both hands brought it down with terrible force on tancreds mailed head  then guido stood still and tancred raising his mace in the air brought it down upon guidos head  then tancred stood still and turned his back and guido swinging his mace sideways gave him a terrific blow from behind midway right centre  tancred returned the blow  then tancred knelt down on his hands and knees and guido brought the mace down on his back  it was a sheer contest of skill and agility  for a time the issue was doubtful  then tancreds armour began to bend his blows weakened he fell prone  guido pressed his advantage and hammered him out as flat as a sardine can  then placing his foot on tancreds chest he lowered his vizor and looked around about him  at this second there was a resounding shriek  isolde the slender alarmed by the sound of the blows precipitated herself into the room  for a moment the lovers looked into each others faces  then with their countenances distraught with agony they fell swooning in different directions  there had been a mistake  guido was not guido and isolde was not isolde  they were wrong about the miniatures  each of them was a picture of somebody else  torrents of remorse flooded over the lovers hearts  isolde thought of the unhappy tancred hammered out as flat as a picturecard and hopelessly spoilt of conrad the cocoanut head first in the mud and sickfried the susceptible coiled up with agonies of sulphuric acid  guido thought of the dead saracens and the slaughtered turks  and all for nothing  the guerdon of their love had proved vain  each of them was not what the other had thought  so it is ever with the loves of this world and herein is the medieval allegory of this tale  the hearts of the two lovers broke together  they expired  meantime carlo the corkscrew and beowulf the bradawl and their forty followers were hustling down the spirals as fast as they could crawl hind end uppermost    iv  gertrude the governess or simple seventeen       synopsis of previous chapters     there are no previous chapters  it was a wild and stormy night on the west coast of scotland  this however is immaterial to the present story as the scene is not laid in the west of scotland for the matter of that the weather was just as bad on the east coast of ireland  but the scene of this narrative is laid in the south of england and takes place in and around knotacentinum towers pronounced as if written nosham taws the seat of lord knotacent pronounced as if written nosh  but it is not necessary to pronounce either of these names in reading them  nosham taws was a typical english home  the main part of the house was an elizabethan structure of warm red brick while the elder portion of which the earl was inordinately proud still showed the outlines of a norman keep to which had been added a lancastrian jail and a plantagenet orphan asylum  from the house in all directions stretched magnificent woodland and park with oaks and elms of immemorial antiquity while nearer the house stood raspberry bushes and geranium plants which had been set out by the crusaders  about the grand old mansion the air was loud with the chirping of thrushes the cawing of partridges and the clear sweet note of the rook while deer antelope and other quadrupeds strutted about the lawn so tame as to eat off the sundial  in fact the place was a regular menagerie  from the house downwards through the park stretched a beautiful broad avenue laid out by henry vii  lord nosh stood upon the hearthrug of the library trained diplomat and statesman as he was his stern aristocratic face was upside down with fury  boy he said you shall marry this girl or i disinherit you  you are no son of mine  young lord ronald erect before him flung back a glance as defiant as his own  i defy you he said  henceforth you are no father of mine  i will get another  i will marry none but a woman i can love  this girl that we have never seen  fool said the earl would you throw aside our estate and name of a thousand years  the girl i am told is beautiful her aunt is willing they are french pah they understand such things in france  but your reason  i give no reason said the earl  listen ronald i give one month  for that time you remain here  if at the end of it you refuse me i cut you off with a shilling  lord ronald said nothing he flung himself from the room flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions  as the door of the library closed upon ronald the earl sank into a chair  his face changed  it was no longer that of the haughty nobleman but of the hunted criminal  he must marry the girl he muttered  soon she will know all tutchemoff has escaped from siberia  he knows and will tell the whole of the mines pass to her this property with it and ibut enough  he rose walked to the sideboard drained a dipper full of gin and bitters and became again a highbred english gentleman  it was at this moment that a high dogcart driven by a groom in the livery of earl nosh might have been seen entering the avenue of nosham taws  beside him sat a young girl scarce more than a child in fact not nearly so big as the groom  the applepie hat which she wore surmounted with black willow plumes concealed from view a face so facelike in its appearance as to be positively facial  it wasneed we say itgertrude the governess who was this day to enter upon her duties at nosham taws  at the same time that the dogcart entered the avenue at one end there might have been seen riding down it from the other a tall young man whose long aristocratic face proclaimed his birth and who was mounted upon a horse with a face even longer than his own  and who is this tall young man who draws nearer to gertrude with every revolution of the horse  ah who indeed  ah who who  i wonder if any of my readers could guess that this was none other than lord ronald  the two were destined to meet  nearer and nearer they came and then still nearer  then for one brief moment they met as they passed gertrude raised her head and directed towards the young nobleman two eyes so eyelike in their expression as to be absolutely circular while lord ronald directed towards the occupant of the dogcart a gaze so gazelike that nothing but a gazelle or a gaspipe could have emulated its intensity  was this the dawn of love  wait and see  do not spoil the story    let us speak of gertrude  gertrude demongmorenci mcfiggin had known neither father nor mother  they had both died years before she was born  of her mother she knew nothing save that she was french was extremely beautiful and that all her ancestors and even her business acquaintances had perished in the revolution  yet gertrude cherished the memory of her parents  on her breast the girl wore a locket in which was enshrined a miniature of her mother while down her neck inside at the back hung a daguerreotype of her father  she carried a portrait of her grandmother up her sleeve and had pictures of her cousins tucked inside her boot while beneath her but enough quite enough  of her father gertrude knew even less  that he was a highborn english gentleman who had lived as a wanderer in many lands this was all she knew  his only legacy to gertrude had been a russian grammar a roumanian phrasebook a theodolite and a work on mining engineering  from her earliest infancy gertrude had been brought up by her aunt  her aunt had carefully instructed her in christian principles  she had also taught her mohammedanism to make sure  when gertrude was seventeen her aunt had died of hydrophobia  the circumstances were mysterious  there had called upon her that day a strange bearded man in the costume of the russians after he had left gertrude had found her aunt in a syncope from which she passed into an apostrophe and never recovered  to avoid scandal it was called hydrophobia  gertrude was thus thrown upon the world  what to do  that was the problem that confronted her  it was while musing one day upon her fate that gertrudes eye was struck with an advertisement  wanted a governess must possess a knowledge of french italian russian and roumanian music and mining engineering salary 1 pound 4 shillings and 4 pence halfpenny per annum apply between halfpast eleven and twentyfive minutes to twelve at no 41 a decimal six belgravia terrace  the countess of nosh  gertrude was a girl of great natural quickness of apprehension and she had not pondered over this announcement more than half an hour before she was struck with the extraordinary coincidence between the list of items desired and the things that she herself knew  she duly presented herself at belgravia terrace before the countess who advanced to meet her with a charm which at once placed the girl at her ease  you are proficient in french she asked  oh oui said gertrude modestly  and italian continued the countess  oh si said gertrude  and german said the countess in delight  ah ja said gertrude  and russian  yaw  and roumanian  jep  amazed at the girls extraordinary proficiency in modern languages the countess looked at her narrowly  where had she seen those lineaments before  she passed her hand over her brow in thought and spit upon the floor but no the face baffled her  enough she said i engage you on the spot tomorrow you go down to nosham taws and begin teaching the children  i must add that in addition you will be expected to aid the earl with his russian correspondence  he has large mining interests at tschminsk  tschminsk why did the simple word reverberate upon gertrudes ears  why  because it was the name written in her fathers hand on the title page of his book on mining  what mystery was here  it was on the following day that gertrude had driven up the avenue  she descended from the dogcart passed through a phalanx of liveried servants drawn up sevendeep to each of whom she gave a sovereign as she passed and entered nosham taws  welcome said the countess as she aided gertrude to carry her trunk upstairs  the girl presently descended and was ushered into the library where she was presented to the earl  as soon as the earls eye fell upon the face of the new governess he started visibly where had he seen those lineaments  where was it  at the races or the theatreon a busno  some subtler thread of memory was stirring in his mind  he strode hastily to the sideboard drained a dipper and a half of brandy and became again the perfect english gentleman  while gertrude has gone to the nursery to make the acquaintance of the two tiny goldenhaired children who are to be her charges let us say something here of the earl and his son  lord nosh was the perfect type of the english nobleman and statesman  the years that he had spent in the diplomatic service at constantinople st petersburg and salt lake city had given to him a peculiar finesse and noblesse while his long residence at st helena pitcairn island and hamilton ontario had rendered him impervious to external impressions  as deputypaymaster of the militia of the county he had seen something of the sterner side of military life while his hereditary office of groom of the sunday breeches had brought him into direct contact with royalty itself  his passion for outdoor sports endeared him to his tenants a keen sportsman he excelled in foxhunting doghunting pigkilling batcatching and the pastimes of his class  in this latter respect lord ronald took after his father  from the start the lad had shown the greatest promise  at eton he had made a splendid showing at battledore and shuttlecock and at cambridge had been first in his class at needlework  already his name was whispered in connection with the allengland pingpong championship a triumph which would undoubtedly carry with it a seat in parliament  thus was gertrude the governess installed at nosham taws  the days and the weeks sped past  the simple charm of the beautiful orphan girl attracted all hearts  her two little pupils became her slaves  me loves oo the little rasehellfrida would say leaning her golden head in gertrudes lap  even the servants loved her  the head gardener would bring a bouquet of beautiful roses to her room before she was up the second gardener a bunch of early cauliflowers the third a spray of late asparagus and even the tenth and eleventh a sprig of mangelwurzel of an armful of hay  her room was full of gardeners all the time while at evening the aged butler touched at the friendless girls loneliness would tap softly at her door to bring her a rye whiskey and seltzer or a box of pittsburg stogies  even the dumb creatures seemed to admire her in their own dumb way  the dumb rooks settled on her shoulder and every dumb dog around the place followed her  and ronald ah ronald  yes indeed  they had met  they had spoken  what a dull morning gertrude had said  quelle triste matin was fur ein allerverdamnter tag  beastly ronald had answered  beastly  the word rang in gertrudes ears all day  after that they were constantly together  they played tennis and pingpong in the day and in the evening in accordance with the stiff routine of the place they sat down with the earl and countess to twentyfivecent poker and later still they sat together on the verandah and watched the moon sweeping in great circles around the horizon  it was not long before gertrude realised that lord ronald felt towards her a warmer feeling than that of mere pingpong  at times in her presence he would fall especially after dinner into a fit of profound subtraction  once at night when gertrude withdrew to her chamber and before seeking her pillow prepared to retire as a preliminary to disrobingin other words before going to bed she flung wide the casement opened the window and perceived saw the face of lord ronald  he was sitting on a thorn bush beneath her and his upturned face wore an expression of agonised pallor  meanwhile the days passed  life at the taws moved in the ordinary routine of a great english household  at 7 a gong sounded for rising at 8 a horn blew for breakfast at 830 a whistle sounded for prayers at 1 a flag was run up at halfmast for lunch at 4 a gun was fired for afternoon tea at 9 a first bell sounded for dressing at 915 a second bell for going on dressing while at 930 a rocket was sent up to indicate that dinner was ready  at midnight dinner was over and at 1 am the tolling of a bell summoned the domestics to evening prayers  meanwhile the month allotted by the earl to lord ronald was passing away  it was already july 15 then within a day or two it was july 17 and almost immediately afterwards july 18  at times the earl in passing ronald in the hall would say sternly remember boy your consent or i disinherit you  and what were the earls thoughts of gertrude  here was the one drop of bitterness in the girls cup of happiness  for some reason that she could not divine the earl showed signs of marked antipathy  once as she passed the door of the library he threw a bootjack at her  on another occasion at lunch alone with her he struck her savagely across the face with a sausage  it was her duty to translate to the earl his russian correspondence  she sought in it in vain for the mystery one day a russian telegram was handed to the earl  gertrude translated it to him aloud  tutchemoff went to the woman  she is dead  on hearing this the earl became livid with fury in fact this was the day that he struck her with the sausage  then one day while the earl was absent on a bat hunt gertrude who was turning over his correspondence with that sweet feminine instinct of interest that rose superior to illtreatment suddenly found the key to the mystery  lord nosh was not the rightful owner of the taws  his distant cousin of the older line the true heir had died in a russian prison to which the machinations of the earl while ambassador at tschminsk had consigned him  the daughter of this cousin was the true owner of nosham taws  the family story save only that the documents before her withheld the name of the rightful heir lay bare to gertrudes eye  strange is the heart of woman  did gertrude turn from the earl with spurning  no  her own sad fate had taught her sympathy  yet still the mystery remained  why did the earl start perceptibly each time that he looked into her face  sometimes he started as much as four centimetres so that one could distinctly see him do it  on such occasions he would hastily drain a dipper of rum and vichy water and become again the correct english gentleman  the denouement came swiftly  gertrude never forgot it  it was the night of the great ball at nosham taws  the whole neighbourhood was invited  how gertrudes heart had beat with anticipation and with what trepidation she had overhauled her scant wardrobe in order to appear not unworthy in lord ronalds eyes  her resources were poor indeed yet the inborn genius for dress that she inherited from her french mother stood her in good stead  she twined a single rose in her hair and contrived herself a dress out of a few old newspapers and the inside of an umbrella that would have graced a court  round her waist she bound a single braid of bagstring while a piece of old lace that had been her mothers was suspended to her ear by a thread  gertrude was the cynosure of all eyes  floating to the strains of the music she presented a picture of bright girlish innocence that no one could see undisenraptured  the ball was at its height  it was away up  ronald stood with gertrude in the shrubbery  they looked into one anothers eyes  gertrude he said i love you  simple words and yet they thrilled every fibre in the girls costume  ronald she said and cast herself about his neck  at this moment the earl appeared standing beside them in the moonlight  his stern face was distorted with indignation  so he said turning to ronald it appears that you have chosen  i have said ronald with hauteur  you prefer to marry this penniless girl rather than the heiress i have selected for you  gertrude looked from father to son in amazement  yes said ronald  be it so said the earl draining a dipper of gin which he carried and resuming his calm  then i disinherit you leave this place and never return to it  come gertrude said ronald tenderly let us flee together  gertrude stood before them  the rose had fallen from her head the lace had fallen from her ear and the bagstring had come undone from her waist  her newspapers were crumpled beyond recognition  but dishevelled and illegible as she was she was still mistress of herself  never she said firmly  ronald you shall never make this sacrifice for me  then to the earl in tones of ice there is a pride sir as great even as yours  the daughter of metschnikoff mcfiggin need crave a boon from no one  with that she hauled from her bosom the daguerreotype of her father and pressed it to her lips  the earl started as if shot  that name he cried that face that photograph stop  there  there is no need to finish my readers have long since divined it  gertrude was the heiress  the lovers fell into one anothers arms  the earls proud face relaxed  god bless you he said  the countess and the guests came pouring out upon the lawn  the breaking day illuminated a scene of gay congratulations  gertrude and ronald were wed  their happiness was complete need we say more  yes only this  the earl was killed in the huntingfield a few days after  the countess was struck by lightning  the two children fell down a well  thus the happiness of gertrude and ronald was complete    v  a hero in homespun or the life struggle of hezekiah hayloft   can you give me a job  the foreman of the bricklayers looked down from the scaffold to the speaker below  something in the lads upturned face appealed to the man  he threw a brick at him  it was hezekiah hayloft  he was all in homespun  he carried a carpetbag in each hand  he had come to new york the cruel city looking for work  hezekiah moved on  presently he stopped in front of a policeman  sir he said can you tell me the way to  the policeman struck him savagely across the side of the head  ill learn you he said to ask damn fool questions  again hezekiah moved on  in a few moments he met a man whose tall black hat black waistcoat and white tie proclaimed him a clergyman  good sir said hezekiah can you tell me  the clergyman pounced upon him with a growl of a hyena and bit a piece out of his ear  yes he did reader  just imagine a clergyman biting a boy in open daylight  yet that happens in new york every minute  such is the great cruel city and imagine looking for work in it you and i who spend our time in trying to avoid work can hardly realise what it must mean  think how it must feel to be alone in new york without a friend or a relation at hand with no one to know or care what you do  it must be great  for a few moments hezekiah stood irresolute  he looked about him he looked up at the top of the metropolitan tower  he saw no work there  he looked across at the skyscrapers on madison square but his eye detected no work in any of them  he stood on his head and looked up at the flatiron building  still no work in sight  all that day and the next hezekiah looked for work  a wall street firm had advertised for a stenographer  can you write shorthand they said  no said the boy in homespun but i can try  they threw him down the elevator  hezekiah was not discouraged  that day he applied for fourteen jobs  the waldorf astoria was in need of a chef  hezekiah applied for the place  can you cook they said  no said hezekiah but oh sir give me a trial give me an egg and let me tryi will try so hard  great tears rolled down the boys face  they rolled him out into the corridor  next he applied for a job as a telegrapher  his mere ignorance of telegraphy was made the ground of refusal  at nightfall hezekiah hayloft grew hungry  he entered again the portico of the waldorf astoria  within it stood a tall man in uniform  boss said the boy hero will you trust me for the price of a square meal  they set the dog on him  such reader is the hardness and bitterness of the great city  for fourteen weeks hezekiah hayloft looked for work  once or twice he obtained temporary employment only to lose it again  for a few days he was made accountant in a trust company  he was discharged because he would not tell a lie  for about a week he held a position as cashier in a bank  they discharged the lad because he refused to forge a cheque  for three days he held a conductorship on a broadway surface car  he was dismissed from this business for refusing to steal a nickel  such reader is the horrid degradation of business life in new york  meantime the days passed and still hayloft found no work his stock of money was exhausted  he had not had any money anyway  for food he ate grass in central park and drank the water from the cruelty to animals horsetrough  gradually a change came over the lad his face grew hard and stern the great city was setting its mark upon him  one night hezekiah stood upon the sidewalk  it was late long after ten oclock  only a few chance pedestrians passed  by heaven said hezekiah shaking his fist at the lights of the cruel city i have exhausted fair means i will try foul i will beg  no hayloft has been a beggar yet he added with a bitter laugh but i will begin  a welldressed man passed along  hezekiah seized him by the throat  what do you want cried the man in sudden terror  dont ask me for work  i tell you i have no work to give  i dont want work said hezekiah grimly  i am a beggar  oh is that all said the man relieved  here take this ten dollars and go and buy a drink with it  money money and with it a new sense of power that rushed like an intoxicant to hezekiahs brain  drink he muttered hoarsely yes drink  the lights of a sodawater fountain struck his eye  give me an egg phosphate he said as he dashed his money on the counter  he drank phosphate after phosphate till his brain reeled  mad with the liquor he staggered to and fro in the shop weighed himself recklessly on the slot machine three or four times tore out chewing gum and matches from the automatic nickel boxes and finally staggered on to the street reeling from the effects of thirteen phosphates and a sarsaparilla soda  crime he hissed  crime crime thats what i want  he noticed that the passersby made way for him now with respect  on the corner of the street a policeman was standing  hezekiah picked up a cobblestone threw it and struck the man full on the ear  the policeman smiled at him roguishly and then gently wagged his finger in reproof  it was the same policeman who had struck him fourteen weeks before for asking the way  hezekiah moved on still full of his new idea of crime  down the street was a novelty shop the window decked with new years gifts  sell me a revolver he said  yes sir said the salesman  would you like something for evening wear or a plain kind for home use  here is a very good family revolver or would you like a roof garden size  hezekiah selected a revolver and went out  now then he muttered i will burglarise a house and get money  walking across to fifth avenue he selected one of the finest residences and rang the bell  a man in livery appeared in the brightly lighted hall  where is your master hezekiah asked showing his revolver  he is upstairs sir counting his money the man answered but he dislikes being disturbed  show me to him said hezekiah i wish to shoot him and take his money  very good sir said the man deferentially  you will find him on the first floor  hezekiah turned and shot the footman twice through the livery and went upstairs  in an upper room was a man sitting at a desk under a readinglamp  in front of him was a pile of gold  what are you doing said hezekiah  i am counting my money said the man  what are you asked hezekiah sternly  i am a philanthropist said the man  i give my money to deserving objects  i establish medals for heroes  i give prizes for ship captains who jump into the sea and for firemen who throw people from the windows of upper stories at the risk of their own i send american missionaries to china chinese missionaries to india and indian missionaries to chicago  i set aside money to keep college professors from starving to death when they deserve it  stop said hezekiah you deserve to die  stand up  open your mouth and shut your eyes  the old man stood up  there was a loud report  the philanthropist fell  he was shot through the waistcoat and his suspenders were cut to ribbons  hezekiah his eyes glittering with the mania of crime crammed his pockets with gold pieces  there was a roar and hubbub in the street below  the police hezekiah muttered  i must set fire to the house and escape in the confusion  he struck a safety match and held it to the leg of the table  it was a fireproof table and refused to burn  he held it to the door  the door was fireproof  he applied it to the bookcase he ran the match along the books  they were all fireproof everything was fireproof  frenzied with rage he tore off his celluloid collar and set fire to it  he waved it above his head  great tongues of flame swept from the windows  fire  fire was the cry  hezekiah rushed to the door and threw the blazing collar down the elevator shaft  in a moment the iron elevator with its steel ropes burst into a mass of flame then the brass fittings of the door took fire and in a moment the cement floor of the elevator was one roaring mass of flame  great columns of smoke burst from the building  fire  fire shouted the crowd  reader have you ever seen a fire in a great city  the sight is a wondrous one  one realises that vast and horrible as the city is it nevertheless shows its human organisation in its most perfect form  scarcely had the fire broken out before resolute efforts were made to stay its progress  long lines of men passed buckets of water from hand to hand  the water was dashed on the fronts of the neighbouring houses thrown all over the street splashed against the telegraph poles and poured in torrents over the excited crowd  every place in the neighbourhood of the fire was literally soaked the man worked with a will  a derrick rapidly erected in the street reared itself to the height of sixteen or seventeen feet  a daring man mounted on the top of it hauled bucket after bucket of water on the pulley  balancing himself with the cool daring of the trained fireman he threw the water in all directions over the crowd  the fire raged for an hour  hezekiah standing at an empty window amid the flames rapidly filled his revolver and emptied it into the crowd  from one hundred revolvers in the street a fusillade was kept up in return  this lasted for an hour  several persons were almost hit by the rain of bullets which would have proved fatal had they struck anyone  meantime as the flames died down a squad of policemen rushed into the doomed building  hezekiah threw aside his revolver and received them with folded arms  hayloft said the chief of police i arrest you for murder burglary arson and conspiracy  you put up a splendid fight old man and i am only sorry that it is our painful duty to arrest you  as hayloft appeared below a great cheer went up from the crowd  true courage always appeals to the heart of the people  hayloft was put in a motor and whirled rapidly to the police station  on the way the chief handed him a flask and a cigar  they chatted over the events of the evening  hayloft realised that a new life had opened for him  he was no longer a despised outcast  he had entered the american criminal class  at the police station the chief showed hezekiah to his room  i hope you will like this room he said a little anxiously it is the best that i can give you tonight  tomorrow i can give you a room with a bath but at such short notice i am sure you will not mind putting up with this  he said good night and shut the door  in a moment he reappeared  about breakfast he said  would you rather have it in your room or will you join us at our table dhote  the force are most anxious to meet you  next morning before hezekiah was up the chief brought to his room a new outfit of clothesa silk hat frockcoat shepherdsplaid trousers and varnished boots with spats  you wont mind accepting these things mr hayloft  our force would like very much to enable you to make a suitable appearance in the court  carefully dressed and shaved hezekiah descended  he was introduced to the leading officials of the force and spent a pleasant hour of chat over a cigar discussing the incidents of the night before  in the course of the morning a number of persons called to meet and congratulate hezekiah  i want to tell you sir said the editor of a great american daily that your work of last night will be known and commented on all over the states  your shooting of the footman was a splendid piece of nerve sir and will do much in defence of the unwritten law  mr hayloft said another caller i am sorry not to have met you sooner  our friends here tell me that you have been in new york for some months  i regret sir that we did not know you this is the name of my firm mr hayloft  we are leading lawyers here and we want the honour of defending you  we may  thank you sir  and now as we have still an hour or two before the court i want to run you up to my house in my motor  my wife is very anxious to have a little luncheon with you  the court met that afternoon  there was a cheer as hezekiah entered  mr hayloft said the judge i am adjourning this court for a few days  from what i hear the nerve strain that you have undergone must have been most severe  your friends tell me that you can hardly be in a state to take a proper interest in the case till you have had a thorough rest  as hayloft left the court a cheer went up from the crowd in which the judge joined  the next few days were busy days for hezekiah  filled with receptions civic committees and the preparation of the brief in which hezekiahs native intelligence excited the admiration of the lawyers  newspaper men sought for interviews  business promoters called upon hezekiah  his name was put down as a director of several leading companies and it was rumoured that in the event of his acquittal he would undertake a merger of all the great burglar protection corporations of the united states  the trial opened a week later and lasted two months  hezekiah was indicted on five chargesarson for having burned the steel cage of the elevator misdemeanour for shooting the footman the theft of the money petty larceny the killing of the philanthropist infanticide and the shooting at the police without hitting them aggravated felony  the proceedings were very complicatedexpert evidence was taken from all over the united states  an analytical examination was made of the brain of the philanthropist nothing was found  the entire jury were dismissed three times on the grounds of prejudice twice on the ground of ignorance and finally disbanded on the ground of insanity  the proceedings dragged on  meanwhile hezekiahs business interests accumulated  at length at hezekiahs own suggestion it was necessary to abandon the case  gentlemen he said in his final speech to the court  i feel that i owe an apology for not being able to attend these proceedings any further  at any time when i can snatch an hour or two from my business you may always count on my attendance  in the meantime rest assured that i shall follow your proceedings with the greatest interest  he left the room amid three cheers and the singing of auld lang syne  after that the case dragged hopeless on from stage to stage  the charge of arson was met by a nolle prosequi  the accusation of theft was stopped by a ne plus ultra  the killing of the footman was pronounced justifiable insanity  the accusation of murder for the death of the philanthropist was withdrawn by common consent  damages in error were awarded to hayloft for the loss of his revolver and cartridges  the main body of the case was carried on a writ of certiorari to the federal courts and appealed to the supreme court of the united states  it is there still  meantime hezekiah as managing director of the burglars security corporation remains one of the rising generation of financiers in new york with every prospect of election to the state senate     vi  sorrows of a super soul or the memoirs of marie mushenough    translated by machinery out of the original russian   do you ever look at your face in the glass  i do  sometimes i stand for hours and peer at my face and wonder at it at times i turn it upside down and gaze intently at it  i try to think what it means  it seems to look back at me with its great brown eyes as if it knew me and wanted to speak to me  why was i born  i do not know  i ask my face a thousand times a day and find no answer  at times when people pass my roommy maid nitnitzka or jakub the servingmanand see me talking to my face they think i am foolish  but i am not  at times i cast myself on the sofa and bury my head in the cushions even then i cannot find out why i was born  i am seventeen  shall i ever be seventyseven  ah  shall i ever be even sixtyseven or sixtyseven even  oh  and if i am both of these shall i ever be eightyseven  i cannot tell  often i start up in the night with wild eyes and wonder if i shall be eightyseven                                                                                        next day  i passed a flower in my walk today  it grew in the meadow beside the river bank  it stood dreaming on a long stem  i knew its name  it was a tchupvskja  i love beautiful names  i leaned over and spoke to it  i asked it if my heart would ever know love  it said it thought so  on the way home i passed an onion  it lay upon the road  someone had stepped upon its stem and crushed it  how it must have suffered  i placed it in my bosom  all night it lay beside my pillow                                                                                        another day  my heart is yearning for love  how is it that i can love no one  i have tried and i cannot  my fatherivan ivanovitchhe is so big and so kind and yet i cannot love him and my mother katoosha katooshavitch she is just as big and yet i cannot love her  and my brother dimitri dimitrivitch i cannot love him  and alexis alexovitch  i cannot love him  and yet i am to marry him  they have set the day it is a month from today  one month  thirty days  why cannot i love alexis  he is tall and strong  he is a soldier  he is in the guard of the czar nicholas romanoff and yet i cannot love him                                                                                   next day but one  how they cramp and confine me hereivan ivanovitch my father and my mother i forget her name for the minute and all the rest  i cannot breathe  they will not let me  every time i try to commit suicide they hinder me  last night i tried again  i placed a phial of sulphuric acid on the table beside my bed  in the morning it was still there  it had not killed me  they have forbidden me to drown myself  why  i do not know why  in vain i ask the air and the trees why i should not drown myself  they do not see any reason why  and yet i long to be free free as the young birds as the very youngest of them  i watch the leaves blowing in the wind and i want to be a leaf  yet here they want to make me eat  yesterday i ate a banana  ugh                                                                                        next day  today in my walk i found a cabbage  it lay in a corner of the hedge  cruel boys had chased it there with stones  it was dead when i lifted it up  beside it was an egg  it too was dead  ah how i wept                                                                                    this morning  how my heart beats  today a man passed  he passed actually passed  from my window i saw him go by the garden gate and out into the meadow beside the river where my tchupvskja flower is growing  how beautiful he looked  not tall like alexis alexovitch ah no but so short and wide and roundshaped like the beautiful cabbage that died last week  he wore a velvet jacket and he carried a camp stool and an easel on his back and in his face was a curved pipe with a long stem and his face was not red and rough like the face of alexis but mild and beautiful and with a smile that played on it like moonlight over putty  do i love him  i cannot tell  not yet  love is a gentle plant  you cannot force its growth  as he passed i leaned from the window and threw a rosebud at him  but he did not see it  then i threw a cake of soap and a toothbrush at him  but i missed him and he passed on                                                                                      another day  love has come into my life  it fills it  i have seen him again  i have spoken with him  he sat beside the river on his camp stool  how beautiful he looked sitting on it how strong he seemed and how frail the little stool on which he sat  before him was the easel and he was painting  i spoke to him  i know his name now  his name  how my heart beats as i write itno i cannot write it i will whisper itit is otto dinkelspiel  is it not a beautiful name  ah  he was painting on a canvasbeautiful colours red and gold and white in glorious opalescent streaks in all directions  i looked at it in wonder  instinctively i spoke to him  what are you painting i said is it the heavenly child  no he said it is a cow  then i looked again and i could see that it was a cow  i looked straight into his eyes  it shall be our secret i said no one else shall know  and i knew that i loved him                                                                                      a week later  each morning i go to see otto beside the river in the meadow  he sits and paints and i sit with my hands clasped about my knees and talk to him  i tell him all that i think all that i read all that i know all that i feel all that i do not feel  he listens to me with that faraway look that i have learned to love and that means that he is thinking deeply at times he almost seems not to hear  the intercourse of our minds is wonderful  we stimulate one anothers thought  otto is my master  i am his disciple  yesterday i asked him if hegel or schlegel or whegel gives the truest view of life  he said he didnt know  my otto                                                                                           today  otto touched me  he touched me  how the recollection of it thrills me  i stood beside him on the river bank and as we talked the handle of my parasol touched the bottom button of his waistcoat  it seemed to burn me like fire  tomorrow i am to bring otto to see my father  but tonight i can think of nothing else but that otto has touched me                                                                                        next day  otto has touched father  he touched him for ten roubles my father is furious  i cannot tell what it means  i brought otto to our home  he spoke with my father ivan ivanovitch  they sat together in the evening  and now my father is angry  he says that otto wanted to touch him  why should he be angry  but otto is forbidden the house and i can see him only in the meadow                                                                                     two days later  today otto asked me for a keepsake  i offered him one of my hatpins  but he said no  he has taken instead the diamond buckle from my belt  i read his meaning  he means that i am to him as a diamond is to lesser natures                                                                                    this morning  yesterday otto asked me for another keepsake  i took a gold rouble from my bag and said that he should break it in half and that each should keep one of the halves  but otto said no  i divined his thought  it would violate our love to break the coin  he is to keep it for both of us and it is to remain unbroken like our love  is it not a sweet thought  otto is so thoughtful  he thinks of everything  today he asked me if i had another gold rouble                                                                                        next day  today i brought otto another gold rouble  his eyes shone with love when he saw it  he has given me for it a bronze kopek  our love is to be as pure as gold and as strong as bronze  is it not beautiful                                                                                          later  i am so fearful that alexis alexovitch may return  i fear that if he comes otto might kill him  otto is so calm i dread to think of what would happen if he were aroused                                                                                        next day  i have told otto about alexis  i have told him that alexis is a soldier that he is in the guards of the czar and that i am betrothed to him  at first otto would not listen to me  he feared that his anger might overmaster him  he began folding up his campstool  then i told him that alexis would not come for some time yet and he grew calmer  i have begged him for my sake not to kill alexis  he has given me his promise                                                                                      another day  ivan ivanovitch my father has heard from alexis  he will return in fourteen days  the day after his return i am to marry him  and meantime i have still fourteen days to love otto  my love is perfect  it makes me want to die  last night i tried again to commit suicide  why should i live now that i have known a perfect love  i placed a box of cartridges beside my bed  i awoke unharmed  they did not kill me  but i know what it means  it means that otto and i are to die together i must tell otto                                                                                          later  today i told otto that we must kill ourselves that our love is so perfect that we have no right to live  at first he looked so strange  he suggested that i should kill myself first and that he should starve himself beside my grave  but i could not accept the sacrifice  i offered instead to help him to hang himself beside the river  he is to think it over  if he does not hang himself he is to shoot himself  i have lent him my fathers revolver  how grateful he looked when he took it                                                                                        next day  why does otto seem to avoid me  has he some secret sorrow that i cannot share  today he moved his campstool to the other side of the meadow  he was in the long grass behind an elderberry bush  at first i did not see him  i thought that he had hanged himself  but he said no  he had forgotten to get a rope  he had tried he said to shoot himself  but he had missed himself                                                                                   five days later  otto and i are not to die  we are to live to live and love one another for ever  we are going away out into the world together how happy i am  otto and i are to flee together  when alexis comes we shall be gone we shall be far away  i have said to otto that i will fly with him and he has said yes  i told him that we would go out into the world together emptyhanded we would fare forth together and defy the world  i said that he should be my knighterrant my paladin  otto said he would be it  he has consented  but he says we must not fare forth emptyhanded i do not know why he thinks this but he is firm and i yield to my lord  he is making all our preparations  each morning i bring to the meadow a little bundle of my things and give them to my knighterrant and he takes them to the inn where he is staying  last week i brought my jewelcase and yesterday at his request i took my money from the bank and brought it to my paladin  it will be so safe with him  today he said that i shall need some little things to remember my father and mother by when we are gone  so i am to take my fathers gold watch while he is asleep  my hero  how thoughtful he is of my happiness                                                                                        next day   all is ready  tomorrow i am to meet otto at the meadow with the watch and the rest of the things  tomorrow night we are to flee together  i am to go down to the little gate at the foot of the garden and otto will be there  today i have wandered about the house and garden and have said goodbye  i have said goodbye to my tchupvskja flower and to the birds and the bees  tomorrow it will be all over                                                                                    next evening  how can i write what has happened  my soul is shattered to its depths  all that i dreaded most has happened  how can i live  alexis has come back  he and otto have fought  ah god it has been terrible  i stood with otto in the meadow  i had brought him the watch and i gave it to him and all my love and my life with it  then as we stood i turned and saw alexis alexovitch striding towards us through the grass  how tall and soldierly he looked  and the thought flashed through my mind that if otto killed him he would be lying there a dead inanimate thing  go otto i cried go if you stay you will kill him  otto looked and saw alexis coming  he turned one glance at me his face was full of infinite meaning  then for my sake he ran  how noble he looked as he ran brave heart he dared not stay and risk the outburst of his anger  but alexis overtook him  then beside the riverbank they fought  ah but it was terrible to see them fight  is it not awful when men fight together  i could only stand and wring my hands and look on in agony  first alexis seized otto by the waistband of his trousers and swung him round and round in the air  i could see ottos face as he went round the same mute courage was written on it as when he turned to run  alexis swung otto round and round until his waistband broke and he was thrown into the grass  that was the first part of the fight  then alexis stood beside otto and kicked him from behind as he lay in the grass and they fought like that for some time  that was the second part of the fight  then came the third and last part  alexis picked up the easel and smashed the picture over ottos head  it fastened itself like a collar about his neck then alexis picked otto up with the picture round his neck and threw him into the stream  he floated  my paladin  he floated  i could see his upturned face as he floated onwards down the stream through the meadow  it was full of deep resignation  then alexis alexovitch came to me and gathered me up in his arms and carried me thus across the meadowhe is so tall and strong and whispered that he loved me and that tomorrow he would shield me from the world  he carried me thus to the house in his arms among the grass and flowers and there was my father ivan ivanovitch and my mother katoosha katooshavitch  and tomorrow i am to marry alexis  he had brought back from the inn my jewels and my money and he gave me again the diamond clasp that otto had taken from my waist  how can i bear it  alexis is to take me to petersburg and he has bought a beautiful house in the prospekt and i am to live in it with him and we are to be rich and i am to be presented at the court of nicholas romanoff and his wife  ah  is it not dreadful  and i can only think of otto floating down the stream with the easel about his neck  from the little river he will float into the dnieper and from the dnieper into the bug and from the bug he will float down the volga and from the volga into the caspian sea  and from the caspian sea there is no outlet and otto will float round and round it for ever  is it not dreadful     vii  hannah of the highlands or the laird of loch aucherlocherty                   sair maun ye greet but hoot awa                 theres muckle yet love isna a                 nae more yell see howeer ye whine                 the bonnie breeks of auld lang syne  the simple words rang out fresh and sweet upon the morning air  it was hannah of the highlands  she was gathering lobsters in the burn that ran through the glen  the scene about her was typically highland  wild hills rose on both sides of the burn to a height of seventyfive feet covered with a dense highland forest that stretched a hundred yards in either direction  at the foot of the burn a beautiful scotch loch lay in the hollow of the hills  beyond it again through the gap of the hills was the sea  through the glen and close beside the burn where hannah stood wound the road that rose again to follow the cliffs along the shore  the tourists in the highlands will find no more beautiful spot than the glen of aucherlocherty  nor is there any spot which can more justly claim to be historic ground  it was here in the glen that bonnie prince charlie had lain and hidden after the defeat of culloden  almost in the same spot the great boulder still stands behind which the bruce had laid hidden after bannockburn while behind a number of lesser stones the covenanters had concealed themselves during the height of the stuart persecution  through the glen montrose had passed on his fateful ride to killiecrankie while at the lower end of it the rock was still pointed out behind which william wallace had paused to change his breeches while flying from the wrath of rob roy  grim memories such as these gave character to the spot  indeed most of the great events of scotch history had taken place in the glen while the little loch had been the scene of some of the most stirring naval combats in the history of the grampian hills  but there was little in the scene which lay so peaceful on this april morning to recall the sanguinary history of the glen  its sides at present were covered with a thick growth of gorse elderberry eggplants and ghillie flower while the woods about it were loud with the voice of the throstle the linnet the magpie the jackdaw and other songbirds of the highlands  it was a gloriously beautiful scotch morning  the rain fell softly and quietly bringing dampness and moisture and almost a sense of wetness to the soft moss underfoot  grey mists flew hither and thither carrying with them an invigorating rawness that had almost a feeling of dampness  it is the memory of such a morning that draws a tear from the eye of scotchmen after years of exile  the scotch heart reader can be moved to its depths by the sight of a raindrop or the sound of a wet rag  and meantime hannah the beautiful highland girl was singing the fresh young voice rose high above the rain  even the birds seemed to pause to listen and as they listened to the simple words of the gaelic folksong fell off the bough with a thud on the grass  the highland girl made a beautiful picture as she stood  her bare feet were in the burn the rippling water of which laved her ankles  the lobsters played about her feet or clung affectionately to her toes as if loath to leave the water and be gathered in the folds of her blue apron  it was a scene to charm the heart of a burnejones or an alma tadema or of anybody fond of lobsters  the girls golden hair flowed widely behind her gathered in a single braid with a piece of stovepipe wire  will you sell me one of your lobsters  hannah looked up  there standing in the burn a few yards above her was the vision of a young man  the beautiful highland girl gazed at him fascinated  he seemed a higher order of being  he carried a fishingrod and basket in his hand  he was dressed in a salmonfishing costume of an english gentleman  salmonfishing boots reached to his thighs while above them he wore a fishingjacket fastened loosely with a fishingbelt about his waist he wore a small fishingcap on his head  there were no fish in his basket  he drew near to the highland girl  hannah knew as she looked at him that it must be ian mcwhinus the new laird  at sight she loved him  yere sair welcome she said as she handed to the young man the finest of her lobsters  he put it in his basket  then he felt in the pocket of his jacket and brought out a sixpennypiece  you must let me pay for it he said  hannah took the sixpence and held it a moment flushing with true highland pride  ill no be selling the fush for money she said  something in the girls speech went straight to the young mans heart  he handed her half a crown  whistling lightly he strode off up the side of the burn  hannah stood gazing after him spellbound  she was aroused from her reverie by an angry voice calling her name  hannah hannah cried the voice come away ben are ye daft lass that ye stand there keeking at a mcwhinus  then hannah realised what she had done  she had spoken with a mcwhinus a thing that no mcshamus had done for a hundred and fifty years  for nearly two centuries the mcshamuses and the mcwhinuses albeit both dwellers in the glen had been torn asunder by one of those painful divisions by which the life of the scotch people is broken into fragments  it had arisen out of a point of spiritual belief  it had been six generations agone at a highland banquet in the days when the unrestrained temper of the time gave way to wild orgies during which theological discussions raged with unrestrained fury  shamus mcshamus an embittered calvinist half crazed perhaps with liquor had maintained that damnation could be achieved only by faith  whimper mcwhinus had held that damnation could be achieved also by good works  inflamed with drink mcshamus had struck mcwhinus across the temple with an oatcake and killed him  mcshamus had been brought to trial  although defended by some of the most skilled lawyers of aucherlocherty he had been acquitted  on the very night of his acquittal whangus mcwhinus the son of the murdered man had lain in wait for shamus mcshamus in the hollow of the glen road where it rises to the cliff and had shot him through the bagpipes  since then the feud had raged with unquenched bitterness for a century and a half  with each generation the difference between the two families became more acute  they differed on every possible point  they wore different tartans sat under different ministers drank different brands of whisky and upheld different doctrines in regard to eternal punishment  to add to the feud the mcwhinuses had grown rich while the mcshamuses had become poor  at least once in every generation a mcwhinus or a mcshamus had been shot and always at the turn of the glen road where it rose to the edge of the cliff  finally two generations gone the mcwhinuses had been raised to sudden wealth by the discovery of a coal mine on their land  to show their contempt for the mcshamuses they had left the glen to live in america  the mcshamuses to show their contempt for the mcwhinuses had remained in the glen  the feud was kept alive in their memory  and now the descendant of the mcwhinuses had come back and bought out the property of the laird of aucherlocherty beside the glen ian mcwhinus knew nothing of the feud  reared in another atmosphere the traditions of scotland had no meaning for him  he had entirely degenerated  to him the tartan had become only a piece of coloured cloth  he wore a kilt as a masquerade costume for a halloween dance and when it rained he put on a raincoat  he was no longer scotch  more than that he had married a beautiful american wife a talcumpowder blonde with a dough face and the exquisite rotundity of the packinghouse district of the middlewest  ian mcwhinus was her slave  for her sake he had bought the lobster from hannah for her sake too he had scrutinised closely the beautiful highland girl for his wife was anxious to bring back a scotch housemaid with her to chicago  and meantime hannah with the rapture of a new love in her heart followed her father oyster mcoyster mcshamus to the cottage  oyster mcoyster even in advancing age was a fine specimen of scotch manhood ninetyseven years of age he was approaching the time when many of his countrymen begin to show the ravages of time  but he bore himself straight as a lath while his tall stature and his native highland costume accentuated the fine outline of his form  this costume consisted of a black velvet beetleshell jacket which extended from the shoulder halfway down the back and was continued in a short kilt of the tartan of the mcshamuses which extended from the waist halfway to the thigh  the costume reappeared again after an interval in the form of rolled golf stockings which extended halfway up to the knee while on his feet a pair of half shoes were buckled halfway up with a highland clasp  on his head halfway between the ear and the upper superficies of the skull he wore half a scotch cap from which a tall rhinoceros feather extended halfway into the air  a pair of bagpipes were beneath his arm from which as he walked he blew those deep and plaintive sounds which have done much to imprint upon the characters of those who hear them a melancholy and resigned despair  at the door of the cottage he turned and faced his daughter  what said ian mcwhinus to you i the burnside he said fiercely  twas nae muckle said hannah and she added for the truth was ever more to her than her fathers wrath he gied me saxpence for a fush  siller shrieked the highlander  siller from a mcwhinus  hannah handed him the sixpence  oyster mcoyster dashed it fiercely on the ground then picking it up he dashed it with full force against the wall of the cottage  then seizing it again he dashed it angrily into the pocket of his kilt  they entered the cottage  hannah had never seen her fathers face so dour as it looked that night  their home seemed changed  hannah and her mother and father sat down that night in silence to their simple meal of oatmeal porridge and scotch whisky  in the evening the mother sat to her spinning  busily she plied her work for it was a task of love  her eldest born jamie was away at college at edinburgh preparing for the ministry  his graduation day was approaching and jamies mother was spinning him a pair of breeches against the day  the breeches were to be a surprise already they were shaping that way  oyster mcshamus sat reading the old testament in silence while hannah looked into the peat fire and thought of the beautiful young laird  only once the highlander spoke  the mcwhinus is back he said and his glance turned towards the old flintlock musket on the wall  that night hannah dreamed of the feud of the glen and the burn of love of lobsters and of the laird of loch aucherlocherty  and when she rose in the morning there was a wistful look in her eyes and there came no song from her throat  the days passed  each day the beautiful highland girl saw the young laird though her father knew it not  in the mornings she would see him as he came fishing to the burn  at times he wore his fishingsuit at other times he had on a knickerbocker suit of shepherds plaid with a domino pattern neglige shirt  for his sake the beautiful highland girl made herself more beautiful still  each morning she would twine a scotch thistle in her hair and pin a spray of burdock at her heart  and at times he spoke to her  how hannah treasured his words  once catching sight of her father in the distance he had asked her who was the old sardine in the petticoats and the girl had answered gladly that it was her father for as a fishermans daughter she was proud to have her father mistaken for a sardine  at another time he had asked her if she was handy about the work of the house  how hannahs heart had beat at the question  she made up her mind to spin him a pair of breeches like the ones now finishing for her brother jamie  and every evening as the sun set hannah would watch in secret from the window of the cottage waiting for the young laird to come past in his motorcar down the glen road to the sea  always he would slacken the car at the sharp turn at the top of the cliff  for six generations no mcwhinus had passed that spot after nightfall with his life  but ian mcwhinus knew nothing of the feud  at times oyster mcoyster would see him pass and standing at the roadside would call down gaelic curses on his head  once when her father was from home hannah had stood on the roadside and ian had stopped the machine and had taken her with him in the car for a ride  hannah her heart beating with delight had listened to him as he explained how the car was worked  had her father know that she had sat thus beside a mcwhinus he would have slain her where she sat  the tragedy of hannahs love ran swiftly to its close  each day she met the young laird at the burn  each day she gave him the finest of her lobsters  she wore a new thistle every day  and every night in secret as her mother slept she span a new concentric section of his breeches  and the young laird when he went home said to the talcum blonde that the highland fishergirl was not half such a damn fool as she seemed  then came the fateful afternoon  he stood beside her at the burn  hannah he said as he bent towards her i want to take you to america  hannah had fallen fainting in his arms  ian propped her against a tree and went home  an hour later when hannah entered her home her father was standing behind the fireplace  he was staring fixedly into the fire with the flintlock musket in his hands  there was the old dour look of the feud upon his face and there were muttered curses on his lips  his wife ellen clung to his arm and vainly sought to quiet him  curse him he muttered ill een kill him the night as he passes in his deil machine  then hannah knew that oyster mcshamus had seen her with ian beside the burn  she turned and fled from the house  straight up the road she ran across towards the manorhouse of aucherlocherty to warn ian  to save him from her fathers wrath that was her one thought night gathered about the highland girl as she ran  the rain clouds and the gathering storm hung low with fitful lightning overhead she still ran on  about her was the rolling of the thunder and the angry roaring of the swollen burn  then the storm broke upon the darkness with all the fury of the highland gale  they sky was rent with the fierce play of the elements  yet on hannah ran  again and again the lightning hit her but she ran on still  she fell over the stones tripped and stumbled in the ruts butted into the hedges cannoned off against the stone walls  but she never stopped  she went quicker and quicker  the storm was awful lightning fire flame and thunder were all about her  trees were falling hurdles were flying birds were being struck by lightning dogs sheep and even cattle were hurled through the air  she reached the manorhouse and stood a moment at the door  the storm had lulled the rain ceased and for a brief moment there was quiet  the light was streaming from the windows of the house hannah paused  suddenly her heart misgave her  her quick ear had caught the sound of a womans voice within  she approached the window and looked in  then as if rooted to the spot the highland girl gazed and listened at the pane  ian lay upon a sofa  the neglige dressinggown that he wore enhanced the pallid beauty of his face  beside him sat the talcumpowder blonde  she was feeding him with chocolates  hannah understood  ian had trifled with her love  he had bought her lobsters to win her heart only to cast it aside  hannah turned from the window  she plucked the thistle from her throat and flung it on the ground  then as she turned her eye she caught sight of the motor standing in the shed  the deil machine she muttered while the wild light of highland frenzy gathered in her eye then as she rushed to it and tore the tarpaulin from off it yell no be wanting of a mark the night oyster mcshamus she cried  a moment later the motor with hannah at the wheel was thundering down the road to the glen  the power was on to the full and the demented girl clung tight to the steeringgear as the machine rocked and thundered down the descent  the storm was raging again and the thunder mingled with the roar of the machine as it coursed madly towards the sea  the great eye of the motor blazed in front  the lurid light of it flashed a second on the trees and the burn as it passed and flashed blinding on the eyes of oyster as he stood erect on the cliffside below musket in hand and faced the blazing apparition that charged upon him with the old highland blood surging in his veins  it was all over in a momenta blinding flash of lightning the report of a musket a great peal of thunder and the motor bearing the devoted girl hurled headlong over the cliff  they found her there in the morning  she lay on her side motionless half buried in the sand upturned towards the blue highland sky serene now after the passing of the storm  quiet and still she lay  the seabirds seemed to pause in their flight to look down on her  the little group of scotch people that had gathered stood and gazed at her with reverential awe  they made no attempt to put her together  it would have been useless  her gasoline tubes were twisted and bent her tank burst her sprockets broken from their sides and her steeringgear an utter wreck  the motor would never run again  after a time they roused themselves from their grief and looked about for hannah  they found her  she lay among the sand and seaweed her fair hair soaked in gasoline  then they looked about for oyster mcshamus  him too they found lying half buried in the grass and soaked in whisky  then they looked about for ellen  they found her lying across the door of the cottage half buried in jamies breeches  then they gathered them up  life was not extinct  they chafed their hands  they rubbed their feet  they put hot bricks upon their stomachs  they poured hot whisky down their throats  that brought them to  of course  it always does  they all lived  but the feud was done for  that was the end of it  hannah had put it to the bad    viii  soaked in seaweed or upset in the ocean            an oldfashioned sea story   it was in august in 1867 that i stepped on board the deck of the saucy sally lying in dock at gravesend to fill the berth of second mate  let me first say a word about myself  i was a tall handsome young fellow squarely and powerfully built bronzed by the sun and the moon and even coppercoloured in spots from the effect of the stars and with a face in which honesty intelligence and exceptional brain power were combined with christianity simplicity and modesty  as i stepped on the deck i could not help a slight feeling of triumph as i caught sight of my sailorlike features reflected in a tarbarrel that stood beside the mast while a little later i could scarcely repress a sense of gratification as i noticed them reflected again in a bucket of bilge water  welcome on board mr blowhard called out captain bilge stepping out of the binnacle and shaking hands across the taffrail  i saw before me a fine sailorlike man of from thirty to sixty cleanshaven except for an enormous pair of whiskers a heavy beard and a thick moustache powerful in build and carrying his beam well aft in a pair of broad duck trousers across the back of which there would have been room to write a history of the british navy  beside him were the first and third mates both of them being quiet men of poor stature who looked at captain bilge with what seemed to me an apprehensive expression in their eyes  the vessel was on the eve of departure  her deck presented that scene of bustle and alacrity dear to the sailors heart  men were busy nailing up the masts hanging the bowsprit over the side varnishing the leescuppers and pouring hot tar down the companionway  captain bilge with a megaphone to his lips kept calling out to the men in his rough sailor fashion  now then dont overexert yourselves gentlemen  remember please that we have plenty of time  keep out of the sun as much as you can step carefully in the rigging there jones i fear its just a little high for you  tut tut williams dont get yourself so dirty with that tar you wont look fit to be seen  i stood leaning over the gaff of the mainsail and thinkingyes thinking dear reader of my mother  i hope that you will think none the less of me for that  whenever things look dark i lean up against something and think of mother  if they get positively black i stand on one leg and think of father  after that i can face anything  did i think too of another younger than mother and fairer than father  yes i did  bear up darling i had whispered as she nestled her head beneath my oilskins and kicked out backward with one heel in the agony of her girlish grief in five years the voyage will be over and after three more like it i shall come back with money enough to buy a secondhand fishingnet and settle down on shore  meantime the ships preparations were complete  the masts were all in position the sails nailed up and men with axes were busily chopping away the gangway  all ready called the captain  aye aye sir  then hoist the anchor in board and send a man down with the key to open the bar  opening the bar the last sad rite of departure  how often in my voyages have i seen it the little group of men soon to be exiled from their home standing about with saddened faces waiting to see the man with the key open the barheld there by some strange fascination                                                 next morning with a fair wind astern we had buzzed around the corner of england and were running down the channel  i know no finer sight for those who have never seen it than the english channel  it is the highway of the world  ships of all nations are passing up and down dutch scotch venezuelan and even american  chinese junks rush to and fro  warships motor yachts icebergs and lumber rafts are everywhere  if i add to this fact that so thick a fog hangs over it that it is entirely hidden from sight my readers can form some idea of the majesty of the scene                                                 we had now been three days at sea  my first seasickness was wearing off and i thought less of father  on the third morning captain bilge descended to my cabin  mr blowhard he said i must ask you to stand double watches  what is the matter i inquired  the two other mates have fallen overboard he said uneasily and avoiding my eye  i contented myself with saying very good sir but i could not help thinking it a trifle odd that both the mates should have fallen overboard in the same night  surely there was some mystery in this  two mornings later the captain appeared at the breakfasttable with the same shifting and uneasy look in his eye  anything wrong sir i asked  yes he answered trying to appear at ease and twisting a fried egg to and fro between his fingers with such nervous force as almost to break it in twoi regret to say that we have lost the bosun  the bosun i cried  yes said captain bilge more quietly he is overboard  i blame myself for it partly  it was early this morning  i was holding him up in my arms to look at an iceberg and quite accidentally i assure youi dropped him overboard  captain bilge i asked have you taken any steps to recover him  not as yet he replied uneasily  i looked at him fixedly but said nothing  ten days passed  the mystery thickened  on thursday two men of the starboard watch were reported missing  on friday the carpenters assistant disappeared  on the night of saturday a circumstance occurred which slight as it was gave me some clue as to what was happening  as i stood at the wheel about midnight i saw the captain approach in the darkness carrying the cabinboy by the hind leg  the lad was a bright little fellow whose merry disposition had already endeared him to me and i watched with some interest to see what the captain would do to him  arrived at the stern of the vessel captain bilge looked cautiously around a moment and then dropped the boy into the sea  for a brief instant the lads head appeared in the phosphorus of the waves  the captain threw a boot at him sighed deeply and went below  here then was the key to the mystery  the captain was throwing the crew overboard  next morning we met at breakfast as usual  poor little williams has fallen overboard said the captain seizing a strip of ships bacon and tearing at it with his teeth as if he almost meant to eat it  captain i said greatly excited stabbing at a ships loaf in my agitation with such ferocity as almost to drive my knife into it you threw that boy overboard  i did said captain bilge grown suddenly quiet i threw them all over and intend to throw the rest  listen blowhard you are young ambitious and trustworthy  i will confide in you  perfectly calm now he stepped to a locker rummaged in it a moment and drew out a faded piece of yellow parchment which he spread on the table  it was a map or chart  in the centre of it was a circle in the middle of the circle was a small dot and a letter t while at one side of the map was a letter n and against it on the other side a letter s  what is this i asked  can you not guess queried captain bilge  it is a desert island  ah i rejoined with a sudden flash of intuition and n is for north and s is for south  blowhard said the captain striking the table with such force as to cause a loaf of ships bread to bounce up and down three or four times youve struck it  that part of it had not yet occurred to me  and the letter t i asked  the treasure the buried treasure said the captain and turning the map over he read from the back of itthe point t indicates the spot where the treasure is buried under the sand it consists of half a million spanish dollars and is buried in a brown leather dresssuit case  and where is the island i inquired mad with excitement  that i do not know said the captain  i intend to sail up and down the parallels of latitude until i find it  and meantime  meantime the first thing to do is to reduce the number of the crew so as to have fewer hands to divide among  come come he added in a burst of frankness which made me love the man in spite of his shortcomings will you join me in this  well throw them all over keeping the cook to the last dig up the treasure and be rich for the rest of our lives  reader do you blame me if i said yes  i was young ardent ambitious full of bright hopes and boyish enthusiasm  captain bilge i said putting my hand in his i am yours  good he said now go forward to the forecastle and get an idea what the men are thinking  i went forward to the mens quartersa plain room in the front of the ship with only a rough carpet on the floor a few simple armchairs writingdesks spittoons of a plain pattern and small brass beds with blueandgreen screens  it was sunday morning and the men were mostly sitting about in their dressinggowns  they rose as i entered and curtseyed  sir said tompkins the bosuns mate i think it my duty to tell you that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the men  several of the men nodded  they dont like the way the men keep going overboard he continued his voice rising to a tone of uncontrolled passion  it is positively absurd sir and if you will allow me to say so the men are far from pleased  tompkins i said sternly you must understand that my position will not allow me to listen to mutinous language of this sort  i returned to the captain  i think the men mean mutiny i said  good said captain bilge rubbing his hands that will get rid of a lot of them and of course he added musingly looking out of the broad oldfashioned porthole at the stern of the cabin at the heaving waves of the south atlantic i am expecting pirates at any time and that will take out quite a few of them  howeverand here he pressed the bell for a cabinboykindly ask mr tompkins to step this way  tompkins said the captain as the bosuns mate entered be good enough to stand on the locker and stick your head through the stern porthole and tell me what you think of the weather  aye aye sir replied the tar with a simplicity which caused us to exchange a quiet smile  tompkins stood on the locker and put his head and shoulders out of the port  taking a leg each we pushed him through  we heard him plump into the sea  tompkins was easy said captain bilge  excuse me as i enter his death in the log  yes he continued presently it will be a great help if they mutiny  i suppose they will sooner or later  its customary to do so  but i shall take no step to precipitate it until we have first fallen in with pirates  i am expecting them in these latitudes at any time  meantime mr blowhard he said rising if you can continue to drop overboard one or two more each week i shall feel extremely grateful  three days later we rounded the cape of good hope and entered upon the inky waters of the indian ocean  our course lay now in zigzags and the weather being favourable we sailed up and down at a furious rate over a sea as calm as glass  on the fourth day a pirate ship appeared  reader i do not know if you have ever seen a pirate ship  the sight was one to appal the stoutest heart  the entire ship was painted black a black flag hung at the masthead the sails were black and on the deck people dressed all in black walked up and down arminarm  the words pirate ship were painted in white letters on the bow  at the sight of it our crew were visibly cowed  it was a spectacle that would have cowed a dog  the two ships were brought side by side  they were then lashed tightly together with bag string and binder twine and a gang plank laid between them  in a moment the pirates swarmed upon our deck rolling their eyes gnashing their teeth and filing their nails  then the fight began  it lasted two hourswith fifteen minutes off for lunch  it was awful  the men grappled with one another kicked one another from behind slapped one another across the face and in many cases completely lost their temper and tried to bite one another i noticed one gigantic fellow brandishing a knotted towel and striking right and left among our men until captain bilge rushed at him and struck him flat across the mouth with a banana skin  at the end of two hours by mutual consent the fight was declared a draw  the points standing at sixtyone and a half against sixtytwo  the ships were unlashed and with three cheers from each crew were headed on their way  now then said the captain to me aside let us see how many of the crew are sufficiently exhausted to be thrown overboard  he went below  in a few minutes he reappeared his face deadly pale blowhard he said the ship is sinking  one of the pirates sheer accident of course i blame no one has kicked a hole in the side let us sound the well  we put our ear to the ships well  it sounded like water  the men were put to the pumps and worked with the frenzied effort which only those who have been drowned in a sinking ship can understand  at six pm the well marked one half an inch of water at nightfall threequarters of an inch and at daybreak after a night of unremitting toil seveneighths of an inch  by noon of the next day the water had risen to fifteensixteenths of an inch and on the next night the sounding showed thirtyone thirtyseconds of an inch of water in the hold  the situation was desperate  at this rate of increase few if any could tell where it would rise to in a few days  that night the captain called me to his cabin  he had a book of mathematical tables in front of him and great sheets of vulgar fractions littered the floor on all sides  the ship is bound to sink he said in fact blowhard she is sinking  i can prove it  it may be six months or it may take years but if she goes on like this sink she must  there is nothing for it but to abandon her  that night in the dead of darkness while the crew were busy at the pumps the captain and i built a raft  unobserved we cut down the masts chopped them into suitable lengths laid them crosswise in a pile and lashed them tightly together with bootlaces  hastily we threw on board a couple of boxes of food and bottles of drinking fluid a sextant a cronometer a gasmeter a bicycle pump and a few other scientific instruments  then taking advantage of a roll in the motion of the ship we launched the raft lowered ourselves upon a line and under cover of the heavy dark of a tropical night we paddled away from the doomed vessel  the break of day found us a tiny speck on the indian ocean  we looked about as big as this   in the morning after dressing and shaving as best we could we opened our box of food and drink  then came the awful horror of our situation  one by one the captain took from the box the square blue tins of canned beef which it contained  we counted fiftytwo in all anxiously and with drawn faces we watched until the last can was lifted from the box  a single thought was in our minds  when the end came the captain stood up on the raft with wild eyes staring at the sky  the canopener he shrieked just heaven the canopener  he fell prostrate  meantime with trembling hands i opened the box of bottles  it contained lager beer bottles each with a patent tin top  one by one i took them out  there were fiftytwo in all  as i withdrew the last one and saw the empty box before me i shroke outthe thing the thing oh merciful heaven  the thing you open them with  i fell prostrate upon the captain  we awoke to find ourselves still a mere speck upon the ocean we felt even smaller than before  over us was the burnished copper sky of the tropics  the heavy leaden sea lapped the sides of the raft  all about us was a litter of corn beef cans and lager beer bottles  our sufferings in the ensuing days were indescribable  we beat and thumped at the cans with our fists  even at the risk of spoiling the tins for ever we hammered them fiercely against the raft  we stamped on them bit at them and swore at them  we pulled and clawed at the bottles with our hands and chipped and knocked them against the cans regardless even of breaking the glass and ruining the bottles  it was futile  then day after day we sat in moody silence gnawed with hunger with nothing to read nothing to smoke and practically nothing to talk about  on the tenth day the captain broke silence  get ready the lots blowhard he said  its got to come to that  yes i answered drearily were getting thinner every day  then with the awful prospect of cannibalism before us we drew lots  i prepared the lots and held them to the captain  he drew the longer one  which does that mean he asked trembling between hope and despair do i win  no bilge i said sadly you lose                                                 but i mustnt dwell on the days that followedthe long quiet days of lazy dreaming on the raft during which i slowly built up my strength which had been shattered by privation  they were days dear reader of deep and quiet peace and yet i cannot recall them without shedding a tear for the brave man who made them what they were  it was on the fifth day after that i was awakened from a sound sleep by the bumping of the raft against the shore  i had eaten perhaps overheartily and had not observed the vicinity of land  before me was an island the circular shape of which with its low sandy shore recalled at once its identity  the treasure island i cried at last i am rewarded for all my heroism  in a fever of haste i rushed to the centre of the island  what was the sight that confronted me  a great hollow scooped in the sand an empty dresssuit case lying beside it and on a ships plank driven deep into the sand the legend saucy sally october 1867  so the miscreants had made good the vessel headed it for the island of whose existence they must have learned from the chart we so carelessly left upon the cabin table and had plundered poor bilge and me of our wellearned treasure  sick with the sense of human ingratitude i sank upon the sand  the island became my home  there i eked out a miserable existence feeding on sand and gravel and dressing myself in cactus plants  years passed  eating sand and mud slowly undermined my robust constitution  i fell ill  i died i buried myself  would that others who write sea stories would do as much    ix  carolines christmas or the inexplicable infant   it was xmasxmas with its mantle of white snow scintillating from a thousand diamond points xmas with its good cheer its peace on earthxmas with its feasting and merriment xmas with itswell anyway it was xmas  or no thats a slight slip it wasnt exactly xmas it was xmas eve xmas eve with its mantle of white snow lying beneath the calm moonlightand in fact with practically the above list of accompanying circumstances with a few obvious emendations  yes it was xmas eve  and more than that  listen to where it was xmas  it was xmas eve on the old homestead  reader do you know by sight the old homestead  in the pauses of your work at your city desk where you have grown rich and avaricious does it never rise before your minds eye the quiet old homestead that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away from it  the old homestead that stands beside the road just on the rise of the hill with its dark spruce trees wrapped in snow the snug barns and the straw stacks behind it while from its windows there streams a shaft of light from a coaloil lamp about as thick as a slate pencil that you can see four miles away from the other side of the cedar swamp in the hollow  dont talk to me of your modern searchlights and your incandescent arcs beside that gleam of light from the coaloil lamp in the farmhouse window  it will shine clear to the heart across thirty years of distance  do you not turn i say sometimes reader from the roar and hustle of the city with its illgotten wealth and its godless creed of mammon to think of the quiet homestead under the brow of the hill  you dont  well you skunk  it was xmas eve  the light shone from the windows of the homestead farm  the light of the log fire rose and flickered and mingled its red glare on the windows with the calm yellow of the lamplight  john enderby and his wife sat in the kitchen room of the farmstead do you know it reader the room called the kitchenwith the open fire on its old brick hearth and the cook stove in the corner  it is the room of the farm where people cook and eat and live  it is the livingroom  the only other room beside the bedroom is the small room in front chillcold in winter with an organ in it for playing rock of ages on when company came  but this room is only used for music and funerals  the real room of the old farm is the kitchen does it not rise up before you reader  it doesnt  well you darn fool  at any rate there sat old john enderby beside the plain deal table his head bowed upon his hands his grizzled face with its unshorn stubble stricken down with the lines of devastating trouble  from time to time he rose and cast a fresh stick of tamarack into the fire with a savage thud that sent a shower of sparks up the chimney across the fireplace sat his wife anna on a straightbacked chair looking into the fire with the mute resignation of her sex  what was wrong with them anyway  ah reader can you ask  do you know or remember so little of the life of the old homestead  when i have said that it is the old homestead and xmas eve and that the farmer is in great trouble and throwing tamarack at the fire surely you ought to guess  the old homestead was mortgaged  ten years ago reckless with debt crazed with remorse mad with despair and persecuted with rheumatism john enderby had mortgaged his farmstead for twentyfour dollars and thirty cents  tonight the mortgage fell due tonight at midnight xmas night such is the way in which mortgages of this kind are always drawn yes sir it was drawn with such diabolical skill that on this night of all nights the mortgage would be foreclosed  at midnight the men would come with hammer and nails and foreclose it nail it up tight  so the afflicted couple sat  anna with the patient resignation of her sex sat silent or at times endeavoured to read  she had taken down from the little wallshelf bunyans holy living and holy dying  she tried to read it  she could not  then she had taken dantes inferno  she could not read it  then she had selected kants critique of pure reason  but she could not read it either  lastly she had taken the farmers almanac for 1911  the books lay littered about her as she sat in patient despair  john enderby showed all the passion of an uncontrolled nature  at times he would reach out for the crock of buttermilk that stood beside him and drained a draught of the maddening liquid till his brain glowed like the coals of the tamarack fire before him  john pleaded anna leave alone the buttermilk  it only maddens you no good ever came of that  aye lass said the farmer with a bitter laugh as he buried his head again in the crock what care i if it maddens me  ah john youd better be employed in reading the good book than in your wild courses  here take it father and read itand she handed to him the wellworn black volume from the shelf  enderby paused a moment and held the volume in his hand  he and his wife had known nothing of religious teaching in the public schools of their day but the firstclass nonsectarian education that the farmer had received had stood him in good stead  take the book she said  read john in this hour of affliction it brings comfort  the farmer took from her hand the wellworn copy of euclids elements and laying aside his hat with reverence he read aloud the angles at the base of an isoceles triangle are equal and whosoever shall produce the sides lo the same also shall be equal each unto each  the farmer put the book aside  its no use anna  i cant read the good words tonight  he rose staggered to the crock of buttermilk and before his wife could stay his hand drained it to the last drop  then he sank heavily to his chair  let them foreclose it if they will he said i am past caring  the woman looked sadly into the fire  ah if only her son henry had been here  henry who had left them three years agone and whose bright letters still brought from time to time the gleam of hope to the stricken farmhouse  henry was in sing sing  his letters brought news to his mother of his steady success first in the baseball nine of the prison a favourite with his wardens and the chaplain the best bridge player of the corridor  henry was pushing his way to the front with the oldtime spirit of the enderbys  his mother had hoped that he might have been with her at xmas but henry had written that it was practically impossible for him to leave sing sing  he could not see his way out  the authorities were arranging a dance and sleighing party for the xmas celebration he had some hope he said of slipping away unnoticed but his doing so might excite attention  of the trouble at home anna had told her son nothing  no henry could not come  there was no help there  and william the other son ten years older than henry  alas william had gone forth from the homestead to fight his way in the great city mother he had said when i make a million dollars ill come home  till then goodbye and he had gone  how annas heart had beat for him  would he make that million dollars  would she ever live to see it  and as the years passed she and john had often sat in the evenings picturing william at home again bringing with him a million dollars or picturing the million dollars sent by express with love  but the years had passed  william came not  he did not come  the great city had swallowed him up as it has many another lad from the old homestead  anna started from her musing  what was that at the door  the sound of a soft and timid rapping and through the glass of the doorpane a face a womans face looking into the firelit room with pleading eyes  what was it she bore in her arms the little bundle that she held tight to her breast to shield it from the falling snow  can you guess reader try three guesses and see  right you are  thats what it was  the farmers wife went hastily to the door  lords mercy she cried what are you doing out on such a night come in child to the fire  the woman entered carrying the little bundle with her and looking with wide eyes they were at least an inch and a half across at enderby and his wife  anna could see that there was no weddingring on her hand  your name said the farmers wife  my name is caroline the girl whispered  the rest was lost in the low tones of her voice  i want shelter she paused i want you to take the child  anna took the baby and laid it carefully on the top shelf of the cupboard then she hastened to bring a glass of water and a doughnut and set it before the halffrozen girl  eat she said and warm yourself  john rose from his seat  ill have no child of that sort here he said  john john pleaded anna remember what the good book says things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another  john sank back in his chair  and why had caroline no weddingring  ah reader can you not guess  well you cant  it wasnt what you think at all so there caroline had no weddingring because she had thrown it away in bitterness as she tramped the streets of the great city  why she cried should the wife of a man in the penitentiary wear a ring  then she had gone forth with the child from what had been her home  it was the old sad story  she had taken the baby and laid it tenderly gently on a seat in the park  then she walked rapidly away  a few minutes after a man had chased after caroline with the little bundle in his arms  i beg your pardon he said panting i think you left your baby in the park  caroline thanked him  next she took the baby to the grand central waitingroom kissed it tenderly and laid it on a shelf behind the lunchcounter  a few minutes an official beaming with satisfaction had brought it back to her  yours i think madame he said as he handed it to her  caroline thanked him  then she had left it at the desk of the waldorf astoria and at the ticketoffice of the subway  it always came back  once or twice she took it to the brooklyn bridge and threw it into the river but perhaps something in the way it fell through the air touched the mothers heart and smote her and she had descended to the river and fished it out  then caroline had taken the child to the country  at first she thought to leave it on the wayside and she had put it down in the snow and standing a little distance off had thrown mullein stalks at it but something in the way the little bundle lay covered in the snow appealed to the mothers heart  she picked it up and went on  somewhere she murmured i shall find a door of kindness open to it  soon after she had staggered into the homestead  anna with true womans kindness asked no questions  she put the baby carefully away in a trunk saw caroline safely to bed in the best room and returned to her seat by the fire  the old clock struck twenty minutes past eight  again a knock sounded at the door  there entered the familiar figure of the village lawyer  his astrachan coat of yellow dogskin his celluloid collar and boots which reached no higher than the ankle contrasted with the rude surroundings of the little room  enderby he said can you pay  lawyer perkins said the farmer give me time and i will so help me give me five years more and ill clear this debt to the last cent  john said the lawyer touched in spite of his rough dogskin exterior i couldnt if i would  these things are not what they were  its a big new york corporation pinchem  company that makes these loans now and they take their money on the day or they sell you up  i cant help it  so theres your notice john and i am sorry no ill take no buttermilk i must keep a clear head to work and with that he hurried out into the snow again  john sat brooding in his chair  the fire flickered down  the old clock struck halfpast eight then it half struck a quarter to nine then slowly it struck striking  presently enderby rose picked a lantern from its hook mortgage or no mortgage he said i must see to the stock  he passed out of the house and standing in the yard looked over the snow to the cedar swamp beyond with the snow winding through it far in the distance the lights of the village far away  he thought of the forty years he had spent here on the homesteadthe rude pioneer daysthe house he had built for himself with its plain furniture the oldfashioned spinningwheel on which anna had spun his trousers the wooden telephone and the rude skidway on which he ate his meals  he looked out over the swamp and sighed  down in the swamp two miles away could he have but seen it there moved a sleigh and in it a man dressed in a sealskin coat and silk hat whose face beamed in the moonlight as he turned to and fro and stared at each object by the roadside as at an old familiar scene round his waist was a belt containing a million dollars in gold coin and as he halted his horse in an opening of the road he unstrapped the belt and counted the coins  beside him there crouched in the bushes at the dark edge of the swamp road with eyes that watched every glitter of the coins and a hand that grasped a heavy cudgel of blackthorn a man whose closecropped hair and hard lined face belonged nowhere but within the walls of sing sing  when the sleigh started again the man in the bushes followed doggedly in its track  meanwhile john enderby had made the rounds of his outbuildings  he bedded the fat cattle that blinked in the flashing light of the lantern  he stood a moment among his hogs and farmer as he was forgot his troubles a moment to speak to each calling them by name it smote him to think how at times he had been tempted to sell one of the hogs or even to sell the cattle to clear the mortgage off the place  thank god however he had put that temptation behind him  as he reached the house a sleigh was standing on the roadway  anna met him at the door  john she said there was a stranger came while you were in the barn and wanted a lodging for the night a city man i reckon by his clothes  i hated to refuse him and i put him in willies room  well never want it again and hes gone to sleep  ay we cant refuse  john enderby took out the horse to the barn and then returned to his vigil with anna beside the fire  the fumes of the buttermilk had died out of his brain  he was thinking as he sat there of midnight and what it would bring  in the room above the man in the sealskin coat had thrown himself down clothes and all upon the bed tired with his drive  how it all comes back to me he muttered as he fell asleep the same old room nothing changedexcept themhow worn they look and a tear started to his eyes  he thought of his leaving his home fifteen years ago of his struggle in the great city of the great idea he had conceived of making money and of the farm investment company he had institutedthe simple system of applying the crushing power of capital to exact the uttermost penny from the farm loans  and now here he was back again true to his word with a million dollars in his belt  tomorrow he had murmured i will tell them  it will be xmas  then williamyes reader it was william see line 503 above had fallen asleep  the hours passed and kept passing  it was 1130  then suddenly anna started from her place  henry she cried as the door opened and a man entered  he advanced gladly to meet her and in a moment mother and son were folded in a close embrace  it was henry the man from sing sing true to his word he had slipped away unostentatiously at the height of the festivities  alas henry said the mother after the warmth of the first greetings had passed you come at an unlucky hour  they told him of the mortgage on the farm and the ruin of his home  yes said anna not even a bed to offer you and she spoke of the strangers who had arrived of the stricken woman and the child and the rich man in the sealskin coat who had asked for a nights shelter  henry listened intently while they told him of the man and a sudden light of intelligence flashed into his eye  by heaven father i have it he cried  then dropping his voice he said speak low father  this man upstairs he had a sealskin coat and silk hat  yes said the father  father said henry i saw a man sitting in a sleigh in the cedar swamp  he had money in his hand and he counted it and chuckledfive dollar gold piecesin all 1125465 dollars and a quarter  the father and son looked at one another  i see your idea said enderby sternly  well choke him said henry  or club him said the farmer and pay the mortgage  anna looked from one to the other joy and hope struggling with the sorrow in her face  henry my henry she said proudly i knew he would find a way  come on said henry bring the lamp mother take the club father and gaily but with hushed voices the three stole up the stairs  the stranger lay sunk in sleep  the back of his head was turned to them as they came in  now mother said the farmer firmly hold the lamp a little nearer just behind the ear i think henry  no said henry rolling back his sleeve and speaking with the quick authority that sat well upon him across the jaw father its quicker and neater  well well said the farmer smiling proudly have your own way lad you know best  henry raised the club  but as he did sostay what was that  far away behind the cedar swamp the deep booming of the bell of the village church began to strike out midnight  one two three its tones came clear across the crisp air  almost at the same moment the clock below began with deep strokes to mark the midnight hour from the farmyard chicken coop a rooster began to crow twelve times while the loud lowing of the cattle and the soft cooing of the hogs seemed to usher in the morning of christmas with its message of peace and goodwill  the club fell from henrys hand and rattled on the floor  the sleeper woke and sat up  father  mother he cried  my son my son sobbed the father we had guessed it was you we had come to wake you  yes it is i said william smiling to his parents and i have brought the million dollars  here it is and with that he unstrapped the belt from his waist and laid a million dollars on the table  thank heaven cried anna our troubles are at an end  this money will help clear the mortgageand the greed of pinchem  co cannot harm us now  the farm was mortgaged said william aghast  ay said the farmer mortgaged to men who have no conscience whose greedy hand has nearly brought us to the grave  see how she has aged my boy and he pointed to anna  father said william in deep tones of contrition i am pinchem  co  heaven help me  i see it now  i see at what expense of suffering my fortune was made  i will restore it all these million dollars to those i have wronged  no said his mother softly  you repent dear son with true christian repentance  that is enough  you may keep the money we will look upon it as a trust a sacred trust and every time we spend a dollar of it on ourselves we will think of it as a trust  yes said the farmer softly your mother is right the money is a trust and we will restock the farm with it buy out the joness property and regard the whole thing as a trust  at this moment the door of the room opened  a womans form appeared  it was caroline robed in one of annas directoire nightgowns  i heard your voices she said and then as she caught sight of henry she gave a great cry  my husband  my wife said henry and folded her to his heart  you have left sing sing cried caroline with joy  yes caroline said henry  i shall never go back  gaily the reunited family descended  anna carried the lamp henry carried the club  william carried the million dollars  the tamarack fire roared again upon the hearth  the buttermilk circulated from hand to hand  william and henry told and retold the story of their adventures  the first streak of the christmas morn fell through the doorpane  ah my sons said john enderby henceforth let us stick to the narrow path  what is it that the good book says a straight line is that which lies evenly between its extreme points    x  the man in asbestos an allegory of the future   to begin with let me admit that i did it on purpose  perhaps it was partly from jealousy  it seemed unfair that other writers should be able at will to drop into a sleep of four or five hundred years and to plunge headfirst into a distant future and be a witness of its marvels  i wanted to do that too  i always had been i still am a passionate student of social problems the world of today with its roaring machinery the unceasing toil of its working classes its strife its poverty its war its cruelty appals me as i look at it  i love to think of the time that must come some day when man will have conquered nature and the toilworn human race enter upon an era of peace  i loved to think of it and i longed to see it  so i set about the thing deliberately  what i wanted to do was to fall asleep after the customary fashion for two or three hundred years at least and wake and find myself in the marvel world of the future  i made my preparations for the sleep  i bought all the comic papers that i could find even the illustrated ones  i carried them up to my room in my hotel with them i brought up a pork pie and dozens and dozens of doughnuts  i ate the pie and the doughnuts then sat back in the bed and read the comic papers one after the other  finally as i felt the awful lethargy stealing upon me i reached out my hand for the london weekly times and held up the editorial page before my eye  it was in a way clear straight suicide but i did it  i could feel my senses leaving me  in the room across the hall there was a man singing  his voice that had been loud came fainter and fainter through the transom  i fell into a sleep the deep immeasurable sleep in which the very existence of the outer world was hushed  dimly i could feel the days go past then the years and then the long passage of the centuries  then not as it were gradually but quite suddenly i woke up sat up and looked about me  where was i  well might i ask myself  i found myself lying or rather sitting up on a broad couch  i was in a great room dim gloomy and dilapidated in its general appearance and apparently from its glass cases and the stuffed figures that they contained some kind of museum  beside me sat a man  his face was hairless but neither old nor young  he wore clothes that looked like the grey ashes of paper that had burned and kept its shape  he was looking at me quietly but with no particular surprise or interest  quick i said eager to begin where am i  who are you  what year is this is it the year 3000 or what is it  he drew in his breath with a look of annoyance on his face  what a queer excited way you have of speaking he said  tell me i said again is this the year 3000  i think i know what you mean he said but really i havent the faintest idea  i should think it must be at least that within a hundred years or so but nobody has kept track of them for so long its hard to say  dont you keep track of them any more i gasped  we used to said the man  i myself can remember that a century or two ago there were still a number of people who used to try to keep track of the year but it died out along with so many other faddish things of that kind  why he continued showing for the first time a sort of animation in his talk what was the use of it you see after we eliminated death  eliminated death i cried sitting upright  good god  what was that expression you used queried the man  good god i repeated  ah he said never heard it before  but i was saying that after we had eliminated death and food and change we had practically got rid of events and  stop i said my brain reeling  tell me one thing at a time  humph he ejaculated  i see you must have been asleep a long time go on then and ask questions  only if you dont mind just as few as possible and please dont get interested or excited  oddly enough the first question that sprang to my lips was  what are those clothes made of  asbestos answered the man  they last hundreds of years  we have one suit each and there are billions of them piled up if anybody wants a new one  thank you i answered  now tell me where i am  you are in a museum  the figures in the cases are specimens like yourself  but here he said if you want really to find out about what is evidently a new epoch to you get off your platform and come out on broadway and sit on a bench  i got down  as we passed through the dim and dustcovered buildings i looked curiously at the figures in the cases  by jove i said looking at one figure in blue clothes with a belt and baton thats a policeman  really said my new acquaintance is that what a policeman was  ive often wondered  what used they to be used for  used for i repeated in perplexity  why they stood at the corner of the street  ah yes i see he said so as to shoot at the people  you must excuse my ignorance he continued as to some of your social customs in the past  when i took my education i was operated upon for social history but the stuff they used was very inferior  i didnt in the least understand what the man meant but had no time to question him for at that moment we came out upon the street and i stood riveted in astonishment  broadway  was it possible  the change was absolutely appalling in place of the roaring thoroughfare that i had known this silent mossgrown desolation  great buildings fallen into ruin through the sheer stress of centuries of wind and weather the sides of them coated over with a growth of fungus and moss  the place was soundless  not a vehicle moved  there were no wires overheadno sound of life or movement except here and there there passed slowly to and fro human figures dressed in the same asbestos clothes as my acquaintance with the same hairless faces and the same look of infinite age upon them  good heavens and was this the era of the conquest that i had hoped to see  i had always taken for granted i do not know why that humanity was destined to move forward  this picture of what seemed desolation on the ruins of our civilisation rendered me almost speechless  there were little benches placed here and there on the street  we sat down  improved isnt it said man in asbestos since the days when you remember it  he seemed to speak quite proudly  i gasped out a question  where are the street cars and the motors  oh done away with long ago he said how awful they must have been the noise of them and his asbestos clothes rustled with a shudder  but how do you get about  we dont he answered  why should we  its just the same being here as being anywhere else  he looked at me with an infinity of dreariness in his face  a thousand questions surged into my mind at once  i asked one of the simplest  but how do you get back and forwards to your work  work he said  there isnt any work  its finished  the last of it was all done centuries ago  i looked at him a moment openmouthed  then i turned and looked again at the grey desolation of the street with the asbestos figures moving here and there  i tried to pull my senses together  i realised that if i was to unravel this new and undreamedof future i must go at it systematically and step by step  i see i said after a pause that momentous things have happened since my time  i wish you would let me ask you about it all systematically and would explain it to me bit by bit  first what do you mean by saying that there is no work  why answered my strange acquaintance it died out of itself machinery killed it  if i remember rightly you had a certain amount of machinery even in your time  you had done very well with steam made a good beginning with electricity though i think radial energy had hardly as yet been put to use  i nodded assent  but you found it did you no good  the better your machines the harder you worked  the more things you had the more you wanted  the pace of life grew swifter and swifter  you cried out but it would not stop  you were all caught in the cogs of your own machine  none of you could see the end  that is quite true i said  how do you know it all  oh answered the man in asbestos that part of my education was very well operatedi see you do not know what i mean  never mind i can tell you that later  well then there came probably almost two hundred years after your time the era of the great conquest of nature the final victory of man and machinery  they did conquer it i asked quickly with a thrill of the old hope in my veins again  conquered it he said beat it out  fought it to a standstill things came one by one then faster and faster in a hundred years it was all done  in fact just as soon as mankind turned its energy to decreasing its needs instead of increasing its desires the whole thing was easy  chemical food came first  heavens the simplicity of it  and in your time thousands of millions of people tilled and grubbed at the soil from morning till night  ive seen specimens of themfarmers they called them  theres one in the museum  after the invention of chemical food we piled up enough in the emporiums in a year to last for centuries  agriculture went overboard eating and all that goes with it domestic labour houseworkall ended nowadays one takes a concentrated pill every year or so thats all the whole digestive apparatus as you knew it was a clumsy thing that had been bloated up like a set of bagpipes through the evolution of its use  i could not forbear to interrupt  have you and these people i said no stomachsno apparatus  of course we have he answered but we use it to some purpose mine is largely filled with my educationbut there  i am anticipating again  better let me go on as i was  chemical food came first that cut off almost onethird of the work and then came asbestos clothes  that was wonderful  in one year humanity made enough suits to last for ever and ever  that of course could never have been if it hadnt been connected with the revolt of women and the fall of fashion  have the fashions gone i asked that insane extravagant idea of i was about to launch into one of my oldtime harangues about the sheer vanity of decorative dress when my eye rested on the moving figures in asbestos and i stopped  all gone said the man in asbestos  then next to that we killed or practically killed the changes of climate  i dont think that in your day you properly understood how much of your work was due to the shifts of what you called the weather  it meant the need of all kinds of special clothes and houses and shelters a wilderness of work  how dreadful it must have been in your daywind and storms great wet masseswhat did you call themcloudsflying through the air the ocean full of salt was it nottossed and torn by the wind snow thrown all over everything hail rainhow awful  sometimes i said it was very beautiful  but how did you alter it  killed the weather answered the man in asbestos  simple as anythingturned its forces loose one against the other altered the composition of the sea so that the top became all more or less gelatinous  i really cant explain it as it is an operation that i never took at school but it made the sky grey as you see it and the sea gumcoloured the weather all the same  it cut out fuel and houses and an infinity of work with them  he paused a moment  i began to realise something of the course of evolution that had happened  so i said the conquest of nature meant that presently there was no more work to do  exactly he said nothing left  food enough for all  too much he answered  houses and clothes  all you like said the man in asbestos waving his hand  there they are  go out and take them  of course theyre falling down slowly very slowly  but theyll last for centuries yet nobody need bother  then i realised i think for the first time just what work had meant in the old life and how much of the texture of life itself had been bound up in the keen effort of it  presently my eyes looked upward dangling at the top of a mossgrown building i saw what seemed to be the remains of telephone wires  what became of all that i said the telegraph and the telephone and all the system of communication  ah said the man in asbestos that was what a telephone meant was it  i knew that it had been suppressed centuries ago  just what was it for  why i said with enthusiasm by means of the telephone we could talk to anybody call up anybody and talk at any distance  and anybody could call you up at any time and talk said the man in asbestos with something like horror  how awful  what a dreadful age yours was to be sure  no the telephone and all the rest of it all the transportation and intercommunication was cut out and forbidden  there was no sense in it  you see he added what you dont realise is that people after your day became gradually more and more reasonable  take the railroad what good was that  it brought into every town a lot of people from every other town  who wanted them  nobody  when work stopped and commerce ended and food was needless and the weather killed it was foolish to move about  so it was all terminated  anyway he said with a quick look of apprehension and a change in his voice it was dangerous  so i said  dangerous  you still have danger  why yes he said theres always the danger of getting broken  what do you mean i asked  why said the man in asbestos i suppose its what you would call being dead  of course in one sense theres been no death for centuries past we cut that out  disease and death were simply a matter of germs  we found them one by one  i think that even in your day you had found one or two of the easier the bigger ones  i nodded  yes you had found diphtheria and typhoid and if i am right there were some outstanding like scarlet fever and smallpox that you called ultramicroscopic and which you were still hunting for and others that you didnt even suspect  well we hunted them down one by one and destroyed them  strange that it never occurred to any of you that old age was only a germ  it turned out to be quite a simple one but it was so distributed in its action that you never even thought of it  and you mean to say i ejaculated in amazement looking at the man in asbestos that nowadays you live for ever  i wish he said that you hadnt that peculiar excitable way of talking you speak as if everything mattered so tremendously yes he continued we live for ever unless of course we get broken  that happens sometimes  i mean that we may fall over a high place or bump on something and snap ourselves  you see were just a little brittle stillsome remnant i suppose of the old age germand we have to be careful  in fact he continued i dont mind saying that accidents of this sort were the most distressing feature of our civilisation till we took steps to cut out all accidents  we forbid all street cars street traffic aeroplanes and so on  the risks of your time he said with a shiver of his asbestos clothes must have been awful  they were i answered with a new kind of pride in my generation that i had never felt before but we thought it part of the duty of brave people to  yes yes said the man in asbestos impatiently please dont get excited  i know what you mean  it was quite irrational  we sat silent for a long time  i looked about me at the crumbling buildings the monotone unchanging sky and the dreary empty street here then was the fruit of the conquest here was the elimination of work the end of hunger and of cold the cessation of the hard struggle the downfall of change and deathnay the very millennium of happiness  and yet somehow there seemed something wrong with it all i pondered then i put two or three rapid questions hardly waiting to reflect upon the answers  is there any war now  done with centuries ago  they took to settling international disputes with a slot machine  after that all foreign dealings were given up why have them  everybody thinks foreigners awful  are there any newspapers now  newspapers  what on earth would we want them for  if we should need them at any time there are thousands of old ones piled up  but what is in them anyway only things that happen wars and accidents and work and death  when these went newspapers went too  listen continued the man in asbestos you seem to have been something of a social reformer and yet you dont understand the new life at all  you dont understand how completely all our burdens have disappeared  look at it this way  how used your people to spend all the early part of their lives  why i said our first fifteen years or so were spent in getting education  exactly he answered now notice how we improved on all that education in our day is done by surgery  strange that in your time nobody realised that education was simply a surgical operation  you hadnt the sense to see that what you really did was to slowly remodel curve and convolute the inside of the brain by a long and painful mental operation  everything learned was reproduced in a physical difference to the brain  you knew that but you didnt see the full consequences  then came the invention of surgical educationthe simple system of opening the side of the skull and engrafting into it a piece of prepared brain  at first of course they had to use i suppose the brains of dead people and that was ghastlyhere the man in asbestos shuddered like a leafbut very soon they found how to make moulds that did just as well  after that it was a mere nothing an operation of a few minutes would suffice to let in poetry or foreign languages or history or anything else that one cared to have  here for instance he added pushing back the hair at the side of his head and showing a scar beneath it is the mark where i had my spherical trigonometry let in  that was i admit rather painful but other things such as english poetry or history can be inserted absolutely without the least suffering when i think of your painful barbarous methods of education through the ear i shudder at it  oddly enough we have found lately that for a great many things there is no need to use the head  we lodge themthings like philosophy and metaphysics and so onin what used to be the digestive apparatus  they fill it admirably  he paused a moment  then went on  well then to continue what used to occupy your time and effort after your education  why i said one had of course to work and then to tell the truth a great part of ones time and feeling was devoted toward the other sex towards falling in love and finding some woman to share ones life  ah said the man in asbestos with real interest  ive heard about your arrangements with the women but never quite understood them tell me you say you selected some woman  yes  and she became what you called your wife  yes of course  and you worked for her asked the man in asbestos in astonishment  yes  and she did not work  no i answered of course not  and half of what you had was hers  yes  and she had the right to live in your house and use your things  of course i answered  how dreadful said the man in asbestos  i hadnt realised the horrors of your age till now  he sat shivering slightly with the same timid look in his face as before  then it suddenly struck me that of the figures on the street all had looked alike  tell me i said are there no women now  are they gone too  oh no answered the man in asbestos theyre here just the same some of those are women  only you see everything has been changed now  it all came as part of their great revolt their desire to be like the men  had that begun in your time  only a little i answered they were beginning to ask for votes and equality  thats it said my acquaintance i couldnt think of the word your women i believe were something awful were they not  covered with feathers and skins and dazzling colours made of dead things all over them and they laughed did they not and had foolish teeth and at any moment they could inveigle you into one of those contracts ugh  he shuddered  asbestos i said i knew no other name to call him as i turned on him in wrath asbestos do you think that those jellybag equalities out on the street there with their ashbarrel suits can be compared for one moment with our unredeemed unreformed heavencreated hobbleskirted women of the twentieth century  then suddenly another thought flashed into my mind  the children i said where are the children  are there any  children he said no  i have never heard of there being any such things for at least a century  horrible little hobgoblins they must have been  great big faces and cried constantly  and grew did they not  like funguses  i believe they were longer each year than they had been the last and  i rose  asbestos i said this then is your coming civilisation your millennium  this dull dead thing with the work and the burden gone out of life and with them all the joy and sweetness of it  for the old strugglemere stagnation and in place of danger and death the dull monotony of security and the horror of an unending decay  give me back i cried and i flung wide my arms to the dull air the old life of danger and stress with its hard toil and its bitter chances and its heartbreaks  i see its value  i know its worth  give me no rest i cried aloud                                                 yes but give a rest to the rest of the corridor cried an angered voice that broke in upon my exultation  suddenly my sleep had gone  i was back again in the room of my hotel with the hum of the wicked busy old world all about me and loud in my ears the voice of the indignant man across the corridor  quit your blatting you infernal blatherskite he was calling come down to earth  i came                                  the end
