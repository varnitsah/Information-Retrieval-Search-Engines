introduction to a legend of montrose  the legend of montrose was written chiefly with a view to place before the reader the melancholy fate of john lord kilpont eldest son of william earl of airth and menteith and the singular circumstances attending the birth and history of james stewart of ardvoirlich by whose hand the unfortunate nobleman fell  our subject leads us to talk of deadly feuds and we must begin with one still more ancient than that to which our story relates during the reign of james iv a great feud between the powerful families of drummond and murray divided perthshire the former being the most numerous and powerful cooped up eight score of the murrays in the kirk of monivaird and set fire to it the wives and the children of the illfated men who had also found shelter in the church perished by the same conflagration one man named david murray escaped by the humanity of one of the drummonds who received him in his arms as he leaped from amongst the flames as king james iv ruled with more activity than most of his predecessors this cruel deed was severely revenged and several of the perpetrators were beheaded at stirling in consequence of the prosecution against his clan the drummond by whose assistance david murray had escaped fled to ireland until by means of the person whose life he had saved he was permitted to return to scotland where he and his descendants were distinguished by the name of drummondeirinich or ernoch that is drummond of ireland and the same title was bestowed on their estate  the drummondernoch of james the sixths time was a kings forester in the forest of glenartney and chanced to be employed there in search of venison about the year 1588 or early in 1589 this forest was adjacent to the chief haunts of the macgregors or a particular race of them known by the title of maceagh or children of the mist they considered the foresters hunting in their vicinity as an aggression or perhaps they had him at feud for the apprehension or slaughter of some of their own name or for some similar reason this tribe of macgregors were outlawed and persecuted as the reader may see in the introduction to rob roy and every mans hand being against them their hand was of course directed against every man in short they surprised and slew drummondernoch cut off his head and carried it with them wrapt in the corner of one of their plaids  in the full exultation of vengeance they stopped at the house of ardvoirlich and demanded refreshment which the lady a sister of the murdered drummondernoch her husband being absent was afraid or unwilling to refuse she caused bread and cheese to be placed before them and gave directions for more substantial refreshments to be prepared while she was absent with this hospitable intention the barbarians placed the head of her brother on the table filling the mouth with bread and cheese and bidding him eat for many a merry meal he had eaten in that house  the poor woman returning and beholding this dreadful sight shrieked aloud and fled into the woods where as described in the romance she roamed a raving maniac and for some time secreted herself from all living society some remaining instinctive feeling brought her at length to steal a glance from a distance at the maidens while they milked the cows which being observed her husband ardvoirlich had her conveyed back to her home and detained her there till she gave birth to a child of whom she had been pregnant after which she was observed gradually to recover her mental faculties  meanwhile the outlaws had carried to the utmost their insults against the regal authority which indeed as exercised they had little reason for respecting they bore the same bloody trophy which they had so savagely exhibited to the lady of ardvoirlich into the old church of balquidder nearly in the centre of their country where the laird of macgregor and all his clan being convened for the purpose laid their hands successively on the dead mans head and swore in heathenish and barbarous manner to defend the author of the deed this fierce and vindictive combination gave the authors late and lamented friend sir alexander boswell bart subject for a spirited poem entitled clanalpins vow which was printed but not i believe published in 1811 see appendix no i  the fact is ascertained by a proclamation from the privy council dated 4th february 1589 directing letters of fire and sword against the macgregors see appendix no ii this fearful commission was executed with uncommon fury the late excellent john buchanan of cambusmore showed the author some correspondence between his ancestor the laird of buchanan and lord drummond about sweeping certain valleys with their followers on a fixed time and rendezvous and taking sweet revenge for the death of their cousin drummondernoch in spite of all however that could be done the devoted tribe of macgregor still bred up survivors to sustain and to inflict new cruelties and injuries  i embrace the opportunity given me by a second mention of this tribe to notice an error which imputes to an individual named ciar mohr macgregor the slaughter of the students at the battle of glenfruin i am informed from the authority of john gregorson esq that the chieftain so named was dead nearly a century before the battle in question and could not therefore have done the cruel action mentioned the mistake does not rest with me as i disclaimed being responsible for the tradition while i quoted it but with vulgar fame which is always disposed to ascribe remarkable actions to a remarkable namesee the erroneous passage rob roy introduction and so soft sleep the offended phantom of dugald ciar mohr  it is with mingled pleasure and shame that i record the more important error of having announced as deceased my learned acquaintance the rev dr grahame minister of aberfoilsee rob roy p360 i cannot now recollect the precise ground of my depriving my learned and excellent friend of his existence unless like mr kirke his predecessor in the parish the excellent doctor had made a short trip to fairyland with whose wonders he is so well acquainted but however i may have been misled my regret is most sincere for having spread such a rumour and no one can be more gratified than i that the report however i have been induced to credit and give it currency is a false one and that dr grahame is still the living pastor of aberfoil for the delight and instruction of his brother antiquaries  meanwhile young james stewart of ardvoirlich grew up to manhood uncommonly tall strong and active with such power in the grasp of his hand in particular as could force the blood from beneath the nails of the persons who contended with him in this feat of strength his temper was moody fierce and irascible yet he must have had some ostensible good qualities as he was greatly beloved by lord kilpont the eldest son of the earl of airth and menteith  this gallant young nobleman joined montrose in the setting up his standard in 1644 just before the decisive battle at tippermuir on the 1st september in that year at that time stewart of ardvoirlich shared the confidence of the young lord by day and his bed by night when about four or five days after the battle ardvoirlich either from a fit of sudden fury or deep malice long entertained against his unsuspecting friend stabbed lord kilpont to the heart and escaped from the camp of montrose having killed a sentinel who attempted to detain him bishop guthrie gives us a reason for this villainous action that lord kilpont had rejected with abhorrence a proposal of ardvoirlich to assassinate montrose but it does not appear that there is any authority for this charge which rests on mere suspicion ardvoirlich the assassin certainly did fly to the covenanters and was employed and promoted by them he obtained a pardon for the slaughter of lord kilpont confirmed by parliament in 1634 and was made major of argyles regiment in 1648 such are the facts of the tale here given as a legend of montroses wars the reader will find they are considerably altered in the fictitious narrative  the author has endeavoured to enliven the tragedy of the tale by the introduction of a personage proper to the time and country in this he has been held by excellent judges to have been in some degree successful the contempt of commerce entertained by young men having some pretence to gentility the poverty of the country of scotland the national disposition to wandering and to adventure all conduced to lead the scots abroad into the military service of countries which were at war with each other they were distinguished on the continent by their bravery but in adopting the trade of mercenary soldiers they necessarily injured their national character the tincture of learning which most of them possessed degenerated into pedantry their good breeding became mere ceremonial their fear of dishonour no longer kept them aloof from that which was really unworthy but was made to depend on certain punctilious observances totally apart from that which was in itself deserving of praise a cavalier of honour in search of his fortune might for example change his service as he would his shirt fight like the doughty captain dalgetty in one cause after another without regard to the justice of the quarrel and might plunder the peasantry subjected to him by the fate of war with the most unrelenting rapacity but he must beware how he sustained the slightest reproach even from a clergyman if it had regard to neglect on the score of duty the following occurrence will prove the truth of what i mean  here i must not forget the memory of one preacher master william forbesse a preacher for souldiers yea and a captaine in neede to leade souldiers on a good occasion being full of courage with discretion and good conduct beyond some captaines i have knowne that were not so capable as he at this time he not onely prayed for us but went on with us to remarke as i thinke mens carriage and having found a sergeant neglecting his dutie and his honour at such a time whose name i will not expresse having chidden him did promise to reveale him unto me as he did after their service the sergeant being called before me and accused did deny his accusation alleaging if he were no pasteur that had alleaged it he would not lie under the injury the preacher offered to fight with him in proof that it was truth he had spoken of him whereupon i cashiered the sergeant and gave his place to a worthier called mungo gray a gentleman of good worth and of much courage the sergeant being cashiered never called master william to account for which he was evill thought of so that he retired home and quit the warres  the above quotation is taken from a work which the author repeatedly consulted while composing the following sheets and which is in great measure written in the humour of captain dugald dalgetty it bears the following formidable titlemonro his expedition with the worthy scots regiment called mackeyes regiment levied in august 1626 by sir donald mackeye lord rees colonel for his majesties service of denmark and reduced after the battle of nerling in september 1634 at wormes in the palz discharged in several duties and observations of service first under the magnanimous king of denmark during his wars against the empire afterwards under the invincible king of sweden during his majesties lifetime and since under the directorgeneral the rexchancellor oxensterne and his generals collected and gathered together at spare hours by colonel robert monro as first lieutenant under the said regiment to the noble and worthy captain thomas mackenzie of kildon brother to the noble lord the lord earl of seaforth for the use of all noble cavaliers favouring the laudable profession of arms to which is annexed the abridgement of exercise and divers practical observations for the younger officer his consideration ending with the soldiers meditations on going on servicelondon 1637  another worthy of the same school and nearly the same views of the military character is sir james turner a soldier of fortune who rose to considerable rank in the reign of charles ii had a command in galloway and dumfriesshire for the suppression of conventicles and was made prisoner by the insurgent covenanters in that rising which was followed by the battle of pentland sir james is a person even of superior pretensions to lieutenantcolonel monro having written a military treatise on the pikeexercise called pallas armata moreover he was educated at glasgow college though he escaped to become an ensign in the german wars instead of taking his degree of master of arts at that learned seminary  in latter times he was author of several discourses on historical and literary subjects from which the bannatyne club have extracted and printed such passages as concern his life and times under the title of sir james turners memoirs from this curious book i extract the following passage as an example of how captain dalgetty might have recorded such an incident had he kept a journal or to give it a more just character it is such as the genius of de foe would have devised to give the minute and distinguishing features of truth to a fictitious narrative  heere i will set doun ane accident befell me for thogh it was not a very strange one yet it was a very od one in all its parts my tuo brigads lay in a village within halfe a mile of applebie my own quarter was in a gentlemans house ho was a ritmaster and at that time with sir marmaduke his wife keepd her chamber readie to be brought to bed the castle being over and lambert farre enough i resolved to goe to bed everie night haveing had fatigue enough before the first night i sleepd well enough and riseing nixt morning i misd one linnen stockine one halfe silke one and one boothose the accoustrement under a boote for one leg neither could they be found for any search being provided of more of the same kind i made myselfe reddie and rode to the headquarters at my returne i could heare no news of my stockins that night i went to bed and nixt morning found myselfe just so used missing the three stockins for one leg onlie the other three being left intire as they were the day before a narrower search then the first was made bot without successe i had yet in reserve one paire of whole stockings and a paire of boothose greater then the former these i put on my legs the third morning i found the same usage the stockins for one leg onlie left me it was time for me then and my servants too to imagine it must be rats that had shard my stockins so inequallie with me and this the mistress of the house knew well enough but would not tell it me the roome which was a low parlour being well searched with candles the top of my great boothose was found at a hole in which they had drawne all the rest i went abroad and ordered the boards to be raised to see how the rats had disposed of my moveables the mistress sent a servant of her oune to be present at this action which she knew concerned her one board being bot a litle opend a litle boy of mine thrust in his hand and fetchd with him foure and tuentie old peeces of gold and one angell the servant of the house affirmed it appertained to his mistres the boy bringing the gold to me i went immediatlie to the gentlewomans chamber and told her it was probable lambert haveing quarterd in that house as indeed he had some of his servants might have hid that gold and if so it was lawfullie mine bot if she could make it appeare it belongd to her i should immediatlie give it her the poore gentlewoman told me with many teares that her husband being none of the frugallest men and indeed he was a spendthrift she had hid that gold without his knowledge to make use of it as she had occasion especiallie when she lay in and conjured me as i lovd the king for whom her husband and she had suffered much not to detaine her gold she said if there was either more or lesse then foure and tuentie whole peeces and two halfe ones it sould be none of hers and that they were put by her in a red velvet purse after i had given her assureance of her gold a new search is made the other angell is found the velvet purse all gnawd in bits as my stockins were and the gold instantlie restord to the gentlewoman i have often heard that the eating or gnawing of cloths by rats is ominous and portends some mischance to fall on those to whom the cloths belong i thank god i was never addicted to such divinations or heeded them it is true that more misfortunes then one fell on me shortlie after bot i am sure i could have better forseene them myselfe then rats or any such vermine and yet did it not i have heard indeed many fine stories told of rats how they abandon houses and ships when the first are to be burnt and the second dround naturalists say they are very sagacious creatures and i beleeve they are so bot i shall never be of the opinion they can forsee future contingencies which i suppose the divell himselfe can neither forknow nor fortell these being things which the almightie hath keepd hidden in the bosome of his divine prescience and whither the great god hath preordained or predestinated these things which to us are contingent to fall out by ane uncontrollable and unavoidable necessitie is a question not yet decided sir james turners memoirs bannatyne edition p 59  in quoting these ancient authorities i must not forget the more modern sketch of a scottish soldier of the old fashion by a masterhand in the character of lesmahagow since the existence of that doughty captain alone must deprive the present author of all claim to absolute originality still dalgetty as the production of his own fancy has been so far a favourite with its parent that he has fallen into the error of assigning to the captain too prominent a part in the story this is the opinion of a critic who encamps on the highest pinnacles of literature and the author is so far fortunate in having incurred his censure that it gives his modesty a decent apology for quoting the praise which it would have illbefited him to bring forward in an unmingled state the passage occurs in the edinburgh review no 55 containing a criticism on ivanhoe  there is too much perhaps of dalgettyor rather he engrosses too great a proportion of the workfor in himself we think he is uniformly entertainingand the author has nowhere shown more affinity to that matchless spirit who could bring out his falstaffs and his pistols in act after act and play after play and exercise them every time with scenes of unbounded loquacity without either exhausting their humour or varying a note from its characteristic tone than in his large and reiterated specimens of the eloquence of the redoubted rittmaster the general idea of the character is familiar to our comic dramatists after the restorationand may be said in some measure to be compounded of captain fluellen and bobadilbut the ludicrous combination of the soldado with the divinity student of mareschalcollege is entirely original and the mixture of talent selfishness courage coarseness and conceit was never so happily exemplified numerous as his speeches are there is not one that is not characteristicand to our taste divertingly ludicrous   postscript  while these pages were passing through the press the author received a letter from the present robert stewart of ardvoirlich favouring him with the account of the unhappy slaughter of lord kilpont differing from and more probable than that given by bishop wishart whose narrative infers either insanity or the blackest treachery on the part of james stewart of ardvoirlich the ancestor of the present family of that name it is but fair to give the entire communication as received from my respected correspondent which is more minute than the histories of the period  although i have not the honour of being personally known to you i hope you will excuse the liberty i now take in addressing you on the subject of a transaction more than once alluded to by you in which an ancestor of mine was unhappily concerned i allude to the slaughter of lord kilpont son of the earl of airth and monteith in 1644 by james stewart of ardvoirlich as the cause of this unhappy event and the quarrel which led to it have never been correctly stated in any history of the period in which it took place i am induced in consequence of your having in the second series of your admirable tales on the history of scotland adopted wisharts version of the transaction and being aware that your having done so will stamp it with an authenticity which it does not merit and with a view as far as possible to do justice to the memory of my unfortunate ancestor to send you the account of this affair as it has been handed down in the family  james stewart of ardvoirlich who lived in the early part of the 17th century and who was the unlucky cause of the slaughter of lord kilpont as before mentioned was appointed to the command of one of several independent companies raised in the highlands at the commencement of the troubles in the reign of charles i another of these companies was under the command of lord kilpont and a strong intimacy strengthened by a distant relationship subsisted between them when montrose raised the royal standard ardvoirlich was one of the first to declare for him and is said to have been a principal means of bringing over lord kilpont to the same cause and they accordingly along with sir john drummond and their respective followers joined montrose as recorded by wishart at buchanty while they served together so strong was their intimacy that they lived and slept in the same tent  in the meantime montrose had been joined by the irish under the command of alexander macdonald these on their march to join montrose had committed some excesses on lands belonging to ardvoirlich which lay in the line of their march from the west coast of this ardvoirlich complained to montrose who probably wishing as much as possible to conciliate his new allies treated it in rather an evasive manner ardvoirlich who was a man of violent passions having failed to receive such satisfaction as he required challenged macdonald to single combat before they met however montrose on the information and by advice as it is said of kilpont laid them both under arrest montrose seeing the evils of such a feud at such a critical time effected a sort of reconciliation between them and forced them to shake hands in his presence when it was said that ardvoirlich who was a very powerful man took such a hold of macdonalds hand as to make the blood start from his fingers still it would appear ardvoirlich was by no means reconciled  a few days after the battle of tippermuir when montrose with his army was encamped at collace an entertainment was given by him to his officers in honour of the victory he had obtained and kilpont and his comrade ardvoirlich were of the party after returning to their quarters ardvoirlich who seemed still to brood over his quarrel with macdonald and being heated with drink began to blame lord kilpont for the part he had taken in preventing his obtaining redress and reflecting against montrose for not allowing him what he considered proper reparation kilpont of course defended the conduct of himself and his relative montrose till their argument came to high words and finally from the state they were both in by an easy transition to blows when ardvoirlich with his dirk struck kilpont dead on the spot he immediately fled and under the cover of a thick mist escaped pursuit leaving his eldest son henry who had been mortally wounded at tippermuir on his deathbed  his followers immediately withdrew from montrose and no course remained for him but to throw himself into the arms of the opposite faction by whom he was well received his name is frequently mentioned in leslies campaigns and on more than one occasion he is mentioned as having afforded protection to several of his former friends through his interest with leslie when the kings cause became desperate  the foregoing account of this unfortunate transaction i am well aware differs materially from the account given by wishart who alleges that stewart had laid a plot for the assassination of montrose and that he murdered lord kilpont in consequence of his refusal to participate in his design now i may be allowed to remark that besides wishart having always been regarded as a partial historian and very questionable authority on any subject connected with the motives or conduct of those who differed from him in opinion that even had stewart formed such a design kilpont from his name and connexions was likely to be the very last man of whom stewart would choose to make a confidant and accomplice on the other hand the above account though never that i am aware before hinted at has been a constant tradition in the family and from the comparative recent date of the transaction and the sources from which the tradition has been derived i have no reason to doubt its perfect authenticity it was most circumstantially detailed as above given to my father mr stewart now of ardvoirlich many years ago by a man nearly connected with the family who lived to the age of 100 this man was a greatgrandson of james stewart by a natural son john of whom many stories are still current in this country under his appellation of john dhu mhor this john was with his father at the time and of course was a witness of the whole transaction he lived till a considerable time after the revolution and it was from him that my fathers informant who was a man before his grandfather john dhu mhors death received the information as above stated  i have many apologies to offer for trespassing so long on your patience but i felt a natural desire if possible to correct what i conceive to be a groundless imputation on the memory of my ancestor before it shall come to be considered as a matter of history that he was a man of violent passions and singular temper i do not pretend to deny as many traditions still current in this country amply verify but that he was capable of forming a design to assassinate montrose the whole tenor of his former conduct and principles contradict that he was obliged to join the opposite party was merely a matter of safety while kilpont had so many powerful friends and connexions able and ready to avenge his death  i have only to add that you have my full permission to make what use of this communication you please and either to reject it altogether or allow it such credit as you think it deserves and i shall be ready at all times to furnish you with any further information on this subject which you may require and which it may be in my power to afford  ardvoirlich 15th january 1830  the publication of a statement so particular and probably so correct is a debt due to the memory of james stewart the victim it would seem of his own violent passions but perhaps incapable of an act of premeditated treachery  abbotsford 1st august 1830     ii introduction supplement  sergeant more malpin was during his residence among us one of the most honoured inhabitants of gandercleugh no one thought of disputing his title to the great leathern chair on the cosiest side of the chimney in the common room of the wallace arms on a saturday evening no less would our sexton john duirward have held it an unlicensed intrusion to suffer any one to induct himself into the corner of the lefthand pew nearest to the pulpit which the sergeant regularly occupied on sundays there he sat his blue invalid uniform brushed with the most scrupulous accuracy two medals of merit displayed at his buttonhole as well as the empty sleeve which should have been occupied by his right arm bore evidence of his hard and honourable service his weatherbeaten features his grey hair tied in a thin queue in the military fashion of former days and the right side of his head a little turned up the better to catch the sound of the clergymans voice were all marks of his profession and infirmities beside him sat his sister janet a little neat old woman with a highland curch and tartan plaid watching the very looks of her brother to her the greatest man upon earth and actively looking out for him in his silverclasped bible the texts which the minister quoted or expounded  i believe it was the respect that was universally paid to this worthy veteran by all ranks in gandercleugh which induced him to choose our village for his residence for such was by no means his original intention  he had risen to the rank of sergeantmajor of artillery by hard service in various quarters of the world and was reckoned one of the most tried and trusty men of the scotch train a ball which shattered his arm in a peninsular campaign at length procured him an honourable discharge with an allowance from chelsea and a handsome gratuity from the patriotic fund moreover sergeant more malpin had been prudent as well as valiant and from prizemoney and savings had become master of a small sum in the three per cent consols  he retired with the purpose of enjoying this income in the wild highland glen in which when a boy he had herded black cattle and goats ere the roll of the drum had made him cock his bonnet an inch higher and follow its music for nearly forty years to his recollection this retired spot was unparalleled in beauty by the richest scenes he had visited in his wanderings even the happy valley of rasselas would have sunk into nothing upon the comparison he camehe revisited the loved scene it was but a sterile glen surrounded with rude crags and traversed by a northern torrent this was not the worst the fires had been quenched upon thirty hearthsof the cottage of his fathers he could but distinguish a few rude stonesthe language was almost extinguishedthe ancient race from which he boasted his descent had found a refuge beyond the atlantic one southland farmer three greyplaided shepherds and six dogs now tenanted the whole glen which in his youth had maintained in content if not in competence upwards of two hundred inhabitants  in the house of the new tenant sergeant malpin found however an unexpected source of pleasure and a means of employing his social affections his sister janet had fortunately entertained so strong a persuasion that her brother would one day return that she had refused to accompany her kinsfolk upon their emigration nay she had consented though not without a feeling of degradation to take service with the intruding lowlander who though a saxon she said had proved a kind man to her this unexpected meeting with his sister seemed a cure for all the disappointments which it had been sergeant mores lot to encounter although it was not without a reluctant tear that he heard told as a highland woman alone could ten it the story of the expatriation of his kinsmen  she narrated at great length the vain offers they had made of advanced rent the payment of which must have reduced them to the extremity of poverty which they were yet contented to face for permission to live and die on their native soil nor did janet forget the portents which had announced the departure of the celtic race and the arrival of the strangers for two years previous to the emigration when the night wind howled dawn the pass of balachra its notes were distinctly modelled to the tune of ha til mi tulidh we return no more with which the emigrants usually bid farewell to their native shores the uncouth cries of the southland shepherds and the barking of their dogs were often heard in the midst of the hills long before their actual arrival a bard the last of his race had commemorated the expulsion of the natives of the glen in a tune which brought tears into the aged eyes of the veteran and of which the first stanza may be thus rendered       woe woe son of the lowlander      why wilt thou leave thine own bonny border      why comes thou hither disturbing the highlander      wasting the glen that was once in fair order  what added to sergeant more malpins distress upon the occasion was that the chief by whom this change had been effected was by tradition and common opinion held to represent the ancient leaders and fathers of the expelled fugitives and it had hitherto been one of sergeant mores principal subjects of pride to prove by genealogical deduction in what degree of kindred he stood to this personage a woful change was now wrought in his sentiments towards him  i cannot curse him he said as he rose and strode through the room when janets narrative was finishedi will not curse him he is the descendant and representative of my fathers but never shall mortal man hear me name his name again and he kept his word for until his dying day no man heard him mention his selfish and hardhearted chieftain  after giving a day to sad recollections the hardy spirit which had carried him through so many dangers manned the sergeants bosom against this cruel disappointment he would go he said to canada to his kinsfolk where they had named a transatlantic valley after the glen of their fathers janet he said should kilt her coats like a leaguer lady dn the distance it was a fleas leap to the voyages and marches he had made on a slighter occasion  with this purpose he left the highlands and came with his sister as far as gandercleugh on his way to glasgow to take a passage to canada but winter was now set in and as he thought it advisable to wait for a spring passage when the st lawrence should be open he settled among us for the few months of his stay in britain as we said before the respectable old man met with deference and attention from all ranks of society and when spring returned he was so satisfied with his quarters that he did not renew the purpose of his voyage janet was afraid of the sea and he himself felt the infirmities of age and hard service more than he had at first expected and as he confessed to the clergyman and my worthy principal mr cleishbotham it was better staying with kend friends than going farther and faring worse  he therefore established himself and his domicile at gandercleugh to the great satisfaction as we have already said of all its inhabitants to whom he became in respect of military intelligence and able commentaries upon the newspapers gazettes and bulletins a very oracle explanatory of all martial events past present or to come  it is true the sergeant had his inconsistencies he was a steady jacobite his father and his four uncles having been out in the fortyfive but he was a no less steady adherent of king george in whose service he had made his little fortune and lost three brothers so that you were in equal danger to displease him in terming prince charles the pretender or by saying anything derogatory to the dignity of king george further it must not be denied that when the day of receiving his dividends came round the sergeant was apt to tarry longer at the wallace arms of an evening than was consistent with strict temperance or indeed with his worldly interest for upon these occasions his compotators sometimes contrived to flatter his partialities by singing jacobite songs and drinking confusion to bonaparte and the health of the duke of wellington until the sergeant was not only flattered into paying the whole reckoning but occasionally induced to lend small sums to his interested companions after such sprays as he called them were over and his temper once more cool he seldom failed to thank god and the duke of york who had made it much more difficult for an old soldier to ruin himself by his folly than had been the case in his younger days  it was not on such occasions that i made a part of sergeant more malpins society but often when my leisure would permit i used to seek him on what he called his morning and evening parade on which when the weather was fair he appeared as regularly as if summoned by tuck of drum his morning walk was beneath the elms in the churchyard for death he said had been his nextdoor neighbour for so many years that he had no apology for dropping the acquaintance his evening promenade was on the bleachinggreen by the riverside where he was sometimes to be seen on an open bench with spectacles on nose conning over the newspapers to a circle of village politicians explaining military terms and aiding the comprehension of his hearers by lines drawn on the ground with the end of his rattan on other occasions he was surrounded by a bevy of schoolboys whom he sometimes drilled to the manual and sometimes with less approbation on the part of their parents instructed in the mystery of artificial fireworks for in the case of public rejoicings the sergeant was pyrotechnist as the encyclopedia calls it to the village of gandercleugh  it was in his morning walk that i most frequently met with the veteran and i can hardly yet look upon the village footpath overshadowed by the row of lofty elms without thinking i see his upright form advancing towards me with measured step and his cane advanced ready to pay me the military salutebut he is dead and sleeps with his faithful janet under the third of those very trees counting from the stile at the west corner of the churchyard  the delight which i had in sergeant malpins conversation related not only to his own adventures of which he had encountered many in the course of a wandering life but also to his recollection of numerous highland traditions in which his youth had been instructed by his parents and of which he would in after life have deemed it a kind of heresy to question the authenticity many of these belonged to the wars of montrose in which some of the sergeants ancestry had it seems taken a distinguished part it has happened that although these civil commotions reflect the highest honour upon the highlanders being indeed the first occasion upon which they showed themselves superior or even equal to their lowcountry neighbours in military encounters they have been less commemorated among them than any one would have expected judging from the abundance of traditions which they have preserved upon less interesting subjects it was therefore with great pleasure that i extracted from my military friend some curious particulars respecting that time they are mixed with that measure of the wild and wonderful which belongs to the period and the narrator but which i do not in the least object to the readers treating with disbelief providing he will be so good as to give implicit credit to the natural events of the story which like all those which i have had the honour to put under his notice actually rest upon a basis of truth     iii a legend of montrose     chapter i       such as do build their faith upon      the holy text of pike and gun      decide all controversies by      infallible artillery      and prove their doctrine orthodox      by apostolic blows and knocksbutler  it was during the period of that great and bloody civil war which agitated britain during the seventeenth century that our tale has its commencement scotland had as yet remained free from the ravages of intestine war although its inhabitants were much divided in political opinions and many of them tired of the control of the estates of parliament and disapproving of the bold measure which they had adopted by sending into england a large army to the assistance of the parliament were determined on their part to embrace the earliest opportunity of declaring for the king and making such a diversion as should at least compel the recall of general leslies army out of england if it did not recover a great part of scotland to the kings allegiance this plan was chiefly adopted by the northern nobility who had resisted with great obstinacy the adoption of the solemn league and covenant and by many of the chiefs of the highland clans who conceived their interest and authority to be connected with royalty who had besides a decided aversion to the presbyterian form of religion and who finally were in that half savage state of society in which war is always more welcome than peace  great commotions were generally expected to arise from these concurrent causes and the trade of incursion and depredation which the scotch highlanders at all times exercised upon the lowlands began to assume a more steady avowed and systematic form as part of a general military system  those at the head of affairs were not insensible to the peril of the moment and anxiously made preparations to meet and to repel it they considered however with satisfaction that no leader or name of consequence had as yet appeared to assemble an army of royalists or even to direct the efforts of those desultory bands whom love of plunder perhaps as much as political principle had hurried into measures of hostility it was generally hoped that the quartering a sufficient number of troops in the lowlands adjacent to the highland line would have the effect of restraining the mountain chieftains while the power of various barons in the north who had espoused the covenant as for example the earl mareschal the great families of forbes leslie and irvine the grants and other presbyterian clans might counterbalance and bridle not only the strength of the ogilvies and other cavaliers of angus and kincardine but even the potent family of the gordons whose extensive authority was only equalled by their extreme dislike to the presbyterian model  in the west highlands the ruling party numbered many enemies but the power of these disaffected clans was supposed to be broken and the spirit of their chieftains intimidated by the predominating influence of the marquis of argyle upon whom the confidence of the convention of estates was reposed with the utmost security and whose power in the highlands already exorbitant had been still farther increased by concessions extorted from the king at the last pacification it was indeed well known that argyle was a man rather of political enterprise than personal courage and better calculated to manage an intrigue of state than to control the tribes of hostile mountaineers yet the numbers of his clan and the spirit of the gallant gentlemen by whom it was led might it was supposed atone for the personal deficiencies of their chief and as the campbells had already severely humbled several of the neighbouring tribes it was supposed these would not readily again provoke an encounter with a body so powerful  thus having at their command the whole west and south of scotland indisputably the richest part of the kingdomfifeshire being in a peculiar manner their own and possessing many and powerful friends even north of the forth and taythe scottish convention of estates saw no danger sufficient to induce them to alter the line of policy they had adopted or to recall from the assistance of their brethren of the english parliament that auxiliary army of twenty thousand men by means of which accession of strength the kings party had been reduced to the defensive when in full career of triumph and success  the causes which moved the convention of estates at this time to take such an immediate and active interest in the civil war of england are detailed in our historians but may be here shortly recapitulated they had indeed no new injury or aggression to complain of at the hand of the king and the peace which had been made between charles and his subjects of scotland had been carefully observed but the scottish rulers were well aware that this peace had been extorted from the king as well by the influence of the parliamentary party in england as by the terror of their own arms it is true king charles had since then visited the capital of his ancient kingdom had assented to the new organization of the church and had distributed honours and rewards among the leaders of the party which had shown themselves most hostile to his interests but it was suspected that distinctions so unwillingly conferred would be resumed as soon as opportunity offered the low state of the english parliament was seen in scotland with deep apprehension and it was concluded that should charles triumph by force of arms against his insurgent subjects of england he would not be long in exacting from the scotch the vengeance which he might suppose due to those who had set the example of taking up arms against him such was the policy of the measure which dictated the sending the auxiliary army into england and it was avowed in a manifesto explanatory of their reasons for giving this timely and important aid to the english parliament the english parliament they said had been already friendly to them and might be so again whereas the king although he had so lately established religion among them according to their desires had given them no ground to confide in his royal declaration seeing they had found his promises and actions inconsistent with each other our conscience they concluded and god who is greater than our conscience beareth us record that we aim altogether at the glory of god peace of both nations and honour of the king in suppressing and punishing in a legal way those who are the troublers of israel the firebrands of hell the korahs the balaams the doegs the rabshakehs the hamans the tobiahs the sanballats of our time which done we are satisfied neither have we begun to use a military expedition to england as a mean for compassing those our pious ends until all other means which we could think upon have failed us and this alone is left to us ultimum et unicum remedium the last and only remedy  leaving it to casuists to determine whether one contracting party is justified in breaking a solemn treaty upon the suspicion that in certain future contingencies it might be infringed by the other we shall proceed to mention two other circumstances that had at least equal influence with the scottish rulers and nation with any doubts which they entertained of the kings good faith  the first of these was the nature and condition of their army headed by a poor and discontented nobility under whom it was officered chiefly by scottish soldiers of fortune who had served in the german wars until they had lost almost all distinction of political principle and even of country in the adoption of the mercenary faith that a soldiers principal duty was fidelity to the state or sovereign from whom he received his pay without respect either to the justice of the quarrel or to their own connexion with either of the contending parties to men of this stamp grotius applies the severe characternullum vitae genus et improbius quam eorum qui sine causae respectu mercede conducti militant to these mercenary soldiers as well as to the needy gentry with whom they were mixed in command and who easily imbibed the same opinions the success of the late short invasion of england in 1641 was a sufficient reason for renewing so profitable an experiment the good pay and free quarters of england had made a feeling impression upon the recollection of these military adventurers and the prospect of again levying eight hundred and fifty pounds aday came in place of all arguments whether of state or of morality  another cause inflamed the minds of the nation at large no less than the tempting prospect of the wealth of england animated the soldiery so much had been written and said on either side concerning the form of church government that it had become a matter of infinitely more consequence in the eyes of the multitude than the doctrines of that gospel which both churches had embraced the prelatists and presbyterians of the more violent kind became as illiberal as the papists and would scarcely allow the possibility of salvation beyond the pale of their respective churches it was in vain remarked to these zealots that had the author of our holy religion considered any peculiar form of church government as essential to salvation it would have been revealed with the same precision as under the old testament dispensation both parties continued as violent as if they could have pleaded the distinct commands of heaven to justify their intolerance laud in the days of his domination had fired the train by attempting to impose upon the scottish people church ceremonies foreign to their habits and opinions the success with which this had been resisted and the presbyterian model substituted in its place had endeared the latter to the nation as the cause in which they had triumphed the solemn league and covenant adopted with such zeal by the greater part of the kingdom and by them forced at the swords point upon the others bore in its bosom as its principal object the establishing the doctrine and discipline of the presbyterian church and the putting down all error and heresy and having attained for their own country an establishment of this golden candlestick the scots became liberally and fraternally anxious to erect the same in england this they conceived might be easily attained by lending to the parliament the effectual assistance of the scottish forces the presbyterians a numerous and powerful party in the english parliament had hitherto taken the lead in opposition to the king while the independents and other sectaries who afterwards under cromwell resumed the power of the sword and overset the presbyterian model both in scotland and england were as yet contented to lurk under the shelter of the wealthier and more powerful party the prospect of bringing to a uniformity the kingdoms of england and scotland in discipline and worship seemed therefore as fair as it was desirable  the celebrated sir henry vane one of the commissioners who negotiated the alliance betwixt england and scotland saw the influence which this bait had upon the spirits of those with whom he dealt and although himself a violent independent he contrived at once to gratify and to elude the eager desires of the presbyterians by qualifying the obligation to reform the church of england as a change to be executed according to the word of god and the best reformed churches deceived by their own eagerness themselves entertaining no doubts on the jus divinum of their own ecclesiastical establishments and not holding it possible such doubts could be adopted by others the convention of estates and the kirk of scotland conceived that such expressions necessarily inferred the establishment of presbytery nor were they undeceived until when their help was no longer needful the sectaries gave them to understand that the phrase might be as well applied to independency or any other mode of worship which those who were at the head of affairs at the time might consider as agreeable to the word of god and the practice of the reformed churches neither were the outwitted scottish less astonished to find that the designs of the english sectaries struck against the monarchial constitution of britain it having been their intention to reduce the power of the king but by no means to abrogate the office they fared however in this respect like rash physicians who commence by overphysicking a patient until he is reduced to a state of weakness from which cordials are afterwards unable to recover him  but these events were still in the womb of futurity as yet the scottish parliament held their engagement with england consistent with justice prudence and piety and their military undertaking seemed to succeed to their very wish the junction of the scottish army with those of fairfax and manchester enabled the parliamentary forces to besiege york and to fight the desperate action of longmarston moor in which prince rupert and the marquis of newcastle were defeated the scottish auxiliaries indeed had less of the glory of this victory than their countrymen could desire david leslie with their cavalry fought bravely and to them as well as to cromwells brigade of independents the honour of the day belonged but the old earl of leven the covenanting general was driven out of the field by the impetuous charge of prince rupert and was thirty miles distant in full flight towards scotland when he was overtaken by the news that his party had gained a complete victory  the absence of these auxiliary troops upon this crusade for the establishment of presbyterianism in england had considerably diminished the power of the convention of estates in scotland and had given rise to those agitations among the anticovenanters which we have noticed at the beginning of this chapter    chapter ii       his mother could for him as cradle set      her husbands rusty iron corselet      whose jangling sound could hush her babe to rest      that never plaind of his uneasy nest      then did he dream of dreary wars at hand      and woke and fought and won ere he could standhalls satires  it was towards the close of a summers evening during the anxious period which we have commemorated that a young gentleman of quality well mounted and armed and accompanied by two servants one of whom led a sumpter horse rode slowly up one of those steep passes by which the highlands are accessible from the lowlands of perthshire the beautiful pass of leny near callander in monteith would in some respects answer this description their course had lain for some time along the banks of a lake whose deep waters reflected the crimson beams of the western sun the broken path which they pursued with some difficulty was in some places shaded by ancient birches and oaktrees and in others overhung by fragments of huge rock elsewhere the hill which formed the northern side of this beautiful sheet of water arose in steep but less precipitous acclivity and was arrayed in heath of the darkest purple in the present times a scene so romantic would have been judged to possess the highest charms for the traveller but those who journey in days of doubt and dread pay little attention to picturesque scenery  the master kept as often as the wood permitted abreast of one or both of his domestics and seemed earnestly to converse with them probably because the distinctions of rank are readily set aside among those who are made to be sharers of common danger the dispositions of the leading men who inhabit this wild country and the probability of their taking part in the political convulsions that were soon expected were the subjects of their conversation  they had not advanced above half way up the lake and the young gentleman was pointing to his attendants the spot where their intended road turned northwards and leaving the verge of the loch ascended a ravine to the right hand when they discovered a single horseman coming down the shore as if to meet them the gleam of the sunbeams upon his headpiece and corslet showed that he was in armour and the purpose of the other travellers required that he should not pass unquestioned we must know who he is said the young gentleman and whither he is going and putting spurs to his horse he rode forward as fast as the rugged state of the road would permit followed by his two attendants until he reached the point where the pass along the side of the lake was intersected by that which descended from the ravine securing thus against the possibility of the stranger eluding them by turning into the latter road before they came up with him  the single horseman had mended his pace when he first observed the three riders advance rapidly towards him but when he saw them halt and form a front which completely occupied the path he checked his horse and advanced with great deliberation so that each party had an opportunity to take a full survey of the other the solitary stranger was mounted upon an able horse fit for military service and for the great weight which he had to carry and his rider occupied his demipique or warsaddle with an air that showed it was his familiar seat he had a bright burnished headpiece with a plume of feathers together with a cuirass thick enough to resist a musketball and a backpiece of lighter materials these defensive arms he wore over a buff jerkin along with a pair of gauntlets or steel gloves the tops of which reached up to his elbow and which like the rest of his armour were of bright steel at the front of his military saddle hung a case of pistols far beyond the ordinary size nearly two feet in length and carrying bullets of twenty to the pound a buff belt with a broad silver buckle sustained on one side a long straight doubleedged broadsword with a strong guard and a blade calculated either to strike or push on the right side hung a dagger of about eighteen inches in length a shoulderbelt sustained at his back a musketoon or blunderbuss and was crossed by a bandelier containing his charges of ammunition thighpieces of steel then termed taslets met the tops of his huge jackboots and completed the equipage of a wellarmed trooper of the period  the appearance of the horseman himself corresponded well with his military equipage to which he had the air of having been long inured he was above the middle size and of strength sufficient to bear with ease the weight of his weapons offensive and defensive his age might be forty and upwards and his countenance was that of a resolute weatherbeaten veteran who had seen many fields and brought away in token more than one scar at the distance of about thirty yards he halted and stood fast raised himself on his stirrups as if to reconnoitre and ascertain the purpose of the opposite party and brought his musketoon under his right arm ready for use if occasion should require it in everything but numbers he had the advantage of those who seemed inclined to interrupt his passage  the leader of the party was indeed well mounted and clad in a buff coat richly embroidered the halfmilitary dress of the period but his domestics had only coarse jackets of thick felt which could scarce be expected to turn the edge of a sword if wielded by a strong man and none of them had any weapons save swords and pistols without which gentlemen or their attendants during those disturbed times seldom stirred abroad  when they had stood at gaze for about a minute the younger gentleman gave the challenge which was then common in the mouth of all strangers who met in such circumstancesfor whom are you  tell me first answered the soldier for whom are youthe strongest party should speak first  we are for god and king charles answered the first speakernow tell your faction you know ours  i am for god and my standard answered the single horseman  and for which standard replied the chief of the other partycavalier or roundhead king or convention  by my troth sir answered the soldier i would be loath to reply to you with an untruth as a thing unbecoming a cavalier of fortune and a soldier but to answer your query with beseeming veracity it is necessary i should myself have resolved to whilk of the present divisions of the kingdom i shall ultimately adhere being a matter whereon my mind is not as yet preceesely ascertained  i should have thought answered the gentleman that when loyalty and religion are at stake no gentleman or man of honour could be long in choosing his party  truly sir replied the trooper if ye speak this in the way of vituperation as meaning to impugn my honour or genteelity i would blithely put the same to issue venturing in that quarrel with my single person against you three but if you speak it in the way of logical ratiocination whilk i have studied in my youth at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen i am ready to prove to ye logice that my resolution to defer for a certain season the taking upon me either of these quarrels not only becometh me as a gentleman and a man of honour but also as a person of sense and prudence one imbued with humane letters in his early youth and who from thenceforward has followed the wars under the banner of the invincible gustavus the lion of the north and under many other heroic leaders both lutheran and calvinist papist and arminian  after exchanging a word or two with his domestics the younger gentleman replied i should be glad sir to have some conversation with you upon so interesting a question and should be proud if i can determine you in favour of the cause i have myself espoused i ride this evening to a friends house not three miles distant whither if you choose to accompany me you shall have good quarters for the night and free permission to take your own road in the morning if you then feel no inclination to join with us  whose word am i to take for this answered the cautious soldiera man must know his guarantee or he may fall into an ambuscade  i am called answered the younger stranger the earl of menteith and i trust you will receive my honour as a sufficient security  a worthy nobleman answered the soldier whose parole is not to be doubted with one motion he replaced his musketoon at his back and with another made his military salute to the young nobleman and continuing to talk as he rode forward to join himand i trust said he my own assurance that i will be bon camarado to your lordship in peace or in peril during the time we shall abide together will not be altogether vilipended in these doubtful times when as they say a mans head is safer in a steelcap than in a marble palace  i assure you sir said lord menteith that to judge from your appearance i most highly value the advantage of your escort but i trust we shall have no occasion for any exercise of valour as i expect to conduct you to good and friendly quarters  good quarters my lord replied the soldier are always acceptable and are only to be postponed to good pay or good bootynot to mention the honour of a cavalier or the needful points of commanded duty and truly my lord your noble proffer is not the less welcome in that i knew not preceesely this night where i and my poor companion patting his horse were to find lodgments  may i be permitted to ask then said lord menteith to whom i have the good fortune to stand quartermaster  truly my lord said the trooper my name is dalgettydugald dalgetty rittmaster dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket at your honourable service to command it is a name you may have seen in gallo belgicus the swedish intelligencer or if you read high dutch in the fliegenden mercoeur of leipsic my father my lord having by unthrifty courses reduced a fair patrimony to a nonentity i had no better shift when i was eighteen years auld than to carry the learning whilk i had acquired at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen my gentle bluid and designation of drumthwacket together with a pair of stalwarth arms and legs conform to the german wars there to push my way as a cavalier of fortune my lord my legs and arms stood me in more stead than either my gentle kin or my booklear and i found myself trailing a pike as a private gentleman under old sir ludovick leslie where i learned the rules of service so tightly that i will not forget them in a hurry sir i have been made to stand guard eight hours being from twelve at noon to eight oclock of the night at the palace armed with back and breast headpiece and bracelets being iron to the teeth in a bitter frost and the ice was as hard as ever was flint and all for stopping an instant to speak to my landlady when i should have gone to rollcall  and doubtless sir replied lord menteith you have gone through some hot service as well as this same cold duty you talk of  surely my lord it doth not become me to speak but he that hath seen the fields of leipsic and of lutzen may be said to have seen pitched battles and one who hath witnessed the intaking of frankfort and spanheim and nuremberg and so forth should know somewhat about leaguers storms onslaughts and outfalls  but your merit sir and experience were doubtless followed by promotion  it came slow my lord dooms slow replied dalgetty but as my scottish countrymen the fathers of the war and the raisers of those valorous scottish regiments that were the dread of germany began to fall pretty thick what with pestilence and what with the sword why we their children succeeded to their inheritance sir i was six years first private gentleman of the company and three years lance speisade disdaining to receive a halberd as unbecoming my birth wherefore i was ultimately promoted to be a fahndragger as the high dutch call it which signifies an ancient in the kings leif regiment of blackhorse and thereafter i arose to be lieutenant and rittmaster under that invincible monarch the bulwark of the protestant faith the lion of the north the terror of austria gustavus the victorious  and yet if i understand you captain dalgettyi think that rank corresponds with your foreign title of rittmaster  the same grade preceesely answered dalgetty rittmaster signifying literally fileleader  i was observing continued lord menteith that if i understood you right you had left the service of this great prince  it was after his deathit was after his death sir said dalgetty when i was in no shape bound to continue mine adherence there are things my lord in that service that cannot but go against the stomach of any cavalier of honour in especial albeit the pay be none of the most superabundant being only about sixty dollars amonth to a rittmaster yet the invincible gustavus never paid above onethird of that sum whilk was distributed monthly by way of loan although when justly considered it was in fact a borrowing by that great monarch of the additional twothirds which were due to the soldier and i have seen some whole regiments of dutch and holsteiners mutiny on the field of battle like base scullions crying out gelt gelt signifying their desire of pay instead of falling to blows like our noble scottish blades who ever disdained my lord postponing of honour to filthy lucre  but were not these arrears said lord menteith paid to the soldiery at some stated period  my lord said dalgetty i take it on my conscience that at no period and by no possible process could one creutzer of them ever be recovered i myself never saw twenty dollars of my own all the time i served the invincible gustavus unless it was from the chance of a storm or victory or the fetching in some town or doorp when a cavalier of fortune who knows the usage of wars seldom faileth to make some small profit  i begin rather to wonder sir said lord menteith that you should have continued so long in the swedish service than that you should have ultimately withdrawn from it  neither i should answered the rittmaster but that great leader captain and king the lion of the north and the bulwark of the protestant faith had a way of winning battles taking towns overrunning countries and levying contributions whilk made his service irresistibly delectable to all truebred cavaliers who follow the noble profession of arms simple as i ride here my lord i have myself commanded the whole stift of dunklespiel on the lower rhine occupying the palsgraves palace consuming his choice wines with my comrades calling in contributions requisitions and caduacs and not failing to lick my fingers as became a good cook but truly all this glory hastened to decay after our great master had been shot with three bullets on the field of lutzen wherefore finding that fortune had changed sides that the borrowings and lendings went on as before out of our pay while the caduacs and casualties were all cut off i een gave up my commission and took service with wallenstein in walter butlers irish regiment  and may i beg to know of you said lord menteith apparently interested in the adventures of this soldier of fortune how you liked this change of masters  indifferent well said the captainvery indifferent well i cannot say that the emperor paid much better than the great gustavus for hard knocks we had plenty of them i was often obliged to run my head against my old acquaintances the swedish feathers whilk your honour must conceive to be doublepointed stakes shod with iron at each end and planted before the squad of pikes to prevent an onfall of the cavalry the whilk swedish feathers although they look gay to the eye resembling the shrubs or lesser trees of ane forest as the puissant pikes arranged in battalia behind them correspond to the tall pines thereof yet nevertheless are not altogether so soft to encounter as the plumage of a goose howbeit in despite of heavy blows and light pay a cavalier of fortune may thrive indifferently well in the imperial service in respect his private casualties are nothing so closely looked to as by the swede and so that an officer did his duty on the field neither wallenstein nor pappenheim nor old tilly before them would likely listen to the objurgations of boors or burghers against any commander or soldado by whom they chanced to be somewhat closely shorn so that an experienced cavalier knowing how to lay as our scottish phrase runs the head of the sow to the tail of the grice might get out of the country the pay whilk he could not obtain from the emperor  with a full hand sir doubtless and with interest said lord menteith  indubitably my lord answered dalgetty composedly for it would be doubly disgraceful for any soldado of rank to have his name called in question for any petty delinquency  and pray sir continued lord menteith what made you leave so gainful a service  why truly sir answered the soldier an irish cavalier called oquilligan being major of our regiment and i having had words with him the night before respecting the worth and precedence of our several nations it pleased him the next day to deliver his orders to me with the point of his batoon advanced and held aloof instead of declining and trailing the same as is the fashion from a courteous commanding officer towards his equal in rank though it may be his inferior in military grade upon this quarrel sir we fought in private rencontre and as in the perquisitions which followed it pleased walter butler our oberst or colonel to give the lighter punishment to his countryman and the heavier to me whereupon illstomaching such partiality i exchanged my commission for one under the spaniard  i hope you found yourself better off by the change said lord menteith  in good sooth answered the rittmaster i had but little to complain of the pay was somewhat regular being furnished by the rich flemings and waloons of the low country the quarters were excellent the good wheaten loaves of the flemings were better than the provant ryebread of the swede and rhenish wine was more plenty with us than ever i saw the blackbeer of rostock in gustavuss camp service there was none duty there was little and that little we might do or leave undone at our pleasure an excellent retirement for a cavalier somewhat weary of field and leaguer who had purchased with his blood as much honour as might serve his turn and was desirous of a little ease and good living  and may i ask said lord menteith why you captain being as i suppose in the situation you describe retired from the spanish service also  you are to consider my lord that your spaniard replied captain dalgetty is a person altogether unparalleled in his own conceit wherethrough he maketh not fit account of such foreign cavaliers of valour as are pleased to take service with him and a galling thing it is to every honourable soldado to be put aside and postponed and obliged to yield preference to every puffing signor who were it the question which should first mount a breach at push of pike might be apt to yield willing place to a scottish cavalier moreover sir i was pricked in conscience respecting a matter of religion  i should not have thought captain dalgetty said the young nobleman that an old soldier who had changed service so often would have been too scrupulous on that head  no more i am my lord said the captain since i hold it to be the duty of the chaplain of the regiment to settle those matters for me and every other brave cavalier inasmuch as he does nothing else that i know of for his pay and allowances but this was a particular case my lord a casus improvisus as i may say in whilk i had no chaplain of my own persuasion to act as my adviser i found in short that although my being a protestant might be winked at in respect that i was a man of action and had more experience than all the dons in our tertia put together yet when in garrison it was expected i should go to mass with the regiment now my lord as a true scottish man and educated at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen i was bound to uphold the mass to be an act of blinded papistry and utter idolatry whilk i was altogether unwilling to homologate by my presence true it is that i consulted on the point with a worthy countryman of my own one father fatsides of the scottish covenant in wurtzburg  and i hope observed lord menteith you obtained a clear opinion from this same ghostly father  as clear as it could be replied captain dalgetty considering we had drunk six flasks of rhenish and about two mutchkins of kirchenwasser father fatsides informed me that as nearly as he could judge for a heretic like myself it signified not much whether i went to mass or not seeing my eternal perdition was signed and sealed at any rate in respect of my impenitent and obdurate perseverance in my damnable heresy being discouraged by this response i applied to a dutch pastor of the reformed church who told me he thought i might lawfully go to mass in respect that the prophet permitted naaman a mighty man of valour and an honourable cavalier of syria to follow his master into the house of rimmon a false god or idol to whom he had vowed service and to bow down when the king was leaning upon his hand but neither was this answer satisfactory to me both because there was an unco difference between an anointed king of syria and our spanish colonel whom i could have blown away like the peeling of an ingan and chiefly because i could not find the thing was required of me by any of the articles of war neither was i proffered any consideration either in perquisite or pay for the wrong i might thereby do to my conscience  so you again changed your service said lord menteith  in troth did i my lord and after trying for a short while two or three other powers i even took on for a time with their high mightinesses the states of holland  and how did their service jump with your humour again demanded his companion  o my lord said the soldier in a sort of enthusiasm their behaviour on payday might be a pattern to all europeno borrowings no lendings no offsets no arrearsall balanced and paid like a bankers book the quarters too are excellent and the allowances unchallengeable but then sir they are a preceese scrupulous people and will allow nothing for peccadilloes so that if a boor complains of a broken head or a beerseller of a broken can or a daft wench does but squeak loud enough to be heard above her breath a soldier of honour shall be dragged not before his own courtmartial who can best judge of and punish his demerits but before a base mechanical burgomaster who shall menace him with the rasphouse the cord and what not as if he were one of their own mean amphibious twentybreeched boors so not being able to dwell longer among those ungrateful plebeians who although unable to defend themselves by their proper strength will nevertheless allow the noble foreign cavalier who engages with them nothing beyond his dry wages which no honourable spirit will put in competition with a liberal license and honourable countenance i resolved to leave the service of the mynheers and hearing at this time to my exceeding satisfaction that there is something to be doing this summer in my way in this my dear native country i am come hither as they say like a beggar to a bridal in order to give my loving countrymen the advantage of that experience which i have acquired in foreign parts so your lordship has an outline of my brief story excepting my deportment in those passages of action in the field in leaguers storms and onslaughts whilk would be wearisome to narrate and might peradventure better befit any other tongue than mine own    chapter iii       for pleas of right let statesmen vex their head      battles my business and my guerdon bread      and with the sworded switzer i can say      the best of causes is the best of paydonne  the difficulty and narrowness of the road had by this time become such as to interrupt the conversation of the travellers and lord menteith reining back his horse held a moments private conversation with his domestics the captain who now led the van of the party after about a quarter of a miles slow and toilsome advance up a broken and rugged ascent emerged into an upland valley to which a mountain stream acted as a drain and afforded sufficient room upon its greensward banks for the travellers to pursue their journey in a more social manner  lord menteith accordingly resumed the conversation which had been interrupted by the difficulties of the way i should have thought said he to captain dalgetty that a cavalier of your honourable mark who hath so long followed the valiant king of sweden and entertains such a suitable contempt for the base mechanical states of holland would not have hesitated to embrace the cause of king charles in preference to that of the lowborn roundheaded canting knaves who are in rebellion against his authority  ye speak reasonably my lord said dalgetty and caeteris paribus i might be induced to see the matter in the same light but my lord there is a southern proverb fine words butter no parsnips i have heard enough since i came here to satisfy me that a cavalier of honour is free to take any part in this civil embroilment whilk he may find most convenient for his own peculiar loyalty is your password my lordliberty roars another chield from the other side of the straththe king shouts one warcrythe parliament roars anothermontrose for ever cries donald waving his bonnetargyle and leven cries a southcountry saunders vapouring with his hat and feather fight for the bishops says a priest with his gown and rochetstand stout for the kirk cries a minister in a geneva cap and bandgood watchwords allexcellent watchwords whilk cause is the best i cannot say but sure am i that i have fought kneedeep in blood many a day for one that was ten degrees worse than the worst of them all  and pray captain dalgetty said his lordship since the pretensions of both parties seem to you so equal will you please to inform us by what circumstances your preference will be determined  simply upon two considerations my lord answered the soldier being first on which side my services would be in most honourable requestand secondly whilk is a corollary of the first by whilk party they are likely to be most gratefully requited and to deal plainly with you my lord my opinion at present doth on both points rather incline to the side of the parliament  your reasons if you please said lord menteith and perhaps i may be able to meet them with some others which are more powerful  sir i shall be amenable to reason said captain dalgetty supposing it addresses itself to my honour and my interest well then my lord here is a sort of highland host assembled or expected to assemble in these wild hills in the kings behalf now sir you know the nature of our highlanders i will not deny them to be a people stout in body and valiant in heart and courageous enough in their own wild way of fighting which is as remote from the usages and discipline of war as ever was that of the ancient scythians or of the salvage indians of america that now is they havena sae mickle as a german whistle or a drum to beat a march an alarm a charge a retreat a reveille or the tattoo or any other point of war and their damnable skirlin pipes whilk they themselves pretend to understand are unintelligible to the ears of any cavaliero accustomed to civilised warfare so that were i undertaking to discipline such a breechless mob it were impossible for me to be understood and if i were understood judge ye my lord what chance i had of being obeyed among a band of half salvages who are accustomed to pay to their own lairds and chiefs allenarly that respect and obedience whilk ought to be paid to commissionate officers if i were teaching them to form battalia by extracting the square root that is by forming your square battalion of equal number of men of rank and file corresponding to the square root of the full number present what return could i expect for communicating this golden secret of military tactic except it may be a dirk in my wame on placing some malister more mshemei or capperfae in the flank or rear when he claimed to be in the vantruly well saith holy writ if ye cast pearls before swine they will turn again and rend ye  i believe anderson said lord menteith looking back to one of his servants for both were close behind him you can assure this gentleman we shall have more occasion for experienced officers and be more disposed to profit by their instructions than he seems to be aware of  with your honours permission said anderson respectfully raising his cap when we are joined by the irish infantry who are expected and who should be landed in the west highlands before now we shall have need of good soldiers to discipline our levies  and i should like wellvery well to be employed in such service said dalgetty the irish are pretty fellowsvery pretty fellowsi desire to see none better in the field i once saw a brigade of irish at the taking of frankfort upon the oder stand to it with sword and pike until they beat off the blue and yellow swedish brigades esteemed as stout as any that fought under the immortal gustavus and although stout hepburn valiant lumsdale courageous monroe with myself and other cavaliers made entry elsewhere at point of pike yet had we all met with such opposition we had returned with great loss and little profit wherefore these valiant irishes being all put to the sword as is usual in such cases did nevertheless gain immortal praise and honour so that for their sakes i have always loved and honoured those of that nation next to my own country of scotland  a command of irish said menteith i think i could almost promise you should you be disposed to embrace the royal cause  and yet said captain dalgetty my second and greatest difficulty remains behind for although i hold it a mean and sordid thing for a soldado to have nothing in his mouth but pay and gelt like the base cullions the german lanzknechts whom i mentioned before and although i will maintain it with my sword that honour is to be preferred before pay free quarters and arrears yet ex contrario a soldiers pay being the counterpart of his engagement of service it becomes a wise and considerate cavalier to consider what remuneration he is to receive for his service and from what funds it is to be paid and truly my lord from what i can see and hear the convention are the pursemasters the highlanders indeed may be kept in humour by allowing them to steal cattle and for the irishes your lordship and your noble associates may according to the practice of the wars in such cases pay them as seldom or as little as may suit your pleasure or convenience but the same mode of treatment doth not apply to a cavalier like me who must keep up his horses servants arms and equipage and who neither can nor will go to warfare upon his own charges  anderson the domestic who had before spoken now respectfully addressed his masteri think my lord he said that under your lordships favour i could say something to remove captain dalgettys second objection also he asks us where we are to collect our pay now in my poor mind the resources are as open to us as to the covenanters they tax the country according to their pleasure and dilapidate the estates of the kings friends now were we once in the lowlands with our highlanders and our irish at our backs and our swords in our hands we can find many a fat traitor whose illgotten wealth shall fill our military chest and satisfy our soldiery besides confiscations will fall in thick and in giving donations of forfeited lands to every adventurous cavalier who joins his standard the king will at once reward his friends and punish his enemies in short he that joins these roundhead dogs may get some miserable pittance of payhe that joins our standard has a chance to be knight lord or earl if luck serve him  have you ever served my good friend said the captain to the spokesman  a little sir in these our domestic quarrels answered the man modestly  but never in germany or the low countries said dalgetty  i never had the honour answered anderson  i profess said dalgetty addressing lord menteith your lordships servant has a sensible natural pretty idea of military matters somewhat irregular though and smells a little too much of selling the bears skin before he has hunted himi will take the matter however into my consideration  do so captain said lord menteith you will have the night to think of it for we are now near the house where i hope to ensure you a hospitable reception  and that is what will be very welcome said the captain for i have tasted no food since daybreak but a farl of oatcake which i divided with my horse so i have been fain to draw my swordbelt three bores tighter for very extenuation lest hunger and heavy iron should make the gird slip    chapter iv       once on a time no matter when      some glunimies met in a glen      as deft and tight as ever wore      a durk a targe and a claymore      short hose and belted plaid or trews      in uist lochaber skye or lewes      or coverd hard head with his bonnet      had you but known them you would own itmeston  a hill was now before the travellers covered with an ancient forest of scottish firs the topmost of which flinging their scathed branches across the western horizon gleamed ruddy in the setting sun in the centre of this wood rose the towers or rather the chimneys of the house or castle as it was called destined for the end of their journey  as usual at that period one or two highridged narrow buildings intersecting and crossing each other formed the corps de logis a protecting bartizan or two with the addition of small turrets at the angles much resembling pepperboxes had procured for darnlinvarach the dignified appellation of a castle it was surrounded by a low courtyard wall within which were the usual offices  as the travellers approached more nearly they discovered marks of recent additions to the defences of the place which had been suggested doubtless by the insecurity of those troublesome times additional loopholes for musketry were struck out in different parts of the building and of its surrounding wall the windows had just been carefully secured by stancheons of iron crossing each other athwart and endlong like the grates of a prison the door of the courtyard was shut and it was only after cautious challenge that one of its leaves was opened by two domestics both strong highlanders and both under arms like bitias and pandarus in the aeneid ready to defend the entrance if aught hostile had ventured an intrusion  when the travellers were admitted into the court they found additional preparations for defence the walls were scaffolded for the use of firearms and one or two of the small guns called sackers or falcons were mounted at the angles and flanking turrets  more domestics both in the highland and lowland dress instantly rushed from the anterior of the mansion and some hastened to take the horses of the strangers while others waited to marshal them a way into the dwellinghouse but captain dalgetty refused the proffered assistance of those who wished to relieve him of the charge of his horse it is my custom my friends to see gustavus for so i have called him after my invincible master accommodated myself we are old friends and fellowtravellers and as i often need the use of his legs i always lend him in my turn the service of my tongue to call for whatever he has occasion for and accordingly he strode into the stable after his steed without farther apology  neither lord menteith nor his attendants paid the same attention to their horses but leaving them to the proffered care of the servants of the place walked forward into the house where a sort of dark vaulted vestibule displayed among other miscellaneous articles a huge barrel of twopenny ale beside which were ranged two or three wooden queichs or bickers ready it would appear for the service of whoever thought proper to employ them lord menteith applied himself to the spigot drank without ceremony and then handed the stoup to anderson who followed his masters example but not until he had flung out the drop of ale which remained and slightly rinsed the wooden cup  what the deil man said an old highland servant belonging to the family can she no drink after her ain master without washing the cup and spilling the ale and be tamned to her  i was bred in france answered anderson where nobody drinks after another out of the same cup unless it be after a young lady  the teils in their nicety said donald and if the ale be gude fat the waur ist that another mans beards been in the queich before ye  andersons companion drank without observing the ceremony which had given donald so much offence and both of them followed their master into the lowarched stone hall which was the common rendezvous of a highland family a large fire of peats in the huge chimney at the upper end shed a dim light through the apartment and was rendered necessary by the damp by which even during the summer the apartment was rendered uncomfortable twenty or thirty targets as many claymores with dirks and plaids and guns both matchlock and firelock and longbows and crossbows and lochaber axes and coats of plate armour and steel bonnets and headpieces and the more ancient haborgeons or shirts of reticulated mail with hood and sleeves corresponding to it all hung in confusion about the walls and would have formed a months amusement to a member of a modern antiquarian society but such things were too familiar to attract much observation on the part of the present spectators  there was a large clumsy oaken table which the hasty hospitality of the domestic who had before spoken immediately spread with milk butter goatmilk cheese a flagon of beer and a flask of usquebae designed for the refreshment of lord menteith while an inferior servant made similar preparations at the bottom of the table for the benefit of his attendants the space which intervened between them was according to the manners of the times sufficient distinction between master and servant even though the former was as in the present instance of high rank meanwhile the guests stood by the firethe young nobleman under the chimney and his servants at some little distance  what do you think anderson said the former of our fellowtraveller  a stout fellow replied anderson if all be good that is upcome i wish we had twenty such to put our teagues into some sort of discipline  i differ from you anderson said lord menteith i think this fellow dalgetty is one of those horseleeches whose appetite for blood being only sharpened by what he has sucked in foreign countries he is now returned to batten upon that of his own shame on the pack of these mercenary swordmen they have made the name of scot through all europe equivalent to that of a pitiful mercenary who knows neither honour nor principle but his months pay who transfers his allegiance from standard to standard at the pleasure of fortune or the highest bidder and to whose insatiable thirst for plunder and warm quarters we owe much of that civil dissension which is now turning our swords against our own bowels i had scarce patience with the hired gladiator and yet could hardly help laughing at the extremity of his impudence  your lordship will forgive me said anderson if i recommend to you in the present circumstances to conceal at least a part of this generous indignation we cannot unfortunately do our work without the assistance of those who act on baser motives than our own we cannot spare the assistance of such fellows as our friend the soldado to use the canting phrase of the saints in the english parliament the sons of zeruiah are still too many for us  i must dissemble then as well as i can said lord menteith as i have hitherto done upon your hint but i wish the fellow at the devil with all my heart  ay but still you must remember my lord resumed anderson that to cure the bite of a scorpion you must crush another scorpion on the woundbut stop we shall be overheard  from a sidedoor in the hall glided a highlander into the apartment whose lofty stature and complete equipment as well as the eagles feather in his bonnet and the confidence of his demeanour announced to be a person of superior rank he walked slowly up to the table and made no answer to lord menteith who addressing him by the name of allan asked him how he did  ye manna speak to her een now whispered the old attendant  the tall highlander sinking down upon the empty settle next the fire fixed his eyes upon the red embers and the huge heap of turf and seemed buried in profound abstraction his dark eyes and wild and enthusiastic features bore the air of one who deeply impressed with his own subjects of meditation pays little attention to exterior objects an air of gloomy severity the fruit perhaps of ascetic and solitary habits might in a lowlander have been ascribed to religious fanaticism but by that disease of the mind then so common both in england and the lowlands of scotland the highlanders of this period were rarely infected they had however their own peculiar superstitions which overclouded the mind with thickcoming fancies as completely as the puritanism of their neighbours  his lordships honour said the highland servant sideling up to lord menteith and speaking in a very low tone his lordship manna speak to allan even now for the cloud is upon his mind  lord menteith nodded and took no farther notice of the reserved mountaineer  said i not asked the latter suddenly raising his stately person upright and looking at the domesticsaid i not that four were to come and here stand but three on the hall floor  in troth did ye say sae allan said the old highlander and heres the fourth man coming clinking in at the yett een now from the stable for hes shelled like a partan wi airn on back and breast haunch and shanks and am i to set her chair up near the menteiths or down wi the honest gentlemen at the foot of the table  lord menteith himself answered the enquiry by pointing to a seat beside his own  and here she comes said donald as captain dalgetty entered the hall and i hope gentlemens will all take bread and cheese as we say in the glens until better meat be ready until the tiernach comes back frae the hill wi the southern gentlefolk and then dugald cook will show himself wi his kid and hill venison  in the meantime captain dalgetty had entered the apartment and walking up to the seat placed next lord menteith was leaning on the back of it with his arms folded anderson and his companion waited at the bottom of the table in a respectful attitude until they should receive permission to seat themselves while three or four highlanders under the direction of old donald ran hither and thither to bring additional articles of food or stood still to give attendance upon the guests  in the midst of these preparations allan suddenly started up and snatching a lamp from the hand of an attendant held it close to dalgettys face while he perused his features with the most heedful and grave attention  by my honour said dalgetty half displeased as mysteriously shaking his head allan gave up the scrutinyi trow that lad and i will ken each other when we meet again  meanwhile allan strode to the bottom of the table and having by the aid of his lamp subjected anderson and his companion to the same investigation stood a moment as if in deep reflection then touching his forehead suddenly seized anderson by the arm and before he could offer any effectual resistance half led and half dragged him to the vacant seat at the upper end and having made a mute intimation that he should there place himself he hurried the soldado with the same unceremonious precipitation to the bottom of the table the captain exceedingly incensed at this freedom endeavoured to shake allan from him with violence but powerful as he was he proved in the struggle inferior to the gigantic mountaineer who threw him off with such violence that after reeling a few paces he fell at full length and the vaulted hall rang with the clash of his armour when he arose his first action was to draw his sword and to fly at allan who with folded arms seemed to await his onset with the most scornful indifference lord menteith and his attendants interposed to preserve peace while the highlanders snatching weapons from the wall seemed prompt to increase the broil  he is mad whispered lord menteith he is perfectly mad there is no purpose in quarrelling with him  if your lordship is assured that he is non compos mentis said captain dalgetty the whilk his breeding and behaviour seem to testify the matter must end here seeing that a madman can neither give an affront nor render honourable satisfaction but by my saul if i had my provstnt and a bottle of rhenish under my belt i should hive stood otherways up to him and yet its a pity he should be sae weak in the intellectuals being a strong proper man of body fit to handle pike morgenstern or any other military implement whatsoever this was a sort of club or mace used in the earlier part of the seventeenth century in the defence of breaches and walls when the germans insulted a scotch regiment then besieged in trailsund saying they heard there was a ship come from denmark to them laden with tobacco pipes one of our soldiers says colonel robert munro showing them over the work a morgenstern made of a large stock banded with iron like the shaft of a halberd with a round globe at the end with cross iron pikes saith here is one of the tobacco pipes wherewith we will beat out your brains when you intend to storm us  peace was thus restored and the party seated themselves agreeably to their former arrangement with which allan who had now returned to his settle by the fire and seemed once more immersed in meditation did not again interfere lord menteith addressing the principal domestic hastened to start some theme of conversation which might obliterate all recollection of the fray that had taken place the laird is at the hill then donald i understand and some english strangers with him  at the hill he is an it like your honour and two saxon calabaleros are with him sure eneugh and that is sir miles musgrave and christopher hall both from the cumraik as i think they call their country  hall and musgrave said lord menteith looking at his attendants the very men that we wished to see  troth said donald an i wish i had never seen them between the een for theyre come to herry us out o house and ha  why donald said lord menteith you did not use to be so churlish of your beef and ale southland though they be theyll scarce eat up all the cattle thats going on the castle mains  teil care an they did said donald an that were the warst ot for we have a wheen canny trewsmen here that wadna let us want if there was a horned beast atween this and perth but this is a warse jobits nae less than a wager  a wager repeated lord menteith with some surprise  troth continued donald to the full as eager to tell his news as lord menteith was curious to hear them as your lordship is a friend and kinsman o the house an as yell hear eneugh ot in less than an hour i may as weel tell ye mysell ye sall be pleased then to know that when our laird was up in england where he gangs oftener than his friends can wish he was biding at the house o this sir miles musgrave an there was putten on the table six candlesticks that they tell me were twice as muckle as the candlesticks in dunblane kirk and neither airn brass nor tin but a solid silver nae lessup wi their english pride has sae muckle and kens sae little how to guide it sae they began to jeer the laird that he saw nae sic graith in his ain poor country and the laird scorning to hae his country put down without a word for its credit swore like a gude scotsman that he had mair candlesticks and better candlesticks in his ain castle at hame than were ever lighted in a hall in cumberland an cumberland be the name o the country  that was patriotically said observed lord menteith  fary true said donald but her honour had better hae hauden her tongue for if ye say ony thing amang the saxons thats a wee by ordinar they clink ye down for a wager as fast as a lowland smith would hammer shoon on a highland shelty an so the laird behoved either to gae back o his word or wager twa hunder merks and sa he een tock the wager rather than be shamed wi the like o them and now hes like to get it to pay and im thinking thats what makes him sae swear to come hame at een  indeed said lord menteith from my idea of your family plate donald your master is certain to lose such a wager  your honour may swear that an where hes to get the siller i kenna although he borrowed out o twenty purses i advised him to pit the twa saxon gentlemen and their servants cannily into the pit o the tower till they gae up the bagain o free gudewill but the laird winna hear reason  allan here started up strode forward and interrupted the conversation saying to the domestic in a voice like thunder and how dared you to give my brother such dishonourable advice or how dare you to say he will lose this or any other wager which it is his pleasure to lay  troth allan maulay answered the old man its no for my fathers son to gainsay what your fathers son thinks fit to say an so the laird may no doubt win his wager a that i ken against it is that the teil a candlestick or ony thing like it is in the house except the auld airn branches that has been here since laird kenneths time and the tin sconces that your father gard be made by auld willie winkie the tinkler mair be token that deil an unce of siller plate is about the house at a forby the ladys auld posset dish that wants the cover and ane o the lugs  peace old man said allan fiercely and do you gentlemen if your refection is finished leave this apartment clear i must prepare it for the reception of these southern guests  come away said the domestic pulling lord menteith by the sleeve his hour is on him said he looking towards allan and he will not be controlled  they left the hall accordingly lord menteith and the captain being ushered one way by old donald and the two attendants conducted elsewhere by another highlander the former had scarcely reached a sort of withdrawing apartment ere they were joined by the lord of the mansion angus maulay by name and his english guests great joy was expressed by all parties for lord menteith and the english gentlemen were well known to each other and on lord menteiths introduction captain dalgetty was well received by the laird but after the first burst of hospitable congratulation was over lord menteith could observe that there was a shade of sadness on the brow of his highland friend  you must have heard said sir christopher hall that our fine undertaking in cumberland is all blown up the militia would not march into scotland and your prickeard covenanters have been too hard for our friends in the southern shires and so understanding there is some stirring work here musgrave and i rather than sit idle at home are come to have a campaign among your kilts and plaids  i hope you have brought arms men and money with you said lord menteith smiling  only some dozen or two of troopers whom we left at the last lowland village said musgrave and trouble enough we had to get them so far  as for money said his companion we expect a small supply from our friend and host here  the laird now colouring highly took menteith a little apart and expressed to him his regret that he had fallen into a foolish blunder  i heard it from donald said lord menteith scarce able to suppress a smile  devil take that old man said maulay he would tell every thing were it to cost ones life but its no jesting matter to you neither my lord for i reckon on your friendly and fraternal benevolence as a near kinsman of our house to help me out with the money due to these pockpuddings or else to be plain wi ye the deil a maulay will there be at the muster for curse me if i do not turn covenanter rather than face these fellows without paying them and at the best i shall be ill enough off getting both the scaith and the scorn  you may suppose cousin said lord menteith i am not too well equipt just now but you may be assured i shall endeavour to help you as well as i can for the sake of old kindred neighbourhood and alliance  thank yethank yethank ye reiterated maulay and as they are to spend the money in the kings service what signifies whether you they or i pay itwe are a one mans bairns i hope but you must help me out too with some reasonable excuse or else i shall be for taking to andrew ferrara for i like not to be treated like a liar or a braggart at my own boardend when god knows i only meant to support my honour and that of my family and country  donald as they were speaking entered with rather a blither face than he might have been expected to wear considering the impending fate of his masters purse and credit gentlemens her dinner is ready and her candles are lighted too said donald with a strong guttural emphasis on the last clause of his speech  what the devil can he mean said musgrave looking to his countryman  lord menteith put the same question with his eyes to the laird which maulay answered by shaking his head  a short dispute about precedence somewhat delayed their leaving the apartment lord menteith insisted upon yielding up that which belonged to his rank on consideration of his being in his own country and of his near connexion with the family in which they found themselves the two english strangers therefore were first ushered into the hall where an unexpected display awaited them the large oaken table was spread with substantial joints of meat and seats were placed in order for the guests behind every seat stood a gigantic highlander completely dressed and armed after the fashion of his country holding in his right hand his drawn sword with the point turned downwards and in the left a blazing torch made of the bogpine this wood found in the morasses is so full of turpentine that when split and dried it is frequently used in the highlands instead of candles the unexpected and somewhat startling apparition was seen by the red glare of the torches which displayed the wild features unusual dress and glittering arms of those who bore them while the smoke eddying up to the roof of the hall overcanopied them with a volume of vapour ere the strangers had recovered from their surprise allan stept forward and pointing with his sheathed broadsword to the torchbearers said in a deep and stern tone of voice behold gentlemen cavaliers the chandeliers of my brothers house the ancient fashion of our ancient name not one of these men knows any law but their chiefs commandwould you dare to compare to them in value the richest ore that ever was dug out of the mine how say you cavaliersis your wager won or lost  lost lost said musgrave gailymy own silver candlesticks are all melted and riding on horseback by this time and i wish the fellows that enlisted were half as trusty as thesehere sir he added to the chief is your money it impairs halls finances and mine somewhat but debts of honour must be settled  my fathers curse upon my fathers son said allan interrupting him if he receive from you one penny it is enough that you claim no right to exact from him what is his own  lord menteith eagerly supported allans opinion and the elder maulay readily joined declaring the whole to be a fools business and not worth speaking more about the englishmen after some courteous opposition were persuaded to regard the whole as a joke  and now allan said the laird please to remove your candles for since the saxon gentlemen have seen them they will eat their dinner as comfortably by the light of the old tin sconces without scomfishing them with so much smoke  accordingly at a sign from allan the living chandeliers recovering their broadswords and holding the point erect marched out of the hall and left the guests to enjoy their refreshment such a bet as that mentioned in the text is said to have been taken by macdonald of keppoch who extricated himself in the manner there narrated    chapter v       thareby so fearlesse and so fell he grew      that his own syre and maister of his guise      did often tremble at his horrid view      and if for dread of hurt would him advise      the angry beastes not rashly to despise      nor too much to provoke for he would learne      the lion stoup to him in lowly wise      a lesson hard and make the libbard sterne      leave roaring when in rage he for revenge did earnespenser  notwithstanding the proverbial epicurism of the englishproverbial that is to say in scotland at the periodthe english visitors made no figure whatever at the entertainment compared with the portentous voracity of captain dalgetty although that gallant soldier had already displayed much steadiness and pertinacity in his attack upon the lighter refreshment set before them at their entrance by way of forlorn hope he spoke to no one during the time of his meal and it was not until the victuals were nearly withdrawn from the table that he gratified the rest of the company who had watched him with some surprise with an account of the reasons why he ate so very fast and so very long  the former quality he said he had acquired while he filled a place at the bursars table at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen when said he if you did not move your jaws as fast as a pair of castanets you were very unlikely to get any thing to put between them and as for the quantity of my food be it known to this honourable company continued the captain that its the duty of every commander of a fortress on all occasions which offer to secure as much munition and vivers as their magazines can possibly hold not knowing when they may have to sustain a siege or a blockade upon which principle gentlemen said he when a cavalier finds that provant is good and abundant he will in my estimation do wisely to victual himself for at least three days as there is no knowing when he may come by another meal  the laird expressed his acquiescence in the prudence of this principle and recommended to the veteran to add a tass of brandy and a flagon of claret to the substantial provisions he had already laid in to which proposal the captain readily agreed  when dinner was removed and the servants had withdrawn excepting the lairds page or henchman who remained in the apartment to call for or bring whatever was wanted or in a word to answer the purposes of a modern bellwire the conversation began to turn upon politics and the state of the country and lord menteith enquired anxiously and particularly what clans were expected to join the proposed muster of the kings friends  that depends much my lord on the person who lifts the banner said the laird for you know we highlanders when a few clans are assembled are not easily commanded by one of our own chiefs or to say the truth by any other body we have heard a rumour indeed that colkittothat is young colkitto or alaster mdonald is come over the kyle from ireland with a body of the earl of antrims people and that they had got as far as ardnamurchan they might have been here before now but i suppose they loitered to plunder the country as they came along  will colkitto not serve you for a leader then said lord menteith  colkitto said allan maulay scornfully who talks of colkittothere lives but one man whom we will follow and that is montrose  but montrose sir said sir christopher hall has not been heard of since our ineffectual attempt to rise in the north of england it is thought he has returned to the king at oxford for farther instructions  returned said allan with a scornful laugh i could tell ye but it is not worth my while ye will know soon enough  by my honour allan said lord menteith you will weary out your friends with this intolerable froward and sullen humourbut i know the reason added he laughing you have not seen annot lyle today  whom did you say i had not seen said allan sternly  annot lyle the fairy queen of song and minstrelsy said lord menteith  would to god i were never to see her again said allan sighing on condition the same weird were laid on you  and why on me said lord menteith carelessly  because said allan it is written on your forehead that you are to be the ruin of each other so saying he rose up and left the room  has he been long in this way asked lord menteith addressing his brother  about three days answered angus the fit is wellnigh over he will be better tomorrowbut come gentlemen dont let the tappithen scraugh to be emptied the kings health king charless health and may the covenanting dog that refuses it go to heaven by the road of the grassmarket  the health was quickly pledged and as fast succeeded by another and another and another all of a party cast and enforced in an earnest manner captain dalgetty however thought it necessary to enter a protest  gentlemen cavaliers he said i drink these healths primo both out of respect to this honourable and hospitable rooftree and secundo because i hold it not good to be preceese in such matters inter pocula but i protest agreeable to the warrandice granted by this honourable lord that it shall be free to me notwithstanding my present complaisance to take service with the covenanters tomorrow providing i shall be so minded  maulay and his english guests stared at this declaration which would have certainly bred new disturbance if lord menteith had not taken up the affair and explained the circumstances and conditions i trust he concluded we shall be able to secure captain dalgettys assistance to our own party  and if not said the laird i protest as the captain says that nothing that has passed this evening not even his having eaten my bread and salt and pledged me in brandy bourdeaux or usquebaugh shall prejudice my cleaving him to the neckbone  you shall be heartily welcome said the captain providing my sword cannot keep my head which it has done in worse dangers than your fend is likely to make for me  here lord menteith again interposed and the concord of the company being with no small difficulty restored was cemented by some deep carouses lord menteith however contrived to break up the party earlier than was the usage of the castle under pretence of fatigue and indisposition this was somewhat to the disappointment of the valiant captain who among other habits acquired in the low countries had acquired both a disposition to drink and a capacity to bear an exorbitant quantity of strong liquors  their landlord ushered them in person to a sort of sleeping gallery in which there was a fourpost bed with tartan curtains and a number of cribs or long hampers placed along the wall three of which well stuffed with blooming heather were prepared for the reception of guests  i need not tell your lordship said maulay to lord menteith a little apart our highland mode of quartering only that not liking you should sleep in the room alone with this german landlouper i have caused your servants beds to be made here in the gallery by gd my lord these are times when men go to bed with a throat hale and sound as ever swallowed brandy and before next morning it may be gaping like an oystershell  lord menteith thanked him sincerely saying it was just the arrangement he would have requested for although he had not the least apprehension of violence from captain dalgetty yet anderson was a better kind of person a sort of gentleman whom he always liked to have near his person  i have not seen this anderson said maulay did you hire him in england  i did so said lord menteith you will see the man tomorrow in the meantime i wish you goodnight  his host left the apartment after the evening salutation and was about to pay the same compliment to captain dalgetty but observing him deeply engaged in the discussion of a huge pitcher filled with brandy posset he thought it a pity to disturb him in so laudable an employment and took his leave without farther ceremony  lord menteiths two attendants entered the apartment almost immediately after his departure the good captain who was now somewhat encumbered with his good cheer began to find the undoing of the clasps of his armour a task somewhat difficult and addressed anderson in these words interrupted by a slight hiccupanderson my good friend you may read in scripture that he that putteth off his armour should not boast himself like he that putteth it oni believe that is not the right word of command but the plain truth of it is i am like to sleep in my corslet like many an honest fellow that never waked again unless you unloose this buckle  undo his armour sibbald said anderson to the other servant  by st andrew exclaimed the captain turning round in great astonishment heres a common fellowa stipendiary with four pounds ayear and a livery cloak thinks himself too good to serve rittmaster dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket who has studied humanity at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen and served half the princes of europe  captain dalgetty said lord menteith whose lot it was to stand peacemaker throughout the evening please to understand that anderson waits upon no one but myself but i will help sibbald to undo your corslet with much pleasure  too much trouble for you my lord said dalgetty and yet it would do you no harm to practise how a handsome harness is put on and put off i can step in and out of mine like a glove only tonight although not ebrius i am in the classic phrase vino ciboque gravatus  by this time he was unshelled and stood before the fire musing with a face of drunken wisdom on the events of the evening what seemed chiefly to interest him was the character of allan maulay to come over the englishmen so cleverly with his highland torchbearerseight barebreeched rories for six silver candlesticksit was a masterpiecea tour de passeit was perfect legerdemainand to be a madman after alli doubt greatly my lord shaking his head that i must allow him notwithstanding his relationship to your lordship the privileges of a rational person and either batoon him sufficiently to expiate the violence offered to my person or else bring it to a matter of mortal arbitrement as becometh an insulted cavalier  if you care to hear a long story said lord menteith at this time of night i can tell you how the circumstances of allans birth account so well for his singular character as to put such satisfaction entirely out of the question  a long story my lord said captain dalgetty is next to a good evening draught and a warm nightcap the best shoeinghorn for drawing on a sound sleep and since your lordship is pleased to take the trouble to tell it i shall rest your patient and obliged auditor  anderson said lord menteith and you sibbald are dying to hear i suppose of this strange man too and i believe i must indulge your curiosity that you may know how to behave to him in time of need you had better step to the fire then  having thus assembled an audience about him lord menteith sat down upon the edge of the fourpost bed while captain dalgetty wiping the relics of the posset from his beard and mustachoes and repeating the first verse of the lutheran psalm alle guter geister loben den herrn etc rolled himself into one of the places of repose and thrusting his shock pate from between the blankets listened to lord menteiths relation in a most luxurious state between sleeping and waking  the father said lord menteith of the two brothers angus and allan maulay was a gentleman of consideration and family being the chief of a highland clan of good account though not numerous his lady the mother of these young men was a gentlewoman of good family if i may be permitted to say so of one nearly connected with my own her brother an honourable and spirited young man obtained from james the sixth a grant of forestry and other privileges over a royal chase adjacent to this castle and in exercising and defending these rights he was so unfortunate as to involve himself in a quarrel with some of our highland freebooters or caterans of whom i think captain dalgetty you must have heard  and that i have said the captain exerting himself to answer the appeal before i left the mareschalcollege of aberdeen dugald garr was playing the devil in the garioch and the farquharsons on deeside and the clan chattan on the gordons lands and the grants and camerons in morayland and since that i have seen the cravats and pandours in pannonia and transylvania and the cossacks from the polish frontier and robbers banditti and barbarians of all countries besides so that i have a distinct idea of your broken highlandmen  the clan said lord menteith with whom the maternal uncle of the maulays had been placed in feud was a small sept of banditti called from their houseless state and their incessantly wandering among the mountains and glens the children of the mist they are a fierce and hardy people with all the irritability and wild and vengeful passions proper to men who have never known the restraint of civilized society a party of them lay in wait for the unfortunate warden of the forest surprised him while hunting alone and unattended and slew him with every circumstance of inventive cruelty they cut off his head and resolved in a bravado to exhibit it at the castle of his brotherinlaw the laird was absent and the lady reluctantly received as guests men against whom perhaps she was afraid to shut her gates refreshments were placed before the children of the mist who took an opportunity to take the head of their victim from the plaid in which it was wrapt placed it on the table put a piece of bread between the lifeless jaws bidding them do their office now since many a good meal they had eaten at that table the lady who had been absent for some household purpose entered at this moment and upon beholding her brothers head fled like an arrow out of the house into the woods uttering shriek upon shriek the ruffians satisfied with this savage triumph withdrew the terrified menials after overcoming the alarm to which they had been subjected sought their unfortunate mistress in every direction but she was nowhere to be found the miserable husband returned next day and with the assistance of his people undertook a more anxious and distant search but to equally little purpose it was believed universally that in the ecstasy of her terror she must either have thrown herself over one of the numerous precipices which overhang the river or into a deep lake about a mile from the castle her loss was the more lamented as she was six months advanced in her pregnancy angus maulay her eldest son having been born about eighteen months beforebut i tire you captain dalgetty and you seem inclined to sleep  by no means answered the soldier i am no whit somnolent i always hear best with my eyes shut it is a fashion i learned when i stood sentinel  and i daresay said lord menteith aside to anderson the weight of the halberd of the sergeant of the rounds often made him open them  being apparently however in the humour of storytelling the young nobleman went on addressing himself chiefly to his servants without minding the slumbering veteran  every baron in the country said he now swore revenge for this dreadful crime they took arms with the relations and brotherinlaw of the murdered person and the children of the mist were hunted down i believe with as little mercy as they had themselves manifested seventeen heads the bloody trophies of their vengeance were distributed among the allies and fed the crows upon the gates of their castles the survivors sought out more distant wildernesses to which they retreated  to your right hand countermarch and retreat to your former ground said captain dalgetty the military phrase having produced the correspondent word of command and then starting up professed he had been profoundly atttentive to every word that had been spoken  it is the custom in summer said lord menteith without attending to his apology to send the cows to the upland pastures to have the benefit of the grass and the maids of the village and of the family go there to milk them in the morning and evening while thus employed the females of this family to their great terror perceived that their motions were watched at a distance by a pale thin meagre figure bearing a strong resemblance to their deceased mistress and passing of course for her apparition when some of the boldest resolved to approach this faded form it fled from them into the woods with a wild shriek the husband informed of this circumstance came up to the glen with some attendants and took his measures so well as to intercept the retreat of the unhappy fugitive and to secure the person of his unfortunate lady though her intellect proved to be totally deranged how she supported herself during her wandering in the woods could not be knownsome supposed she lived upon roots and wildberries with which the woods at that season abounded but the greater part of the vulgar were satisfied that she must have subsisted upon the milk of the wild does or been nourished by the fairies or supported in some manner equally marvellous her reappearance was more easily accounted for she had seen from the thicket the milking of the cows to superintend which had been her favourite domestic employment and the habit had prevailed even in her deranged state of mind  in due season the unfortunate lady was delivered of a boy who not only showed no appearance of having suffered from his mothers calamities but appeared to be an infant of uncommon health and strength the unhappy mother after her confinement recovered her reasonat least in a great measure but never her health and spirits allan was her only joy her attention to him was unremitting and unquestionably she must have impressed upon his early mind many of those superstitious ideas to which his moody and enthusiastic temper gave so ready a reception she died when he was about ten years old her last words were spoken to him in private but there is little doubt that they conveyed an injunction of vengeance upon the children of the mist with which he has since amply complied  from this moment the habits of allan maulay were totally changed he had hitherto been his mothers constant companion listening to her dreams and repeating his own and feeding his imagination which probably from the circumstances preceding his birth was constitutionally deranged with all the wild and terrible superstitions so common to the mountaineers to which his unfortunate mother had become much addicted since her brothers death by living in this manner the boy had gotten a timid wild startled look loved to seek out solitary places in the woods and was never so much terrified as by the approach of children of the same age i remember although some years younger being brought up here by my father upon a visit nor can i forget the astonishment with which i saw this infanthermit shun every attempt i made to engage him in the sports natural to our age i can remember his father bewailing his disposition to mine and alleging at the same time that it was impossible for him to take from his wife the company of the boy as he seemed to be the only consolation that remained to her in this world and as the amusement which allans society afforded her seemed to prevent the recurrence at least in its full force of that fearful malady by which she had been visited but after the death of his mother the habits and manners of the boy seemed at once to change it is true he remained as thoughtful and serious as before and long fits of silence and abstraction showed plainly that his disposition in this respect was in no degree altered but at other times he sought out the rendezvous of the youth of the clan which he had hitherto seemed anxious to avoid he took share in all their exercises and from his very extraordinary personal strength soon excelled his brother and other youths whose age considerably exceeded his own they who had hitherto held him in contempt now feared if they did not love him and instead of allans being esteemed a dreaming womanish and feebleminded boy those who encountered him in sports or military exercise now complained that when heated by the strife he was too apt to turn game into earnest and to forget that he was only engaged in a friendly trial of strengthbut i speak to regardless ears said lord menteith interrupting himself for the captains nose now gave the most indisputable signs that he was fast locked in the arms of oblivion  if you mean the ears of that snorting swine my lord said anderson they are indeed shut to anything that you can say nevertheless this place being unfit for more private conference i hope you will have the goodness to proceed for sibbalds benefit and for mine the history of this poor young fellow has a deep and wild interest in it  you must know then proceeded lord menteith that allan continued to increase in strength and activity till his fifteenth year about which time he assumed a total independence of character and impatience of control which much alarmed his surviving parent he was absent in the woods for whole days and nights under pretence of hunting though he did not always bring home game his father was the more alarmed because several of the children of the mist encouraged by the increasing troubles of the state had ventured back to their old haunts nor did he think it altogether safe to renew any attack upon them the risk of allan in his wanderings sustaining injury from these vindictive freebooters was a perpetual source of apprehension  i was myself upon a visit to the castle when this matter was brought to a crisis allan had been absent since daybreak in the woods where i had sought for him in vain it was a dark stormy night and he did not return his father expressed the utmost anxiety and spoke of detaching a party at the dawn of morning in quest of him when as we were sitting at the suppertable the door suddenly opened and allan entered the room with a proud firm and confident air his intractability of temper as well as the unsettled state of his mind had such an influence over his father that he suppressed all other tokens of displeasure excepting the observation that i had killed a fat buck and had returned before sunset while he supposed allan who had been on the hill till midnight had returned with empty hands are you sure of that said allan fiercely here is something will tell you another tale  we now observed his hands were bloody and that there were spots of blood on his face and waited the issue with impatience when suddenly undoing the corner of his plaid he rolled down on the table a human head bloody and new severed saying at the same time lie thou where the head of a better man lay before ye from the haggard features and matted red hair and beard partly grizzled with age his father and others present recognised the head of hector of the mist a wellknown leader among the outlaws redoubted for strength and ferocity who had been active in the murder of the unfortunate forester uncle to allan and had escaped by a desperate defence and extraordinary agility when so many of his companions were destroyed we were all it may be believed struck with surprise but allan refused to gratify our curiosity and we only conjectured that he must have overcome the outlaw after a desperate struggle because we discovered that he had sustained several wounds from the contest all measures were now taken to ensure him against the vengeance of the freebooters but neither his wounds nor the positive command of his father nor even the locking of the gates of the castle and the doors of his apartment were precautions adequate to prevent allan from seeking out the very persons to whom he was peculiarly obnoxious he made his escape by night from the window of the apartment and laughing at his fathers vain care produced on one occasion the head of one and upon another those of two of the children of the mist at length these men fierce as they were became appalled by the inveterate animosity and audacity with which allan sought out their recesses as he never hesitated to encounter any odds they concluded that he must bear a charmed life or fight under the guardianship of some supernatural influence neither gun dirk nor dourlach dourlachquiver literally satchelof arrows they said availed aught against him they imputed this to the remarkable circumstances under which he was born and at length five or six of the stoutest caterans of the highlands would have fled at allans halloo or the blast of his horn  in the meanwhile however the children of the mist carried on their old trade and did the maulays as well as their kinsmen and allies as much mischief as they could this provoked another expedition against the tribe in which i had my share we surprised them effectually by besetting at once the upper and under passes of the country and made such clean work as is usual on these occasions burning and slaying right before us in this terrible species of war even the females and the helpless do not always escape one little maiden alone who smiled upon allans drawn dirk escaped his vengeance upon my earnest entreaty she was brought to the castle and here bred up under the name of annot lyle the most beautiful little fairy certainly that ever danced upon a heath by moonlight it was long ere allan could endure the presence of the child until it occurred to his imagination from her features perhaps that she did not belong to the hated blood of his enemies but had become their captive in some of their incursions a circumstance not in itself impossible but in which he believes as firmly as in holy writ he is particularly delighted by her skill in music which is so exquisite that she far exceeds the best performers in this country in playing on the clairshach or harp it was discovered that this produced upon the disturbed spirits of allan in his gloomiest moods beneficial effects similar to those experienced by the jewish monarch of old and so engaging is the temper of annot lyle so fascinating the innocence and gaiety of her disposition that she is considered and treated in the castle rather as the sister of the proprietor than as a dependent upon his charity indeed it is impossible for any one to see her without being deeply interested by the ingenuity liveliness and sweetness of her disposition  take care my lord said anderson smiling there is danger in such violent commendations allan maulay as your lordship describes him would prove no very safe rival  pooh pooh said lord menteith laughing yet blushing at the same time allan is not accessible to the passion of love and for myself said he more gravely annots unknown birth is a sufficient reason against serious designs and her unprotected state precludes every other  it is spoken like yourself my lord said andersonbut i trust you will proceed with your interesting story  it is wellnigh finished said lord menteith i have only to add that from the great strength and courage of allan maulay from his energetic and uncontrollable disposition and from an opinion generally entertained and encouraged by himself that he holds communion with supernatural beings and can predict future events the clan pay a much greater degree of deference to him than even to his brother who is a boldhearted rattling highlander but with nothing which can possibly rival the extraordinary character of his younger brother  such a character said anderson cannot but have the deepest effect on the minds of a highland host we must secure allan my lord at all events what between his bravery and his second sight  hush said lord menteith that owl is awaking  do you talk of the second sight or deuteroscopia said the soldier i remember memorable major munro telling me how murdoch mackenzie born in assint a private gentleman in a company and a pretty soldier foretold the death of donald tough a lochaber man and certain other persons as well as the hurt of the major himself at a sudden onfall at the siege of trailsund  i have often heard of this faculty observed anderson but i have always thought those pretending to it were either enthusiasts or impostors  i should be loath said lord menteith to apply either character to my kinsman allan maulay he has shown on many occasions too much acuteness and sense of which you this night had an instance for the character of an enthusiast and his high sense of honour and manliness of disposition free him from the charge of imposture  your lordship then said anderson is a believer in his supernatural attributes  by no means said the young nobleman i think that he persuades himself that the predictions which are in reality the result of judgment and reflection are supernatural impressions on his mind just as fanatics conceive the workings of their own imagination to be divine inspirationat least if this will not serve you anderson i have no better explanation to give and it is time we were all asleep after the toilsome journey of the day    chapter vi       coming events cast their shadows beforecampbell  at an early hour in the morning the guests of the castle sprung from their repose and after a moments private conversation with his attendants lord menteith addressed the soldier who was seated in a corner burnishing his corslet with rotstone and chamoisleather while he hummed the old song in honour of the victorious gustavus adolphus       when cannons are roaring and bullets are flying      the lad that would have honour boys must never fear dying  captain dalgetty said lord menteith the time is come that we must part or become comrades in service  not before breakfast i hope said captain dalgetty  i should have thought replied his lordship that your garrison was victualled for three days at least  i have still some stowage left for beef and bannocks said the captain and i never miss a favourable opportunity of renewing my supplies  but said lord menteith no judicious commander allows either flags of truce or neutrals to remain in his camp longer than is prudent and therefore we must know your mind exactly according to which you shall either have a safeconduct to depart in peace or be welcome to remain with us  truly said the captain that being the case i will not attempt to protract the capitulation by a counterfeited parley a thing excellently practised by sir james ramsay at the siege of hannau in the year of god 1636 but i will frankly own that if i like your pay as well as your provant and your company i care not how soon i take the oath to your colours  our pay said lord menteith must at present be small since it is paid out of the common stock raised by the few amongst us who can command some fundsas major and adjutant i dare not promise captain dalgetty more than half a dollar aday  the devil take all halves and quarters said the captain were it in my option i could no more consent to the halving of that dollar than the woman in the judgment of solomon to the disseverment of the child of her bowels  the parallel will scarce hold captain dalgetty for i think you would rather consent to the dividing of the dollar than give it up entire to your competitor however in the way of arrears i may promise you the other halfdollar at the end of the campaign  ah these arrearages said captain dalgetty that are always promised and always go for nothing spain austria and sweden all sing one song oh long life to the hoganmogans if they were no officers of soldiers they were good paymastersand yet my lord if i could but be made certiorate that my natural hereditament of drumthwacket had fallen into possession of any of these loons of covenanters who could be in the event of our success conveniently made a traitor of i have so much value for that fertile and pleasant spot that i would een take on with you for the campaign  i can resolve captain dalgettys question said sibbald lord menteiths second attendant for if his estate of drumthwacket be as i conceive the long waste moor so called that lies five miles south of aberdeen i can tell him it was lately purchased by elias strachan as rank a rebel as ever swore the covenant  the cropeared hound said captain dalgetty in a rage what the devil gave him the assurance to purchase the inheritance of a family of four hundred years standingcynthius aurem vellet as we used to say at mareschalcollege that is to say i will pull him out of my fathers house by the ears and so my lord menteith i am yours hand and sword body and soul till death do us part or to the end of the next campaign whichever event shall first come to pass  and i said the young nobleman rivet the bargain with a months pay in advance  that is more than necessary said dalgetty pocketing the money however but now i must go down look after my warsaddle and abuilziements and see that gustavus has his morning and tell him we have taken new service  there goes your precious recruit said lord menteith to anderson as the captain left the room i fear we shall have little credit of him  he is a man of the times however said anderson and without such we should hardly be able to carry on our enterprise  let us go down answered lord menteith and see how our muster is likely to thrive for i hear a good deal of bustle in the castle  when they entered the hall the domestics keeping modestly in the background morning greetings passed between lord menteith angus maulay and his english guests while allan occupying the same settle which he had filled the preceding evening paid no attention whatever to any one old donald hastily rushed into the apartment a message from vich alister more the patronymic of macdonell of glengarry he is coming up in the evening  with how many attendants said maulay  some fiveandtwenty or thirty said donald his ordinary retinue  shake down plenty of straw in the great barn said the laird  another servant here stumbled hastily in announcing the expected approach of sir hector mlean who is arriving with a large following  put them in the maltkiln said maulay and keep the breadth of the middenstead between them and the mdonalds they are but unfriends to each other  donald now reentered his visage considerably lengthenedthe tells i the folk he said the haill hielands are asteer i think evan dhu of lochiel will be here in an hour with lord kens how many gillies  into the great barn with them beside the mdonalds said the laird  more and more chiefs were announced the least of whom would have accounted it derogatory to his dignity to stir without a retinue of six or seven persons to every new annunciation angus maulay answered by naming some place of accommodationthe stables the loft the cowhouse the sheds every domestic office were destined for the night to some hospitable purpose or other at length the arrival of mdougal of lorn after all his means of accommodation were exhausted reduced him to some perplexity what the devil is to be done donald said he the great barn would hold fifty more if they would lie heads and thraws but there would be drawn dirks amang them which should lie uppermost and so we should have bloody puddings before morning  what needs all this said allan starting up and coming forward with the stern abruptness of his usual manner are the gael today of softer flesh or whiter blood than their fathers were knock the head out of a cask of usquebae let that be their nightgeartheir plaids their bedclothesthe blue sky their canopy and the heather their couchcome a thousand more and they would not quarrel on the broad heath for want of room  allan is right said his brother it is very odd how allan who between ourselves said he to musgrave is a little wowf wowf ie crazed seems at times to have more sense than us all put together observe him now  yes continued allan fixing his eyes with a ghastly stare upon the opposite side of the hall they may well begin as they are to end many a man will sleep this night upon the heath that when the martinmas wind shalt blow shall lie there stark enough and reck little of cold or lack of covering  do not forespeak us brother said angus that is not lucky  and what luck is it then that you expect said allan and straining his eyes until they almost started from their sockets he fell with a convulsive shudder into the arms of donald and his brother who knowing the nature of his fits had come near to prevent his fall they seated him upon a bench and supported him until he came to himself and was about to speak  for gods sake allan said his brother who knew the impression his mystical words were likely to make on many of the guests say nothing to discourage us  am i he who discourages you said allan let every man face his world as i shall face mine that which must come will come and we shall stride gallantly over many a field of victory ere we reach yon fatal slaughterplace or tread yon sable scaffolds  what slaughterplace what scaffolds exclaimed several voices for allans renown as a seer was generally established in the highlands  you will know that but too soon answered allan speak to me no more i am weary of your questions he then pressed his hand against his brow rested his elbow upon his knee and sunk into a deep reverie  send for annot lyle and the harp said angus in a whisper to his servant and let those gentlemen follow me who do not fear a highland breakfast  all accompanied their hospitable landlord excepting only lord menteith who lingered in one of the deep embrasures formed by the windows of the hall annot lyle shortly after glided into the room not ill described by lord menteith as being the lightest and most fairy figure that ever trode the turf by moonlight her stature considerably less than the ordinary size of women gave her the appearance of extreme youth insomuch that although she was near eighteen she might have passed for four years younger her figure hands and feet were formed upon a model of exquisite symmetry with the size and lightness of her person so that titania herself could scarce have found a more fitting representative her hair was a dark shade of the colour usually termed flaxen whose clustering ringlets suited admirably with her fair complexion and with the playful yet simple expression of her features when we add to these charms that annot in her orphan state seemed the gayest and happiest of maidens the reader must allow us to claim for her the interest of almost all who looked on her in fact it was impossible to find a more universal favourite and she often came among the rude inhabitants of the castle as allan himself in a poetical mood expressed it like a sunbeam on a sullen sea communicating to all others the cheerfulness that filled her own mind  annot such as we have described her smiled and blushed when on entering the apartment lord menteith came from his place of retirement and kindly wished her goodmorning  and goodmorning to you my lord returned she extending her hand to her friend we have seldom seen you of late at the castle and now i fear it is with no peaceful purpose  at least let me not interrupt your harmony annot said lord menteith though my arrival may breed discord elsewhere my cousin allan needs the assistance of your voice and music  my preserver said annot lyle has a right to my poor exertions and you too my lordyou too are my preserver and were the most active to save a life that is worthless enough unless it can benefit my protectors  so saying she sate down at a little distance upon the bench on which allan maulay was placed and tuning her clairshach a small harp about thirty inches in height she accompanied it with her voice the air was an ancient gaelic melody and the words which were supposed to be very old were in the same language but we subjoin a translation of them by secundus macpherson esq of glenforgen which although submitted to the fetters of english rhythm we trust will be found nearly as genuine as the version of ossian by his celebrated namesake       birds of omen dark and foul      nightcrow raven bat and owl      leave the sick man to his dream      all night long he heard your scream      haste to cave

thy dark palfrey and begone      thou darest not face the godlike sun  as the strain proceeded allan maulay gradually gave signs of recovering his presence of mind and attention to the objects around him the deepknit furrows of his brow relaxed and smoothed themselves and the rest of his features which had seemed contorted with internal agony relapsed into a more natural state when he raised his head and sat upright his countenance though still deeply melancholy was divested of its wildness and ferocity and in its composed state although by no means handsome the expression of his features was striking manly and even noble his thick brown eyebrows which had hitherto been drawn close together were now slightly separated as in the natural state and his grey eyes which had rolled and flashed from under them with an unnatural and portentous gleam now recovered a steady and determined expression  thank god he said after sitting silent for about a minute until the very last sounds of the harp had ceased to vibrate my soul is no longer darkenedthe mist hath passed from my spirit  you owe thanks cousin allan said lord menteith coming forward to annot lyle as well as to heaven for this happy change in your melancholy mood  my noble cousin menteith said allan rising and greeting him very respectfully as well as kindly has known my unhappy circumstances so long that his goodness will require no excuse for my being thus late in bidding him welcome to the castle  we are too old acquaintances allan said lord menteith and too good friends to stand on the ceremonial of outward greeting but half the highlands will be here today and you know with our mountain chiefs ceremony must not be neglected what will you give little annot for making you fit company to meet evan dhu and i know not how many bonnets and feathers  what will he give me said annot smiling nothing less i hope than the best ribbon at the fair of doune  the fair of doune annot said allan sadly there will be bloody work before that day and i may never see it but you have well reminded me of what i have long intended to do  having said this he left the room  should he talk long in this manner said lord menteith you must keep your harp in tune my dear annot  i hope not said annot anxiously this fit has been a long one and probably will not soon return it is fearful to see a mind naturally generous and affectionate afflicted by this constitutional malady  as she spoke in a low and confidential tone lord menteith naturally drew close and stooped forward that he might the better catch the sense of what she said when allan suddenly entered the apartment they as naturally drew back from each other with a manner expressive of consciousness as if surprised in a conversation which they wished to keep secret from him this did not escape allans observation he stopt short at the door of the apartmenthis brows were contractedhis eyes rolled but it was only the paroxysm of a moment he passed his broad sinewy hand across his brow as if to obliterate these signs of emotion and advanced towards annot holding in his hand a very small box made of oakwood curiously inlaid i take you to witness he said cousin menteith that i give this box and its contents to annot lyle it contains a few ornaments that belonged to my poor motherof trifling value you may guess for the wife of a highland laird has seldom a rich jewelcasket  but these ornaments said annot lyle gently and timidly refusing the box belong to the familyi cannot accept  they belong to me alone annot said allan interrupting her they were my mothers dying bequest they are all i can call my own except my plaid and my claymore take them thereforethey are to me valueless trinketsand keep them for my sakeshould i never return from these wars  so saying he opened the case and presented it to annot if said he they are of any value dispose of them for your own support when this house has been consumed with hostile fire and can no longer afford you protection but keep one ring in memory of allan who has done to requite your kindness if not all he wished at least all he could  annot lyle endeavoured in vain to restrain the gathering tears when she said one ring allan i will accept from you as a memorial of your goodness to a poor orphan but do not press me to take more for i cannot and will not accept a gift of such disproportioned value  make your choice then said allan your delicacy may be well founded the others will assume a shape in which they may be more useful to you  think not of it said annot choosing from the contents of the casket a ring apparently the most trifling in value which it contained keep them for your own or your brothers bridebut good heavens she said interrupting herself and looking at the ring what is this that i have chosen  allan hastened to look upon it with eyes of gloomy apprehension it bore in enamel a deaths head above two crossed daggers when allan recognised the device he uttered a sigh so deep that she dropped the ring from her hand which rolled upon the floor lord menteith picked it up and returned it to the terrified annot  i take god to witness said allan in a solemn tone that your hand young lord and not mine has again delivered to her this illomened gift it was the mourning ring worn by my mother in memorial of her murdered brother  i fear no omens said annot smiling through her tears and nothing coming through the hands of my two patrons so she was wont to call lord menteith and allan can bring bad luck to the poor orphan  she put the ring on her finger and turning to her harp sung to a lively air the following verses of one of the fashionable songs of the period which had found its way marked as it was with the quaint hyperbolical taste of king charless time from some court masque to the wilds of perthshire       gaze not upon the stars fond sage      in them no influence lies      to read the fate of youth or age      look on my helens eyes       yet rash astrologer refrain      too dearly would be won      the prescience of anothers pain      if purchased by thine own  she is right allan said lord menteith and this end of an old song is worth all we shall gain by our attempt to look into futurity  she is wrong my lord said allan sternly though you who treat with lightness the warnings i have given you may not live to see the event of the omenlaugh not so scornfully he added interrupting himself or rather laugh on as loud and as long as you will your term of laughter will find a pause ere long  i care not for your visions allan said lord menteith however short my span of life the eye of no highland seer can see its termination  for heavens sake said annot lyle interrupting him you know his nature and how little he can endure  fear me not said allan interrupting hermy mind is now constant and calmbut for you young lord said he turning to lord menteith my eye has sought you through fields of battle where highlanders and lowlanders lay strewed as thick as ever the rooks sat on those ancient trees pointing to a rookery which was seen from the windowmy eye sought you but your corpse was not theremy eye sought you among a train of unresisting and disarmed captives drawn up within the bounding walls of an ancient and rugged fortressflash after flashplatoon after platoonthe hostile shot fell amongst them they dropped like the dry leaves in autumn but you were not among their ranksscaffolds were preparedblocks were arranged sawdust was spreadthe priest was ready with his book the headsman with his axebut there too mine eye found you not  the gibbet then i suppose must be my doom said lord menteith yet i wish they had spared me the halter were it but for the dignity of the peerage  he spoke this scornfully yet not without a sort of curiosity and a wish to receive an answer for the desire of prying into futurity frequently has some influence even on the minds of those who disavow all belief in the possibility of such predictions  your rank my lord will suffer no dishonour in your person or by the manner of your death three times have i seen a highlander plant his dirk in your bosomand such will be your fate  i wish you would describe him to me said lord menteith and i shall save him the trouble of fulfilling your prophecy if his plaid be passible to sword or pistol  your weapons said allan would avail you little nor can i give you the information you desire the face of the vision has been ever averted from me  so be it then said lord menteith and let it rest in the uncertainty in which your augury has placed it i shall dine not the less merrily among plaids and dirks and kilts today  it may be so said allan and it may be you do well to enjoy these moments which to me are poisoned by auguries of future evil but i he continuedi repeat to you that this weaponthat is such a weapon as this touching the hilt of the dirk which he wore carries your fate in the meanwhile said lord menteith you allan have frightened the blood from the cheeks of annot lylelet us leave this discourse my friend and go to see what we both understandthe progress of our military preparations  they joined angus maulay and his english guests and in the military discussions which immediately took place allan showed a clearness of mind strength of judgment and precision of thought totally inconsistent with the mystical light in which his character has been hitherto exhibited    chapter vii       when albin her claymore indignantly draws      when her bonneted chieftains around her shall crowd      clanranald the dauntless and moray the proud      all plaided and plumed in their tartan arraylocheils warning  whoever saw that morning the castle of darnlinvarach beheld a busy and a gallant sight  the various chiefs arriving with their different retinues which notwithstanding their numbers formed no more than their usual equipage and bodyguard upon occasions of solemnity saluted the lord of the castle and each other with overflowing kindness or with haughty and distant politeness according to the circumstances of friendship or hostility in which their clans had recently stood to each other each chief however small his comparative importance showed the full disposition to exact from the rest the deference due to a separate and independent prince while the stronger and more powerful divided among themselves by recent contentions or ancient feuds were constrained in policy to use great deference to the feelings of their less powerful brethren in order in case of need to attach as many wellwishers as might be to their own interest and standard thus the meeting of chiefs resembled not a little those ancient diets of the empire where the smallest freygraf who possessed a castle perched upon a barren crag with a few hundred acres around it claimed the state and honours of a sovereign prince and a seat according to his rank among the dignitaries of the empire  the followers of the different leaders were separately arranged and accommodated as room and circumstances best permitted each retaining however his henchman who waited close as the shadow upon his person to execute whatever might be required by his patron  the exterior of the castle afforded a singular scene the highlanders from different islands glens and straths eyed each other at a distance with looks of emulation inquisitive curiosity or hostile malevolence but the most astounding part of the assembly at least to a lowland ear was the rival performance of the bagpipers these warlike minstrels who had the highest opinion each of the superiority of his own tribe joined to the most overweening idea of the importance connected with his profession at first performed their various pibrochs in front each of his own clan at length however as the blackcocks towards the end of the season when in sportsmans language they are said to flock or crowd attracted together by the sound of each others triumphant crow even so did the pipers swelling their plaids and tartans in the same triumphant manner in which the birds ruffle up their feathers begin to approach each other within such distance as might give to their brethren a sample of their skill walking within a short interval and eyeing each other with looks in which selfimportance and defiance might be traced they strutted puffed and plied their screaming instruments each playing his own favourite tune with such a din that if an italian musician had lain buried within ten miles of them he must have risen from the dead to run out of hearing  the chieftains meanwhile had assembled in close conclave in the great hall of the castle among them were the persons of the greatest consequence in the highlands some of them attracted by zeal for the royal cause and many by aversion to that severe and general domination which the marquis of argyle since his rising to such influence in the state had exercised over his highland neighbours that statesman indeed though possessed of considerable abilities and great power had failings which rendered him unpopular among the highland chiefs the devotion which he professed was of a morose and fanatical character his ambition appeared to be insatiable and inferior chiefs complained of his want of bounty and liberality add to this that although a highlander and of a family distinguished for valour before and since gillespie grumach grumachillfavored which from an obliquity in his eyes was the personal distinction he bore in the highlands where titles of rank are unknown was suspected of being a better man in the cabinet than in the field he and his tribe were particularly obnoxious to the mdonalds and the mleans two numerous septs who though disunited by ancient feuds agreed in an intense dislike to the campbells or as they were called the children of diarmid  for some time the assembled chiefs remained silent until some one should open the business of the meeting at length one of the most powerful of them commenced the diet by sayingwe have been summoned hither maulay to consult of weighty matters concerning the kings affairs and those of the state and we crave to know by whom they are to be explained to us  maulay whose strength did not lie in oratory intimated his wish that lord menteith should open the business of the council with great modesty and at the same time with spirit that young lord said he wished what he was about to propose had come from some person of better known and more established character since however it lay with him to be spokesman he had to state to the chiefs assembled that those who wished to throw off the base yoke which fanaticism had endeavoured to wreath round their necks had not a moment to lose the covenanters he said after having twice made war upon their sovereign and having extorted from him every request reasonable or unreasonable which they thought proper to demandafter their chiefs had been loaded with dignities and favoursafter having publicly declared when his majesty after a gracious visit to the land of his nativity was upon his return to england that he returned a contented king from a contented peopleafter all this and without even the pretext for a national grievance the same men have upon doubts and suspicions equally dishonourable to the king and groundless in themselves detached a strong army to assist his rebels in england in a quarrel with which scotland had no more to do than she has with the wars in germany it was well he said that the eagerness with which this treasonable purpose was pursued had blinded the junta who now usurped the government of scotland to the risk which they were about to incur the army which they had dispatched to england under old leven comprehended their veteran soldiers the strength of those armies which had been levied in scotland during the two former wars  here captain dalgetty endeavoured to rise for the purpose of explaining how many veteran officers trained in the german wars were to his certain knowledge in the army of the earl of leven but allan maulay holding him down in his seat with one hand pressed the forefinger of the other upon his own lips and though with some difficulty prevented his interference captain dalgetty looked upon him with a very scornful and indignant air by which the others gravity was in no way moved and lord menteith proceeded without farther interruption  the moment he said was most favourable for all truehearted and loyal scotchmen to show that the reproach their country had lately undergone arose from the selfish ambition of a few turbulent and seditious men joined to the absurd fanaticism which disseminated from five hundred pulpits had spread like a landflood over the lowlands of scotland he had letters from the marquis of huntly in the north which he should show to the chiefs separately that nobleman equally loyal and powerful was determined to exert his utmost energy in the common cause and the powerful earl of seaforth was prepared to join the same standard from the earl of airly and the ogilvies in angusshire he had had communications equally decided and there was no doubt that these who with the hays leiths burnets and other loyal gentlemen would be soon on horseback would form a body far more than sufficient to overawe the northern covenanters who had already experienced their valour in the wellknown rout which was popularly termed the trot of turiff south of forth and tay he said the king had many friends who oppressed by enforced oaths compulsatory levies heavy taxes unjustly imposed and unequally levied by the tyranny of the committee of estates and the inquisitorial insolence of the presbyterian divines waited but the waving of the royal banner to take up arms douglas traquair roxburgh hume all friendly to the royal cause would counterbalance he said the covenanting interest in the south and two gentlemen of name and quality here present from the north of england would answer for the zeal of cumberland westmoreland and northumberland against so many gallant gentlemen the southern covenanters could but arm raw levies the whigamores of the western shires and the ploughmen and mechanics of the lowcountry for the west highlands he knew no interest which the covenanters possessed there except that of one individual as well known as he was odious but was there a single man who on casting his eye round this hall and recognising the power the gallantry and the dignity of the chiefs assembled could entertain a moments doubt of their success against the utmost force which gillespie grumach could collect against them he had only farther to add that considerable funds both of money and ammunition had been provided for the armyhere dalgetty pricked up his earsthat officers of ability and experience in the foreign wars one of whom was now present the captain drew himself up and looked round had engaged to train such levies as might require to be disciplinedand that a numerous body of auxiliary forces from ireland having been detached from the earl of antrim from ulster had successfully accomplished their descent upon the main land and with the assistance of clanranalds people having taken and fortified the castle of mingarry in spite of argyles attempts to intercept them were in full march to this place of rendezvous it only remained he said that the noble chiefs assembled laying aside every lesser consideration should unite heart and hand in the common cause send the fiery cross through their clans in order to collect their utmost force and form their junction with such celerity as to leave the enemy no time either for preparation or recovery from the panic which would spread at the first sound of their pibroch he himself he said though neither among the richest nor the most powerful of the scottish nobility felt that he had to support the dignity of an ancient and honourable house the independence of an ancient and honourable nation and to that cause he was determined to devote both life and fortune if those who were more powerful were equally prompt he trusted they would deserve the thanks of their king and the gratitude of posterity  loud applause followed this speech of lord menteith and testified the general acquiescence of all present in the sentiments which he had expressed but when the shout had died away the assembled chiefs continued to gaze upon each other as if something yet remained to be settled after some whispers among themselves an aged man whom his grey hairs rendered respectable although he was not of the highest order of chiefs replied to what had been said  thane of menteith he said you have well spoken nor is there one of us in whose bosom the same sentiments do not burn like fire but it is not strength alone that wins the fight it is the head of the commander as well as the arm of the soldier that brings victory i ask of you who is to raise and sustain the banner under which we are invited to rise and muster ourselves will it be expected that we should risk our children and the flower of our kinsmen ere we know to whose guidance they are to be intrusted this were leading those to slaughter whom by the laws of god and man it is our duty to protect where is the royal commission under which the lieges are to be convocated in arms simple and rude as we may be deemed we know something of the established rules of war as well as of the laws of our country nor will we arm ourselves against the general peace of scotland unless by the express commands of the king and under a leader fit to command such men as are here assembled  where would you find such a leader said another chief starting up saving the representative of the lord of the isles entitled by birth and hereditary descent to lead forth the array of every clan of the highlands and where is that dignity lodged save in the house of vich alister more  i acknowledge said another chief eagerly interrupting the speaker the truth in what has been first said but not the inference if vich alister more desires to be held representative of the lord of the isles let him first show his blood is redder than mine  that is soon tried said vich alister more laying his hand upon the basket hilt of his claymore lord menteith threw himself between them entreating and imploring each to remember that the interests of scotland the liberty of their country and the cause of their king ought to be superior in their eyes to any personal disputes respecting descent rank and precedence several of the highland chiefs who had no desire to admit the claims of either chieftain interfered to the same purpose and none with more emphasis than the celebrated evan dhu  i have come from my lakes he said as a stream descends from the hills not to turn again but to accomplish my course it is not by looking back to our own pretensions that we shall serve scotland or king charles my voice shall be for that general whom the king shall name who will doubtless possess those qualities which are necessary to command men like us highborn he must be or we shall lose our rank in obeying himwise and skilful or we shall endanger the safety of our peoplebravest among the brave or we shall peril our own honourtemperate firm and manly to keep us united such is the man that must command us are you prepared thane of menteith to say where such a general is to be found  there is but one said allan maulay and here he said laying his hand upon the shoulder of anderson who stood behind lord menteith here he stands  the general surprise of the meeting was expressed by an impatient murmur when anderson throwing back the cloak in which his face was muffled and stepping forward spoke thusi did not long intend to be a silent spectator of this interesting scene although my hasty friend has obliged me to disclose myself somewhat sooner than was my intention whether i deserve the honour reposed in me by this parchment will best appear from what i shall be able to do for the kings service it is a commission under the great seal to james graham earl of montrose to command those forces which are to be assembled for the service of his majesty in this kingdom  a loud shout of approbation burst from the assembly there was in fact no other person to whom in point of rank these proud mountaineers would have been disposed to submit his inveterate and hereditary hostility to the marquis of argyle insured his engaging in the war with sufficient energy while his wellknown military talents and his tried valour afforded every hope of his bringing it to a favourable conclusion    chapter viii       our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and      constant  a good plot good friends and full of expectation      an excellent plot very good friendshenry iv part i  no sooner had the general acclamation of joyful surprise subsided than silence was eagerly demanded for reading the royal commission and the bonnets which hitherto each chief had worn probably because unwilling to be the first to uncover were now at once vailed in honour of the royal warrant it was couched in the most full and ample terms authorizing the earl of montrose to assemble the subjects in arms for the putting down the present rebellion which divers traitors and seditious persons had levied against the king to the manifest forfaulture as it stated of their allegiance and to the breach of the pacification between the two kingdoms it enjoined all subordinate authorities to be obedient and assisting to montrose in his enterprise gave him the power of making ordinances and proclamations punishing misdemeanours pardoning criminals placing and displacing governors and commanders in fine it was as large and full a commission as any with which a prince could intrust a subject as soon as it was finished a shout burst from the assembled chiefs in testimony of their ready submission to the will of their sovereign not contented with generally thanking them for a reception so favourable montrose hastened to address himself to individuals the most important chiefs had already been long personally known to him but even to those of inferior consequence he now introduced himself and by the acquaintance he displayed with their peculiar designations and the circumstances and history of their clans he showed how long he must have studied the character of the mountaineers and prepared himself for such a situation as he now held  while he was engaged in these acts of courtesy his graceful manner expressive features and dignity of deportment made a singular contrast with the coarseness and meanness of his dress montrose possessed that sort of form and face in which the beholder at the first glance sees nothing extraordinary but of which the interest becomes more impressive the longer we gaze upon them his stature was very little above the middle size but in person he was uncommonly wellbuilt and capable both of exerting great force and enduring much fatigue in fact he enjoyed a constitution of iron without which he could not have sustained the trials of his extraordinary campaigns through all of which he subjected himself to the hardships of the meanest soldier he was perfect in all exercises whether peaceful or martial and possessed of course that graceful ease of deportment proper to those to whom habit has rendered all postures easy  his long brown hair according to the custom of men of quality among the royalists was parted on the top of his head and trained to hang down on each side in curled locks one of which descending two or three inches lower than the others intimated montroses compliance with that fashion against which it pleased mr prynne the puritan to write a treatise entitled the unloveliness of lovelocks the features which these tresses enclosed were of that kind which derive their interest from the character of the man rather than from the regularity of their form but a high nose a full decided wellopened quick grey eye and a sanguine complexion made amends for some coarseness and irregularity in the subordinate parts of the face so that altogether montrose might be termed rather a handsome than a hardfeatured man but those who saw him when his soul looked through those eyes with all the energy and fire of geniusthose who heard him speak with the authority of talent and the eloquence of nature were impressed with an opinion even of his external form more enthusiastically favourable than the portraits which still survive would entitle us to ascribe to it such at least was the impression he made upon the assembled chiefs of the mountaineers over whom as upon all persons in their state of society personal appearance has no small influence  in the discussions which followed his discovering himself montrose explained the various risks which he had run in his present undertaking his first attempt had been to assemble a body of loyalists in the north of england who in obedience to the orders of the marquis of newcastle he expected would have marched into scotland but the disinclination of the english to cross the border and the delay of the earl of antrim who was to have landed in the solway frith with his irish army prevented his executing this design other plans having in like manner failed he stated that he found himself under the necessity of assuming a disguise to render his passage secure through the lowlands in which he had been kindly assisted by his kinsman of menteith by what means allan maulay had come to know him he could not pretend to explain those who knew allans prophetic pretensions smiled mysteriously but he himself only replied that the earl of montrose need not be surprised if he was known to thousands of whom he himself could retain no memory  by the honour of a cavalier said captain dalgetty finding at length an opportunity to thrust in his word i am proud and happy in having an opportunity of drawing a sword under your lordships command and i do forgive all grudge malecontent and malice of my heart to mr allan maulay for having thrust me down to the lowest seat of the board yestreen certes he hath this day spoken so like a man having full command of his senses that i had resolved in my secret purpose that he was no way entitled to claim the privilege of insanity but since i was only postponed to a noble earl my future commanderinchief i do before you all recognise the justice of the preference and heartily salute allan as one who is to be his boncamarado  having made this speech which was little understood or attended to without putting off his military glove he seized on allans hand and began to shake it with violence which allan with a gripe like a smiths vice returned with such force as to drive the iron splents of the gauntlet into the hand of the wearer  captain dalgetty might have construed this into a new affront had not his attention as he stood blowing and shaking the injured member been suddenly called by montrose himself  hear this news he said captain dalgettyi should say major dalgettythe irish who are to profit by your military experience are now within a few leagues of us  our deerstalkers said angus maulay who were abroad to bring in venison for this honourable party have heard of a band of strangers speaking neither saxon nor pure gaelic and with difficulty making themselves understood by the people of the country who are marching this way in arms under the leading it is said of alaster mdonald who is commonly called young colkitto  these must be our men said montrose we must hasten to send messengers forward both to act as guides and to relieve their wants  the last said angus maulay will be no easy matter for i am informed that excepting muskets and a very little ammunition they want everything that soldiers should have and they are particularly deficient in money in shoes and in raiment  there is at least no use in saying so said montrose in so loud a tone the puritan weavers of glasgow shall provide them plenty of broadcloth when we make a descent from the highlands and if the ministers could formerly preach the old women of the scottish boroughs out of their webs of napery to make tents to the fellows on dunse law the covenanters encamped on dunse law during the troubles of 1639 i will try whether i have not a little interest both to make these godly dames renew their patriotic gift and the prickeared knaves their husbands open their purses  and respecting arms said captain dalgetty if your lordship will permit an old cavalier to speak his mind so that the onethird have muskets my darling weapon would be the pike for the remainder whether for resisting a charge of horse or for breaking the infantry a common smith will make a hundred pikeheads in a day here is plenty of wood for shafts and i will uphold that according to the best usages of war a strong battalion of pikes drawn up in the fashion of the lion of the north the immortal gustavus would beat the macedonian phalanx of which i used to read in the mareschalcollege when i studied in the ancient town of bonaccord and further i will venture to predicate  the captains lecture upon tactics was here suddenly interrupted by allan maulay who said hastilyroom for an unexpected and unwelcome guest  at the same moment the door of the hall opened and a greyhaired man of a very stately appearance presented himself to the assembly there was much dignity and even authority in his manner his stature was above the common size and his looks such as were used to command he cast a severe and almost stern glance upon the assembly of chiefs those of the higher rank among them returned it with scornful indifference but some of the western gentlemen of inferior power looked as if they wished themselves elsewhere  to which of this assembly said the stranger am i to address myself as leader or have you not fixed upon the person who is to hold an office at least as perilous as it is honourable  address yourself to me sir duncan campbell said montrose stepping forward  to you said sir duncan campbell with some scorn  yesto me repeated montroseto the earl of montrose if you have forgot him  i should now at least said sir duncan campbell have had some difficulty in recognising him in the disguise of a groomand yet i might have guessed that no evil influence inferior to your lordships distinguished as one who troubles israel could have collected together this rash assembly of misguided persons  i will answer unto you said montrose in the manner of your own puritans i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house but let us leave an altercation which is of little consequence but to ourselves and hear the tidings you have brought from your chief of argyle for i must conclude that it is in his name that you have come to this meeting  it is in the name of the marquis of argyle said sir duncan campbellin the name of the scottish convention of estates that i demand to know the meaning of this singular convocation if it is designed to disturb the peace of the country it were but acting like neighbours and men of honour to give us some intimation to stand upon our guard  it is a singular and new state of affairs in scotland said montrose turning from sir duncan campbell to the assembly when scottish men of rank and family cannot meet in the house of a common friend without an inquisitorial visit and demand on the part of our rulers to know the subject of our conference methinks our ancestors were accustomed to hold highland huntings or other purposes of meeting without asking the leave either of the great mcallum more himself or any of his emissaries or dependents  the times have been such in scotland answered one of the western chiefs and such they will again be when the intruders on our ancient possessions are again reduced to be lairds of lochow instead of overspreading us like a band of devouring locusts  am i to understand then said sir duncan that it is against my name alone that these preparations are directed or are the race of diarmid only to be sufferers in common with the whole of the peaceful and orderly inhabitants of scotland  i would ask said a wildlooking chief starting hastily up one question of the knight of ardenvohr ere he proceeds farther in his daring catechismhas he brought more than one life to this castle that he ventures to intrude among us for the purposes of insult  gentlemen said montrose let me implore your patience a messenger who comes among us for the purpose of embassy is entitled to freedom of speech and safeconduct and since sir duncan campbell is so pressing i care not if i inform him for his guidance that he is in an assembly of the kings loyal subjects convoked by me in his majestys name and authority and as empowered by his majestys royal commission  we are to have then i presume said sir duncan campbell a civil war in all its forms i have been too long a soldier to view its approach with anxiety but it would have been for my lord of montroses honour if in this matter he had consulted his own ambition less and the peace of the country more  those consulted their own ambition and selfinterest sir duncan answered montrose who brought the country to the pass in which it now stands and rendered necessary the sharp remedies which we are now reluctantly about to use  and what rank among these selfseekers said sir duncan campbell we shall assign to a noble earl so violently attached to the covenant that he was the first in 1639 to cross the tyne wading middle deep at the head of his regiment to charge the royal forces it was the same i think who imposed the covenant upon the burgesses and colleges of aberdeen at the point of sword and pike  i understand your sneer sir duncan said montrose temperately and i can only add that if sincere repentance can make amends for youthful error and for yielding to the artful representation of ambitious hypocrites i shall be pardoned for the crimes with which you taunt me i will at least endeavour to deserve forgiveness for i am here with my sword in my hand willing to spend the best blood of my body to make amends for my error and mortal man can do no more  well my lord said sir duncan i shall be sorry to carry back this language to the marquis of argyle i had it in farther charge from the marquis that to prevent the bloody feuds which must necessarily follow a highland war his lordship will be contented if terms of truce could be arranged to the north of the highland line as there is ground enough in scotland to fight upon without neighbours destroying each others families and inheritances  it is a peaceful proposal said montrose smiling such as it should be coming from one whose personal actions have always been more peaceful than his measures yet if the terms of such a truce could be equally fixed and if we can obtain security for that sir duncan is indispensablethat your marquis will observe these terms with strict fidelity i for my part should be content to leave peace behind us since we must needs carry war before us but sir duncan you are too old and experienced a soldier for us to permit you to remain in our leaguer and witness our proceedings we shall therefore when you have refreshed yourself recommend your speedy return to inverary and we shall send with you a gentleman on our part to adjust the terms of the highland armistice in case the marquis shall be found serious in proposing such a measure sir duncan campbell assented by a bow  my lord of menteith continued montrose will you have the goodness to attend sir duncan campbell of ardenvohr while we determine who shall return with him to his chief maulay will permit us to request that he be entertained with suitable hospitality  i will give orders for that said allan maulay rising and coming forward i love sir duncan campbell we have been joint sufferers in former days and i do not forget it now  my lord of menteith said sir duncan campbell i am grieved to see you at your early age engaged in such desperate and rebellious courses  i am young answered menteith yet old enough to distinguish between right and wrong between loyalty and rebellion and the sooner a good course is begun the longer and the better have i a chance of running it  and you too my friend allan maulay said sir duncan taking his hand must we also call each other enemies that have been so often allied against a common foe then turning round to the meeting he said farewell gentlemen there are so many of you to whom i wish well that your rejection of all terms of mediation gives me deep affliction may heaven he said looking upwards judge between our motives and those of the movers of this civil commotion  amen said montrose to that tribunal we all submit us  sir duncan campbell left the hall accompanied by allan maulay and lord menteith there goes a truebred campbell said montrose as the envoy departed for they are ever fair and false  pardon me my lord said evan dhu hereditary enemy as i am to their name i have ever found the knight of ardenvohr brave in war honest in peace and true in council  of his own disposition said montrose such he is undoubtedly but he now acts as the organ or mouthpiece of his chief the marquis the falsest man that ever drew breath and maulay he continued in a whisper to his host lest he should make some impression upon the inexperience of menteith or the singular disposition of your brother you had better send music into their chamber to prevent his inveigling them into any private conference  the devil a musician have i answered maulay excepting the piper who has nearly broke his wind by an ambitious contention for superiority with three of his own craft but i can send annot lyle and her harp and he left the apartment to give orders accordingly  meanwhile a warm discussion took place who should undertake the perilous task of returning with sir duncan to inverary to the higher dignitaries accustomed to consider themselves upon an equality even with mcallum more this was an office not to be proposed unto others who could not plead the same excuse it was altogether unacceptable one would have thought inverary had been the valley of the shadow of death the inferior chiefs showed such reluctance to approach it after a considerable hesitation the plain reason was at length spoken out namely that whatever highlander should undertake an office so distasteful to mcallum more he would be sure to treasure the offence in his remembrance and one day or other to make him bitterly repent of it  in this dilemma montrose who considered the proposed armistice as a mere stratagem on the part of argyle although he had not ventured bluntly to reject it in presence of those whom it concerned so nearly resolved to impose the danger and dignity upon captain dalgetty who had neither clan nor estate in the highlands upon which the wrath of argyle could wreak itself  but i have a neck though said dalgetty bluntly and what if he chooses to avenge himself upon that i have known a case where an honourable ambassador has been hanged as a spy before now neither did the romans use ambassadors much more mercifully at the siege of capua although i read that they only cut off their hands and noses put out their eyes and suffered them to depart in peace  by my honour captain dalgetty said montrose should the marquis contrary to the rules of war dare to practise any atrocity against you you may depend upon my taking such signal vengeance that all scotland shall ring of it  that will do but little for dalgetty returned the captain but corragio as the spaniard says with the land of promise full in view the moor of drumthwacket mea paupera regna as we said at mareschalcollege i will not refuse your excellencys commission being conscious it becomes a cavalier of honour to obey his commanders orders in defiance both of gibbet and sword  gallantly resolved said montrose and if you will come apart with me i will furnish you with the conditions to be laid before mcallum more upon which we are willing to grant him a truce for his highland dominions  with these we need not trouble our readers they were of an evasive nature calculated to meet a proposal which montrose considered to have been made only for the purpose of gaining time when he had put captain dalgetty in complete possession of his instructions and when that worthy making his military obeisance was near the door of his apartment montrose made him a sign to return  i presume said he i need not remind an officer who has served under the great gustavus that a little more is required of a person sent with a flag of truce than mere discharge of his instructions and that his general will expect from him on his return some account of the state of the enemys affairs as far as they come under his observation in short captain dalgetty you must be un peu clairvoyant  ah ha your excellency said the captain twisting his hard features into an inimitable expression of cunning and intelligence if they do not put my head in a poke which i have known practised upon honourable soldados who have been suspected to come upon such errands as the present your excellency may rely on a preceese narration of whatever dugald dalgetty shall hear or see were it even how many turns of tune there are in mcallum mores pibroch or how many checks in the sett of his plaid and trews  enough answered montrose farewell captain dalgetty and as they say that a ladys mind is always expressed in her postscript so i would have you think that the most important part of your commission lies in what i have last said to you  dalgetty once more grinned intelligence and withdrew to victual his charger and himself for the fatigues of his approaching mission  at the door of the stable for gustavus always claimed his first carehe met angus maulay and sir miles musgrave who had been looking at his horse and after praising his points and carriage both united in strongly dissuading the captain from taking an animal of such value with him upon his present very fatiguing journey  angus painted in the most alarming colours the roads or rather wild tracks by which it would be necessary for him to travel into argyleshire and the wretched huts or bothies where he would be condemned to pass the night and where no forage could be procured for his horse unless he could eat the stumps of old heather in short he pronounced it absolutely impossible that after undertaking such a pilgrimage the animal could be in any case for military service the englishman strongly confirmed all that angus had said and gave himself body and soul to the devil if he thought it was not an act little short of absolute murder to carry a horse worth a farthing into such a waste and inhospitable desert captain dalgetty for an instant looked steadily first at one of the gentlemen and next at the other and then asked them as if in a state of indecision what they would advise him to do with gustavus under such circumstances  by the hand of my father my dear friend answered maulay if you leave the beast in my keeping you may rely on his being fed and sorted according to his worth and quality and that upon your happy return you will find him as sleek as an onion boiled in butter  or said sir miles musgrave if this worthy cavalier chooses to part with his charger for a reasonable sum i have some part of the silver candlesticks still dancing the heys in my purse which i shall be very willing to transfer to his  in brief mine honourable friends said captain dalgetty again eyeing them both with an air of comic penetration i find it would not be altogether unacceptable to either of you to have some token to remember the old soldier by in case it shall please mcallum more to hang him up at the gate of his own castle and doubtless it would be no small satisfaction to me in such an event that a noble and loyal cavalier like sir miles musgrave or a worthy and hospitable chieftain like our excellent landlord should act as my executor  both hastened to protest that they had no such object and insisted again upon the impassable character of the highland paths angus maulay mumbled over a number of hard gaellic names descriptive of the difficult passes precipices corries and beals through which he said the road lay to inverary when old donald who had now entered sanctioned his masters account of these difficulties by holding up his hands and elevating his eyes and shaking his head at every gruttural which maulay pronounced but all this did not move the inflexible captain  my worthy friends said he gustavus is not new to the dangers of travelling and the mountains of bohemia and no disparagement to the beals and corries mr angus is pleased to mention and of which sir miles who never saw them confirms the horrors these mountains may compete with the vilest roads in europe in fact my horse hath a most excellent and social quality for although he cannot pledge in my cup yet we share our loaf between us and it will be hard if he suffers famine where cakes or bannocks are to be found and to cut this matter short i beseech you my good friends to observe the state of sir duncan campbells palfrey which stands in that stall before us fat and fair and in return for your anxiety an my account i give you my honest asseveration that while we travel the same road both that palfrey and his rider shall lack for food before either gustavus or i  having said this he filled a large measure with corn and walked up with it to his charger who by his low whinnying neigh his pricked ears and his pawing showed how close the alliance was betwixt him and his rider nor did he taste his corn until he had returned his masters caresses by licking his hands and face after this interchange of greeting the steed began to his provender with an eager dispatch which showed old military habits and the master after looking on the animal with great complacency for about five minutes saidmuch good may it do your honest heart gustavusnow must i go and lay in provant myself for the campaign  he then departed having first saluted the englishman and angus maulay who remained looking at each other for some time in silence and then burst out into a fit of laughter  that fellow said sir miles musgrave is formed to go through the world  i shall think so too said maulay if he can slip through mcallum mores fingers as easily as he has done through ours  do you think said the englishman that the marquis will not respect in captain dalgettys person the laws of civilized war  no more than i would respect a lowland proclamation said angus maulaybut come along it is time i were returning to my guests    chapter ix           in a rebellion      when whats not meet but what must be was law      then were they chosen in a better hour      let what is meet be said it must be meet      and throw their power i the dustcoriolanus in a small apartment remote from the rest of the guests assembled at the castle sir duncan campbell was presented with every species of refreshment and respectfully attended by lord menteith and by allan maulay his discourse with the latter turned upon a sort of hunting campaign in which they had been engaged together against the children of the mist with whom the knight of ardenvohr as well as the maulays had a deadly and irreconcilable feud sir duncan however speedily endeavoured to lead back the conversation to the subject of his present errand to the castle of darnlinvarach  it grieved him to the very heart he said to see that friends and neighbours who should stand shoulder to shoulder were likely to be engaged hand to hand in a cause which so little concerned them what signifies it he said to the highland chiefs whether king or parliament got uppermost were it not better to let them settle their own differences without interference while the chiefs in the meantime took the opportunity of establishing their own authority in a manner not to be called in question hereafter by either king or parliament he reminded allan maulay that the measures taken in the last reign to settle the peace as was alleged of the highlands were in fact levelled at the patriarchal power of the chieftains and he mentioned the celebrated settlement of the fife undertakers as they were called in the lewis as part of a deliberate plan formed to introduce strangers among the celtic tribes to destroy by degrees their ancient customs and mode of government and to despoil them of the inheritance of their fathers in the reign of james vi an attempt of rather an extraordinary kind was made to civilize the extreme northern part of the hebridean archipelago that monarch granted the property of the island of lewis as if it had been an unknown and savage country to a number of lowland gentlemen called undertakers chiefly natives of the shire of fife that they might colonize and settle there the enterprise was at first successful but the natives of the island macleods and mackenzies rose on the lowland adventurers and put most of them to the sword and yet he continued addressing allan it is for the purpose of giving despotic authority to the monarch by whom these designs have been nursed that so many highland chiefs are upon the point of quarrelling with and drawing the sword against their neighbours allies and ancient confederates it is to my brother said allan it is to the eldest son of my fathers house that the knight of ardenvohr must address these remonstrances i am indeed the brother of angus but in being so i am only the first of his clansmen and bound to show an example to the others by my cheerful and ready obedience to his commands  the cause also said lord menteith interposing is far more general than sir duncan campbell seems to suppose it it is neither limited to saxon nor to gael to mountain nor to strath to highlands nor to lowlands the question is if we will continue to be governed by the unlimited authority assumed by a set of persons in no respect superior to ourselves instead of returning to the natural government of the prince against whom they have rebelled and respecting the interest of the highlands in particular he added i crave sir duncan campbells pardon for my plainness but it seems very clear to me that the only effect produced by the present usurpation will be the aggrandisement of one overgrown clan at the expense of every independent chief in the highlands  i will not reply to you my lord said sir duncan campbell because i know your prejudices and from whom they are borrowed yet you will pardon my saying that being at the head of a rival branch of the house of graham i have both read of and known an earl of menteith who would have disdained to have been tutored in politics or to have been commanded in war by an earl of montrose  you will find it in vain sir duncan said lord menteith haughtily to set my vanity in arms against my principles the king gave my ancestors their title and rank and these shall never prevent my acting in the royal cause under any one who is better qualified than myself to be a commanderinchief least of all shall any miserable jealousy prevent me from placing my hand and sword under the guidance of the bravest the most loyal the most heroic spirit among our scottish nobility  pity said sir duncan campbell that you cannot add to this panegyric the farther epithets of the most steady and the most consistent but i have no purpose of debating these points with you my lord waving his hand as if to avoid farther discussion the die is cast with you allow me only to express my sorrow for the disastrous fate to which angus maulays natural rashness and your lordships influence are dragging my gallant friend allan here with his fathers clan and many a brave man besides  the die is cast for us all sir duncan replied allan looking gloomy and arguing on his own hypochondriac feelings the iron hand of destiny branded our fate upon our forehead long ere we could form a wish or raise a finger in our own behalf were this otherwise by what means does the seer ascertain the future from those shadowy presages which haunt his waking and his sleeping eye nought can be foreseen but that which is certain to happen  sir duncan campbell was about to reply and the darkest and most contested point of metaphysics might have been brought into discussion betwixt two highland disputants when the door opened and annot lyle with her clairshach in her hand entered the apartment the freedom of a highland maiden was in her step and in her eye for bred up in the closest intimacy with the laird of maulay and his brother with lord menteith and other young men who frequented darnlinvarach she possessed none of that timidity which a female educated chiefly among her own sex would either have felt or thought necessary to assume on an occasion like the present  her dress partook of the antique for new fashions seldom penetrated into the highlands nor would they easily have found their way to a castle inhabited chiefly by men whose sole occupation was war and the chase yet annots garments were not only becoming but even rich her open jacket with a high collar was composed of blue cloth richly embroidered and had silver clasps to fasten when it pleased the wearer its sleeves which were wide came no lower than the elbow and terminated in a golden fringe under this upper coat if it can be so termed she wore an under dress of blue satin also richly embroidered but which was several shades lighter in colour than the upper garment the petticoat was formed of tartan silk in the sett or pattern of which the colour of blue greatly predominated so as to remove the tawdry effect too frequently produced in tartan by the mixture and strong opposition of colours an antique silver chain hung round her neck and supported the wrest or key with which she turned her instrument a small ruff rose above her collar and was secured by a brooch of some value an old keepsake from lord menteith her profusion of light hair almost hid her laughing eyes while with a smile and a blush she mentioned that she had maulays directions to ask them if they chose music sir duncan campbell gazed with considerable surprise and interest at the lovely apparition which thus interrupted his debate with allan maulay  can this he said to him in a whisper a creature so beautiful and so elegant be a domestic musician of your brothers establishment  by no means answered allan hastily yet with some hesitation she is aanear relation of our familyand treated he added more firmly as an adopted daughter of our fathers house  as he spoke thus he arose from his seat and with that air of courtesy which every highlander can assume when it suits him to practise it he resigned it to annot and offered to her at the same time whatever refreshments the table afforded with an assiduity which was probably designed to give sir duncan an impression of her rank and consequence if such was allans purpose however it was unnecessary sir duncan kept his eyes fixed upon annot with an expression of much deeper interest than could have arisen from any impression that she was a person of consequence annot even felt embarrassed under the old knights steady gaze and it was not without considerable hesitation that tuning her instrument and receiving an assenting look from lord menteith and allan she executed the following ballad which our friend mr secundus mpherson whose goodness we had before to acknowledge has thus translated into the english tongue  the orphan maid       novembers hailcloud drifts away      novembers sunbeam wan      looks coldly on the castle grey      when forth comes lady anne       the orphan by the oak was set      her arms her feet were bare      the haildrops had not melted yet      amid her raven hair       and dame she said by all the ties      that child and mother know      aid one who never knew these joys      relieve an orphans woe       the lady said an orphans state      is hard and sad to bear      yet worse the widowd mothers fate      who mourns both lord and heir       twelve times the rolling year has sped      since when from vengeance wild      of fierce strathallans chief i fled      forths eddies whelmd my child       twelve times the year its course has born      the wandering maid replied      since fishers on st bridgets morn      drew nets on campsie side       st bridget sent no scaly spoil      an infant wellnigh dead      they saved and reard in want and toil      to beg from you her bread       that orphan maid the lady kissd      my husbands looks you bear      st bridget and her morn be blessd      you are his widows heir       theyve robed that maid so poor and pale      in silk and sandals rare      and pearls for drops of frozen hail      are glistening in her hair  the admirers of pure celtic antiquity notwithstanding the elegance of the above translation may be desirous to see a literal version from the original gaelic which we therefore subjoin and have only to add that the original is deposited with mr jedediah cleishbotham  literal translation       the hailblast had drifted away upon the wings of the gale      of autumn  the sun looked from between the clouds pale as      the wounded hero who rears his head feebly on the heath when      the roar of battle hath passed over him       finele the lady of the castle came forth to see her      maidens pass to the herds with their leglins milkpails       there sat an orphan maiden beneath the old oaktree of      appointment  the withered leaves fell around her and her      heart was more withered than they       the parent of the ice poetically taken from the frost      still congealed the haildrops in her hair they were like      the specks of white ashes on the twisted boughs of the      blackened and halfconsumed oak that blazes in the hall       and the maiden said give me comfort lady i am an orphan      child  and the lady replied how can i give that which i      have not  i am the widow of a slain lordthe mother of a      perished child  when i fled in my fear from the vengeance      of my husbands foes our bark was overwhelmed in the tide      and my infant perished  this was on st bridgets morn      near the strong lyns of campsie  may ill luck light upon      the day  and the maiden answered it was on st bridgets      morn and twelve harvests before this time that the      fishermen of campsie drew in their nets neither grilse nor      salmon but an infant half dead who hath since lived in      misery and must die unless she is now aided and the lady      answered blessed be saint bridget and her morn for these      are the dark eyes and the falcon look of my slain lord and      thine shall be the inheritance of his widow  and she      called for her waiting attendants and she bade them clothe      that maiden in silk and in samite and the pearls which      they wove among her black tresses were whiter than the      frozen haildrops  while the song proceeded lord menteith observed with some surprise that it appeared to produce a much deeper effect upon the mind of sir duncan campbell than he could possibly have anticipated from his age and character he well knew that the highlanders of that period possessed a much greater sensibility both for tale and song than was found among their lowland neighbours but even this he thought hardly accounted for the embarrassment with which the old man withdrew his eyes from the songstress as if unwilling to suffer them to rest on an object so interesting still less was it to be expected that features which expressed pride stern common sense and the austere habit of authority should have been so much agitated by so trivial a circumstance as the chiefs brow became clouded he drooped his large shaggy grey eyebrows until they almost concealed his eyes on the lids of which something like a tear might be seen to glisten he remained silent and fixed in the same posture for a minute or two after the last note had ceased to vibrate he then raised his head and having looked at annot lyle as if purposing to speak to her he as suddenly changed that purpose and was about to address allan when the door opened and the lord of the castle made his appearance    chapter x       dark on their journey lourd the gloomy day      wild were the hills and doubtful grew the way      more dark more gloomy and more doubtful showd      the mansion which received them from the road      the travellers a romance  angus maulay was charged with a message which he seemed to find some difficulty in communicating for it was not till after he had framed his speech several different ways and blundered them all that he succeeded in letting sir duncan campbell know that the cavalier who was to accompany him was waiting in readiness and that all was prepared for his return to inverary sir duncan campbell rose up very indignantly the affront which this message implied immediately driving out of his recollection the sensibility which had been awakened by the music  i little expected this he said looking indignantly at angus maulay i little thought that there was a chief in the west highlands who at the pleasure of a saxon would have bid the knight of ardenvohr leave his castle when the sun was declining from the meridian and ere the second cup had been filled but farewell sir the food of a churl does not satisfy the appetite when i next revisit darnlinvarach it shall be with a naked sword in one hand and a firebrand in the other  and if you so come said angus i pledge myself to meet you fairly though you brought five hundred campbells at your back and to afford you and them such entertainment that you shall not again complain of the hospitality of darnlinvarach  threatened men said sir duncan live long your turn for gasconading laird of maulay is too well known that men of honour should regard your vaunts to you my lord and to allan who have supplied the place of my churlish host i leave my thanksand to you pretty mistress he said addressing annot lyle this little token for having opened a fountain which hath been dry for many a year so saying he left the apartment and commanded his attendants to be summoned angus maulay equally embarrassed and incensed at the charge of inhospitality which was the greatest possible affront to a highlander did not follow sir duncan to the courtyard where mounting his palfrey which was in readiness followed by six mounted attendants and accompanied by the noble captain dalgetty who had also awaited him holding gustavus ready for action though he did not draw his girths and mount till sir duncan appeared the whole cavalcade left the castle  the journey was long and toilsome but without any of the extreme privations which the laird of maulay had prophesied in truth sir duncan was very cautious to avoid those nearer and more secret paths by means of which the county of argyle was accessible from the eastward for his relation and chief the marquis was used to boast that he would not for a hundred thousand crowns any mortal should know the passes by which an armed force could penetrate into his country  sir duncan campbell therefore rather shunned the highlands and falling into the lowcountry made for the nearest seaport in the vicinity where he had several halfdecked galleys or birlings as they were called at his command in one of these they embarked with gustavus in company who was so seasoned to adventure that land and sea seemed as indifferent to him as to his master  the wind being favourable they pursued their way rapidly with sails and oars and early the next morning it was announced to captain dalgetty then in a small cabin beneath the halldeck that the galley was under the walls of sir duncan campbells castle  ardenvohr accordingly rose high above him when he came upon the deck of the galley it was a gloomy square tower of considerable size and great height situated upon a headland projecting into the saltwater lake or arm of the sea which they had entered on the preceding evening a wall with flanking towers at each angle surrounded the castle to landward but towards the lake it was built so near the brink of the precipice as only to leave room for a battery of seven guns designed to protect the fortress from any insult from that side although situated too high to be of any effectual use according to the modern system of warfare  the eastern sun rising behind the old tower flung its shadow far on the lake darkening the deck of the galley on which captain dalgetty now walked waiting with some impatience the signal to land sir duncan campbell as he was informed by his attendants was already within the walls of the castle but no one encouraged the captains proposal of following him ashore until as they stated they should receive the direct permission or order of the knight of ardenvohr  in a short time afterwards the mandate arrived while a boat with a piper in the bow bearing the knight of ardenvohrs crest in silver upon his left arm and playing with all his might the family march entitled the campbells are coming approached to conduct the envoy of montrose to the castle of ardenvohr the distance between the galley and the beach was so short as scarce to require the assistance of the eight sturdy rowers in bonnets short coats and trews whose efforts sent the boat to the little creek in which they usually landed before one could have conceived that it had left the side of the birling two of the boatmen in spite of dalgettys resistance horsed the captain on the back of a third highlander and wading through the surf with him landed him high and dry upon the beach beneath the castle rock in the face of this rock there appeared something like the entrance of a lowbrowed cavern towards which the assistants were preparing to hurry our friend dalgetty when shaking himself loose from them with some difficulty he insisted upon seeing gustavus safely landed before he proceeded one step farther the highlanders could not comprehend what he meant until one who had picked up a little english or rather lowland scotch exclaimed houts its a about her horse ta useless baste farther remonstrance on the part of captain dalgetty was interrupted by the appearance of sir duncan campbell himself from the mouth of the cavern which we have described for the purpose of inviting captain dalgetty to accept of the hospitality of ardenvohr pledging his honour at the same time that gustavus should be treated as became the hero from whom he derived his name not to mention the important person to whom he now belonged notwithstanding this satisfactory guarantee captain dalgetty would still have hesitated such was his anxiety to witness the fate of his companion gustavus had not two highlanders seized him by the arms two more pushed him on behind while a fifth exclaimed hout awa wi the daft sassenach does she no hear the laird bidding her up to her ain castle wi her special voice and isna that very mickle honour for the like o her  thus impelled captain dalgetty could only for a short space keep a reverted eye towards the galley in which he had left the partner of his military toils in a few minutes afterwards he found himself involved in the total darkness of a staircase which entering from the lowbrowed cavern we have mentioned winded upwards through the entrails of the living rock  the cursed highland salvages muttered the captain half aloud what is to become of me if gustavus the namesake of the invincible lion of the protestant league should be lamed among their untenty hands  have no fear of that said the voice of sir duncan who was nearer to him than he imagined my men are accustomed to handle horses both in embarking and dressing them and you will soon see gustavus as safe as when you last dismounted from his back  captain dalgetty knew the world too well to offer any farther remonstrance whatever uneasiness he might suppress within his own bosom a step or two higher up the stair showed light and a door and an irongrated wicket led him out upon a gallery cut in the open face of the rock extending a space of about six or eight yards until he reached a second door where the path reentered the rock and which was also defended by an iron portcullis an admirable traverse observed the captain and if commanded by a fieldpiece or even a few muskets quite sufficient to ensure the place against a storming party  sir duncan campbell made no answer at the time but the moment afterwards when they had entered the second cavern he struck with the stick which he had in his hand first on the one side and then on the other of the wicket and the sullen ringing sound which replied to the blows made captain dalgetty sensible that there was a gun placed on each side for the purpose of raking the gallery through which they had passed although the embrasures through which they might be fired on occasion were masked on the outside with sods and loose stones having ascended the second staircase they found themselves again on an open platform and gallery exposed to a fire both of musketry and wallguns if being come with hostile intent they had ventured farther a third flight of steps cut in the rock like the former but not caverned over led them finally into the battery at the foot of the tower this last stair also was narrow and steep and not to mention the fire which might be directed on it from above one or two resolute men with pikes and battleaxes could have made the pass good against hundreds for the staircase would not admit two persons abreast and was not secured by any sort of balustrade or railing from the sheer and abrupt precipice on the foot of which the tide now rolled with a voice of thunder so that under the jealous precautions used to secure this ancient celtic fortress a person of weak nerves and a brain liable to become dizzy might have found it something difficult to have achieved the entrance to the castle even supposing no resistance had been offered  captain dalgetty too old a soldier to feel such tremors had no sooner arrived in the courtyard than he protested to god the defences of sir duncans castle reminded him more of the notable fortress of spandau situated in the march of brandenburg than of any place whilk it had been his fortune to defend in the course of his travels nevertheless he criticised considerably the mode of placing the guns on the battery we have noticed observing that where cannon were perched like to scarts or seagulls on the top of a rock he had ever observed that they astonished more by their noise than they dismayed by the skaith or damage which they occasioned  sir duncan without replying conducted the soldier into the tower the defences of which were a portcullis and ironclenched oaken door the thickness of the wall being the space between them he had no sooner arrived in a hall hung with tapestry than the captain prosecuted his military criticism it was indeed suspended by the sight of an excellent breakfast of which he partook with great avidity but no sooner had he secured this meal than he made the tour of the apartment examining the ground around the castle very carefully from each window in the room he then returned to his chair and throwing himself back into it at his length stretched out one manly leg and tapping his jackboot with the ridingrod which he carried in his hand after the manner of a halfbred man who affects ease in the society of his betters he delivered his unasked opinion as followsthis house of yours now sir duncan is a very pretty defensible sort of a tenement and yet it is hardly such as a cavaliero of honour would expect to maintain his credit by holding out for many days for sir duncan if it pleases you to notice your house is overcrowed and slighted or commanded as we military men say by yonder round hillock to the landward whereon an enemy might stell such a battery of cannon as would make ye glad to beat a chamade within fortyeight hours unless it pleased the lord extraordinarily to show mercy  there is no road replied sir duncan somewhat shortly by which cannon can be brought against ardenvohr the swamps and morasses around my house would scarce carry your horse and yourself excepting by such paths as could be rendered impassable within a few hours  sir duncan said the captain it is your pleasure to suppose so and yet we martial men say that where there is a seacoast there is always a naked side seeing that cannon and munition where they cannot be transported by land may be right easily brought by sea near to the place where they are to be put in action neither is a castle however secure in its situation to be accounted altogether invincible or as they say impregnable for i protest tye sir duncan that i have known twentyfive men by the mere surprise and audacity of the attack win at point of pike as strong a hold as this of ardenvohr and put to the sword captivate or hold to the ransom the defenders being ten times their own number  notwithstanding sir duncan campbells knowledge of the world and his power of concealing his internal emotion he appeared piqued and hurt at these reflections which the captain made with the most unconscious gravity having merely selected the subject of conversation as one upon which he thought himself capable of shining and as they say of laying down the law without exactly recollecting that the topic might not be equally agreeable to his landlord  to cut this matter short said sir duncan with an expression of voice and countenance somewhat agitated it is unnecessary for you to tell me captain dalgetty that a castle may be stormed if it is not valorously defended or surprised if it is not heedfully watched i trust this poor house of mine will not be found in any of these predicaments should even captain dalgetty himself choose to beleaguer it  for all that sir duncan answered the persevering commander i would premonish you as a friend to trace out a sconce upon that round hill with a good graffe or ditch whilk may be easily accomplished by compelling the labour of the boors in the vicinity it being the custom of the valorous gustavus adolphus to fight as much by the spade and shovel as by sword pike and musket also i would advise you to fortify the said sconce not only by a foussie or graffe but also by certain stackets or palisadeshere sir duncan becoming impatient left the apartment the captain following him to the door and raising his voice as he retreated until he was fairly out of hearingthe whilk stackets or palisades should be artificially framed with reentering angles and loopholes or crenelles for musketry whereof it shall arise that the foemanthe highland brute the old highland brute they are as proud as peacocks and as obstinate as tupsand here he has missed an opportunity of making his house as pretty an irregular fortification as an invading army ever broke their teeth uponbut i see he continued looking own from the window upon the bottom of the precipice they have got gustavus safe ashoreproper fellow i would know that toss of his head among a whole squadron i must go to see what they are to make of him  he had no sooner reached however the court to the seaward and put himself in the act of descending the staircase than two highland sentinels advancing their lochaber axes gave him to understand that this was a service of danger  diavolo said the soldier and i have got no password i could not speak a syllable of their salvage gibberish an it were to save me from the provostmarshal  i will be your surety captain dalgetty said sir duncan who had again approached him without his observing from whence and we will go together and see how your favourite charger is accommodated  he conducted him accordingly down the staircase to the beach and from thence by a short turn behind a large rock which concealed the stables and other offices belonging to the castle captain dalgetty became sensible at the same time that the side of the castle to the land was rendered totally inaccessible by a ravine partly natural and partly scarped with great care and labour so as to be only passed by a drawbridge still however the captain insisted not withstanding the triumphant air with which sir duncan pointed out his defences that a sconce should be erected on drumsnab the round eminence to the east of the castle in respect the house might be annoyed from thence by burning bullets full of fire shot out of cannon according to the curious invention of stephen bathian king of poland whereby that prince utterly ruined the great muscovite city of moscow this invention captain dalgetty owned he had not yet witnessed but observed that it would give him particular delectation to witness the same put to the proof against ardenvohr or any other castle of similar strength observing that so curious an experiment could not but afford the greatest delight to all admirers of the military art  sir duncan campbell diverted this conversation by carrying the soldier into his stables and suffering him to arrange gustavus according to his own will and pleasure after this duty had been carefully performed captain dalgetty proposed to return to the castle observing it was his intention to spend the time betwixt this and dinner which he presumed would come upon the parade about noon in burnishing his armour which having sustained some injury from the seaair might he was afraid seem discreditable in the eyes of mcallum more yet while they were returning to the castle he failed not to warn sir duncan campbell against the great injury he might sustain by any sudden onfall of an enemy whereby his horses cattle and granaries might be cut off and consumed to his great prejudice wherefore he again strongly conjured him to construct a sconce upon the round hill called drumsnab and offered his own friendly services in lining out the same to this disinterested advice sir duncan only replied by ushering his guest to his apartment and informing him that the tolling of the castle bell would make him aware when dinner was ready    chapter xi       is this thy castle baldwin  melancholy      displays her sable banner from the donjon      darkening the foam of the whole surge beneath      were i a habitant to see this gloom      pollute the face of nature and to hear      the ceaseless sound of wave and seabirds scream      id wish me in the hut that poorest peasant      eer framed to give him temporary shelterbrown  the gallant rittmaster would willingly have employed his leisure in studying the exterior of sir duncans castle and verifying his own military ideas upon the nature of its defences but a stout sentinel who mounted guard with a lochaberaxe at the door of his apartment gave him to understand by very significant signs that he was in a sort of honourable captivity  it is strange thought the rittmaster to himself how well these salvages understand the rules and practique of war who should have presupposed their acquaintance with the maxim of the great and godlike gustavus adolphus that a flag of truce should be half a messenger half a spyand having finished burnishing his arms he sate down patiently to compute how much half a dollar per diem would amount to at the end of a sixmonths campaign and when he had settled that problem proceeded to the more abstruse calculations necessary for drawing up a brigade of two thousand men on the principle of extracting the square root  from his musings he was roused by the joyful sound of the dinner bell on which the highlander lately his guard became his gentlemanusher and marshalled him to the hall where a table with four covers bore ample proofs of highland hospitality sir duncan entered conducting his lady a tall faded melancholy female dressed in deep mourning they were followed by a presbyterian clergyman in his geneva cloak and wearing a black silk skullcap covering his short hair so closely that it could scarce be seen at all so that the unrestricted ears had an undue predominance in the general aspect this ungraceful fashion was universal at the time and partly led to the nicknames of roundheads prickeared curs and so forth which the insolence of the cavaliers liberally bestowed on their political enemies  sir duncan presented his military guest to his lady who received his technical salutation with a stiff and silent reverence in which it could scarce be judged whether pride or melancholy had the greater share the churchman to whom he was next presented eyed him with a glance of mingled dislike and curiosity  the captain well accustomed to worse looks from more dangerous persons cared very little either for those of the lady or of the divine but bent his whole soul upon assaulting a huge piece of beef which smoked at the nether end of the table but the onslaught as he would have termed it was delayed until the conclusion of a very long grace betwixt every section of which dalgetty handled his knife and fork as he might have done his musket or pike when going upon action and as often resigned them unwillingly when the prolix chaplain commenced another clause of his benediction sir duncan listened with decency though he was supposed rather to have joined the covenanters out of devotion to his chief than real respect for the cause either of liberty or of presbytery his lady alone attended to the blessing with symptoms of deep acquiescence  the meal was performed almost in carthusian silence for it was none of captain dalgettys habits to employ his mouth in talking while it could be more profitably occupied sir duncan was absolutely silent and the lady and churchman only occasionally exchanged a few words spoken low and indistinctly  but when the dishes were removed and their place supplied by liquors of various sorts captain dalgetty no longer had himself the same weighty reasons for silence and began to tire of that of the rest of the company he commenced a new attack upon his landlord upon the former ground  touching that round monticle or hill or eminence termed drumsnab i would be proud to hold some dialogue with you sir duncan on the nature of the sconce to be there constructed and whether the angles thereof should be acute or obtuseanent whilk i have heard the great veltmareschal bannier hold a learned argument with general tiefenbach during a stillstand of arms  captain dalgetty answered sir duncan very dryly it is not our highland usage to debate military points with strangers this castle is like to hold out against a stronger enemy than any force which the unfortunate gentlemen we left at darnlinvarach are able to bring against it  a deep sigh from the lady accompanied the conclusion of her husbands speech which seemed to remind her of some painful circumstance  he who gave said the clergyman addressing her in a solemn tone hath taken away may you honourable lady be long enabled to say blessed be his name  to this exhortation which seemed intended for her sole behoof the lady answered by an inclination of her head more humble than captain dalgetty had yet observed her make supposing he should now find her in a more conversible humour he proceeded to accost her  it is indubitably very natural that your ladyship should be downcast at the mention of military preparations whilk i have observed to spread perturbation among women of all nations and almost all conditions nevertheless penthesilea in ancient times and also joan of arc and others were of a different kidney and as i have learned while i served the spaniard the duke of alva in former times had the leaguerlasses who followed his camp marshalled into tertias whilk me call regiments and officered and commanded by those of their own feminine gender and regulated by a commanderin chief called in german hureweibler or as we would say vernacularly captain of the queans true it is they were persons not to be named as parallel to your ladyship being such quae quaestum corporibus faciebant as we said of jean drochiels at mareschalcollege the same whom the french term curtisannes and we in scottish  the lady will spare you the trouble of further exposition captain dalgetty said his host somewhat sternly to which the clergyman added that such discourse better befitted a watchtower guarded by profane soldiery than the board of an honourable person and the presence of a lady of quality  craving your pardon dominie or doctor aut quocunque alio nomine gaudes for i would have you to know i have studied polite letters said the unabashed envoy filling a great cup of wine i see no ground for your reproof seeing i did not speak of those turpes personae as if their occupation or character was a proper subject of conversation for this ladys presence but simply par accidens as illustrating the matter in hand namely their natural courage and audacity much enhanced doubtless by the desperate circumstances of their condition  captain dalgetty said sir duncan campbell to break short this discourse i must acquaint you that i have some business to dispatch tonight in order to enable me to ride with you tomorrow towards inverary and therefore  to ride with this person tomorrow exclaimed his lady such cannot be your purpose sir duncan unless you have forgotten that the morrow is a sad anniversary and dedicated to as sad a solemnity  i had not forgotten answered sir duncan how is it possible i can ever forget but the necessity of the times requires i should send this officer onward to inverary without loss of time  yet surely not that you should accompany him in person enquired the lady  it were better i did said sir duncan yet i can write to the marquis and follow on the subsequent daycaptain dalgetty i will dispatch a letter for you explaining to the marquis of argyle your character and commission with which you will please to prepare to travel to inverary early tomorrow morning  sir duncan campbell said dalgetty i am doubtless at your discretionary disposal in this matter not the less i pray you to remember the blot which will fall upon your own escutcheon if you do in any way suffer me being a commissionate flag of truce to be circumvented in this matter whether clam vi vel precario i do not say by your assent to any wrong done to me but even through absence of any due care on your part to prevent the same  you are under the safeguard of my honour sir answered sir duncan campbell and that is more than a sufficient security and now continued he rising i must set the example of retiring  dalgetty saw himself under the necessity of following the hint though the hour was early but like a skilful general he availed himself of every instant of delay which circumstances permitted trusting to your honourable parole said he filling his cup i drink to you sir duncan and to the continuance of your honourablehouse a sigh from sir duncan was the only reply also madam said the soldier replenishing the quaigh with all possible dispatch i drink to your honourable health and fulfilment of all your virtuous desiresand reverend sir not forgetting to fit the action to the words i fill this cup to the drowning of all unkindness betwixt you and captain dalgettyi should say majorand in respect the flagon contains but one cup more i drink to the health of all honourable cavaliers and brave soldadosand the flask being empty i am ready sir duncan to attend your functionary or sentinel to my place of private repose  he received a formal permission to retire and an assurance that as the wine seemed to be to his taste another measure of the same vintage should attend him presently in order to soothe the hours of his solitude  no sooner had the captain reached the apartment than this promise was fulfilled and in a short time afterwards the added comforts of a pasty of reddeer venison rendered him very tolerant both of confinement and want of society the same domestic a sort of chamberlain who placed this good cheer in his apartment delivered to dalgetty a packet sealed and tied up with a silken thread according to the custom of the time addressed with many forms of respect to the high and mighty prince archibald marquis of argyle lord of lorne and so forth the chamberlain at the same time apprized the rittmaster that he must take horse at an early hour for inverary where the packet of sir duncan would be at once his introduction and his passport not forgetting that it was his object to collect information as well as to act as an envoy and desirous for his own sake to ascertain sir duncans reasons for sending him onward without his personal attendance the rittmaster enquired the domestic with all the precaution that his experience suggested what were the reasons which detained sir duncan at home on the succeeding day the man who was from the lowlands replied that it was the habit of sir duncan and his lady to observe as a day of solemn fast and humiliation the anniversary on which their castle had been taken by surprise and their children to the number of four destroyed cruelly by a band of highland freebooters during sir duncans absence upon an expedition which the marquis of argyle had undertaken against the macleans of the isle of mull  truly said the soldier your lord and lady have some cause for fast and humiliation nevertheless i will venture to pronounce that if he had taken the advice of any experienced soldier having skill in the practiques of defending places of advantage he would have built a sconce upon the small hill which is to the left of the drawbrigg and this i can easily prove to you mine honest friend for holding that pasty to be the castlewhats your name friend  lorimer sir replied the man  here is to your health honest lorimeri say lorimerholding that pasty to be the main body or citadel of the place to be defended and taking the marrowbone for the sconce to be erected  i am sorry sir said lorimer interrupting him that i cannot stay to hear the rest of your demonstration but the bell will presently ring as worthy mr graneangowl the marquiss own chaplain does family worship and only seven of our household out of sixty persons understand the scottish tongue it would misbecome any one of them to be absent and greatly prejudice me in the opinion of my lady there are pipes and tobacco sir if you please to drink a whiff of smoke and if you want anything else it shall be forthcoming two hours hence when prayers are over so saying he left the apartment  no sooner was he gone than the heavy toll of the castlebell summoned its inhabitants together and was answered by the shrill clamour of the females mixed with the deeper tones of the men as talking earse at the top of their throats they hurried from different quarters by a long but narrow gallery which served as a communication to many rooms and among others to that in which captain dalgetty was stationed there they go as if they were beating to the rollcall thought the soldier to himself if they all attend the parade i will look out take a mouthful of fresh air and make mine own observations on the practicabilities of this place  accordingly when all was quiet he opened his chamber door and prepared to leave it when he saw his friend with the axe advancing towards him from the distant end of the gallery half whistling a gaelic tune to have shown any want of confidence would have been at once impolitic and unbecoming his military character so the captain putting the best face upon his situation he could whistled a swedish retreat in a tone still louder than the notes of his sentinel and retreating pace by pace with an air of indifference as if his only purpose had been to breathe a little fresh air he shut the door in the face of his guard when the fellow had approached within a few paces of him  it is very well thought the rittmaster to himself he annuls my parole by putting guards upon me for as we used to say at mareschalcollege fides et fiducia sunt relativa see note i and if he does not trust my word i do not see how i am bound to keep it if any motive should occur for my desiring to depart from it surely the moral obligation of the parole is relaxed in as far as physical force is substituted instead thereof  thus comforting himself in the metaphysical immunities which he deduced from the vigilance of his sentinel rittmaster dalgetty retired to his apartment where amid the theoretical calculations of tactics and the occasional more practical attacks on the flask and pasty he consumed the evening until it was time to go to repose he was summoned by lorimer at break of day who gave him to understand that when he had broken his fast for which he produced ample materials his guide and horse were in attendance for his journey to inverary after complying with the hospitable hint of the chamberlain the soldier proceeded to take horse in passing through the apartments he observed that domestics were busily employed in hanging the great hall with black cloth a ceremony which he said he had seen practised when the immortal gustavus adolphus lay in state in the castle of wolgast and which therefore he opined was a testimonial of the strictest and deepest mourning  when dalgetty mounted his steed he found himself attended or perhaps guarded by five or six campbells well armed commanded by one who from the target at his shoulder and the short cocks feather in his bonnet as well as from the state which he took upon himself claimed the rank of a dunniewassel or clansman of superior rank and indeed from his dignity of deportment could not stand in a more distant degree of relationship to sir duncan than that of tenth or twelfth cousin at farthest but it was impossible to extract positive information on this or any other subject inasmuch as neither this commander nor any of his party spoke english the captain rode and his military attendants walked but such was their activity and so numerous the impediments which the nature of the road presented to the equestrian mode of travelling that far from being retarded by the slowness of their pace his difficulty was rather in keeping up with his guides he observed that they occasionally watched him with a sharp eye as if they were jealous of some effort to escape and once as he lingered behind at crossing a brook one of the gillies began to blow the match of his piece giving him to understand that he would run some risk in case of an attempt to part company dalgetty did not augur much good from the close watch thus maintained upon his person but there was no remedy for an attempt to escape from his attendants in an impervious and unknown country would have been little short of insanity he therefore plodded patiently on through a waste and savage wilderness treading paths which were only known to the shepherds and cattledrivers and passing with much more of discomfort than satisfaction many of those sublime combinations of mountainous scenery which now draw visitors from every corner of england to feast their eyes upon highland grandeur and mortify their palates upon highland fare  at length they arrived on the southern verge of that noble lake upon which inverary is situated and a bugle which the dunniewassel winded till rock and greenwood rang served as a signal to a wellmanned galley which starting from a creek where it lay concealed received the party on board including gustavus which sagacious quadruped an experienced traveller both by water and land walked in and out of the boat with the discretion of a christian  embarked on the bosom of loch fine captain dalgetty might have admired one of the grandest scenes which nature affords he might have noticed the rival rivers aray and shiray which pay tribute to the lake each issuing from its own dark and wooded retreat he might have marked on the soft and gentle slope that ascends from the shores the noble old gothic castle with its varied outline embattled walls towers and outer and inner courts which so far as the picturesque is concerned presented an aspect much more striking than the present massive and uniform mansion he might have admired those dark woods which for many a mile surrounded this strong and princely dwelling and his eye might have dwelt on the picturesque peak of duniquoich starting abruptly from the lake and raising its scathed brow into the mists of middle sky while a solitary watchtower perched on its top like an eagles nest gave dignity to the scene by awakening a sense of possible danger all these and every other accompaniment of this noble scene captain dalgetty might have marked if he had been so minded but to confess the truth the gallant captain who had eaten nothing since daybreak was chiefly interested by the smoke which ascended from the castle chimneys and the expectations which this seemed to warrant of his encountering an abundant stock of provant as he was wont to call supplies of this nature  the boat soon approached the rugged pier which abutted into the loch from the little town of inverary then a rude assemblage of huts with a very few stone mansions interspersed stretching upwards from the banks of loch fine to the principal gate of the castle before which a scene presented itself that might easily have quelled a less stout heart and turned a more delicate stomach than those of rittmaster dugald dalgetty titular of drumthwacket    chapter xii       for close designs and crooked counsels fit      sagacious bold and turbulent of wit      restless unfixd in principle and place      in power unpleased impatient in disgrace      absalom and achitophel  the village of inverary now a neat country town then partook of the rudeness of the seventeenth century in the miserable appearance of the houses and the irregularity of the unpaved street but a stronger and more terrible characteristic of the period appeared in the marketplace which was a space of irregular width half way betwixt the harbour or pier and the frowning castlegate which terminated with its gloomy archway portcullis and flankers the upper end of the vista midway this space was erected a rude gibbet on which hung five dead bodies two of which from their dress seemed to have been lowlanders and the other three corpses were muffled in their highland plaids two or three women sate under the gallows who seemed to be mourning and singing the coronach of the deceased in a low voice but the spectacle was apparently of too ordinary occurrence to have much interest for the inhabitants at large who while they thronged to look at the military figure the horse of an unusual size and the burnished panoply of captain dalgetty seemed to bestow no attention whatever on the piteous spectacle which their own marketplace afforded  the envoy of montrose was not quite so indifferent and hearing a word or two of english escape from a highlander of decent appearance he immediately halted gustavus and addressed him the provostmarshal has been busy here my friend may i crave of you what these delinquents have been justified for  he looked towards the gibbet as he spoke and the gael comprehending his meaning rather by his action than his words immediately replied three gentlemen cateransgod sain them crossing himselftwa sassenach bits o bodies that wadna do something that mcallum more bade them and turning from dalgetty with an air of indifference away he walked staying no farther question  dalgetty shrugged his shoulders and proceeded for sir duncan campbells tenth or twelfth cousin had already shown some signs of impatience  at the gate of the castle another terrible spectacle of feudal power awaited him within a stockade or palisade which seemed lately to have been added to the defences of the gate and which was protected by two pieces of light artillery was a small enclosure where stood a huge block on which lay an axe both were smeared with recent blood and a quantity of sawdust strewed around partly retained and partly obliterated the marks of a very late execution  as dalgetty looked on this new object of terror his principal guide suddenly twitched him by the skirt of his jerkin and having thus attracted his attention winked and pointed with his finger to a pole fixed on the stockade which supported a human head being that doubtless of the late sufferer there was a leer on the highlanders face as he pointed to this ghastly spectacle which seemed to his fellowtraveller ominous of nothing good  dalgetty dismounted from his horse at the gateway and gustavus was taken from him without his being permitted to attend him to the stable according to his custom  this gave the soldier a pang which the apparatus of death had not conveyedpoor gustavus said he to himself if anything but good happens to me i had better have left him at darnlinvarach than brought him here among these highland salvages who scarce know the head of a horse from his tail but duty must part a man from his nearest and dearest       when the cannons are roaring lads and the colours are flying      the lads that seek honour must never fear dying      then stout cavaliers let us toil our brave trade in      and fight for the gospel and the bold king of sweden  thus silencing his apprehensions with the butend of a military ballad he followed his guide into a sort of guardroom filled with armed highlanders it was intimated to him that he must remain here until his arrival was communicated to the marquis to make this communication the more intelligible the doughty captain gave to the dunniewassel sir duncan campbells packet desiring as well as he could by signs that it should be delivered into the marquiss own hand his guide nodded and withdrew  the captain was left about half an hour in this place to endure with indifference or return with scorn the inquisitive and at the same time the inimical glances of the armed gael to whom his exterior and equipage were as much subject of curiosity as his person and country seemed matter of dislike all this he bore with military nonchalance until at the expiration of the above period a person dressed in black velvet and wearing a gold chain like a modern magistrate of edinburgh but who was in fact steward of the household to the marquis of argyle entered the apartment and invited with solemn gravity the captain to follow him to his masters presence  the suite of apartments through which he passed were filled with attendants or visitors of various descriptions disposed perhaps with some ostentation in order to impress the envoy of montrose with an idea of the superior power and magnificence belonging to the rival house of argyle one anteroom was filled with lacqueys arrayed in brown and yellow the colours of the family who ranged in double file gazed in silence upon captain dalgetty as he passed betwixt their ranks another was occupied by highland gentlemen and chiefs of small branches who were amusing themselves with chess backgammon and other games which they scarce intermitted to gaze with curiosity upon the stranger a third was filled with lowland gentlemen and officers who seemed also in attendance and lastly the presencechamber of the marquis himself showed him attended by a levee which marked his high importance  this apartment the folding doors of which were opened for the reception of captain dalgetty was a long gallery decorated with tapestry and family portraits and having a vaulted ceiling of open woodwork the extreme projections of the beams being richly carved and gilded the gallery was lighted by long lanceolated gothic casements divided by heavy shafts and filled with painted glass where the sunbeams glimmered dimly through boarsheads and galleys and batons and swords armorial bearings of the powerful house of argyle and emblems of the high hereditary offices of justiciary of scotland and master of the royal household which they long enjoyed at the upper end of this magnificent gallery stood the marquis himself the centre of a splendid circle of highland and lowland gentlemen all richly dressed among whom were two or three of the clergy called in perhaps to be witnesses of his lordships zeal for the covenant  the marquis himself was dressed in the fashion of the period which vandyke has so often painted but his habit was sober and uniform in colour and rather rich than gay his dark complexion furrowed forehead and downcast look gave him the appearance of one frequently engaged in the consideration of important affairs and who has acquired by long habit an air of gravity and mystery which he cannot shake off even where there is nothing to be concealed the cast with his eyes which had procured him in the highlands the nickname of gillespie grumach or the grim was less perceptible when he looked downward which perhaps was one cause of his having adopted that habit in person he was tall and thin but not without that dignity of deportment and manners which became his high rank something there was cold in his address and sinister in his look although he spoke and behaved with the usual grace of a man of such quality he was adored by his own clan whose advancement he had greatly studied although he was in proportion disliked by the highlanders of other septs some of whom he had already stripped of their possessions while others conceived themselves in danger from his future schemes and all dreaded the height to which he was elevated  we have already noticed that in displaying himself amidst his councillors his officers of the household and his train of vassals allies and dependents the marquis of argyle probably wished to make an impression on the nervous system of captain dugald dalgetty but that doughty person had fought his way in one department or another through the greater part of the thirty years war in germany a period when a brave and successful soldier was a companion for princes the king of sweden and after his example even the haughty princes of the empire had found themselves fain frequently to compound with their dignity and silence when they could not satisfy the pecuniary claims of their soldiers by admitting them to unusual privileges and familiarity captain dugald dalgetty had it to boast that he had sate with princes at feasts made for monarchs and therefore was not a person to be browbeat even by the dignity which surrounded mcallum more indeed he was naturally by no means the most modest man in the world but on the contrary had so good an opinion of himself that into whatever company he chanced to be thrown he was always proportionally elevated in his own conceit so that he felt as much at ease in the most exalted society as among his own ordinary companions in this high opinion of his own rank he was greatly fortified by his ideas of the military profession which in his phrase made a valiant cavalier a camarade to an emperor  when introduced therefore into the marquiss presencechamber he advanced to the upper end with an air of more confidence than grace and would have gone close up to argyles person before speaking had not the latter waved his hand as a signal to him to stop short captain dalgetty did so accordingly and having made his military congee with easy confidence he thus accosted the marquis give you good morrow my lordor rather i should say good even beso a usted los manos as the spaniard says  who are you sir and what is your business demanded the marquis in a tone which was intended to interrupt the offensive familiarity of the soldier  that is a fair interrogative my lord answered dalgetty which i shall forthwith answer as becomes a cavalier and that peremptorie as we used to say at mareschalcollege  see who or what he is neal said the marquis sternly to a gentleman who stood near him  i will save the honourable gentleman the labour of investigation continued the captain i am dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket that should be late rittmaster in various services and now major of i know not what or whose regiment of irishes and i am come with a flag of truce from a high and powerful lord james earl of montrose and other noble persons now in arms for his majesty and so god save king charles  do you know where you are and the danger of dallying with us sir again demanded the marquis that you reply to me as if i were a child or a fool the earl of montrose is with the english malignants and i suspect you are one of those irish runagates who are come into this country to burn and slay as they did under sir phelim oneale  my lord replied captain dalgetty i am no renegade though a major of irishes for which i might refer your lordship to the invincible gustavus adolphus the lion of the north to bannier to oxenstiern to the warlike duke of saxeweimar tilly wallenstein piccolomini and other great captains both dead and living and touching the noble earl of montrose i pray your lordship to peruse these my full powers for treating with you in the name of that right honourable commander  the marquis looked slightingly at the signed and sealed paper which captain dalgetty handed to him and throwing it with contempt upon a table asked those around him what he deserved who came as the avowed envoy and agent of malignant traitors in arms against the state  a high gallows and a short shrift was the ready answer of one of the bystanders  i will crave of that honourable cavalier who hath last spoken said dalgetty to be less hasty in forming his conclusions and also of your lordship to be cautelous in adopting the same in respect such threats are to be held out only to base bisognos and not to men of spirit and action who are bound to peril themselves as freely in services of this nature as upon sieges battles or onslaughts of any sort and albeit i have not with me a trumpet or a white flag in respect our army is not yet equipped with its full appointments yet the honourable cavaliers and your lordship must concede unto me that the sanctity of an envoy who cometh on matter of truth or parle consisteth not in the fanfare of a trumpet whilk is but a sound or in the flap of a white flag whilk is but an old rag in itself but in the confidence reposed by the party sending and the party sent in the honour of those to whom the message is to be carried and their full reliance that they will respect the jus gentium as weel as the law of arms in the person of the commissionate  you are not come hither to lecture us upon the law of arms sir said the marquis which neither does nor can apply to rebels and insurgents but to suffer the penalty of your insolence and folly for bringing a traitorous message to the lord justice general of scotland whose duty calls upon him to punish such an offence with death  gentlemen said the captain who began much to dislike the turn which his mission seemed about to take i pray you to remember that the earl of montrose will hold you and your possessions liable for whatever injury my person or my horse shall sustain by these unseemly proceedings and that he will be justified in executing retributive vengeance on your persons and possessions  this menace was received with a scornful laugh while one of the campbells replied it is a far cry to lochow proverbial expression of the tribe meaning that their ancient hereditary domains lay beyond the reach of an invading enemy but gentlemen further urged the unfortunate captain who was unwilling to be condemned without at least the benefit of a full hearing although it is not for me to say how far it may be to lochow in respect i am a stranger to these parts yet what is more to the purpose i trust you will admit that i have the guarantee of an honourable gentleman of your own name sir duncan campbell of ardenvohr for my safety on this mission and i pray you to observe that in breaking the truce towards me you will highly prejudicate his honour and fair fame  this seemed to be new information to many of the gentlemen for they spoke aside with each other and the marquiss face notwithstanding his power of suppressing all external signs of his passions showed impatience and vexation  does sir duncan of ardenvohr pledge his honour for this persons safety my lord said one of the company addressing the marquis  i do not believe it answered the marquis but i have not yet had time to read his letter  we will pray your lordship to do so said another of the campbells our name must not suffer discredit through the means of such a fellow as this  a dead fly said a clergyman maketh the ointment of the apothecary to stink  reverend sir said captain dalgetty in respect of the use to be derived i forgive you the unsavouriness of your comparison and also remit to the gentleman in the red bonnet the disparaging epithet of fellow which he has discourteously applied to me who am no way to be distinguished by the same unless in so far as i have been called fellowsoldier by the great gustavus adolphus the lion of the north and other choice commanders both in germany and the low countries but touching sir duncan campbells guarantee of my safety i will gage my life upon his making my words good thereanent when he comes hither tomorrow  if sir duncan be soon expected my lord said one of the intercessors it would be a pity to anticipate matters with this poor man  besides that said another your lordshipi speak with reverenceshould at least consult the knight of ardenvohrs letter and learn the terms on which this major dalgetty as he calls himself has been sent hither by him  they closed around the marquis and conversed together in a low tone both in gaelic and english the patriarchal power of the chiefs was very great and that of the marquis of argyle armed with all his grants of hereditary jurisdiction was particularly absolute but there interferes some check of one kind or other even in the most despotic government that which mitigated the power of the celtic chiefs was the necessity which they lay under of conciliating the kinsmen who under them led out the lower orders to battle and who formed a sort of council of the tribe in time of peace the marquis on this occasion thought himself under the necessity of attending to the remonstrances of this senate or more properly couroultai of the name of campbell and slipping out of the circle gave orders for the prisoner to be removed to a place of security  prisoner exclaimed dalgetty exerting himself with such force as wellnigh to shake off two highlanders who for some minutes past had waited the signal to seize him and kept for that purpose close at his back indeed the soldier had so nearly attained his liberty that the marquis of argyle changed colour and stepped back two paces laying however his hand on his sword while several of his clan with ready devotion threw themselves betwixt him and the apprehended vengeance of the prisoner but the highland guards were too strong to be shaken off and the unlucky captain after having had his offensive weapons taken from him was dragged off and conducted through several gloomy passages to a small sidedoor grated with iron within which was another of wood these were opened by a grim old highlander with a long white beard and displayed a very steep and narrow flight of steps leading downward the captains guards pushed him down two or three steps then unloosing his arms left him to grope his way to the bottom as he could a task which became difficult and even dangerous when the two doors being successively locked left the prisoner in total darkness     chapter xiii       whatever stranger visits here      we pity his sad case      unless to worship he draw near      the king of kingshis grace      burnss  epigram on a visit to inverary  the captain finding himself deprived of light in the manner we have described and placed in a very uncertain situation proceeded to descend the narrow and broken stair with all the caution in his power hoping that he might find at the bottom some place to repose himself but with all his care he could not finally avoid making a false step which brought him down the four or five last steps too hastily to preserve his equilibrium at the bottom he stumbled over a bundle of something soft which stirred and uttered a groan so deranging the captains descent that he floundered forward and finally fell upon his hands and knees on the floor of a damp and stonepaved dungeon  when dalgetty had recovered his first demand was to know over whom he had stumbled  he was a man a month since answered a hollow and broken voice  and what is he now then said dalgetty that he thinks it fitting to lie upon the lowest step of the stairs and clewd up like a hurchin that honourable cavaliers who chance to be in trouble may break their noses over him  what is he now replied the same voice he is a wretched trunk from which the boughs have one by one been lopped away and which cares little how soon it is torn up and hewed into billets for the furnace  friend said dalgetty i am sorry for you but patienza as the spaniard says if you had but been as quiet as a log as you call yourself i should have saved some excoriations on my hands and knees  you are a soldier replied his fellowprisoner do you complain on account of a fall for which a boy would not bemoan himself  a soldier said the captain and how do you know in this cursed dark cavern that i am a soldier  i heard your armour clash as you fell replied the prisoner and now i see it glimmer when you have remained as long as i in this darkness your eyes will distinguish the smallest eft that crawls on the floor  i had rather the devil picked them out said dalgetty if this be the case i shall wish for a short turn of the rope a soldiers prayer and a leap from a ladder but what sort of provant have you got herewhat food i mean brother in affliction  bread and water once a day replied the voice  prithee friend let me taste your loaf said dalgetty i hope we shall play good comrades while we dwell together in this abominable pit  the loaf and jar of water answered the other prisoner stand in the corner two steps to your right hand take them and welcome with earthly food i have wellnigh done  dalgetty did not wait for a second invitation but groping out the provisions began to munch at the stale black oaten loaf with as much heartiness as we have seen him play his part at better viands  this bread he said muttering with his mouth full at the same time is not very savoury nevertheless it is not much worse than that which we ate at the famous leaguer at werben where the valorous gustavus foiled all the efforts of the celebrated tilly that terrible old hero who had driven two kings out of the fieldnamely ferdinand of bohemia and christian of denmark and anent this water which is none of the most sweet i drink in the same to your speedy deliverance comrade not forgetting mine own and devoutly wishing it were rhenish wine or humming lubeck beer at the least were it but in honour of the pledge  while dalgetty ran on in this way his teeth kept time with his tongue and he speedily finished the provisions which the benevolence or indifference of his companion in misfortune had abandoned to his voracity when this task was accomplished he wrapped himself in his cloak and seating himself in a corner of the dungeon in which he could obtain a support on each side for he had always been an admirer of elbowchairs he remarked even from his youth upward he began to question his fellowcaptive  mine honest friend said he you and i being comrades at bed and board should be better acquainted i am dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket and so forth major in a regiment of loyal irishes and envoy extraordinary of a high and mighty lord james earl of montrosepray what may your name be  it will avail you little to know replied his more taciturn companion  let me judge of that matter answered the soldier  well thenranald maceagh is my namethat is ranald son of the mist  son of the mist ejaculated dalgetty son of utter darkness say i but ranald since that is your name how came you in possession of the provosts court of guard what the devil brought you here that is to say  my misfortunes and my crimes answered ranald know ye the knight of ardenvohr  i do know that honourable person replied dalgetty  but know ye where he now is replied ranald  fasting this day at ardenvohr answered the envoy that he may feast tomorrow at inverary in which last purpose if he chance to fail my lease of human service will be something precarious  then let him know one claims his intercession who is his worst foe and his best friend answered ranald  truly i shall desire to carry a less questionable message answered dalgetty sir duncan is not a person to play at reading riddles with  craven saxon said the prisoner tell him i am the raven that fifteen years since stooped on his tower of strength and the pledges he had left therei am the hunter that found out the wolfs den on the rock and destroyed his offspringi am the leader of the band which surprised ardenvohr yesterday was fifteen years and gave his four children to the sword  truly my honest friend said dalgetty if that is your best recommendation to sir duncans favour i would pretermit my pleading thereupon in respect i have observed that even the animal creation are incensed against those who intromit with their offspring forcibly much more any rational and christian creatures who have had violence done upon their small family but i pray you in courtesy to tell me whether you assailed the castle from the hillock called drumsnab whilk i uphold to be the true point of attack unless it were to be protected by a sconce  we ascended the cliff by ladders of withies or saplings said the prisoner drawn up by an accomplice and clansman who had served six months in the castle to enjoy that one night of unlimited vengeance the owl whooped around us as we hung betwixt heaven and earth the tide roared against the foot of the rock and dashed asunder our skiff yet no mans heart failed him in the morning there was blood and ashes where there had been peace and joy at the sunset  it was a pretty camisade i doubt not ranald maceagh a very sufficient onslaught and not unworthily discharged nevertheless i would have pressed the house from that little hillock called drumsnab but yours is a pretty irregular scythian fashion of warfare ranald much resembling that of turks tartars and other asiatic peoplebut the reason my friend the cause of this warthe teterrima causa as i may say deliver me that ranald  we had been pushed at by the maulays and other western tribes said ranald till our possessions became unsafe for us  ah ha said dalgetty i have faint remembrance of having heard of that matter did you not put bread and cheese into a mans mouth when he had never a stomach whereunto to transmit the same  you have heard then said ranald the tale of our revenge on the haughty forester  i bethink me that i have said dalgetty and that not of an old date it was a merry jest that of cramming the bread into the dead mans mouth but somewhat too wild and salvage for civilized acceptation besides wasting the good victuals i have seen when at a siege or a leaguer ranald a living soldier would have been the better ranald for that crust of bread whilk you threw away on a dead pow  we were attacked by sir duncan continued maceagh and my brother was slainhis head was withering on the battlements which we scaledi vowed revenge and it is a vow i have never broken  it may be so said dalgetty and every thoroughbred soldier will confess that revenge is a sweet morsel but in what manner this story will interest sir duncan in your justification unless it should move him to intercede with the marquis to change the manner thereof from hanging or simple suspension to breaking your limbs on the roue or wheel with the coulter of a plough or otherwise putting you to death by torture surpasses my comprehension were i you ranald i would be for miskenning sir duncan keeping my own secret and departing quietly by suffocation like your ancestors before you  yet hearken stranger said the highlander sir duncan of ardenvohr had four children three died under our dirks but the fourth survives and more would he give to dandle on his knee the fourth child which remains than to rack these old bones which care little for the utmost indulgence of his wrath one word if i list to speak it could turn his day of humiliation and fasting into a day of thankfulness and rejoicing and breaking of bread o i know it by my own heart dearer to me is the child kenneth who chaseth the butterfly on the banks of the aven than ten sons who are mouldering in earth or are preyed on by the fowls of the air  i presume ranald continued dalgetty that the three pretty fellows whom i saw yonder in the marketplace strung up by the head like rizzerd haddocks claimed some interest in you  there was a brief pause ere the highlander replied in a tone of strong emotionthey were my sons strangerthey were my sonsblood of my bloodbone of my bonefleet of footunerring in aimunvanquished by foemen till the sons of diarmid overcame them by numbers why do i wish to survive them the old trunk will less feel the rending up of its roots than it has felt the lopping off of its graceful boughs but kenneth must be trained to revengethe young eagle must learn from the old how to stoop on his foes i will purchase for his sake my life and my freedom by discovering my secret to the knight of ardenvohr  you may attain your end more easily said a third voice mingling in the conference by entrusting it to me  all highlanders are superstitious the enemy of mankind is among us said ranald maceagh springing to his feet his chains clattered as he rose while he drew himself as far as they permitted from the quarter whence the voice appeared to proceed his fear in some degree communicated itself to captain dalgetty who began to repeat in a sort of polyglot gibberish all the exorcisms he had ever heard of without being able to remember more than a word or two of each  in nomine domini as we said at mareschalcollegesantissma madre di dios as the spaniard has italle guten geister loben den herrn saith the blessed psalmist in dr luthers translation  a truce with your exorcisms said the voice they had heard before though i come strangely among you i am mortal like yourselves and my assistance may avail you in your present streight if you are not too proud to be counselled  while the stranger thus spoke he withdrew the shade of a dark lantern by whose feeble light dalgetty could only discern that the speaker who had thus mysteriously united himself to their company and mixed in their conversation was a tall man dressed in a livery cloak of the marquis his first glance was to his feet but he saw neither the cloven foot which scottish legends assign to the foul fiend nor the horses hoof by which he is distinguished in germany his first enquiry was how the stranger had come among them  for said he the creak of these rusty bars would have been heard had the door been made patent and if you passed through the keyhole truly sir put what face you will on it you are not fit to be enrolled in a regiment of living men  i reserve my secret answered the stranger until you shall merit the discovery by communicating to me some of yours it may be that i shall be moved to let you out where i myself came in  it cannot be through the keyhole then said captain dalgetty for my corslet would stick in the passage were it possible that my headpiece could get through as for secrets i have none of my own and but few appertaining to others but impart to us what secrets you desire to know or as professor snufflegreek used to say at the mareschalcollege aberdeen speak that i may know thee  it is not with you i have first to do replied the stranger turning his light full on the mild and wasted features and the large limbs of the highlander ranald maceagh who close drawn up against the walls of the dungeon seemed yet uncertain whether his guest was a living being  i have brought you something my friend said the stranger in a more soothing tone to mend your fare if you are to die tomorrow it is no reason wherefore you should not live tonight  none at allno reason in the creation replied the ready captain dalgetty who forthwith began to unpack the contents of a small basket which the stranger had brought under his cloak while the highlander either in suspicion or disdain paid no attention to the good cheer  heres to thee my friend said the captain who having already dispatched a huge piece of roasted kid was now taking a pull at the wineflask what is thy name my good friend  murdoch campbell sir answered the servant a lackey of the marquis of argyle and occasionally acting as underwarden  then here is to thee once more murdoch said dalgetty drinking to you by your proper name for the better luck sake this wine i take to be calcavella well honest murdoch i take it on me to say thou deservest to be upperwarden since thou showest thyself twenty times better acquainted with the way of victualling honest gentlemen that are under misfortune than thy principal bread and water out upon him it was enough murdoch to destroy the credit of the marquiss dungeon but i see you would converse with my friend ranald maceagh here never mind my presence ill get me into this corner with the basket and i will warrant my jaws make noise enough to prevent my ears from hearing you  notwithstanding this promise however the veteran listened with all the attention he could to gather their discourse or as he described it himself laid his ears back in his neck like gustavus when he heard the key turn in the girnellkist he could therefore owing to the narrowness of the dungeon easily overhear the following dialogue  are you aware son of the mist said the campbell that you will never leave this place excepting for the gibbet  those who are dearest to me answered maceagh have trode that path before me  then you would do nothing asked the visitor to shun following them  the prisoner writhed himself in his chains before returning an answer  i would do much at length he said not for my own life but for the sake of the pledge in the glen of strathaven  and what would you do to turn away the bitterness of the hour again demanded murdoch i care not for what cause ye mean to shun it  i would do what a man might do and still call himself a man  do you call yourself a man said the interrogator who have done the deeds of a wolf  i do answered the outlaw i am a man like my forefatherswhile wrapt in the mantle of peace we were lambsit was rent from us and ye now call us wolves give us the huts ye have burned our children whom ye have murdered our widows whom ye have starvedcollect from the gibbet and the pole the mangled carcasses and whitened skulls of our kinsmenbid them live and bless us and we will be your vassals and brotherstill then let death and blood and mutual wrong draw a dark veil of division between us  you will then do nothing for your liberty said the campbell  anythingbut call myself the friend of your tribe answered maceagh  we scorn the friendship of banditti and caterans retorted murdoch and would not stoop to accept itwhat i demand to know from you in exchange for your liberty is where the daughter and heiress of the knight of ardenvohr is now to be found  that you may wed her to some beggarly kinsman of your great master said ranald after the fashion of the children of diarmid does not the valley of glenorquhy to this very hour cry shame on the violence offered to a helpless infant whom her kinsmen were conveying to the court of the sovereign were not her escort compelled to hide her beneath a cauldron round which they fought till not one remained to tell the tale and was not the girl brought to this fatal castle and afterwards wedded to the brother of mcallum more and all for the sake of her broad lands such a story is told of the heiress of the clan of calder who was made prisoner in the manner described and afterwards wedded to sir duncan campbell from which union the campbells of cawdor have their descent  and if the tale be true said murdoch she had a preferment beyond what the king of scots would have conferred on her but this is far from the purpose the daughter of sir duncan of ardenvohr is of our own blood not a stranger and who has so good a right to know her fate as mcallum more the chief of her clan  it is on his part then that you demand it said the outlaw the domestic of the marquis assented  and you will practise no evil against the maideni have done her wrong enough already  no evil upon the word of a christian man replied murdoch  and my guerdon is to be life and liberty said the child of the mist  such is our paction replied the campbell  then know that the child whom i saved our of compassion at the spoiling of her fathers tower of strength was bred as an adopted daughter of our tribe until we were worsted at the pass of ballenduthil by the fiend incarnate and mortal enemy of our tribe allan maulay of the bloody hand and by the horsemen of lennox under the heir of menteith  fell she into the power of allan of the bloody hand said murdoch and she a reputed daughter of thy tribe then her blood has gilded the dirk and thou hast said nothing to rescue thine own forfeited life  if my life rest on hers answered the outlaw it is secure for she still survives but it has a more insecure reliancethe frail promise of a son of diarmid  that promise shall not fail you said the campbell if you can assure me that she survives and where she is to be found  in the castle of darlinvarach said ranald maceagh under the name of annot lyle i have often heard of her from my kinsmen who have again approached their native woods and it is not long since mine old eyes beheld her  you said murdoch in astonishment you a chief among the children of the mist and ventured so near your mortal foe  son of diarmid i did more replied the outlaw i was in the hall of the castle disguised as a harper from the wild shores of skianach my purpose was to have plunged my dirk in the body of the maulay with the bloody hand before whom our race trembles and to have taken thereafter what fate god should send me but i saw annot lyle even when my hand was on the hilt of my dagger she touched her clairshach harp to a song of the children of the mist which she had learned when her dwelling was amongst us the woods in which we had dwelt pleasantly rustled their green leaves in the song and our streams were there with the sound of all their waters my hand forsook the dagger the fountains of mine eyes were opened and the hour of revenge passed awayand now son of diarmid have i not paid the ransom of my head  ay replied murdoch if your tale be true but what proof can you assign for it  bear witness heaven and earth exclaimed the outlaw he already looks how he may step over his word  not so replied murdoch every promise shall be kept to you when i am assured you have told me the truthbut i must speak a few words with your companion in captivity  fair and falseever fair and false muttered the prisoner as he threw himself once more on the floor of his dungeon  meanwhile captain dalgetty who had attended to every word of this dialogue was making his own remarks on it in private what the henker can this sly fellow have to say to me i have no child either of my own so far as i know or of any other person to tell him a tale about but let him come onhe will have some manoeuvring ere he turn the flank of the old soldier  accordingly as if he had stood pike in hand to defend a breach he waited with caution but without fear the commencement of the attack  you are a citizen of the world captain dalgetty said murdoch campbell and cannot be ignorant of our old scotch proverb gifgaf in old english ka me ka thee ie mutually serving each other which goes through all nations and all services  then i should know something of it said dalgetty for except the turks there are few powers in europe whom i have not served and i have sometimes thought of taking a turn either with bethlem gabor or with the janizaries  a man of your experience and unprejudiced ideas then will understand me at once said murdoch when i say i mean that your freedom shall depend on your true and up right answer to a few trifling questions respecting the gentlemen you have left their state of preparation the number of their men and nature of their appointments and as much as you chance to know about their plan of operations  just to satisfy your curiosity said dalgetty and without any farther purpose  none in the world replied murdoch what interest should a poor devil like me take in their operations  make your interrogations then said the captain and i will answer them preremtorie  how many irish may be on their march to join james graham the delinquent  probably ten thousand said captain dalgetty  ten thousand replied murdoch angrily we know that scarce two thousand landed at ardnamurchan  then you know more about them than i do answered captain dalgetty with great composure i never saw them mustered yet or even under arms  and how many men of the clans may be expected demanded murdoch  as many as they can make replied the captain  you are answering from the purpose sir said murdoch speak plainly will there be five thousand men  there and thereabouts answered dalgetty  you are playing with your life sir if you trifle with me replied the catechist one whistle of mine and in less than ten minutes your head hangs on the drawbridge  but to speak candidly mr murdoch replied the captain do you think it is a reasonable thing to ask me after the secrets of our army and i engaged to serve for the whole campaign if i taught you how to defeat montrose what becomes of my pay arrears and chance of booty  i tell you said campbell that if you be stubborn your campaign shall begin and end in a march to the block at the castlegate which stands ready for such landlaufers but if you answer my questions faithfully i will receive you into myinto the service of mcallum more  does the service afford good pay said captain dalgetty  he will double yours if you will return to montrose and act under his direction  i wish i had seen you sir before taking on with him said dalgetty appearing to meditate  on the contrary i can afford you more advantageous terms now said the campbell always supposing that you are faithful  faithful that is to you and a traitor to montrose answered the captain  faithful to the cause of religion and good order answered murdoch which sanctifies any deception you may employ to serve it  and the marquis of argyleshould i incline to enter his service is he a kind master demanded dalgetty  never man kinder quoth campbell  and bountiful to his officers pursued the captain  the most open hand in scotland replied murdoch  true and faithful to his engagements continued dalgetty  as honourable a nobleman as breathes said the clansman  i never heard so much good of him before said dalgetty you must know the marquis wellor rather you must be the marquis himselflord of argyle he added throwing himself suddenly on the disguised nobleman i arrest you in the name of king charles as a traitor if you venture to call for assistance i will wrench round your neck  the attack which dalgetty made upon argyles person was so sudden and unexpected that he easily prostrated him on the floor of the dungeon and held him down with one hand while his right grasping the marquiss throat was ready to strangle him on the slightest attempt to call for assistance  lord of argyle he said it is now my turn to lay down the terms of capitulation if you list to show me the private way by which you entered the dungeon you shall escape on condition of being my locum tenens as we said at the mareschalcollege until your warder visits his prisoners but if not i will first strangle youi learned the art from a polonian heyduck who had been a slave in the ottoman seraglioand then seek out a mode of retreat  villain you would not murder me for my kindness murmured argyle  not for your kindness my lord replied dalgetty but first to teach your lordship the jus gentium towards cavaliers who come to you under safeconduct and secondly to warn you of the danger of proposing dishonourable terms to any worthy soldado in order to tempt him to become false to his standard during the term of his service  spare my life said argyle and i will do as you require  dalgetty maintained his gripe upon the marquiss throat compressing it a little while he asked questions and relaxing it so far as to give him the power of answering them  where is the secret door into the dungeon he demanded  hold up the lantern to the corner on your right hand you will discern the iron which covers the spring replied the marquis  so far so goodwhere does the passage lead to  to my private apartment behind the tapestry answered the prostrate nobleman  from thence how shall i reach the gateway  through the grand gallery the anteroom the lackeys waiting hall the grand guardroom  all crowded with soldiers factionaries and attendantsthat will never do for me my lordhave you no secret passage to the gate as you have to your dungeons i have seen such in germany  there is a passage through the chapel said the marquis opening from my apartment  and what is the password at the gate  the sword of levi replied the marquis but if you will receive my pledge of honour i will go with you escort you through every guard and set you at full liberty with a passport  i might trust you my lord were your throat not already black with the grasp of my fingersas it is beso los manos a usted as the spaniard says yet you may grant me a passportare there writing materials in your apartment  surely and blank passports ready to be signed i will attend you there said the marquis instantly  it were too much honour for the like of me said dalgetty your lordship shall remain under charge of mine honest friend ranald maceagh therefore prithee let me drag you within reach of his chainhonest ranald you see how matters stand with us i shall find the means i doubt not of setting you at freedom meantime do as you see me do clap your hand thus on the weasand of this high and mighty prince under his ruff and if he offer to struggle or cry out fail not my worthy ranald to squeeze doughtily and if it be ad deliquium ranald that is till he swoon there is no great matter seeing he designed your gullet and mine to still harder usage  if he offer at speech or struggle said ranald he dies by my hand  that is right ranaldvery spiriteda thoroughgoing friend that understands a hint is worth a million  thus resigning the charge of the marquis to his new confederate dalgetty pressed the spring by which the secret door flew open though so well were its hinges polished and oiled that it made not the slightest noise in revolving the opposite side of the door was secured by very strong bolts and bars beside which hung one or two keys designed apparently to undo fetterlocks a narrow staircase ascending up through the thickness of the castlewall landed as the marquis had truly informed him behind the tapestry of his private apartment such communications were frequent in old feudal castles as they gave the lord of the fortress like a second dionysius the means of hearing the conversation of his prisoners or if he pleased of visiting them in disguise an experiment which had terminated so unpleasantly on the present occasion for gillespie grumach having examined previously whether there was any one in the apartment and finding the coast clear the captain entered and hastily possessing himself of a blank passport several of which lay on the table and of writing materials securing at the same time the marquiss dagger and a silk cord from the hangings he again descended into the cavern where listening a moment at the door he could hear the halfstifled voice of the marquis making great proffers to maceagh on condition he would suffer him to give an alarm  not for a forest of deernot for a thousand head of cattle answered the freebooter not for all the lands that ever called a son of diarmid master will i break the troth i have plighted to him of the irongarment  he of the irongarment said dalgetty entering is bounden unto you maceagh and this noble lord shall be bounden also but first he must fill up this passport with the names of major dugald dalgetty and his guide or he is like to have a passport to another world  the marquis subscribed and wrote by the light of the dark lantern as the soldier prescribed to him  and now ranald said dalgetty strip thy upper garmentthy plaid i mean ranald and in it will i muffle the mcallum more and make of him for the time a child of the mistnay i must bring it over your head my lord so as to secure us against your mistimed clamourso now he is sufficiently muffledhold down your hands or by heaven i will stab you to the heart with your own daggernay you shall be bound with nothing less than silk as your quality deservesso now he is secure till some one comes to relieve him if he ordered us a late dinner ranald he is like to be the suffererat what hour my good ranald did the jailor usually appear  never till the sun was beneath the western wave said maceagh then my friend we shall have three hours good said the cautious captain in the meantime let us labour for your liberation  to examine ranalds chain was the next occupation it was undone by means of one of the keys which hung behind the private door probably deposited there that the marquis might if he pleased dismiss a prisoner or remove him elsewhere without the necessity of summoning the warden the outlaw stretched his benumbed arms and bounded from the floor of the dungeon in all the ecstasy of recovered freedom  take the liverycoat of that noble prisoner said captain dalgetty put it on and follow close at my heels  the outlaw obeyed they ascended the private stair having first secured the door behind them and thus safely reached the apartment of the marquis  the precarious state of the feudal nobles introduced a great deal of espionage into their castles sir robert carey mentions his having put on the cloak of one of his own wardens to obtain a confession from the mouth of geordie bourne his prisoner whom he caused presently to be hanged in return for the frankness of his communication the fine old border castle of naworth contains a private stair from the apartment of the lord william howard by which he could visit the dungeon as is alleged in the preceding chapter to have been practised by the marquis of argyle    chapter xiv       this was the entry then these stairsbut whither after      yet he thats sure to perish on the land      may quit the nicety of card and compass      and trust the open sea without a pilottragedy of bennovalt  look out for the private way through the chapel ranald said the captain while i give a hasty regard to these matters  thus speaking he seized with one hand a bundle of argyles most private papers and with the other a purse of gold both of which lay in a drawer of a rich cabinet which stood invitingly open neither did he neglect to possess himself of a sword and pistols with powderflask and balls which hung in the apartment intelligence and booty said the veteran as he pouched the spoils each honourable cavalier should look to the one on his generals behalf and the other on his own this sword is an andrew ferrara and the pistols better than mine own but a fair exchange is no robbery soldados are not to be endangered and endangered gratuitously my lord of argylebut soft soft ranald wise man of the mist whither art thou bound  it was indeed full time to stop maceaghs proceedings for not finding the private passage readily and impatient it would seem of farther delay he had caught down a sword and target and was about to enter the great gallery with the purpose doubtless of fighting his way through all opposition  hold while you live whispered dalgetty laying hold on him we must be perdue if possible so bar we this door that it may be thought mcallum more would be privateand now let me make a reconnaissance for the private passage  by looking behind the tapestry in various places the captain at length discovered a private door and behind that a winding passage terminated by another door which doubtless entered the chapel but what was his disagreeable surprise to hear on the other side of this second door the sonorous voice of a divine in the act of preaching  this made the villain he said recommend this to us as a private passage i am strongly tempted to return and cut his throat  he then opened very gently the door which led into a latticed gallery used by the marquis himself the curtains of which were drawn perhaps with the purpose of having it supposed that he was engaged in attendance upon divine worship when in fact he was absent upon his secular affairs there was no other person in the seat for the family of the marquissuch was the high state maintained in those dayssate during service in another gallery placed somewhat lower than that of the great man himself this being the case captain dalgetty ventured to ensconce himself in the gallery of which he carefully secured the door  never although the expression be a bold one was a sermon listened to with more impatience and less edification on the part of one at least of the audience the captain heard sixteenthlyseventeenthlyeighteenthly and to conclude with a sort of feeling like protracted despair but no man can lecture for the service was called a lecture for ever and the discourse was at length closed the clergyman not failing to make a profound bow towards the latticed gallery little suspecting whom he honoured by that reverence to judge from the haste with which they dispersed the domestics of the marquis were scarce more pleased with their late occupation than the anxious captain dalgetty indeed many of them being highlandmen had the excuse of not understanding a single word which the clergyman spoke although they gave their attendance on his doctrine by the special order of mcallum more and would have done so had the preacher been a turkish imaum  but although the congregation dispersed thus rapidly the divine remained behind in the chapel and walking up and down its gothic precincts seemed either to be meditating on what he had just been delivering or preparing a fresh discourse for the next opportunity bold as he was dalgetty hesitated what he ought to do time however pressed and every moment increased the chance of their escape being discovered by the jailor visiting the dungeon perhaps before his wonted time and discovering the exchange which had been made there at length whispering ranald who watched all his motions to follow him and preserve his countenance captain dalgetty with a very composed air descended a flight of steps which led from the gallery into the body of the chapel a less experienced adventurer would have endeavoured to pass the worthy clergyman rapidly in hopes to escape unnoticed but the captain who foresaw the manifest danger of failing in such an attempt walked gravely to meet the divine upon his walk in the midst of the chancel and pulling off his cap was about to pass him after a formal reverence but what was his surprise to view in the preacher the very same person with whom he had dined in the castle of ardenvohr yet he speedily recovered his composure and ere the clergyman could speak was the first to address him i could not he said leave this mansion without bequeathing to you my very reverend sir my humble thanks for the homily with which you have this evening favoured us  i did not observe sir said the clergyman that you were in the chapel  it pleased the honourable marquis said dalgetty modestly to grace me with a seat in his own gallery the divine bowed low at this intimation knowing that such an honour was only vouchsafed to persons of very high rank it has been my fate sir said the captain in the sort of wandering life which i have led to have heard different preachers of different religionsas for example lutheran evangelical reformed calvinistical and so forth but never have i listened to such a homily as yours  call it a lecture worthy sir said the divine such is the phrase of our church  lecture or homily said dalgetty it was as the high germans say ganz fortre flich and i could not leave this place without testifying unto you what inward emotions i have undergone during your edifying prelection and how i am touched to the quick that i should yesterday during the refection have seemed to infringe on the respect due to such a person as yourself  alas my worthy sir said the clergyman we meet in this world as in the valley of the shadow of death not knowing against whom we may chance to encounter in truth it is no matter of marvel if we sometimes jostle those to whom if known we would yield all respect surely sir i would rather have taken you for a profane malignant than for such a devout person as you prove who reverences the great master even in the meanest of his servants  it is always my custom to do so learned sir answered dalgetty for in the service of the immortal gustavusbut i detain you from your meditationshis desire to speak of the king of sweden being for once overpowered by the necessity of his circumstances  by no means my worthy sir said the clergyman what was i pray you the order of that great prince whose memory is so dear to every protestant bosom  sir the drums beat to prayers morning and evening as regularly as for parade and if a soldier passed without saluting the chaplain he had an hours ride on the wooden mare for his pains sir i wish you a very good eveningi am obliged to depart the castle under mcallum mores passport  stay one instant sir said the preacher is there nothing i can do to testify my respect for the pupil of the great gustavus and so admirable a judge of preaching  nothing sir said the captain but to shew me the nearest way to the gateand if you would have the kindness he added with great effrontery to let a servant bring my horse with him the dark grey geldingcall him gustavus and he will prick up his earsfor i know not where the castlestables are situated and my guide he added looking at ranald speaks no english  i hasten to accommodate you said the clergyman your way lies through that cloistered passage  now heavens blessing upon your vanity said the captain to himself i was afraid i would have had to march off without gustavus  in fact so effectually did the chaplain exert himself in behalf of so excellent a judge of composition that while dalgetty was parleying with the sentinels at the drawbridge showing his passport and giving the watchword a servant brought him his horse ready saddled for the journey in another place the captains sudden appearance at large after having been publicly sent to prison might have excited suspicion and enquiry but the officers and domestics of the marquis were accustomed to the mysterious policy of their master and never supposed aught else than that he had been liberated and intrusted with some private commission by their master in this belief and having received the parole they gave him free passage  dalgetty rode slowly through the town of inverary the outlaw attending upon him like a footpage at his horses shoulder as they passed the gibbet the old man looked on the bodies and wrung his hands the look and gesture was momentary but expressive of indescribable anguish instantly recovering himself ranald in passing whispered somewhat to one of the females who like rizpah the daughter of aiah seemed engaged in watching and mourning the victims of feudal injustice and cruelty the woman started at his voice but immediately collected herself and returned for answer a slight inclination of the head  dalgetty continued his way out of the town uncertain whether he should try to seize or hire a boat and cross the lake or plunge into the woods and there conceal himself from pursuit in the former event he was liable to be instantly pursued by the galleys of the marquis which lay ready for sailing their long yardarms pointing to the wind and what hope could he have in an ordinary highland fishingboat to escape from them if he made the latter choice his chance either of supporting or concealing himself in those waste and unknown wildernesses was in the highest degree precarious the town lay now behind him yet what hand to turn to for safety he was unable to determine and began to be sensible that in escaping from the dungeon at inverary desperate as the matter seemed he had only accomplished the easiest part of a difficult task if retaken his fate was now certain for the personal injury he had offered to a man so powerful and so vindictive could be atoned for only by instant death while he pondered these distressing reflections and looked around with a countenance which plainly expressed indecision ranald maceagh suddenly asked him which way he intended to journey  and that honest comrade answered dalgetty is precisely the question which i cannot answer you truly i begin to hold the opinion ranald that we had better have stuck by the brown loaf and waterpitcher until sir duncan arrived who for his own honour must have made some fight for me  saxon answered maceagh do not regret having exchanged the foul breath of yonder dungeon for the free air of heaven above all repent not that you have served a son of the mist put yourself under my guidance and i will warrant your safety with my head  can you guide me safe through these mountains and back to the army of montrose said dalgetty  i can answered maceagh there lives not a man to whom the mountain passes the caverns the glens the thickets and the corries are known as they are to the children of the mist while others crawl on the level ground by the sides of lakes and streams ours are the steep hollows of the inaccessible mountains the birthplace of the desert springs not all the bloodhounds of argyle can trace the fastnesses through which i can guide you  sayst thou so honest ranald replied dalgetty then have on with thee for of a surety i shall never save the ship by my own pilotage  the outlaw accordingly led the way into the wood by which the castle is surrounded for several miles walking with so much dispatch as kept gustavus at a round trot and taking such a number of cross cuts and turns that captain dalgetty speedily lost all idea where he might be and all knowledge of the points of the compass at length the path which had gradually become more difficult altogether ended among thickets and underwood the roaring of a torrent was heard in the neighbourhood the ground became in some places broken in others boggy and everywhere unfit for riding  what the foul fiend said dalgetty is to be done here i must part with gustavus i fear  take no care for your horse said the outlaw he shall soon be restored to you  as he spoke he whistled in a low tune and a lad halfdressed in tartan half naked having only his own shaggy hair tied with a thong of leather to protect his head and face from sun and weather lean and halfstarved in aspect his wild grey eyes appearing to fill up ten times the proportion usually allotted to them in the human face crept out as a wild beast might have done from a thicket of brambles and briars  give your horse to the gillie said ranald maceagh your life depends upon it  och och exclaimed the despairing veteran eheu as we used to say at mareschalcollege must i leave gustavus in such grooming  are you frantic to lose time thus said his guide do we stand on friends ground that you should part with your horse as if he were your brother i tell you you shall have him again but if you never saw the animal is not life better than the best colt ever mare foaled  and that is true too mine honest friend sighed dalgetty yet if you knew but the value of gustavus and the things we two have done and suffered togethersee he turns back to look at mebe kind to him my good breechless friend and i will requite you well so saying and withal sniffling a little to swallow his grief he turned from the heartrending spectacle in order to follow his guide  to follow his guide was no easy matter and soon required more agility than captain dalgetty could master the very first plunge after he had parted from his charger carried him with little assistance from a few overhanging boughs or projecting roots of trees eight foot sheer down into the course of a torrent up which the son of the mist led the way huge stones over which they scrambledthickets of them and brambles through which they had to drag themselvesrocks which were to be climbed on the one side with much labour and pain for the purpose of an equally precarious descent upon the other all these and many such interruptions were surmounted by the lightfooted and halfnaked mountaineer with an ease and velocity which excited the surprise and envy of captain dalgetty who encumbered by his headpiece corslet and other armour not to mention his ponderous jackboots found himself at length so much exhausted by fatigue and the difficulties of the road that he sate down upon a stone in order to recover his breath while he explained to ranald maceagh the difference betwixt travelling expeditus and impeditus as these two military phrases were understood at mareschalcollege aberdeen the sole answer of the mountaineer was to lay his hand on the soldiers arm and point backward in the direction of the wind dalgetty could spy nothing for evening was closing fast and they were at the bottom of a dark ravine but at length he could distinctly hear at a distance the sullen toll of a large bell  that said he must be the alarmthe stormclock as the germans call it  it strikes the hour of your death answered ranald unless you can accompany me a little farther for every toll of that bell a brave man has yielded up his soul  truly ranald my trusty friend said dalgetty i will not deny that the case may be soon my own for i am so forfoughen being as i explained to you impeditus for had i been expeditus i mind not pedestrian exercise the flourish of a fife that i think i had better ensconce myself in one of these bushes and even lie quiet there to abide what fortune god shall send me i entreat you mine honest friend ranald to shift for yourself and leave me to my fortune as the lion of the north the immortal gustavus adolphus my nevertobeforgotten master whom you must surely have heard of ranald though you may have heard of no one else said to francis albert duke of saxelauenburgh when he was mortally wounded on the plains of lutzen neither despair altogether of my safety ranald seeing i have been in as great pinches as this in germanymore especially i remember me that at the fatal battle of nerlingenafter which i changed service  if you would save your fathers sons breath to help his child out of trouble instead of wasting it upon the tales of seannachies said ranald who now grew impatient of the captains loquacity or if your feet could travel as fast as your tongue you might yet lay your head on an unbloody pillow tonight  something there is like military skill in that replied the captain although wantonly and irreverently spoken to an officer of rank but i hold it good to pardon such freedoms on a march in respect of the saturnalian license indulged in such cases to the troops of all nations and now resume thine office friend ranald in respect i am wellbreathed or to be more plain i prae sequar as we used to say at mareschalcollege  comprehending his meaning rather from his motions than his language the son of the mist again led the way with an unerring precision that looked like instinct through a variety of ground the most difficult and broken that could well be imagined dragging along his ponderous boots encumbered with thighpieces gauntlets corslet and backpiece not to mention the buff jerkin which he wore under all these arms talking of his former exploits the whole way though ranald paid not the slightest attention to him captain dalgetty contrived to follow his guide a considerable space farther when the deepmouthed baying of a hound was heard coming down the wind as if opening on the scent of its prey  black hound said ranald whose throat never boded good to a child of the mist ill fortune to her who littered thee hast thou already found our trace but thou art too late swart hound of darkness and the deer has gained the herd  so saying he whistled very softly and was answered in a tone equally low from the top of a pass up which they had for some time been ascending mending their pace they reached the top where the moon which had now risen bright and clear showed to dalgetty a party of ten or twelve highlanders and about as many women and children by whom ranald maceagh was received with such transports of joy as made his companion easily sensible that those by whom he was surrounded must of course be children of the mist the place which they occupied well suited their name and habits it was a beetling crag round which winded a very narrow and broken footpath commanded in various places by the position which they held  ranald spoke anxiously and hastily to the children of his tribe and the men came one by one to shake hands with dalgetty while the women clamorous in their gratitude pressed round to kiss even the hem of his garment they plight their faith to you said ranald maceagh for requital of the good deed you have done to the tribe this day  enough said ranald answered the soldier enough saidtell them i love not this shaking of handsit confuses ranks and degrees in military service and as to kissing of gauntlets puldrons and the like i remember that the immortal gustavus as he rode through the streets of nuremberg being thus worshipped by the poulace being doubtless far more worthy of it than a poor though honourable cavalier like myself did say unto them in the way of rebuke if you idolize me thus like a god who shall assure you that the vengeance of heaven will not soon prove me to be a mortaland so here i suppose you intend to make a stand against your followers ranaldvoto a dios as the spaniard saysa very pretty positionas pretty a position for a small peloton of men as i have seen in my serviceno enemy can come towards it by the road without being at the mercy of cannon and musketbut then ranald my trusty comrade you have no cannon i dare to aver and i do not see that any of these fellows have muskets either so with what artillery you propose making good the pass before you come to hand blows truly ranald it passeth my apprehension  with the weapons and with the courage of our fathers said maceagh and made the captain observe that the men of his party were armed with bows and arrows  bows and arrows exclaimed dalgetty ha ha ha have we robin hood and little john back again bows and arrows why the sight has not been seen in civilized war for a hundred years bows and arrows and why not weavers beams as in the days of goliah ah that dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket should live to see men fight with bows and arrowsthe immortal gustavus would never have believed itnor wallensteinnor butlernor old tillywell ranald a cat can have but its clawssince bows and arrows are the word een let us make the best of it only as i do not understand the scope and range of such oldfashioned artillery you must make the best disposition you can out of your own head for my taking the command whilk i would have gladly done had you been to fight with any christian weapons is out of the question when you are to combat like quivered numidians i will however play my part with my pistols in the approaching melley in respect my carabine unhappily remains at gustavuss saddlemy service and thanks to you he continued addressing a mountaineer who offered him a bow dugald dalgetty may say of himself as he learned at mareschalcollege       non eget mauri jaculis neque arcu      nec venenatis gravida sagittis      fusce pharetra  whilk is to say  ranald maceagh a second time imposed silence on the talkative commander as before by pulling his sleeve and pointing down the pass the bay of the bloodhound was now approaching nearer and nearer and they could hear the voices of several persons who accompanied the animal and hallooed to each other as they dispersed occasionally either in the hurry of their advance or in order to search more accurately the thickets as they came along they were obviously drawing nearer and nearer every moment maceagh in the meantime proposed to captain dalgetty to disencumber himself of his armour and gave him to understand that the women should transport it to a place of safety  i crave your pardon sir said dalgetty such is not the rule of our foreign service in respect i remember the regiment of finland cuirassiers reprimanded and their kettledrums taken from them by the immortal gustavus because they had assumed the permission to march without their corslets and to leave them with the baggage neither did they strike kettledrums again at the head of that famous regiment until they behaved themselves so notably at the field of leipsic a lesson whilk is not to be forgotten any more than that exclamation of the immortal gustavus now shall i know if my officers love me by their putting on their armour since if my officers are slain who shall lead my soldiers into victory nevertheless friend ranald this is without prejudice to my being rid of these somewhat heavy boots providing i can obtain any other succedaneum for i presume not to say that my bare soles are fortified so as to endure the flints and thorns as seems to be the case with your followers  to rid the captain of his cumbrous greaves and case his feet in a pair of brogues made out of deerskin which a highlander stripped off for his accommodation was the work of a minute and dalgetty found himself much lightened by the exchange he was in the act of recommending to ranald maceagh to send two or three of his followers a little lower to reconnoitre the pass and at the same time somewhat to extend his front placing two detached archers at each flank by way of posts of observation when the near cry of the hound apprised them that the pursuers were at the bottom of the pass all was then dead silence for loquacious as he was on other occasions captain dalgetty knew well the necessity of an ambush keeping itself under covert  the moon gleamed on the broken pathway and on the projecting cliffs of rock round which it winded its light intercepted here and there by the branches of bushes and dwarftrees which finding nourishment in the crevices of the rocks in some places overshadowed the brow and ledge of the precipice below a thick copsewood lay in deep and dark shadow somewhat resembling the billows of a halfseen ocean from the bosom of that darkness and close to the bottom of the precipice the hound was heard at intervals baying fearfully sounds which were redoubled by the echoes of the woods and rocks around at intervals these sunk into deep silence interrupted only by the plashing noise of a small runnel of water which partly fell from the rock partly found a more silent passage to the bottom along its projecting surface voices of men were also heard in stifled converse below it seemed as if the pursuers had not discovered the narrow path which led to the top of the rock or that having discovered it the peril of the ascent joined to the imperfect light and the uncertainty whether it might not be defended made them hesitate to attempt it  at length a shadowy figure was seen which raised itself up from the abyss of darkness below and emerging into the pale moonlight began cautiously and slowly to ascend the rocky path the outline was so distinctly marked that captain dalgetty could discover not only the person of a highlander but the long gun which he carried in his hand and the plume of feathers which decorated his bonnet tausend teiflen that i should say so and so like to be near my latter end ejaculated the captain but under his breath what will become of us now they have brought musketry to encounter our archers  but just as the pursuer had attained a projecting piece of rock about half way up the ascent and pausing made a signal for those who were still at the bottom to follow him an arrow whistled from the bow of one of the children of the mist and transfixed him with so fatal a wound that without a single effort to save himself he lost his balance and fell headlong from the cliff on which he stood into the darkness below the crash of the boughs which received him and the heavy sound of his fall from thence to the ground was followed by a cry of horror and surprise which burst from his followers the children of the mist encouraged in proportion to the alarm this first success had caused among the pursuers echoed back the clamour with a loud and shrill yell of exultation and showing themselves on the brow of the precipice with wild cries and vindictive gestures endeavoured to impress on their enemies a sense at once of their courage their numbers and their state of defence even captain dalgettys military prudence did not prevent his rising up and calling out to ranald more loud than prudence warranted carocco comrade as the spaniard says the longbow for ever in my poor apprehension now were you to order a file to advance and take position  the sassenach cried a voice from beneath mark the sassenach sidier i see the glitter of his breastplate at the same time three muskets were discharged and while one ball rattled against the corslet of proof to the strength of which our valiant captain had been more than once indebted for his life another penetrated the armour which covered the front of his left thigh and stretched him on the ground ranald instantly seized him in his arms and bore him back from the edge of the precipice while he dolefully ejaculated i always told the immortal gustavus wallenstein tilly and other men of the sword that in my poor mind taslets ought to be made musketproof  with two or three earnest words in gaelic maceagh commended the wounded man to the charge of the females who were in the rear of his little party and was then about to return to the contest but dalgetty detained him grasping a firm hold of his plaidi know not how this matter may endbut i request you will inform montrose that i died like a follower of the immortal gustavusand i pray you take heed how you quit your present strength even for the purpose of pursuing the enemy if you gain any advantageandand  here dalgettys breath and eyesight began to fail him through loss of blood and maceagh availing himself of this circumstance extricated from his grasp the end of his own mantle and substituted that of a female by which the captain held stoutly thereby securing as he conceived the outlaws attention to the military instructions which he continued to pour forth while he had any breath to utter them though they became gradually more and more incoherentand comrade you will be sure to keep your musketeers in advance of your stand of pikes lochaberaxes and twohanded swordsstand fast dragoons on the left flankwhere was iay and ranald if ye be minded to retreat leave some lighted matches burning on the branches of the treesit shows as if they were lined with shotbut i forgetye have no matchlocks nor habergeonsonly bows and arrowsbows and arrows ha ha ha  here the captain sunk back in an exhausted condition altogether unable to resist the sense of the ludicrous which as a modern manatarms he connected with the idea of these ancient weapons of war it was a long time ere he recovered his senses and in the meantime we leave him in the care of the daughters of the mist nurses as kind and attentive in reality as they were wild and uncouth in outward appearance    chapter xv       but if no faithless action stain      thy true and constant word      ill make thee famous by my pen      and glorious by my sword       ill serve thee in such noble ways      as neer were known before      ill deck and crown thy head with bays      and love thee more and moremontroses lines  we must now leave with whatever regret the valiant captain dalgetty to recover of his wounds or otherwise as fate shall determine in order briefly to trace the military operations of montrose worthy as they are of a more important page and a better historian by the assistance of the chieftains whom we have commemorated and more especially by the junction of the murrays stewarts and other clans of athole which were peculiarly zealous in the royal cause he soon assembled an army of two or three thousand highlanders to whom he successfully united the irish under colkitto this last leader who to the great embarrassment of miltons commentators is commemorated in one of that great poets sonnets was properly named alister or alexander mdonnell by birth a scottish islesman and related to the earl of antrim to whose patronage he owed the command assigned him in the irish troops in many respects he merited this distinction he was brave to intrepidity and almost to insensibility very strong and active in person completely master of his weapons and always ready to show the example in the extremity of danger to counterbalance these good qualities it must be recorded that he was inexperienced in military tactics and of a jealous and presumptuous disposition which often lost to montrose the fruits of colkittos gallantry yet such is the predominance of outward personal qualities in the eyes of a mild people that the feats of strength and courage shown by this champion seem to have made a stronger impression upon the minds of the highlanders than the military skill and chivalrous spirit of the great marquis of montrose numerous traditions are still preserved in the highland glens concerning alister mdonnell though the name of montrose is rarely mentioned among them  miltons book entitled tetrachordon had been ridiculed it would seem by the divines assembled at westminster and others on account of the hardness of the title and milton in his sonnet retaliates upon the barbarous scottish names which the civil war had made familiar to english ears           why is it harder sirs than gordon      colkitto or mdonald or gallasp      these rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek      that would have made quintillian stare and gasp  we may suppose says bishop newton that these were persons of note among the scotch ministers who were for pressing and enforcing the covenant whereas milton only intends to ridicule the barbarism of scottish names in general and quotes indiscriminately that of gillespie one of the apostles of the covenant and those of colkitto and mdonnell both belonging to one person one of its bitterest enemies  the point upon which montrose finally assembled his little army was in strathearn on the verge of the highlands of perthshire so as to menace the principal town of that county  his enemies were not unprepared for his reception argyle at the head of his highlanders was dogging the steps of the irish from the west to the east and by force fear or influence had collected an army nearly sufficient to have given battle to that under montrose the lowlands were also prepared for reasons which we assigned at the beginning of this tale a body of six thousand infantry and six or seven thousand cavalry which profanely assumed the title of gods army had been hastily assembled from the shires of fife angus perth stirling and the neighbouring counties a much less force in former times nay even in the preceding reign would have been sufficient to have secured the lowlands against a more formidable descent of highlanders than those united under montrose but times had changed strangely within the last half century before that period the lowlanders were as constantly engaged in war as the mountaineers and were incomparably better disciplined and armed the favourite scottish order of battle somewhat resembled the macedonian phalanx their infantry formed a compact body armed with long spears impenetrable even to the menatarms of the age though well mounted and arrayed in complete proof it may easily be conceived therefore that their ranks could not be broken by the disorderly charge of highland infantry armed for close combat only with swords and ill furnished with missile weapons and having no artillery whatever  this habit of fight was in a great measure changed by the introduction of muskets into the scottish lowland service which not being as yet combined with the bayonet was a formidable weapon at a distance but gave no assurance against the enemy who rushed on to close quarters the pike indeed was not wholly disused in the scottish army but it was no longer the favourite weapon nor was it relied upon as formerly by those in whose hands it was placed insomuch that daniel lupton a tactician of the day has written a book expressly upon the superiority of the musket this change commenced as early as the wars of gustavus adolphus whose marches were made with such rapidity that the pike was very soon thrown aside in his army and exchanged for firearms a circumstance which necessarily accompanied this change as well as the establishment of standing armies whereby war became a trade was the introduction of a laborious and complicated system of discipline combining a variety of words of command with corresponding operations and manoeuvres the neglect of any one of which was sure to throw the whole into confusion war therefore as practised among most nations of europe had assumed much more than formerly the character of a profession or mystery to which previous practice and experience were indispensable requisites such was the natural consequence of standing armies which had almost everywhere and particularly in the long german wars superseded what may be called the natural discipline of the feudal militia  the scottish lowland militia therefore laboured under a double disadvantage when opposed to highlanders they were divested of the spear a weapon which in the hands of their ancestors had so often repelled the impetuous assaults of the mountaineer and they were subjected to a new and complicated species of discipline well adapted perhaps to the use of regular troops who could be rendered completely masters of it but tending only to confuse the ranks of citizen soldiers by whom it was rarely practised and imperfectly understood so much has been done in our own time in bringing back tactics to their first principles and in getting rid of the pedantry of war that it is easy for us to estimate the disadvantages under which a halftrained militia laboured who were taught to consider success as depending upon their exercising with precision a system of tactics which they probably only so far comprehended as to find out when they were wrong but without the power of getting right again neither can it be denied that in the material points of military habits and warlike spirit the lowlanders of the seventeenth century had sunk far beneath their highland countrymen  from the earliest period down to the union of the crowns the whole kingdom of scotland lowlands as well as highlands had been the constant scene of war foreign and domestic and there was probably scarce one of its hardy inhabitants between the age of sixteen and sixty who was not as willing in point of fact as he was literally bound in law to assume arms at the first call of his liege lord or of a royal proclamation the law remained the same in sixteen hundred and fortyfive as a hundred years before but the race of those subjected to it had been bred up under very different feelings they had sat in quiet under their vine and under their figtree and a call to battle involved a change of life as new as it was disagreeable such of them also who lived near unto the highlands were in continual and disadvantageous contact with the restless inhabitants of those mountains by whom their cattle were driven off their dwellings plundered and their persons insulted and who had acquired over them that sort of superiority arising from a constant system of aggression the lowlanders who lay more remote and out of reach of these depredations were influenced by the exaggerated reports circulated concerning the highlanders whom as totally differing in laws language and dress they were induced to regard as a nation of savages equally void of fear and of humanity these various prepossessions joined to the less warlike habits of the lowlanders and their imperfect knowledge of the new and complicated system of discipline for which they had exchanged their natural mode of fighting placed them at great disadvantage when opposed to the highlander in the field of battle the mountaineers on the contrary with the arms and courage of their fathers possessed also their simple and natural system of tactics and bore down with the fullest confidence upon an enemy to whom anything they had been taught of discipline was like sauls armour upon david a hinderance rather than a help because they had not proved it  it was with such disadvantages on the one side and such advantages on the other to counterbalance the difference of superior numbers and the presence of artillery and cavalry that montrose encountered the army of lord elcho upon the field of tippermuir the presbyterian clergy had not been wanting in their efforts to rouse the spirit of their followers and one of them who harangued the troops on the very day of battle hesitated not to say that if ever god spoke by his mouth he promised them in his name that day a great and assured victory the cavalry and artillery were also reckoned sure warrants of success as the novelty of their attack had upon former occasions been very discouraging to the highlanders the place of meeting was an open heath and the ground afforded little advantage to either party except that it allowed the horse of the covenanters to act with effect  a battle upon which so much depended was never more easily decided the lowland cavalry made a show of charging but whether thrown into disorder by the fire of musketry or deterred by a disaffection to the service said to have prevailed among the gentlemen they made no impression on the highlanders whatever and recoiled in disorder from ranks which had neither bayonets nor pikes to protect them montrose saw and instantly availed himself of this advantage he ordered his whole army to charge which they performed with the wild and desperate valour peculiar to mountaineers one officer of the covenanters alone trained in the italian wars made a desperate defence upon the right wing in every other point their line was penetrated at the first onset and this advantage once obtained the lowlanders were utterly unable to contend at close quarters with their more agile and athletic enemies many were slain on the held and such a number in the pursuit that above onethird of the covenanters were reported to have fallen in which number however must be computed a great many fat burgesses who broke their wind in the flight and thus died without stroke of sword we choose to quote our authority for a fact so singulara great many burgesses were killedtwentyfive householders in st andrewsmany were bursten in the flight and died without strokesee baillies letters vol ii page 92  the victors obtained possession of perth and obtained considerable sums of money as well as ample supplies of arms and ammunition but those advantages were to be balanced against an almost insurmountable inconvenience that uniformly attended a highland army the clans could be in no respect induced to consider themselves as regular soldiers or to act as such even so late as the year 17456 when the chevalier charles edward by way of making an example caused a soldier to be shot for desertion the highlanders who composed his army were affected as much by indignation as by fear they could not conceive any principle of justice upon which a mans life could be taken for merely going home when it did not suit him to remain longer with the army such had been the uniform practice of their fathers when a battle was over the campaign was in their opinion ended if it was lost they sought safety in their mountainsif won they returned there to secure their booty at other times they had their cattle to look after and their harvests to sow or reap without which their families would have perished for want in either case there was an end of their services for the time and though they were easily enough recalled by the prospect of fresh adventures and more plunder yet the opportunity of success was in the meantime lost and could not afterwards be recovered this circumstance serves to show even if history had not made us acquainted with the same fact that the highlanders had never been accustomed to make war with the view of permanent conquest but only with the hope of deriving temporary advantage or deciding some immediate quarrel it also explains the reason why montrose with all his splendid successes never obtained any secure or permanent footing in the lowlands and why even those lowland noblemen and gentlemen who were inclined to the royal cause showed diffidence and reluctance to join an army of a character so desultory and irregular as might lead them at all times to apprehend that the highlanders securing themselves by a retreat to their mountains would leave whatever lowlanders might have joined them to the mercy of an offended and predominant enemy the same consideration will also serve to account for the sudden marches which montrose was obliged to undertake in order to recruit his army in the mountains and for the rapid changes of fortune by which we often find him obliged to retreat from before those enemies over whom he had recently been victorious if there should be any who read these tales for any further purpose than that of immediate amusement they will find these remarks not unworthy of their recollection  it was owing to such causes the slackness of the lowland loyalists and the temporary desertion of his highland followers that montrose found himself even after the decisive victory of tippermuir in no condition to face the second army with which argyle advanced upon him from the westward in this emergency supplying by velocity the want of strength he moved suddenly from perth to dundee and being refused admission into that town fell northward upon aberdeen where he expected to be joined by the gordons and other loyalists but the zeal of these gentlemen was for the time effectually bridled by a large body of covenanters commanded by the lord burleigh and supposed to amount to three thousand men these montrose boldly attacked with half their number the battle was fought under the walls of the city and the resolute valour of montroses followers was again successful against every disadvantage  but it was the fate of this great commander always to gain the glory but seldom to reap the fruits of victory he had scarcely time to repose his small army in aberdeen ere he found on the one hand that the gordons were likely to be deterred from joining him by the reasons we have mentioned with some others peculiar to their chief the marquis of huntly on the other hand argyle whose forces had been augmented by those of several lowland noblemen advanced towards montrose at the head of an army much larger than he had yet had to cope with these troops moved indeed with slowness corresponding to the cautious character of their commander but even that caution rendered argyles approach formidable since his very advance implied that he was at the head of an army irresistibly superior  there remained one mode of retreat open to montrose and he adopted it he threw himself into the highlands where he could set pursuit at defiance and where he was sure in every glen to recover those recruits who had left his standard to deposit their booty in their native fastnesses it was thus that the singular character of the army which montrose commanded while on the one hand it rendered his victory in some degree nugatory enabled him on the other under the most disadvantageous circumstances to secure his retreat recruit his forces and render himself more formidable than ever to the enemy before whom he had lately been unable to make a stand  on the present occasion he threw himself into badenoch and rapidly traversing that district as well as the neighbouring country of athole he alarmed the covenanters by successive attacks upon various unexpected points and spread such general dismay that repeated orders were dispatched by the parliament to argyle their commander to engage and disperse montrose at all rates  these commands from his superiors neither suited the haughty spirit nor the temporizing and cautious policy of the nobleman to whom they were addressed he paid accordingly no regard to them but limited his efforts to intrigues among montroses few lowland followers many of whom had become disgusted with the prospect of a highland campaign which exposed their persons to intolerable fatigue and left their estates at the covenanters mercy accordingly several of them left montroses camp at this period he was joined however by a body of forces of more congenial spirit and far better adapted to the situation in which he found himself this reinforcement consisted of a large body of highlanders whom colkitto dispatched for that purpose had levied in argyleshire among the most distinguished was john of moidart called the captain of clan ranald with the stewarts of appin the clan gregor the clan mnab and other tribes of inferior distinction by these means montroses army was so formidably increased that argyle cared no longer to remain in the command of that opposed to him but returned to edinburgh and there threw up his commission under pretence that his army was not supplied with reinforcements and provisions in the manner in which they ought to have been from thence the marquis returned to inverary there in full security to govern his feudal vassals and patriarchal followers and to repose himself in safety on the faith of the clan proverb already quotedit is a far cry to lochow    chapter xvi       such mountains steep such craggy hills      his army on one side enclose      the other side great griesly gills      did fence with fenny mire and moss       which when the earl understood      he council craved of captains all      who bade set forth with mournful mood      and take such fortune as would fall      flodden field an ancient poem  montrose had now a splendid career in his view provided he could obtain the consent of his gallant but desultory troops and their independent chieftains the lowlands lay open before him without an army adequate to check his career for argyles followers had left the covenanters host when their master threw up his commission and many other troops tired of the war had taken the same opportunity to disband themselves by descending strathtay therefore one of the most convenient passes from the highlands montrose had only to present himself in the lowlands in order to rouse the slumbering spirit of chivalry and of loyalty which animated the gentlemen to the north of the forth the possession of these districts with or without a victory would give him the command of a wealthy and fertile part of the kingdom and would enable him by regular pay to place his army on a permanent footing to penetrate as far as the capital perhaps from thence to the border where he deemed it possible to communicate with the yet unsubdued forces of king charles  such was the plan of operations by which the truest glory was to be acquired and the most important success insured for the royal cause accordingly it did not escape the ambitious and daring spirit of him whose services had already acquired him the title of the great marquis but other motives actuated many of his followers and perhaps were not without their secret and unacknowledged influence upon his own feelings  the western chiefs in montroses army almost to a man regarded the marquis of argyle as the most direct and proper object of hostilities almost all of them had felt his power almost all in withdrawing their fencible men from their own glens left their families and property exposed to his vengeance all without exception were desirous of diminishing his sovereignty and most of them lay so near his territories that they might reasonably hope to be gratified by a share of his spoil to these chiefs the possession of inverary and its castle was an event infinitely more important and desirable than the capture of edinburgh the latter event could only afford their clansmen a little transitory pay or plunder the former insured to the chiefs themselves indemnity for the past and security for the future besides these personal reasons the leaders who favoured this opinion plausibly urged that though at his first descent into the lowlands montrose might be superior to the enemy yet every days march he made from the hills must diminish his own forces and expose him to the accumulated superiority of any army which the covenanters could collect from the lowland levies and garrisons on the other hand by crushing argyle effectually he would not only permit his present western friends to bring out that proportion of their forces which they must otherwise leave at home for protection of their families but farther he would draw to his standard several tribes already friendly to his cause but who were prevented from joining him by fear of mcallum more  these arguments as we have already hinted found something responsive in montroses own bosom not quite consonant with the general heroism of his character the houses of argyle and montrose had been in former times repeatedly opposed to each other in war and in politics and the superior advantages acquired by the former had made them the subject of envy and dislike to the neighbouring family who conscious of equal desert had not been so richly rewarded this was not all the existing heads of these rival families had stood in the most marked opposition to each other since the commencement of the present troubles  montrose conscious of the superiority of his talents and of having rendered great service to the covenanters at the beginning of the war had expected from that party the supereminence of council and command which they judged it safer to intrust to the more limited faculties and more extensive power of his rival argyle the having awarded this preference was an injury which montrose never forgave the covenanters and he was still less likely to extend his pardon to argyle to whom he had been postponed he was therefore stimulated by every feeling of hatred which could animate a fiery temper in a fierce age to seek for revenge upon the enemy of his house and person and it is probable that these private motives operated not a little upon his mind when he found the principal part of his followers determined rather to undertake an expedition against the territories of argyle than to take the far more decisive step of descending at once into the lowlands  yet whatever temptation montrose found to carry into effect his attack upon argyleshire he could not easily bring himself to renounce the splendid achievement of a descent upon the lowlands he held more than one council with the principal chiefs combating perhaps his own secret inclination as well as theirs he laid before them the extreme difficulty of marching even a highland army from the eastward into argyleshire through passes scarcely practicable for shepherds and deerstalkers and over mountains with which even the clans lying nearest to them did not pretend to be thoroughly acquainted these difficulties were greatly enhanced by the season of the year which was now advancing towards december when the mountainpasses in themselves so difficult might be expected to be rendered utterly impassable by snowstorms these objections neither satisfied nor silenced the chiefs who insisted upon their ancient mode of making war by driving the cattle which according to the gaelic phrase fed upon the grass of their enemy the council was dismissed late at night and without coming to any decision excepting that the chiefs who supported the opinion that argyle should be invaded promised to seek out among their followers those who might be most capable of undertaking the office of guides upon the expedition  montrose had retired to the cabin which served him for a tent and stretched himself upon a bed of dry fern the only place of repose which it afforded but he courted sleep in vain for the visions of ambition excluded those of morpheus in one moment he imagined himself displaying the royal banner from the reconquered castle of edinburgh detaching assistance to a monarch whose crown depended upon his success and receiving in requital all the advantages and preferments which could be heaped upon him whom a king delighteth to honour at another time this dream splendid as it was faded before the vision of gratified vengeance and personal triumph over a personal enemy to surprise argyle in his stronghold of inveraryto crush in him at once the rival of his own house and the chief support of the presbyteriansto show the covenanters the difference between the preferred argyle and the postponed montrose was a picture too flattering to feudal vengeance to be easily relinquished  while he lay thus busied with contradictory thoughts and feelings the soldier who stood sentinel upon his quarters announced to the marquis that two persons desired to speak with his excellency  their names answered montrose and the cause of their urgency at such a late hour  on these points the sentinel who was one of colkittos irishmen could afford his general little information so that montrose who at such a period durst refuse access to no one lest he might have been neglecting some important intelligence gave directions as a necessary precaution to put the guard under arms and then prepared to receive his untimely visitors his groom of the chambers had scarce lighted a pair of torches and montrose himself had scarce risen from his couch when two men entered one wearing a lowland dress of shamoy leather worn almost to tatters the other a tall upright old highlander of a complexion which might be termed irongrey wasted and worn by frost and tempest  what may be your commands with me my friends said the marquis his hand almost unconsciously seeking the but of one of his pistols for the period as well as the time of night warranted suspicions which the good mien of his visitors was not by any means calculated to remove  i pray leave to congratulate you said the lowlander my most noble general and right honourable lord upon the great battles which you have achieved since i had the fortune to be detached from you it was a pretty affair that tuilzie at tippermuir nevertheless if i might be permitted to counsel  before doing so said the marquis will you be pleased to let me know who is so kind as to favour me with his opinion  truly my lord replied the man i should have hoped that was unnecessary seeing it is not so long since i took on in your service under promise of a commission as major with half a dollar of daily pay and half a dollar of arrears and i am to trust your lordship has nut forgotten my pay as well as my person  my good friend major dalgetty said montrose who by this time perfectly recollected his man you must consider what important things have happened to put my friends faces out of my memory besides this imperfect light but all conditions shall be keptand what news from argyleshire my good major we have long given you up for lost and i was now preparing to take the most signal vengeance upon the old fox who infringed the law of arms in your person  truly my noble lord said dalgetty i have no desire that my return should put any stop to so proper and becoming an intention verily it is in no shape in the earl of argyles favour or mercy that i now stand before you and i shall be no intercessor for him but my escape is under heaven and the excellent dexterity which as an old and accomplished cavalier i displayed in effecting the samei say under these it is owing to the assistance of this old highlander whom i venture to recommend to your lordships special favour as the instrument of saving your lordships to command dugald dalgetty of drumthwacket  a thankworthy service said the marquis gravely which shall certainly be requited in the manner it deserves  kneel down ranald said major dalgetty as we must now call him kneel down and kiss his excellencys hand  the prescribed form of acknowledgment not being according to the custom of ranalds country he contented himself with folding his arms on his bosom and making a low inclination of his head  this poor man my lord said major dalgetty continuing his speech with a dignified air of protection towards ranald meagh has strained all his slender means to defend my person from mine enemies although having no better weapons of a missile sort than bows and arrows whilk your lordship will hardly believe  you will see a great many such weapons in my camp said montrose and we find them serviceable in fact for the admirers of archery it may be stated not only that many of the highlanders in montroses army used these antique missiles but even in england the bow and quiver once the glory of the bold yeomen of that land were occasionally used during the great civil wars  serviceable my lord said dalgetty i trust your lordship will permit me to be surprisedbows and arrowsi trust you will forgive my recommending the substitution of muskets the first convenient opportunity but besides defending me this honest highlander also was at the pains of curing me in respect that i had got a touch of the wars in my retreat which merits my best requital in this special introduction of him to your lordships notice and protection  what is your name my friend said montrose turning to the highlander  it may not be spoken answered the mountaineer  that is to say interpreted major dalgetty he desires to have his name concealed in respect he hath in former days taken a castle slain certain children and done other things whilk as your good lordship knows are often practised in war time but excite no benevolence towards the perpetrator in the friends of those who sustain injury i have known in my military experience many brave cavaliers put to death by the boors simply for having used military license upon the country  i understand said montrose this person is at feud with some of our followers let him retire to the court of guard and we will think of the best mode of protecting him  you hear ranald said major dalgetty with an air of superiority his excellency wishes to hold privy council with me you must go to the court of guardhe does not know where that is poor fellowhe is a young soldier for so old a man i will put him under the charge of a sentinel and return to your lordship incontinent he did so and returned accordingly  montroses first enquiry respected the embassy to inverary and he listened with attention to dalgettys reply notwithstanding the prolixity of the majors narrative it required an effort from the marquis to maintain his attention but no one better knew that where information is to be derived from the report of such agents as dalgetty it can only be obtained by suffering them to tell their story in their own way accordingly the marquiss patience was at length rewarded among other spoils which the captain thought himself at liberty to take was a packet of argyles private papers these he consigned to the hands of his general a humour of accounting however which went no farther for i do not understand that he made any mention of the purse of gold which he had appropriated at the same time that he made seizure of the papers aforesaid snatching a torch from the wall montrose was in an instant deeply engaged in the perusal of these documents in which it is probable he found something to animate his personal resentment against his rival argyle  does he not fear me said he then he shall feel me will he fire my castle of murdochinverary shall raise the first smokeo for a guide through the skirts of strathfillan  whatever might be dalgettys personal conceit he understood his business sufficiently to guess at montroses meaning he instantly interrupted his own prolix narration of the skirmish which had taken place and the wound he had received in his retreat and began to speak to the point which he saw interested his general  if said he your excellency wishes to make an infall into argyleshire this poor man ranald of whom i told you together with his children and companions know every pass into that land both leading from the east and from the north  indeed said montrose what reason have you to believe their knowledge so extensive  so please your excellency answered dalgetty during the weeks that i remained with them for cure of my wound they were repeatedly obliged to shift their quarters in respect of argyles repeated attempts to repossess himself of the person of an officer who was honoured with your excellencys confidence so that i had occasion to admire the singular dexterity and knowledge of the face of the country with which they alternately achieved their retreat and their advance and when at length i was able to repair to your excellencys standard this honest simple creature ranald maceagh guided me by paths which my steed gustavus which your lordship may remember trode with perfect safety so that i said to myself that where guides spies or intelligencers were required in a highland campaign in that western country more expert persons than he and his attendants could not possibly be desired  and can you answer for this mans fidelity said montrose what is his name and condition  he is an outlaw and robber by profession something also of a homicide or murderer answered dalgetty and by name called ranald maceagh whilk signifies ranald the son of the mist  i should remember something of that name said montrose pausing did not these children of the mist perpetrate some act of cruelty upon the maulays  major dalgetty mentioned the circumstance of the murder of the forester and montroses active memory at once recalled all the circumstances of the feud  it is most unlucky said montrose this inexpiable quarrel between these men and the maulays allan has borne himself bravely in these wars and possesses by the wild mystery of his behaviour and language so much influence over the minds of his countrymen that the consequences of disobliging him might be serious at the same time these men being so capable of rendering useful service and being as you say major dalgetty perfectly trustworthy  i will pledge my pay and arrears my horse and arms my head and neck upon their fidelity said the major and your excellency knows that a soldado could say no more for his own father  true said montrose but as this is a matter of particular moment i would willingly know the grounds of so positive an assurance  concisely then my lord said the major not only did they disdain to profit by a handsome reward which argyle did me the honour to place upon this poor head of mine and not only did they abstain from pillaging my personal property whilk was to an amount that would have tempted regular soldiers in any service of europe and not only did they restore me my horse whilk your excellency knows to be of value but i could not prevail on them to accept one stiver doit or maravedi for the trouble and expenses of my sick bed they actually refused my coined money when freely offereda tale seldom to be told in a christian land  i admit said montrose after a moments reflection that their conduct towards you is good evidence of their fidelity but how to secure against the breaking out of this feud he paused and then suddenly added i had forgot i have supped while you major have been travelling by moonlight  he called to his attendants to fetch a stoup of wine and some refreshments major dalgetty who had the appetite of a convalescent returned from highland quarters needed not any pressing to partake of what was set before him but proceeded to dispatch his food with such alacrity that the marquis filling a cup of wine and drinking to his health could not help remarking that coarse as the provisions of his camp were he was afraid major dalgetty had fared much worse during his excursion into argyleshire  your excellency may take your corporal oath upon that said the worthy major speaking with his mouth full for argyles bread and water are yet stale and mouldy in my recollection and though they did their best yet the viands that the children of the mist procured for me poor helpless creatures as they were were so unrefreshful to my body that when enclosed in my armour whilk i was fain to leave behind me for expeditions sake i rattled therein like the shrivelled kernel in a nut that hath been kept on to a second halloween  you must take the due means to repair these losses major dalgetty  in troth answered the soldier i shall hardly be able to compass that unless my arrears are to be exchanged for present pay for i protest to your excellency that the three stone weight which i have lost were simply raised upon the regular accountings of the states of holland  in that case said the marquis you are only reduced to good marching order as for the pay let us once have victoryvictory major and your wishes and all our wishes shall be amply fulfilled meantime help yourself to another cup of wine  to your excellencys health said the major filling a cup to the brim to show the zeal with which he drank the toast and victory over all our enemies and particularly over argyle i hope to twitch another handful from his board myselfi have had one pluck at it already  very true answered montrose but to return to those men of the mist you understand dalgetty that their presence here and the purpose for which we employ them is a secret between you and me  delighted as montrose had anticipated with this mark of his generals confidence the major laid his hand upon his nose and nodded intelligence  how many may there be of ranalds followers continued the marquis  they are reduced so far as i know to some eight or ten men answered major dalgetty and a few women and children  where are they now demanded montrose  in a valley at three miles distance answered the soldier awaiting your excellencys command i judged it not fit to bring them to your leaguer without your excellencys orders  you judged very well said montrose it would be proper that they remain where they are or seek some more distant place of refuge i will send them money though it is a scarce article with me at present  it is quite unnecessary said major dalgetty your excellency has only to hint that the maulays are going in that direction and my friends of the mist will instantly make volteface and go to the right about  that were scarce courteous said the marquis better send them a few dollars to purchase them some cattle for the support of the women and children  they know how to come by their cattle at a far cheaper rate said the major but let it be as your excellency wills  let ranald maceagh said montrose select one or two of his followers men whom he can trust and who are capable of keeping their own secret and ours these with their chief for scoutmastergeneral shall serve for our guides let them be at my tent tomorrow at daybreak and see if possible that they neither guess my purpose nor hold any communication with each other in privatethis old man has he any children  they have been killed or hanged answered the major to the number of a round dozen as i believebut he hath left one grandchild a smart and hopeful youth whom i have noted to be never without a pebble in his plaidnook to fling at whatsoever might come in his way being a symbol that like david who was accustomed to sling smooth stones taken from the brook he may afterwards prove an adventurous warrior  that boy major dalgetty said the marquis i will have to attend upon my own person i presume he will have sense enough to keep his name secret  your excellency need not fear that answered dalgetty these highland imps from the moment they chip the shell  well interrupted montrose that boy shall be pledge for the fidelity of his parent and if he prove faithful the childs preferment shall be his rewardand now major dalgetty i will license your departure for the night tomorrow you will introduce this maceagh under any name or character he may please to assume i presume his profession has rendered him sufficiently expert in all sort of disguises or we may admit john of moidart into our schemes who has sense practicability and intelligence and will probably allow this man for a time to be disguised as one of his followers for you major my groom of the chambers will be your quartermaster for this evening  major dalgetty took his leave with a joyful heart greatly elated with the reception he had met with and much pleased with the personal manners of his new general which as he explained at great length to ranald maceagh reminded him in many respects of the demeanour of the immortal gustavus adolphus the lion of the north and bulwark of the protestant faith    chapter xvii        the march begins in military state      and nations on his eyes suspended wait      stern famine guards the solitary coast      and winter barricades the realms of frost      he comesnor want nor cold his course delay      vanity of human wishes  by break of day montrose received in his cabin old maceagh and questioned him long and particularly as to the means of approaching the country of argyle he made a note of his answers which he compared with those of two of his followers whom he introduced as the most prudent and experienced he found them to correspond in all respects but still unsatisfied where precaution was so necessary the marquis compared the information he had received with that he was able to collect from the chiefs who lay most near to the destined scene of invasion and being in all respects satisfied of its accuracy he resolved to proceed in full reliance upon it  in one point montrose changed his mind having judged it unfit to take the boy kenneth into his own service lest in case of his birth being discovered it should be resented as an offence by the numerous clans who entertained a feudal enmity to this devoted family he requested the major to take him in attendance upon himself and as he accompanied this request with a handsome douceur under pretence of clothing and equipping the lad this change was agreeable to all parties  it was about breakfasttime when major dalgetty being dismissed by montrose went in quest of his old acquaintances lord menteith and the maulays to whom he longed to communicate his own adventures as well as to learn from them the particulars of the campaign it may be imagined he was received with great glee by men to whom the late uniformity of their military life had rendered any change of society an interesting novelty allan maulay alone seemed to recoil from his former acquaintance although when challenged by his brother he could render no other reason than a reluctance to be familiar with one who had been so lately in the company of argyle and other enemies major dalgetty was a little alarmed by this sort of instinctive consciousness which allan seemed to entertain respecting the society he had been lately keeping he was soon satisfied however that the perceptions of the seer in this particular were not infallible  as ranald maceagh was to be placed under major dalgettys protection and superintendence it was necessary he should present him to those persons with whom he was most likely to associate the dress of the old man had in the meantime been changed from the tartan of his clan to a sort of clothing peculiar to the men of the distant isles resembling a waistcoat with sleeves and a petticoat all made in one piece this dress was laced from top to bottom in front and bore some resemblance to that called polonaise still worn by children in scotland of the lower rank the tartan hose and bonnet completed the dress which old men of the last century remembered well to have seen worn by the distant islesmen who came to the earl of mars standard in the year 1715  major dalgetty keeping his eye on allan as he spoke introduced ranald maceagh under the fictitious name of ranald macgillihuron in benbecula who had escaped with him out of argyles prison he recommended him as a person skilful in the arts of the harper and the senachie and by no means contemptible in the quality of a secondsighted person or seer while making this exposition major dalgetty stammered and hesitated in a way so unlike the usual glib forwardness of his manner that he could not have failed to have given suspicion to allan maulay had not that persons whole attention been engaged in steadily perusing the features of the person thus introduced to him this steady gaze so much embarrassed ranald maceagh that his hand was beginning to sink down towards his dagger in expectation of a hostile assault when allan suddenly crossing the floor of the hut extended his hand to him in the way of friendly greeting they sat down side by side and conversed in a low mysterious tone of voice menteith and angus maulay were not surprised at this for there prevailed among the highlanders who pretended to the secondsight a sort of freemasonry which generally induced them upon meeting to hold communication with each other on the nature and extent of their visionary experiences  does the sight come gloomy upon your spirits said allan to his new acquaintance  as dark as the shadow upon the moon replied ranald when she is darkened in her midcourse in heaven and prophets foretell of evil times  come hither said allan come more this way i would converse with you apart for men say that in your distant islands the sight is poured forth with more clearness and power than upon us who dwell near the sassenach  while they were plunged into their mystic conference the two english cavaliers entered the cabin in the highest possible spirits and announced to angus maulay that orders had been issued that all should hold themselves in readiness for an immediate march to the westward having delivered themselves of their news with much glee they paid their compliments to their old acquaintance major dalgetty whom they instantly recognised and enquired after the health of his charger gustavus  i humbly thank you gentlemen answered the soldier gustavas is well though like his master somewhat barer on the ribs than when you offered to relieve me of him at darnlinvarach and let me assure you that before you have made one or two of those marches which you seem to contemplate with so much satisfaction in prospect you will leave my good knights some of your english beef and probably an english horse or two behind you  both exclaimed that they cared very little what they found or what they left provided the scene changed from dogging up and down angus and aberdeenshire in pursuit of an enemy who would neither fight nor run away  if such be the case said angus maulay i must give orders to my followers and make provision too for the safe conveyance of annot lyle for an advance into mcallum mores country will be a farther and fouler road than these pinks of cumbrian knighthood are aware of so saying he left the cabin  annot lyle repeated dalgetty is she following the campaign  surely replied sir giles musgrave his eye glancing slightly from lord menteith to allan maulay we could neither march nor fight advance nor retreat without the influence of the princess of harps  the princess of broadswords and targets i say answered his companion for the lady of montrose herself could not be more courteously waited upon she has four highland maidens and as many barelegged gillies to wait upon her orders  and what would you have gentlemen said allan turning suddenly from the highlander with whom he was in conversation would you yourselves have left an innocent female the companion of your infancy to die by violence or perish by famine there is not by this time a roof upon the habitation of my fathersour crops have been destroyed and our cattle have been drivenand you gentlemen have to bless god that coming from a milder and more civilized country you expose only your own lives in this remorseless war without apprehension that your enemies will visit with their vengeance the defenceless pledges you may have left behind you  the englishmen cordially agreed that they had the superiority in this respect and the company now dispersing went each to his several charge or occupation  allan lingered a moment behind still questioning the reluctant ranald maceagh upon a point in his supposed visions by which he was greatly perplexed repeatedly he said have i had the sight of a gael who seemed to plunge his weapon into the body of menteithof that young nobleman in the scarlet laced cloak who has just now left the bothy but by no effort though i have gazed till my eyes were almost fixed in the sockets can i discover the face of this highlander or even conjecture who he may be although his person and air seem familiar to me see note iiwraiths  have you reversed your own plaid said ranald according to the rule of the experienced seers in such case  i have answered allan speaking low and shuddering as if with internal agony  and in what guise did the phantom then appear to you said ranald  with his plaid also reversed answered allan in the same low and convulsed tone  then be assured said ranald that your own hand and none other will do the deed of which you have witnessed the shadow  so has my anxious soul a hundred times surmised replied allan but it is impossible were i to read the record in the eternal book of fate i would declare it impossiblewe are bound by the ties of blood and by a hundred ties more intimatewe have stood side by side in battle and our swords have reeked with the blood of the same enemiesit is impossible i should harm him  that you will do so answered ranald is certain though the cause be hid in the darkness of futurity you say he continued suppressing his own emotions with difficulty that side by side you have pursued your prey like bloodhoundshave you never seen bloodhounds turn their fangs against each other and fight over the body of a throttled deer  it is false said maulay starting up these are not the forebodings of fate but the temptation of some evil spirit from the bottomless pit so saying he strode out of the cabin  thou hast it said the son of the mist looking after him with an air of exultation the barbed arrow is in thy side spirits of the slaughtered rejoice soon shall your murderers swords be dyed in each others blood  on the succeeding morning all was prepared and montrose advanced by rapid marches up the river tay and poured his desultory forces into the romantic vale around the lake of the same name which lies at the head of that river the inhabitants were campbells not indeed the vassals of argyle but of the allied and kindred house of glenorchy which now bears the name of breadalbane being taken by surprise they were totally unprepared for resistance and were compelled to be passive witnesses of the ravages which took place among their flocks and herds advancing in this manner to the vale of loch dochart and laying waste the country around him montrose reached the most difficult point of his enterprise  to a modern army even with the assistance of the good military road which now leads up by teinedrum to the head of loch awe the passage of these extensive wilds would seem a task of some difficulty but at this period and for long afterwards there was no road or path whatsoever and to add to the difficulty the mountains were already covered with snow it was a sublime scene to look up to them piled in great masses one upon another the front rank of dazzling whiteness while those which arose behind them caught a rosy tint from the setting of a clear wintry sun ben cruachan superior in magnitude and seeming the very citadel of the genius of the region rose high above the others showing his glimmering and scathed peak to the distance of many miles  the followers of montrose were men not to be daunted by the sublime yet terrible prospect before them many of them were of that ancient race of highlanders who not only willingly made their couch in the snow but considered it as effeminate luxury to use a snowball for a pillow plunder and revenge lay beyond the frozen mountains which they beheld and they did not permit themselves to be daunted by the difficulty of traversing them montrose did not allow their spirits time to subside he ordered the pipes to play in the van the ancient pibroch entitled hoggil nam bo etc that is we come through snowdrift to drive the prey the shrilling sounds of which had often struck the vales of the lennox with terror it is the familymarch of the mfarlanes a warlike and predatory clan who inhabited the western banks of lochlomond see waverly note xv the troops advanced with the nimble alacrity of mountaineers and were soon involved in the dangerous pass through which ranald acted as their guide going before them with a select party to track out the way  the power of man at no time appears more contemptible than when it is placed in contrast with scenes of natural terror and dignity the victorious army of montrose whose exploits had struck terror into all scotland when ascending up this terrific pass seemed a contemptible handful of stragglers in the act of being devoured by the jaws of the mountain which appeared ready to close upon them even montrose half repented the boldness of his attempt as he looked down from the summit of the first eminence which he attained upon the scattered condition of his small army the difficulty of getting forward was so great that considerable gaps began to occur in the line of march and the distance between the van centre and rear was each moment increased in a degree equally incommodious and dangerous it was with great apprehension that montrose looked upon every point of advantage which the hill afforded in dread it might be found occupied by an enemy prepared for defence and he often afterwards was heard to express his conviction that had the passes of strathfillan been defended by two hundred resolute men not only would his progress have been effectually stopped but his army must have been in danger of being totally cut off security however the bane of many a strong country and many a fortress betrayed on this occasion the district of argyle to his enemies the invaders had only to contend with the natural difficulties of the path and with the snow which fortunately had not fallen in any great quantity the army no sooner reached the summit of the ridge of hills dividing argyleshire from the district of breadalbane than they rushed down upon the devoted vales beneath them with a fury sufficiently expressive of the motives which had dictated a movement so difficult and hazardous  montrose divided his army into three bodies in order to produce a wider and more extensive terror one of which was commanded by the captain of clan ranald one intrusted to the leading of colkitto and the third remained under his own direction he was thus enabled to penetrate the country of argyle at three different points resistance there was none the flight of the shepherds from the hills had first announced in the peopled districts this formidable irruption and wherever the clansmen were summoned out they were killed disarmed and dispersed by an enemy who had anticipated their motions major dalgetty who had been sent forward against inverary with the few horse of the army that were fit for service managed his matters so well that he had very nearly surprised argyle as he expressed it inter pocula and it was only a rapid flight by water which saved that chief from death or captivity but the punishment which argyle himself escaped fell heavily upon his country and clan and the ravages committed by montrose on that devoted land although too consistent with the genius of the country and times have been repeatedly and justly quoted as a blot on his actions and character  argyle in the meantime had fled to edinburgh to lay his complaints before the convention of estates to meet the exigence of the moment a considerable army was raised under general baillie a presbyterian officer of skill and fidelity with whom was joined in command the celebrated sir john urrie a soldier of fortune like dalgetty who had already changed sides twice during the civil war and was destined to turn his coat a third time before it was ended argyle also burning with indignation proceeded to levy his own numerous forces in order to avenge himself of his feudal enemy he established his headquarters at dunbarton where he was soon joined by a considerable force consisting chiefly of his own clansmen and dependants being there joined by baillie and urrie with a very considerable army of regular forces he prepared to march into argyleshire and chastise the invader of his paternal territories  but montrose while these two formidable armies were forming a junction had been recalled from that ravaged country by the approach of a third collected in the north under the earl of seaforth who after some hesitation having embraced the side of the covenanters had now with the assistance of the veteran garrison of inverness formed a considerable army with which he threatened montrose from invernessshire enclosed in a wasted and unfriendly country and menaced on each side by advancing enemies of superior force it might have been supposed that montroses destruction was certain but these were precisely the circumstances under which the active and enterprising genius of the great marquis was calculated to excite the wonder and admiration of his friends the astonishment and terror of his enemies as if by magic he collected his scattered forces from the wasteful occupation in which they had been engaged and scarce were they again united ere argyle and his associate generals were informed that the royalists having suddenly disappeared from argyleshire had retreated northwards among the dusky and impenetrable mountains of lochaber  the sagacity of the generals opposed to montrose immediately conjectured that it was the purpose of their active antagonist to fight with and if possible to destroy seaforth ere they could come to his assistance this occasioned a corresponding change in their operations leaving this chieftain to make the best defence he could urrie and baillie again separated their forces from those of argyle and having chiefly horse and lowland troops under their command they kept the southern side of the grampian ridge moving along eastward into the county of angus resolving from thence to proceed into aberdeenshire in order to intercept montrose if he should attempt to escape in that direction  argyle with his own levies and other troops undertook to follow montroses march so that in case he should come to action either with seaforth or with baillie and urrie he might be placed between two fires by this third army which at a secure distance was to hang upon his rear  for this purpose argyle once more moved towards inverary having an opportunity at every step to deplore the severities which the hostile clans had exercised on his dependants and country whatever noble qualities the highlanders possessed and they had many clemency in treating a hostile country was not of the number but even the ravages of hostile troops combined to swell the number of argyles followers it is still a highland proverb he whose house is burnt must become a soldier and hundreds of the inhabitants of these unfortunate valleys had now no means of maintenance save by exercising upon others the severities they had themselves sustained and no future prospect of happiness excepting in the gratification of revenge his bands were therefore augmented by the very circumstances which had desolated his country and argyle soon found himself at the head of three thousand determined men distinguished for activity and courage and commanded by gentlemen of his own name who yielded to none in those qualities under himself he conferred the principal command upon sir duncan campbell of ardenvohr and another sir duncan campbell of auchenbreck this last character is historical an experienced and veteran soldier whom he had recalled from the wars of ireland for this purpose the cold spirit of argyle himself however clogged the military councils of his more intrepid assistants and it was resolved notwithstanding their increased force to observe the same plan of operations and to follow montrose cautiously in whatever direction he should march avoiding an engagement until an opportunity should occur of falling upon his rear while he should be engaged with another enemy in front    chapter xviii       piobracht au donuildhu      piobrachet au donuil      piobrachet agus sbreittach      feacht an innerlochy       the wartune of donald the black      the wartune of black donald      the pipes and the banner      are up in the rendezvous of inverlochy  the military road connecting the chains of forts as it is called and running in the general line of the present caledonian canal has now completely opened the great glen or chasm extending almost across the whole island once doubtless filled by the sea and still affording basins for that long line of lakes by means of which modern art has united the german and atlantic oceans the paths or tracks by which the natives traversed this extensive valley were in 16456 in the same situation as when they awaked the strain of an irish engineer officer who had been employed in converting them into practicable military roads and whose eulogium begins and for aught i know ends as follows  had you seen but these roads before they were made you would have held up your hands and blessd general wade  but bad as the ordinary paths were montrose avoided them and led his army like a herd of wild deer from mountain to mountain and from forest to forest where his enemies could learn nothing of his motions while he acquired the most perfect knowledge respecting theirs from the friendly clans of cameron and mdonnell whose mountainous districts he now traversed strict orders had been given that argyles advance should be watched and that all intelligence respecting his motions should be communicated instantly to the general himself  it was a moonlight night and montrose worn out by the fatigues of the day was laid down to sleep in a miserable shieling he had only slumbered two hours when some one touched his shoulder he looked up and by the stately form and deep voice easily recognised the chief of the camerons  i have news for you said that leader which is worth while to arise and listen to  milduy mhichconnel dhu the descendant of black donald can bring no other said montrose addressing the chief by his patronymic titleare they good or bad  as you may take them said the chieftain  are they certain demanded montrose  yes answered milduy or another messenger should have brought them know that tired with the task imposed upon me of accompanying that unhappy dalgetty and his handful of horse who detained me for hours on the march at the pace of a crippled badger i made a stretch of four miles with six of my people in the direction of inverlochy and there met with ian of glenroy who had been out for intelligence argyle is moving upon inverlochy with three thousand chosen men commanded by the flower of the sons of diarmidthese are my newsthey are certainit is for you to construe their purport  their purport must be good answered montrose readily and cheerfully the voice of milduy is ever pleasant in the ears of montrose and most pleasant when it speaks of some brave enterprise at handwhat are our musters  he then called for light and easily ascertained that a great part of his followers having as usual dispersed to secure their booty he had not with him above twelve or fourteen hundred men  not much above a third said montrose pausing of argyles force and highlanders opposed to highlanderswith the blessing of god upon the royal cause i would not hesitate were the odds but one to two  then do not hesitate said cameron for when your trumpets shall sound to attack mcallum more not a man of these glens will remain deaf to the summons glengarrykeppochi myselfwould destroy with fire and sword the wretch who should remain behind under any pretence whatsoever tomorrow or the next day shall be a day of battle to all who bear the name of mdonnell or cameron whatever be the event  it is gallantly said my noble friend said montrose grasping his hand and i were worse than a coward did i not do justice to such followers by entertaining the most indubitable hopes of success we will turn back on this mcallum more who follows us like a raven to devour the relics of our army should we meet braver men who may be able to break its strength let the chiefs and leaders be called together as quickly as possible and you who have brought us the first news of this joyful eventfor such it shall beyou milduy shall bring it to a joyful issue by guiding us the best and nearest road against our enemy  that will i willingly do said milduy if i have shown you paths by which to retreat through these dusky wilds with far more readiness will i teach you how to advance against your foe  a general bustle now prevailed and the leaders were everywhere startled from the rude couches on which they had sought temporary repose  i never thought said major dalgetty when summoned up from a handful of rugged heather roots to have parted from a bed as hard as a stablebroom with such bad will but indubitably having but one man of military experience in his army his excellency the marquis may be vindicated in putting him upon hard duty  so saying he repaired to the council where notwithstanding his pedantry montrose seemed always to listen to him with considerable attention partly because the major really possessed military knowledge and experience and often made suggestions which were found of advantage and partly because it relieved the general from the necessity of deferring entirely to the opinion of the highland chiefs and gave him additional ground for disputing it when it was not agreeable to his own on the present occasion dalgetty joyfully acquiesced in the proposal of marching back and confronting argyle which he compared to the valiant resolution of the great gustavus who moved against the duke of bavaria and enriched his troops by the plunder of that fertile country although menaced from the northward by the large army which wallenstein had assembled in bohemia  the chiefs of glengarry keppoch and lochiel whose clans equal in courage and military fame to any in the highlands lay within the neighbourhood of the scene of action dispatched the fiery cross through their vassals to summon every one who could bear arms to meet the kings lieutenant and to join the standards of their respective chiefs as they marched towards inverlochy as the order was emphatically given it was speedily and willingly obeyed their natural love of war their zeal for the royal causefor they viewed the king in the light of a chief whom his clansmen had desertedas well as their implicit obedience to their own patriarch drew in to montroses army not only all in the neighbourhood who were able to bear arms but some who in age at least might have been esteemed past the use of them during the next days march which being directed straight through the mountains of lochaber was unsuspected by the enemy his forces were augmented by handfuls of men issuing from each glen and ranging themselves under the banners of their respective chiefs this was a circumstance highly inspiriting to the rest of the army who by the time they approached the enemy found their strength increased considerably more than onefourth as had been prophesied by the valiant leader of the camerons  while montrose executed this countermarch argyle had at the head of his gallant army advanced up the southern side of locheil and reached the river lochy which combines that lake with lochlochy the ancient castle of inverlochy once as it is said a royal fortress and still although dismantled a place of some strength and consideration offered convenient headquarters and there was ample room for argyles army to encamp around him in the valley where the lochy joins locheil several barges had attended loaded with provisions so that they were in every respect as well accommodated as such an army wished or expected to be argyle in council with auchenbreck and ardenvohr expressed his full confidence that montrose was now on the brink of destruction that his troops must gradually diminish as he moved eastward through such uncouth paths that if he went westward he must encounter urrie and baillie if northward fall into the hands of seaforth or should he choose any haltingplace he would expose himself to be attacked by three armies at once  i cannot rejoice in the prospect my lord said auchebreck that james grahame will be crushed with little assistance of ours he has left a heavy account in argyleshire against him and i long to reckon with him drop of blood for drop of blood i love not the payment of such debts by third hands  you are too scrupulous said argyle what signifies it by whose hands the blood of the grahames is spilt it is time that of the sons of diarmid should cease to flowwhat say you ardenvohr  i say my lord replied sir duncan that i think auchenbreck will be gratified and will himself have a personal opportunity of settling accounts with montrose for his depredations reports have reached our outposts that the camerons are assembling their full strength on the skirts of bennevis this must be to join the advance of montrose and not to cover his retreat  it must be some scheme of harassing and depredation said argyle devised by the inveterate malignity of milduy which he terms loyalty they can intend no more than an attack on our outposts or some annoyance to tomorrows march  i have sent out scouts said sir duncan in every direction to procure intelligence and we must soon hear whether they really do assemble any force upon what point or with what purpose  it was late ere any tidings were received but when the moon had arisen a considerable bustle in the camp and a noise immediately after heard in the castle announced the arrival of important intelligence of the scouts first dispersed by ardenvohr some had returned without being able to collect anything save uncertain rumours concerning movements in the country of the camerons it seemed as if the skirts of bennevis were sending forth those unaccountable and portentous sounds with which they sometimes announce the near approach of a storm others whose zeal carried them farther upon their mission were entrapped and slain or made prisoners by the inhabitants of the fastnesses into which they endeavoured to penetrate at length on the rapid advance of montroses army his advanced guard and the outposts of argyle became aware of each others presence and after exchanging a few musketshots and arrows fell back to their respective main bodies to convey intelligence and receive orders  sir duncan campbell and auchenbreck instantly threw themselves on horseback in order to visit the state of the outposts and argyle maintained his character of commanderinchief with reputation by making a respectable arrangement of his forces in the plain as it was evident that they might now expect a night alarm or an attack in the morning at farthest montrose had kept his forces so cautiously within the defiles of the mountain that no effort which auchenbreck or ardenvohr thought it prudent to attempt could ascertain his probable strength they were aware however that at the utmost computation it must be inferior to their own and they returned to argyle to inform him of the amount of their observations but that nobleman refused to believe that montrose could be in presence himself he said it was a madness of which even james grahame in his height of presumptuous frenzy was incapable and he doubted not that their march was only impeded by their ancient enemies glencoe keppoch and glengarry and perhaps mvourigh with his mphersons might have assembled a force which he knew must be greatly inferior in numbers to his own and whom therefore he doubted not to disperse by force or by terms of capitulation  the spirit of argyles followers was high breathing vengeance for the disasters which their country had so lately undergone and the night passed in anxious hopes that the morning might dawn upon their vengeance the outposts of either army kept a careful watch and the soldiers of argyle slept in the order of battle which they were next day to occupy  a pale dawn had scarce begun to tinge the tops of these immense mountains when the leaders of both armies prepared for the business of the day it was the second of february 16456 the clansmen of argyle were arranged in two lines not far from the angle between the river and the lake and made an appearance equally resolute and formidable auchenbreck would willingly have commenced the battle by an attack on the outposts of the enemy but argyle with more cautious policy preferred receiving to making the onset signals were soon heard that they would not long wait for it in vain the campbells could distinguish in the gorge of the mountains the wartunes of various clans as they advanced to the onset that of the camerons which bears the ominous words addressed to the wolves and ravens come to me and i will give you flesh was loudly reechoed from their native glens in the language of the highland bards the war voice of glengarry was not silent and the gathering tunes of other tribes could be plainly distinguished as they successively came up to the extremity of the passes from which they were to descend into the plain  you see said argyle to his kinsmen it is as i said we have only to deal with our neighbours james grahame has not ventured to show us his banner  at this moment there resounded from the gorge of the pass a lively flourish of trumpets in that note with which it was the ancient scottish fashion to salute the royal standard  you may hear my lord from yonder signal said sir duncan campbell that he who pretends to be the kings lieutenant must be in person among these men  and has probably horse with him said auchenbreck which i could not have anticipated but shall we look pale for that my lord when we have foes to fight and wrongs to revenge  argyle was silent and looked upon his arm which hung in a sash owing to a fall which he had sustained in a preceding march  it is true interrupted ardenvohr eagerly my lord of argyle you are disabled from using either sword or pistol you must retire on board the galleysyour life is precious to us as a headyour hand cannot be useful to us as a soldier  no said argyle pride contending with irresolution it shall never be said that i fled before montrose if i cannot fight i will at least die in the midst of my children  several other principal chiefs of the campbells with one voice conjured and obtested their chieftain to leave them for that day to the leading of ardenvohr and auchenbreck and to behold the conflict from a distance and in safetywe dare not stigmatize argyle with poltroonery for though his life was marked by no action of bravery yet he behaved with so much composure and dignity in the final and closing scene that his conduct upon the present and similar occasions should be rather imputed to indecision than to want of courage but when the small still voice within a mans own breast which tells him that his life is of consequence to himself is seconded by that of numbers around him who assure him that it is of equal advantage to the public history affords many examples of men more habitually daring than argyle who have consulted selfpreservation when the temptations to it were so powerfully increased  see him on board if you will sir duncan said auchenbreck to his kinsman it must be my duty to prevent this spirit from spreading farther among us  so saying he threw himself among the ranks entreating commanding and conjuring the soldiers to remember their ancient fame and their present superiority the wrongs they had to revenge if successful and the fate they had to dread if vanquished and imparting to every bosom a portion of the fire which glowed in his own slowly meanwhile and apparently with reluctance argyle suffered himself to be forced by his officious kinsmen to the verge of the lake and was transported on board of a galley from the deck of which he surveyed with more safety than credit the scene which ensued  sir duncan campbell of ardenvohr notwithstanding the urgency of the occasion stood with his eyes riveted on the boat which bore his chieftain from the field of battle there were feelings in his bosom which could not be expressed for the character of a chief was that of a father and the heart of a clansman durst not dwell upon his failings with critical severity as upon those of other men argyle too harsh and severe to others was generous and liberal among his kinsmen and the noble heart of ardenvohr was wrung with bitter anguish when he reflected to what interpretation his present conduct might subject him  it is better it should be so said he to himself devouring his own emotion butof his line of a hundred sires i know not one who would have retired while the banner of diarmid waved in the wind in the face of its most inveterate foes  a loud shout now compelled him to turn and to hasten with all dispatch to his post which was on the right flank of argyles little army  the retreat of argyle had not passed unobserved by his watchful enemy who occupying the superior ground could mark every circumstance which passed below the movement of three or four horsemen to the rear showed that those who retreated were men of rank  they are going said dalgetty to put their horses out of danger like prudent cavaliers yonder goes sir duncan campbell riding a brown bay gelding which i had marked for my own second charger  you are wrong major said montrose with a bitter smile they are saving their precious chiefgive the signal for assault instantlysend the word through the ranksgentlemen noble chiefs glengarry keppoch mvourigh upon them instantlyride to milduy major dalgetty and tell him to charge as he loves lochaberreturn and bring our handful of horse to my standard they shall be placed with the irish as a reserve    chapter xix       as meets a rock a thousand waves so inisfail met lochlin      ossian  the trumpets and bagpipes those clamorous harbingers of blood and death at once united in the signal for onset which was replied to by the cry of more than two thousand warriors and the echoes of the mountain glens behind them divided into three bodies or columns the highland followers of montrose poured from the defiles which had hitherto concealed them from their enemies and rushed with the utmost determination upon the campbells who waited their charge with the greatest firmness behind these charging columns marched in line the irish under colkitto intended to form the reserve with them was the royal standard and montrose himself and on the flanks were about fifty horse under dalgetty which by wonderful exertions had been kept in some sort fit for service  the right column of royalists was led by glengarry the left by lochiel and the centre by the earl of menteith who preferred fighting on foot in a highland dress to remaining with the cavalry  the highlanders poured on with the proverbial fury of their country firing their guns and discharging their arrows at a little distance from the enemy who received the assault with the most determined gallantry better provided with musketry than their enemies stationary also and therefore taking the more decisive aim the fire of argyles followers was more destructive than that which they sustained the royal clans perceiving this rushed to close quarters and succeeded on two points in throwing their enemies into disorder with regular troops this must have achieved a victory but here highlanders were opposed to highlanders and the nature of the weapons as well as the agility of those who wielded them was equal on both sides  their strife was accordingly desperate and the clash of the swords and axes as they encountered each other or rung upon the targets was mingled with the short wild animating shrieks with which highlanders accompany the battle the dance or indeed violent exertion of any kind many of the foes opposed were personally acquainted and sought to match themselves with each other from motives of hatred or a more generous emulation of valour neither party would retreat an inch while the place of those who fell and they fell fast on both sides was eagerly supplied by others who thronged to the front of danger a steam like that which arises from a seething cauldron rose into the thin cold frosty air and hovered above the combatants  so stood the fight on the right and the centre with no immediate consequence except mutual wounds and death  on the right of the campbells the knight of ardenvohr obtained some advantage through his military skill and by strength of numbers he had moved forward obliquely the extreme flank of his line at the instant the royalists were about to close so that they sustained a fire at once on front and in flank and despite the utmost efforts of their leader were thrown into some confusion at this instant sir duncan campbell gave the word to charge and thus unexpectedly made the attack at the very moment he seemed about to receive it such a change of circumstances is always discouraging and often fatal but the disorder was remedied by the advance of the irish reserve whose heavy and sustained fire compelled the knight of ardenvohr to forego his advantage and content himself with repulsing the enemy the marquis of montrose in the meanwhile availing himself of some scattered birch trees as well as of the smoke produced by the close fire of the irish musketry which concealed the operation called upon dalgetty to follow him with the horse and wheeling round so as to gain the right flank and even the rear of the enemy he commanded his six trumpets to sound the charge the clang of the cavalry trumpets and the noise of the galloping of the horse produced an effect upon argyles right wing which no other sounds could have impressed them with the mountaineers of that period had a superstitious dread of the warhorse like that entertained by the peruvians and had many strange ideas respecting the manner in which that animal was trained to combat when therefore they found their ranks unexpectedly broken and that the objects of their greatest terror were suddenly in the midst of them the panic in spite of sir duncans attempts to stop it became universal indeed the figure of major dalgetty alone sheathed in impenetrable armour and making his horse caracole and bound so as to give weight to every blow which he struck would have been a novelty in itself sufficient to terrify those who had never seen anything more nearly resembling such a cavalier than a shelty waddling under a highlander far bigger than itself the repulsed royalists returned to the charge the irish keeping their ranks maintained a fire equally close and destructive there was no sustaining the fight longer argyles followers began to break and fly most towards the lake the remainder in different directions the defeat of the right wing of itself decisive was rendered irreparable by the death of auchenbreck who fell while endeavouring to restore order  the knight of ardenvohr with two or three hundred men all gentlemen of descent and distinguished gallantryfor the campbells are supposed to have had more gentlemen in their ranks than any of the highland clans endeavoured with unavailing heroism to cover the tumultuary retreat of the common file their resolution only proved fatal to themselves as they were charged again and again by fresh adversaries and forced to separate from each other until at length their aim seemed only to be to purchase an honourable death by resisting to the very last  good quarter sir duncan called out major dalgetty when he discovered his late host with one or two others defending himself against several highlanders and to enforce his offer he rode up to him with his sword uplifted sir duncans reply was the discharge of a reserved pistol which took effect not on the person of the rider but on that of his gallant horse which shot through the heart fell dead under him ranald maceagh who was one of those who had been pressing sir duncan hard took the opportunity to cut him down with his broadsword as he turned from him in the act of firing the pistol  allan maulay came up at this moment they were excepting ranald followers of his brother who were engaged on that part of the field villains he said which of you has dared to do this when it was my positive order that the knight of ardenvohr should be taken alive  halfadozen of busy hands which were emulously employed in plundering the fallen knight whose arms and accoutrements were of a magnificence befitting his quality instantly forbore the occupation and half the number of voices exculpated themselves by laying the blame on the skyeman as they called ranald maceagh  dog of an islander said allan forgetting in his wrath their prophetic brotherhood follow the chase and harm him no farther unless you mean to die by my hand they were at this moment left almost alone for allans threats had forced his own clan from the spot and all around had pressed onwards toward the lake carrying before them noise terror and confusion and leaving behind only the dead and dying the moment was tempting to maceaghs vengeful spiritthat i should die by your hand red as it is with the blood of my kindred said he answering the threat of allan in a tone as menacing as his own is not more likely than that you should fall by mine with that he struck at maulay with such unexpected readiness that he had scarce time to intercept the blow with his target  villain said allan in astonishment what means this  i am ranald of the mist answered the islesman repeating the blow and with that word they engaged in close and furious conflict it seemed to be decreed that in allan maulay had arisen the avenger of his mothers wrongs upon this wild tribe as was proved by the issue of the present as well as of former combats after exchanging a few blows ranald maceagh was prostrated by a deep wound on the skull and maulay setting his foot on him was about to pass the broadsword through his body when the point of the weapon was struck up by a third party who suddenly interposed this was no other than major dalgetty who stunned by the fall and encumbered by the dead body of his horse had now recovered his legs and his understanding hold up your sword said he to maulay and prejudice this person no farther in respect that he is here in my safeconduct and in his excellencys service and in regard that no honourable cavalier is at liberty by the law martial to avenge his own private injuries flagrante bello multo majus flagrante praelio  fool said allan stand aside and dare not to come between the tiger and his prey  but far from quitting his point dalgetty stept across the fallen body of maceagh and gave allan to understand that if he called himself a tiger he was likely at present to find a lion in his path there required no more than the gesture and tone of defiance to turn the whole rage of the military seer against the person who was opposing the course of his vengeance and blows were instantly exchanged without farther ceremony  the strife betwixt allan and maceagh had been unnoticed by the stragglers around for the person of the latter was known to few of montroses followers but the scuffle betwixt dalgetty and him both so well known attracted instant attention and fortunately among others that of montrose himself who had come for the purpose of gathering together his small body of horse and following the pursuit down locheil aware of the fatal consequences of dissension in his little army he pushed his horse up to the spot and seeing maceagh on the ground and dalgetty in the attitude of protecting him against maulay his quick apprehension instantly caught the cause of quarrel and as instantly devised means to stop it for shame he said gentlemen cavaliers brawling together in so glorious a field of victoryare you mad or are you intoxicated with the glory which you have both this day gained  it is not my fault so please your excellency said dalgetty i have been known a bonus socius a bon camarado in all the services of europe but he that touches a man under my safeguard  and he said allan speaking at the same time who dares to bar the course of my just vengeance  for shame gentlemen again repeated montrose i have other business for you bothbusiness of deeper importance than any private quarrel which you may easily find a more fitting time to settle for you major dalgetty kneel down  kneel said dalgetty i have not learned to obey that word of command saving when it is given from the pulpit in the swedish discipline the front rank do indeed kneel but only when the regiment is drawn up six file deep  nevertheless repeated montrosekneel down in the name of king charles and of his representative  when dalgetty reluctantly obeyed montrose struck him lightly on the neck with the flat of his sword sayingin reward of the gallant service of this day and in the name and authority of our sovereign king charles i dub thee knight be brave loyal and fortunate and now sir dugald dalgetty to your duty collect what horsemen you can and pursue such of the enemy as are flying down the side of the lake do not disperse your force nor venture too far but take heed to prevent their rallying which very little exertion may do mount then sir dugald and do your duty  but what shall i mount said the newmade chevalier poor gustavus sleeps in the bed of honour like his immortal namesake and i am made a knight a rider as the high dutch have it just when i have not a horse left to ride upon in german as in latin the original meaning of the word ritter corresponding to eques is merely a horseman  that shall not be said answered montrose dismounting i make you a present of my own which has been thought a good one only i pray you resume the duty you discharge so well  with many acknowledgments sir dugald mounted the steed so liberally bestowed upon him and only beseeching his excellency to remember that maceagh was under his safeconduct immediately began to execute the orders assigned to him with great zeal and alacrity  and you allan maulay said montrose addressing the highlander who leaning his swordpoint on the ground had regarded the ceremony of his antagonists knighthood with a sneer of sullen scornyou who are superior to the ordinary men led by the paltry motives of plunder and pay and personal distinctionyou whose deep knowledge renders you so valuable a counselloris it you whom i find striving with a man like dalgetty for the privilege of trampling the remains of life out of so contemptible an enemy as lies there come my friend i have other work for you this victory skilfully improved shall win seaforth to our party it is not disloyalty but despair of the good cause that has induced him to take arms against us these arms in this moment of better augury he may be brought to unite with ours i shall send my gallant friend colonel hay to him from this very field of battle but he must be united in commission with a highland gentleman of rank befitting that of seaforth and of talents and of influence such as may make an impression upon him you are not only in every respect the fittest for this most important mission but having no immediate command your presence may be more easily spared than that of a chief whose following is in the field you know every pass and glen in the highlands as well as the manners and customs of every tribe go therefore to hay on the right wing he has instructions and expects you you will find him with glenmorrisons men be his guide his interpreter and his colleague  allan maulay bent on the marquis a dark and penetrating glance as if to ascertain whether this sudden mission was not conferred for some latent and unexplained purpose but montrose skilful in searching the motives of others was an equal adept in concealing his own he considered it as of the last consequence in this moment of enthusiasm and exalted passion to remove allan from the camp for a few days that he might provide as his honour required for the safety of those who had acted as his guides when he trusted the seers quarrel with dalgetty might be easily made up allan at parting only recommended to the marquis the care of sir duncan campbell whom montrose instantly directed to be conveyed to a place of safety he took the same precaution for maceagh committing the latter however to a party of the irish with directions that he should be taken care of but that no highlander of any clan should have access to him  the marquis then mounted a led horse which was held by one of his attendants and rode on to view the scene of his victory which was more decisive than even his ardent hopes had anticipated of argyles gallant army of three thousand men fully onehalf fell in the battle or in the flight they had been chiefly driven back upon that part of the plain where the river forms an angle with the lake so that there was no free opening either for retreat or escape several hundreds were forced into the lake and drowned of the survivors about onehalf escaped by swimming the river or by an early flight along the left bank of the lake the remainder threw themselves into the old castle of inverlochy but being without either provisions or hopes of relief they were obliged to surrender on condition of being suffered to return to their homes in peace arms ammunition standards and baggage all became the prey of the conquerors  this was the greatest disaster that ever befell the race of diarmid as the campbells were called in the highlands it being generally remarked that they were as fortunate in the issue of their undertakings as they were sagacious in planning and courageous in executing them of the number slain nearly five hundred were dunniwassels or gentlemen claiming descent from known and respected houses and in the opinion of many of the clan even this heavy loss was exceeded by the disgrace arising from the inglorious conduct of their chief whose galley weighed anchor when the day was lost and sailed down the lake with all the speed to which sails and oars could impel her    chapter xx       faint the din of battle brayd      distant down the hollow wind      war and terror fled before      wounds and death remaind behindpenrose  montroses splendid success over his powerful rival was not attained without some loss though not amounting to the tenth of what he inflicted the obstinate valour of the campbells cost the lives of many brave men of the opposite party and more were wounded the chief of whom was the brave young earl of menteith who had commanded the centre he was but slightly touched however and made rather a graceful than a terrible appearance when he presented to his general the standard of argyle which he had taken from the standardbearer with his own hand and slain him in single combat montrose dearly loved his noble kinsman in whom there was conspicuous a flash of the generous romantic disinterested chivalry of the old heroic times entirely different from the sordid calculating and selfish character which the practice of entertaining mercenary troops had introduced into most parts of europe and of which degeneracy scotland which furnished soldiers of fortune for the service of almost every nation had been contaminated with a more than usual share montrose whose native spirit was congenial although experience had taught him how to avail himself of the motives of others used to menteith neither the language of praise nor of promise but clasped him to his bosom as he exclaimed my gallant kinsman and by this burst of heartfelt applause was menteith thrilled with a warmer glow of delight than if his praises had been recorded in a report of the action sent directly to the throne of his sovereign  nothing he said my lord now seems to remain in which i can render any assistance permit me to look after a duty of humanitythe knight of ardenvohr as i am told is our prisoner and severely wounded  and well he deserves to be so said sir dugald dalgetty who came up to them at that moment with a prodigious addition of acquired importance since he shot my good horse at the time that i was offering him honourable quarter which i must needs say was done more like an ignorant highland cateran who has not sense enough to erect a sconce for the protection of his old hurleyhouse of a castle than like a soldier of worth and quality  are we to condole with you then said lord menteith upon the loss of the famed gustavus  even so my lord answered the soldier with a deep sigh diem clausit supremum as we said at the mareschalcollege of aberdeen better so than be smothered like a cadgers pony in some flowmoss or snowwreath which was like to be his fate if this winter campaign lasted longer but it has pleased his excellency making an inclination to montrose to supply his place by the gift of a noble steed whom i have taken the freedom to name loyaltys reward in memory of this celebrated occasion  i hope said the marquis youll find loyaltys reward since you call him so practised in all the duties of the fieldbut i must just hint to you that at this time in scotland loyalty is more frequently rewarded with a halter than with a horse  ahem your excellency is pleased to be facetious loyaltys reward is as perfect as gustavus in all his exercises and of a far finer figure marry his social qualities are less cultivated in respect he has kept till now inferior company  not meaning his excellency the general i hope said lord menteith for shame sir dugald  my lord answered the knight gravely i am incapable to mean anything so utterly unbecoming what i asseverate is that his excellency having the same intercourse with his horse during his exercise that he hath with his soldiers when training them may form and break either to every feat of war which he chooses to practise and accordingly that this noble charger is admirably managed but as it is the intercourse of private life that formeth the social character so i do not apprehend that of the single soldier to be much polished by the conversation of the corporal or the sergeant or that of loyaltys reward to have been much dulcified or ameliorated by the society of his excellencys grooms who bestow more oaths and kicks and thumps than kindness or caresses upon the animals intrusted to their charge whereby many a generous quadruped rendered as it were misanthropic manifests during the rest of his life a greater desire to kick and bite his master than to love and to honour him  spoken like an oracle said montrose were there an academy for the education of horses to be annexed to the mareschalcollege of aberdeen sir dugald dalgetty alone should fill the chair  because being an ass said menteith aside to the general there would be some distant relation between the professor and the students  and now with your excellencys permission said the newmade knight i am going to pay my last visit to the remains of my old companion in arms  not with the purpose of going through the ceremonial of interment said the marquis who did not know how far sir dugalds enthusiasm might lead him consider our brave fellows themselves will have but a hasty burial  your excellency will pardon me said dalgetty my purpose is less romantic i go to divide poor gustavuss legacy with the fowls of heaven leaving the flesh to them and reserving to myself his hide which in token of affectionate remembrance i purpose to form into a cassock and trowsers after the tartar fashion to be worn under my armour in respect my nether garments are at present shamefully the worse of the wearalas poor gustavus why didst thou not live at least one hour more to have borne the honoured weight of knighthood upon thy loins  he was now turning away when the marquis called after himas you are not likely to be anticipated in this act of kindness sir dugald to your old friend and companion i trust said the marquis you will first assist me and our principal friends to discuss some of argyles good cheer of which we have found abundance in the castle  most willingly please your excellency said sir dugald as meat and mass never hinder work nor indeed am i afraid that the wolves or eagles will begin an onslaught on gustavus tonight in regard there is so much better cheer lying all around but added he as i am to meet two honourable knights of england with others of the knightly degree in your lordships army i pray it may be explained to them that now and in future i claim precedence over them all in respect of my rank as a banneret dubbed in a field of stricken battle  the devil confound him said montrose speaking aside he has contrived to set the kiln on fire as fast as i put it outthis is a point sir dugald said he gravely addressing him which i shall reserve for his majestys express consideration in my camp all must be upon equality like the knights of the round table and take their places as soldiers should upon the principle offirst come first served  then i shall take care said menteith apart to the marquis that don dugald is not first in place todaysir dugald added he raising his voice as you say your wardrobe is out of repair had you not better go to the enemys baggage yonder over which there is a guard placed i saw them take out an excellent buff suit embroidered in front in silk and silver  voto a dios as the spaniard says exclaimed the major and some beggarly gilly may get it while i stand prating here  the prospect of booty having at once driven out of his head both gustavus and the provant he set spurs to loyaltys reward and rode off through the field of battle  there goes the hound said menteith breaking the face and trampling on the body of many a better man than himself and as eager on his sordid spoil as a vulture that stoops upon carrion yet this man the world calls a soldierand you my lord select him as worthy of the honours of chivalry if such they can at this day be termed you have made the collar of knighthood the decoration of a mere bloodhound  what could i do said montrose i had no halfpicked bones to give him and bribed in some manner he must bei cannot follow the chase alone besides the dog has good qualities  if nature has given him such said menteith habit has converted them into feelings of intense selfishness he may be punctilious concerning his reputation and brave in the execution of his duty but it is only because without these qualities he cannot rise in the servicenay his very benevolence is selfish he may defend his companion while he can keep his feet but the instant he is down sir dugald will be as ready to ease him of his purse as he is to convert the skin of gustavus into a buff jerkin  and yet if all this were true cousin answered montrose there is something convenient in commanding a soldier upon whose motives and springs of action you can calculate to a mathematical certainty a fine spirit like yours my cousin alive to a thousand sensations to which this mans is as impervious as his corsletit is for such that thy friend must feel while he gives his advice then suddenly changing his tone he asked menteith when he had seen annot lyle  the young earl coloured deeply and answered not since last eveningexcepting he added with hesitation for one moment about half an hour before the battle began  my dear menteith said montrose very kindly were you one of the gay cavaliers of whitehall who are in their way as great selfseekers as our friend dalgetty should i need to plague you with enquiring into such an amourette as this it would be an intrigue only to be laughed at but this is the land of enchantment where nets strong as steel are wrought out of ladies tresses and you are exactly the destined knight to be so fettered this poor girl is exquisitely beautiful and has talents formed to captivate your romantic temper you cannot think of injuring heryou cannot think of marrying her  my lord replied menteith you have repeatedly urged this jest for so i trust it is meant somewhat beyond bounds annot lyle is of unknown birtha captivethe daughter probably of some obscure outlaw a dependant on the hospitality of the maulays  do not be angry menteith said the marquis interrupting him you love the classics though not educated at mareschalcollege and you may remember how many gallant hearts captive beauty has subdued       movit ajacem telamone natum      forma captivae dominum tecmessae  in a word i am seriously anxious about thisi should not have time perhaps he added very gravely to trouble you with my lectures on the subject were your feelings and those of annot alone interested but you have a dangerous rival in allan maulay and there is no knowing to what extent he may carry his resentment it is my duty to tell you that the kings service may be much prejudiced by dissensions betwixt you  my lord said menteith i know what you mean is kind and friendly i hope you will be satisfied when i assure you that allan maulay and i have discussed this circumstance and that i have explained to him that it is utterly remote from my character to entertain dishonourable views concerning this unprotected female so on the other hand the obscurity of her birth prevents my thinking of her upon other terms i will not disguise from your lordship what i have not disguised from maulaythat if annot lyle were born a lady she should share my name and rank as matters stand it is impossible this explanation i trust will satisfy your lordship as it has satisfied a less reasonable person  montrose shrugged his shoulders and like true champions in romance he said you have agreed that you are both to worship the same mistress as idolaters do the same image and that neither shall extend his pretensions farther  i did not go so far my lord answered menteithi only said in the present circumstancesand there is no prospect of their being changedi could in duty to myself and family stand in no relation to annot lyle but as that of friend or brotherbut your lordship must excuse me i have said he looking at his arm round which he had tied his handkerchief a slight hurt to attend to  a wound said montrose anxiously let me see italas he said i should have heard nothing of this had i not ventured to tent and sound another more secret and more rankling one menteith i am sorry for youi too have knownbut what avails it to awake sorrows which have long slumbered  so saying he shook hands with his noble kinsman and walked into the castle  annot lyle as was not unusual for females in the highlands was possessed of a slight degree of medical and even surgical skill it may readily be believed that the profession of surgery or medicine as a separate art was unknown and the few rude rules which they observed were intrusted to women or to the aged whom constant casualties afforded too much opportunity of acquiring experience the care and attention accordingly of annot lyle her attendants and others acting under her direction had made her services extremely useful during this wild campaign and most readily had these services been rendered to friend and foe wherever they could be most useful she was now in an apartment of the castle anxiously superintending the preparation of vulnerary herbs to be applied to the wounded receiving reports from different females respecting those under their separate charge and distributing what means she had for their relief when allan maulay suddenly entered the apartment she started for she had heard that he had left the camp upon a distant mission and however accustomed she was to the gloom of his countenance it seemed at present to have even a darker shade than usual he stood before her perfectly silent and she felt the necessity of being the first to speak  i thought she said with some effort you had already set out  my companion awaits me said allan i go instantly yet still he stood before her and held her by the arm with a pressure which though insufficient to give her pain made her sensible of his great personal strength his hand closing on her like the gripe of a manacle  shall i take the harp she said in a timid voice isis the shadow falling upon you  instead of replying he led her to the window of the apartment which commanded a view of the field of the slain with all its horrors it was thick spread with dead and wounded and the spoilers were busy tearing the clothes from the victims of war and feudal ambition with as much indifference as if they had not been of the same species and themselves exposed perhaps tomorrow to the same fate  does the sight please you said maulay  it is hideous said annot covering her eyes with her hands how can you bid me look upon it  you must be inured to it said he if you remain with this destined hostyou will soon have to search such a field for my brothers corpsefor menteithsfor minebut that will be a more indifferent taskyou do not love me  this is the first time you have taxed me with unkindness said annot weeping you are my brothermy preservermy protectorand can i then but love youbut your hour of darkness is approaching let me fetch my harp  remain said allan still holding her fast be my visions from heaven or hell or from the middle sphere of disembodied spiritsor be they as the saxons hold but the delusions of an overheated fancy they do not now influence me i speak the language of the natural of the visible worldyou love not me annotyou love menteithby him you are beloved again and allan is no more to you than one of the corpses which encumber yonder heath  it cannot be supposed that this strange speech conveyed any new information to her who was thus addressed no woman ever lived who could not in the same circumstances have discerned long since the state of her lovers mind but by thus suddenly tearing off the veil thin as it was allan prepared her to expect consequences violent in proportion to the enthusiasm of his character she made an effort to repel the charge he had stated  you forget she said your own worth and nobleness when you insult so very helpless a being and one whom fate has thrown so totally into your power you know who and what i am and how impossible it is that menteith or you can use language of affection to me beyond that of friendship you know from what unhappy race i have too probably derived my existence  i will not believe it said allan impetuously never flowed crystal drop from a polluted spring  yet the very doubt pleaded annot should make you forbear to use this language to me  i know said maulay it places a bar between usbut i know also that it divides you not so inseparably from menteithhear me my beloved annotleave this scene of terrors and dangergo with me to kintaili will place you in the house of the noble lady of seaforthor you shall be removed in safety to icolmkill where some women yet devote themselves to the worship of god after the custom of our ancestors  you consider not what you ask of me replied annot to undertake such a journey under your sole guardianship were to show me less scrupulous than maiden ought i will remain here allanhere under the protection of the noble montrose and when his motions next approach the lowlands i will contrive some proper means to relieve you of one who has she knows not how become an object of dislike to you  allan stood as if uncertain whether to give way to sympathy with her distress or to anger at her resistance  annot he said you know too well how little your words apply to my feelings towards youbut you avail yourself of your power and you rejoice in my departure as removing a spy upon your intercourse with menteith but beware both of you he added in a stern tone for when was it ever heard that an injury was offered to allan maulay for which he exacted not tenfold vengeance  so saying he pressed her arm forcibly pulled the bonnet over his brows and strode out of the apartment    chapter xxi       after youre gone      i grew acquainted with my heart and searchd      what stirrd it soalas  i found it love      yet far from lust for could i but have lived      in presence of you i had had my endphilaster  annot lyle had now to contemplate the terrible gulf which allan maulays declaration of love and jealousy had made to open around her it seemed as if she was tottering on the very brink of destruction and was at once deprived of every refuge and of all human assistance she had long been conscious that she loved menteith dearer than a brother indeed how could it be otherwise considering their early intimacy the personal merit of the young nobleman his assiduous attentionsand his infinite superiority in gentleness of disposition and grace of manners over the race of rude warriors with whom she lived but her affection was of that quiet timid meditative character which sought rather a reflected share in the happiness of the beloved object than formed more presumptuous or daring hopes a little gaelic song in which she expressed her feelings has been translated by the ingenious and unhappy andrew mdonald and we willingly transcribe the lines       wert thou like me in lifes low vale      with thee how blest that lot id share      with thee id fly wherever gale      could waft or bounding galley bear      but parted by severe decree      far different must our fortunes prove      may thine be joyenough for me      to weep and pray for him i love       the pangs this foolish heart must feel      when hope shall be forever flown      no sullen murmur shall reveal      no selfish murmurs ever own      nor will i through lifes weary years      like a pale drooping mourner move      while i can think my secret tears      may wound the heart of him i love  the furious declaration of allan had destroyed the romantic plan which she had formed of nursing in secret her pensive tenderness without seeking any other requital long before this she had dreaded allan as much as gratitude and a sense that he softened towards her a temper so haughty and so violent could permit her to do but now she regarded him with unalloyed terror which a perfect knowledge of his disposition and of his preceding history too well authorised her to entertain whatever was in other respects the nobleness of his disposition he had never been known to resist the wilfulness of passionhe walked in the house and in the country of his fathers like a tamed lion whom no one dared to contradict lest they should awaken his natural vehemence of passion so many years had elapsed since he had experienced contradiction or even expostulation that probably nothing but the strong good sense which on all points his mysticism excepted formed the ground of his character prevented his proving an annoyance and terror to the whole neighbourhood but annot had no time to dwell upon her fears being interrupted by the entrance of sir dugald dalgetty  it may well be supposed that the scenes in which this person had passed his former life had not much qualified him to shine in female society he himself felt a sort of consciousness that the language of the barrack guardroom and parade was not proper to entertain ladies the only peaceful part of his life had been spent at mareschalcollege aberdeen and he had forgot the little he had learned there except the arts of darning his own hose and dispatching his commons with unusual celerity both which had since been kept in good exercise by the necessity of frequent practice still it was from an imperfect recollection of what he had acquired during this pacific period that he drew his sources of conversation when in company with women in other words his language became pedantic when it ceased to be military  mistress annot lyle said he upon the present occasion i am just now like the halfpike or spontoon of achilles one end of which could wound and the other curea property belonging neither to spanish pike brownbill partizan halberd lochaberaxe or indeed any other modern staffweapon whatever this compliment he repeated twice but as annot scarce heard him the first time and did not comprehend him the second he was obliged to explain  i mean he said mistress annot lyle that having been the means of an honourable knight receiving a severe wound in this days conflicthe having pistolled somewhat against the law of arms my horse which was named after the immortal king of swedeni am desirous of procuring him such solacement as you madam can supply you being like the heathen god esculapius meaning possibly apollo skilful not only in song and in music but in the more noble art of chirurgeryopiferque per orbem dicor  if you would have the goodness to explain said annot too sick at heart to be amused by sir dugalds airs of pedantic gallantry  that madam replied the knight may not be so easy as i am out of the habit of construingbut we shall try dicor supply egoi am calledopifer opiferi remember signifer and furciferbut i believe opifer stands in this place for md that is doctor of physic  this is a busy day with us all said annot will you say at once what you want with me  merely replied sir dugald that you will visit my brother knight and let your maiden bring some medicaments for his wound which threatens to be what the learned call a damnum fatale  annot lyle never lingered in the cause of humanity she informed herself hastily of the nature of the injury and interesting herself for the dignified old chief whom she had seen at darnlinvarach and whose presence had so much struck her she hastened to lose the sense of her own sorrow for a time in the attempt to be useful to another  sir dugald with great form ushered annot lyle to the chamber of her patient in which to her surprise she found lord menteith she could not help blushing deeply at the meeting but to hide her confusion proceeded instantly to examine the wound of the knight of ardenvohr and easily satisfied herself that it was beyond her skill to cure it as for sir dugald he returned to a large outhouse on the floor of which among other wounded men was deposited the person of ranald of the mist  mine old friend said the knight as i told you before i would willingly do anything to pleasure you in return for the wound you have received while under my safeconduct i have therefore according to your earnest request sent mrs annot lyle to attend upon the wound of the knight of ardenvohr though wherein her doing so should benefit you i cannot imaginei think you once spoke of some blood relationship between them but a soldado in command and charge like me has other things to trouble his head with than highland genealogies  and indeed to do the worthy major justice he never enquired after listened to or recollected the business of other people unless it either related to the art military or was somehow or other connected with his own interest in either of which cases his memory was very tenacious  and now my good friend of the mist said he can you tell me what has become of your hopeful grandson as i have not seen him since he assisted me to disarm after the action a negligence which deserveth the strapado  he is not far from hence said the wounded outlawlift not your hand upon him for he is man enough to pay a yard of leathern scourge with a foot of tempered steel  a most improper vaunt said sir dugald but i owe you some favours ranald and therefore shall let it pass  and if you think you owe me anything said the outlaw it is in your power to requite me by granting me a boon  friend ranald answered dalgetty i have read of these boons in silly storybooks whereby simple knights were drawn into engagements to their great prejudice wherefore ranald the more prudent knights of this day never promise anything until they know that they may keep their word anent the premises without any displeasure or incommodement to themselves it may be you would have me engage the female chirurgeon to visit your wound though you ought to consider ranald that the uncleanness of the place where you are deposited may somewhat soil the gaiety of her garments concerning the preservation of which you may have observed women are apt to be inordinately solicitous i lost the favour of the lady of the grand pensionary of amsterdam by touching with the sole of my boot the train of her black velvet gown which i mistook for a footcloth it being half the room distant from her person  it is not to bring annot lyle hither answered maceagh but to transport me into the room where she is in attendance upon the knight of ardenvohr somewhat i have to say of the last consequence to them both  it is something out of the order of due precedence said dalgetty to carry a wounded outlaw into the presence of a knight knighthood having been of yore and being in some respects still the highest military grade independent always of commissioned officers who rank according to their patents nevertheless as your boon as you call it is so slight i shall not deny compliance with the same so saying he ordered three files of men to transport maceagh on their shoulders to sir duncan campbells apartment and he himself hastened before to announce the cause of his being brought thither but such was the activity of the soldiers employed that they followed him close at the heels and entering with their ghastly burden laid maceagh on the floor of the apartment his features naturally wild were now distorted by pain his hands and scanty garments stained with his own blood and those of others which no kind hand had wiped away although the wound in his side had been secured by a bandage  are you he said raising his head painfully towards the couch where lay stretched his late antagonist he whom men call the knight of ardenvohr  the same answered sir duncanwhat would you with one whose hours are now numbered  my hours are reduced to minutes said the outlaw the more grace if i bestow them in the service of one whose hand has ever been against me as mine has been raised higher against him  thine higher against mecrushed worm said the knight looking down on his miserable adversary  yes answered the outlaw in a firm voice my arm hath been highest in the deadly contest betwixt us the wounds i have dealt have been deepest though thine have neither been idle nor unfelti am ranald maceaghi am ranald of the mistthe night that i gave thy castle to the winds in one huge blaze of fire is now matched with the day in which you have fallen under the sword of my fathersremember the injuries thou hast done our tribenever were such inflicted save by one beside thee he they say is fated and secure against our vengeancea short time will show  my lord menteith said sir duncan raising himself out of his bed this is a proclaimed villain at once the enemy of king and parliament of god and manone of the outlawed banditti of the mist alike the enemy of your house of the maulays and of mine i trust you will not suffer moments which are perhaps my last to be embittered by his barbarous triumph  he shall have the treatment he merits said menteith let him be instantly removed  sir dugald here interposed and spoke of ranalds services as a guide and his own pledge for his safety but the high harsh tones of the outlaw drowned his voice  no said he be rack and gibbet the word let me wither between heaven and earth and gorge the hawks and eagles of bennevis and so shall this haughty knight and this triumphant thane never learn the secret i alone can impart a secret which would make ardenvohrs heart leap with joy were he in the death agony and which the earl of menteith would purchase at the price of his broad earldomcome hither annot lyle he said raising himself with unexpected strength fear not the sight of him to whom thou hast clung in infancy tell these proud men who disdain thee as the issue of mine ancient race that thou art no blood of oursno daughter of the race of the mist but born in halls as lordly and cradled on couch as soft as ever soothed infancy in their proudest palaces  in the name of god said menteith trembling with emotion if you know aught of the birth of this lady do thy conscience the justice to disburden it of the secret before departing from this world  and bless my enemies with my dying breath said maceagh looking at him malignantlysuch are the maxims your priests preachbut when or towards whom do you practise them let me know first the worth of my secret ere i part with itwhat would you give knight of ardenvohr to know that your superstitious fasts have been vain and that there still remains a descendant of your housei pause for an answerwithout it i speak not one word more  i could said sir duncan his voice struggling between the emotions of doubt hatred and anxietyi couldbut that i know thy race are like the great enemy liars and murderers from the beginningbut could it be true thou tellest me i could almost forgive thee the injuries thou hast done me  hear it said ranald he hath wagered deeply for a son of diarmidand you gentle thanethe report of the camp says that you would purchase with life and lands the tidings that annot lyle was no daughter of proscription but of a race noble in your estimation as your ownwellit is for no love i tell youthe time has been that i would have exchanged this secret against liberty i am now bartering it for what is dearer than liberty or lifeannot lyle is the youngest the sole surviving child of the knight of ardenvohr who alone was saved when all in his halls besides was given to blood and ashes  can this man speak truth said annot lyle scarce knowing what she said or is this some strange delusion  maiden replied ranald hadst thou dwelt longer with us thou wouldst have better learnt to know how to distinguish the accents of truth to that saxon lord and to the knight of ardenvohr i will yield such proofs of what i have spoken that incredulity shall stand convinced meantime withdrawi loved thine infancy i hate not thy youthno eye hates the rose in its blossom though it groweth upon a thorn and for thee only do i something regret what is soon to follow but he that would avenge him of his foe must not reck though the guiltless be engaged in the ruin  he advises well annot said lord menteith in gods name retire ifif there be aught in this your meeting with sir duncan must be more prepared for both your sakes  i will not part from my father if i have found one said annoti will not part from him under circumstances so terrible  and a father you shall ever find in me murmured sir duncan  then said menteith i will have maceagh removed into an adjacent apartment and will collect the evidence of his tale myself sir dugald dalgetty will give me his attendance and assistance  with pleasure my lord answered sir dugaldi will be your confessor or assessoreither or both no one can be so fit for i had heard the whole story a month ago at inverary castlebut onslaughts like that of ardenvohr confuse each other in my memory which is besides occupied with matters of more importance  upon hearing this frank declaration which was made as they left the apartment with the wounded man lord menteith darted upon dalgetty a look of extreme anger and disdain to which the selfconceit of the worthy commander rendered him totally insensible    chapter xxii       i am as free as nature first made man      ere the base laws of servitude began      when wild in woods the noble savage ran      conquest of granada  the earl of menteith as he had undertaken so he proceeded to investigate more closely the story told by ranald of the mist which was corroborated by the examination of his two followers who had assisted in the capacity of guides these declarations he carefully compared with such circumstances concerning the destruction of his castle and family as sir duncan campbell was able to supply and it may be supposed he had forgotten nothing relating to an event of such terrific importance it was of the last consequence to prove that this was no invention of the outlaws for the purpose of passing an impostor as the child and heiress of ardenvohr  perhaps menteith so much interested in believing the tale was not altogether the fittest person to be intrusted with the investigation of its truth but the examinations of the children of the mist were simple accurate and in all respects consistent with each other a personal mark was referred to which was known to have been borne by the infant child of sir duncan and which appeared upon the left shoulder of annot lyle it was also well remembered that when the miserable relics of the other children had been collected those of the infant had nowhere been found other circumstances of evidence which it is unnecessary to quote brought the fullest conviction not only to menteith but to the unprejudiced mind of montrose that in annot lyle an humble dependant distinguished only by beauty and talent they were in future to respect the heiress of ardenvohr  while menteith hastened to communicate the result of these enquiries to the persons most interested the outlaw demanded to speak with his grandchild whom he usually called his son he would be found he said in the outer apartment in which he himself had been originally deposited  accordingly the young savage after a close search was found lurking in a corner coiled up among some rotten straw and brought to his grandsire  kenneth said the old outlaw hear the last words of the sire of thy father a saxon soldier and allan of the redhand left this camp within these few hours to travel to the country to caberfae pursue them as the bloodhound pursues the hurt deerswim the lakeclimb the mountainthread the foresttarry not until you join them and then the countenance of the lad darkened as his grandfather spoke and he laid his hand upon a knife which stuck in the thong of leather that confined his scanty plaid no said the old man it is not by thy hand he must fall they will ask the news from the campsay to them that annot lyle of the harp is discovered to be the daughter of duncan of ardenvohr that the thane of menteith is to wed her before the priest and that you are sent to bid guests to the bridal

forefathers ere infirmity disease or age shall break thy spiritbegonebegonelive freerequite kindnessavenge the injuries of thy race  the young savage stooped and kissed the brow of his dying parent but accustomed from infancy to suppress every exterior sign of emotion he parted without tear or adieu and was soon far beyond the limits of montroses camp  sir dugald dalgetty who was present during the latter part of this scene was very little edified by the conduct of maceagh upon the occasion i cannot think my friend ranald said he that you are in the best possible road for a dying man storms onslaughts massacres the burning of suburbs are indeed a soldiers daily work and are justified by the necessity of the case seeing that they are done in the course of duty for burning of suburbs in particular it may be said that they are traitors and cutthroats to all fortified towns hence it is plain that a soldier is a profession peculiarly favoured by heaven seeing that we may hope for salvation although we daily commit actions of so great violence but then ranald in all services of europe it is the custom of the dying soldier not to vaunt him of such doings or to recommend them to his fellows but on the contrary to express contrition for the same and to repeat or have repeated to him some comfortable prayer which if you please i will intercede with his excellencys chaplain to prefer on your account it is otherwise no point of my duty to put you in mind of those things only it may be for the ease of your conscience to depart more like a christian and less like a turk than you seem to be in a fair way of doing  the only answer of the dying manfor as such ranald maceagh might now be consideredwas a request to be raised to such a position that he might obtain a view from the window of the castle the deep frost mist which had long settled upon the top of the mountains was now rolling down each rugged glen and gully where the craggy ridges showed their black and irregular outline like desert islands rising above the ocean of vapour spirit of the mist said ranald maceagh called by our race our father and our preserverreceive into thy tabernacle of clouds when this pang is over him whom in life thou hast so often sheltered so saying he sunk back into the arms of those who upheld him spoke no further word but turned his face to the wall for a short space  i believe said dalgetty my friend ranald will be found in his heart to be little better than a heathen and he renewed his proposal to procure him the assistance of dr wisheart montroses military chaplain a man said sir dugald very clever in his exercise and who will do execution on your sins in less time than i could smoke a pipe of tobacco  saxon said the dying man speak to me no more of thy priesti die contented hadst thou ever an enemy against whom weapons were of no availwhom the ball missed and against whom the arrow shivered and whose bare skin was as impenetrable to sword and dirk as thy steel garmentheardst thou ever of such a foe  very frequently when i served in germany replied sir dugald there was such a fellow at ingolstadt he was proof both against lead and steel the soldiers killed him with the buts of their muskets  this impassible foe said ranald without regarding the majors interruption who has the blood dearest to me upon his handsto this man i have now bequeathed agony of mind jealousy despair and sudden deathor a life more miserable than death itself such shall be the lot of allan of the redhand when he learns that annot weds menteith and i ask no more than the certainty that it is so to sweeten my own bloody end by his hand  if that be the case said the major theres no more to be said but i shall take care as few people see you as possible for i cannot think your mode of departure can be at all creditable or exemplary to a christian army so saying he left the apartment and the son of the mist soon after breathed his last  menteith in the meanwhile leaving the newfound relations to their mutual feelings of mingled emotion was eagerly discussing with montrose the consequences of this discovery i should now see said the marquis even had i not before observed it that your interest in this discovery my dear menteith has no small reference to your own happiness you love this newfound ladyyour affection is returned in point of birth no exceptions can be made in every other respect her advantages are equal to those which you yourself possessthink however a moment sir duncan is a fanaticpresbyterian at leastin arms against the king he is only with us in the quality of a prisoner and we are i fear but at the commencement of a long civil war is this a time think you menteith for you to make proposals for his heiress or what chance is there that he will now listen to it  passion an ingenious as well as an eloquent advocate supplied the young nobleman with a thousand answers to these objections he reminded montrose that the knight of ardenvohr was neither a bigot in politics nor religion he urged his own known and proved zeal for the royal cause and hinted that its influence might be extended and strengthened by his wedding the heiress of ardenvohr he pleaded the dangerous state of sir duncans wound the risk which must be run by suffering the young lady to be carried into the country of the campbells where in case of her fathers death or continued indisposition she must necessarily be placed under the guardianship of argyle an event fatal to his menteiths hopes unless he could stoop to purchase his favour by abandoning the kings party  montrose allowed the force of these arguments and owned although the matter was attended with difficulty yet it seemed consistent with the kings service that it should be concluded as speedily as possible  i could wish said he that it were all settled in one way or another and that this fair briseis were removed from our camp before the return of our highland achilles allan maulayi fear some fatal feud in that quarter menteithand i believe it would be best that sir duncan be dismissed on his parole and that you accompany him and his daughter as his escort the journey can be made chiefly by water so will not greatly incommode his woundand your own my friend will be an honourable excuse for the absence of some time from my camp  never said menteith were i to forfeit the very hope that has so lately dawned upon me never will i leave your excellencys camp while the royal standard is displayed i should deserve that this trifling scratch should gangrene and consume my swordarm were i capable of holding it as an excuse for absence at this crisis of the kings affairs  on this then you are determined said montrose  as fixed as bennevis said the young nobleman  you must then said montrose lose no time in seeking an explanation with the knight of ardenvohr if this prove favourable i will talk myself with the elder maulay and we will devise means to employ his brother at a distance from the army until he shall be reconciled to his present disappointment would to god some vision would descend upon his imagination fair enough to obliterate all traces of annot lyle that perhaps you think impossible menteithwell each to his service you to that of cupid and i to that of mars  they parted and in pursuance of the scheme arranged menteith early on the ensuing morning sought a private interview with the wounded knight of ardenvohr and communicated to him his suit for the hand of his daughter of their mutual attachment sir duncan was aware but he was not prepared for so early a declaration on the part of menteith he said at first that he had already perhaps indulged too much in feelings of personal happiness at a time when his clan had sustained so great a loss and humiliation and that he was unwilling therefore farther to consider the advancement of his own house at a period so calamitous on the more urgent suit of the noble lover he requested a few hours to deliberate and consult with his daughter upon a question so highly important  the result of this interview and deliberation was favourable to menteith sir duncan campbell became fully sensible that the happiness of his newfound daughter depended upon a union with her lover and unless such were now formed he saw that argyle would throw a thousand obstacles in the way of a match in every respect acceptable to himself menteiths private character was so excellent and such was the rank and consideration due to his fortune and family that they outbalanced in sir duncans opinion the difference in their political opinions nor could he have resolved perhaps had his own opinion of the match been less favourable to decline an opportunity of indulging the newfound child of his hopes there was besides a feeling of pride which dictated his determination to produce the heiress of ardenvohr to the world as one who had been educated a poor dependant and musician in the family of darnlinvarach had something in it that was humiliating to introduce her as the betrothed bride or wedded wife of the earl of menteith upon an attachment formed during her obscurity was a warrant to the world that she had at all times been worthy of the rank to which she was elevated  it was under the influence of these considerations that sir duncan campbell announced to the lovers his consent that they should be married in the chapel of the castle by montroses chaplain and as privately as possible but when montrose should break up from inverlochy for which orders were expected in the course of a very few days it was agreed that the young countess should depart with her father to his castle and remain there until the circumstances of the nation permitted menteith to retire with honour from his present military employment his resolution being once taken sir duncan campbell would not permit the maidenly scruples of his daughter to delay its execution and it was therefore resolved that the bridal should take place the next evening being the second after the battle    chapter xxiii       my maidmy blueeyed maid he bore away      due to the toils of many a bloody dayilliad  it was necessary for many reasons that angus maulay so long the kind protector of annot lyle should be made acquainted with the change in the fortunes of his late protege and montrose as he had undertaken communicated to him these remarkable events with the careless and cheerful indifference of his character he expressed much more joy than wonder at annots good fortune had no doubt whatever she would merit it and as she had always been bred in loyal principles would convey the whole estate of her grim fanatical father to some honest fellow who loved the king i should have no objection that my brother allan should try his chance added he notwithstanding that sir duncan campbell was the only man who ever charged darnlinvarach with inhospitality annot lyle could always charm allan out of the sullens and who knows whether matrimony might not make him more a man of this world montrose hastened to interrupt the progress of his castlebuilding by informing him that the lady was already wooed and won and with her fathers approbation was almost immediately to be wedded to his kinsman the earl of menteith and that in testimony of the high respect due to maulay so long the ladys protector he was now to request his presence at the ceremony maulay looked very grave at this intimation and drew up his person with the air of one who thought that he had been neglected  he contrived he said that his uniform kind treatment of the young lady while so many years under his roof required something more upon such an occasion than a bare compliment of ceremony he might he thought without arrogance have expected to have been consulted he wished his kinsman of menteith well no man could wish him better but he must say he thought he had been hasty in this matter allans sentiments towards the young lady had been pretty well understood and he for one could not see why the superior pretensions which he had upon her gratitude should have been set aside without at least undergoing some previous discussion  montrose seeing too well where all this pointed entreated maulay to be reasonable and to consider what probability there was that the knight of ardenvohr could be brought to confer the hand of his sole heiress upon allan whose undeniable excellent qualities were mingled with others by which they were overclouded in a manner that made all tremble who approached him  my lord said angus maulay my brother allan has as god made us all faults as well as merits but he is the best and bravest man of your army be the other who he may and therefore ill deserved that his happiness should have been so little consulted by your excellencyby his own near kinsmanand by a young person who owes all to him and to his family  montrose in vain endeavoured to place the subject in a different view this was the point in which angus was determined to regard it and he was a man of that calibre of understanding who is incapable of being convinced when he has once adopted a prejudice montrose now assumed a higher tone and called upon angus to take care how he nourished any sentiments which might be prejudicial to his majestys service he pointed out to him that he was peculiarly desirous that allans efforts should not be interrupted in the course of his present mission a mission he said highly honourable for himself and likely to prove most advantageous to the kings cause he expected his brother would hold no communication with him upon other subjects nor stir up any cause of dissension which might divert his mind from a matter of such importance  angus answered somewhat sulkily that he was no makebate or stirrerup of quarrels he would rather be a peacemaker his brother knew as well as most men how to resent his own quarrelsas for allans mode of receiving information it was generally believed he had other sources than those of ordinary couriers he should not be surprised if they saw him sooner than they expected  a promise that he would not interfere was the farthest to which montrose could bring this man thoroughly goodtempered as he was on all occasions save when his pride interest or prejudices were interfered with and at this point the marquis was fain to leave the matter for the present  a more willing guest at the bridal ceremony certainly a more willing attendant at the marriage feast was to be expected in sir dugald dalgetty whom montrose resolved to invite as having been a confidant to the circumstances which preceded it but even sir dugald hesitated looked on the elbows of his doublet and the knees of his leather breeches and mumbled out a sort of reluctant acquiescence in the invitation providing he should find it possible after consulting with the noble bridegroom montrose was somewhat surprised but scorning to testify displeasure he left sir dugald to pursue his own course  this carried him instantly to the chamber of the bridegroom who amidst the scanty wardrobe which his campequipage afforded was seeking for such articles as might appear to the best advantage upon the approaching occasion sir dugald entered and paid his compliments with a very grave face upon his approaching happiness which he said he was very sorry he was prevented from witnessing  in plain truth said he i should but disgrace the ceremony seeing that i lack a bridal garment rents and open seams and tatters at elbows in the apparel of the assistants might presage a similar solution of continuity in your matrimonial happinessand to say truth my lord you yourself must partly have the blame of this disappointment in respect you sent me upon a fools errand to get a buffcoat out of the booty taken by the camerons whereas you might as well have sent me to fetch a pound of fresh butter out of a black dogs throat i had no answer my lord but brandished dirks and broadswords and a sort of growling and jabbering in what they call their language for my part i believe these highlanders to be no better than absolute pagans and have been much scandalized by the manner in which my acquaintance ranald maceagh was pleased to beat his final march a little while since  in menteiths state of mind disposed to be pleased with everything and everybody the grave complaint of sir dugald furnished additional amusement he requested his acceptance of a very handsome buffdress which was lying on the floor i had intended it he said for my own bridalgarment as being the least formidable of my warlike equipments and i have here no peaceful dress  sir dugald made the necessary apologieswould not by any means depriveand so forth until it happily occurred to him that it was much more according to military rule that the earl should be married in his back and breast pieces which dress he had seen the bridegroom wear at the union of prince leo of wittlesbach with the youngest daughter of old george frederick of saxony under the auspices of the gallant gustavus adolphus the lion of the north and so forth the goodnatured young earl laughed and acquiesced and thus having secured at least one merry face at his bridal he put on a light and ornamented cuirass concealed partly by a velvet coat and partly by a broad blue silk scarf which he wore over his shoulder agreeably to his rank and the fashion of the times  everything was now arranged and it had been settled that according to the custom of the country the bride and bridegroom should not again meet until they were before the altar the hour had already struck that summoned the bridegroom thither and he only waited in a small anteroom adjacent to the chapel for the marquis who condescended to act as bridesman upon the occasion business relating to the army having suddenly required the marquiss instant attention menteith waited his return it may be supposed in some impatience and when he heard the door of the apartment open he said laughing you are late upon parade  you will find i am too early said allan maulay who burst into the apartment draw menteith and defend yourself like a man or die like a dog  you are mad allan answered menteith astonished alike at his sudden appearance and at the unutterable fury of his demeanour his cheeks were lividhis eyes started from their socketshis lips were covered with foam and his gestures were those of a demoniac  you lie traitor was his frantic replyyou lie in that as you lie in all you have said to me your life is a lie  did i not speak my thoughts when i called you mad said menteith indignantly your own life were a brief one in what do you charge me with deceiving you  you told me answered maulay that you would not marry annot lylefalse traitorshe now waits you at the altar  it is you who speak false retorted menteith i told you the obscurity of her birth was the only bar to our unionthat is now removed and whom do you think yourself that i should yield up my pretensions in your favour  draw then said maulay we understand each other  not now said menteith and not here allan you know me wellwait till tomorrow and you shall have fighting enough  this hourthis instantor never answered maulay  your triumph shall not go farther than the hour which is stricken menteith i entreat you by our relationshipby our joint conflicts and laboursdraw your sword and defend your life as he spoke he seized the earls hand and wrung it with such frantic earnestness that his grasp forced the blood to start under the nails menteith threw him off with violence exclaiming begone madman  then be the vision accomplished said allan and drawing his dirk struck with his whole gigantic force at the earls bosom the temper of the corslet threw the point of the weapon upwards but a deep wound took place between the neck and shoulder and the force of the blow prostrated the bridegroom on the floor montrose entered at one side of the anteroom the bridal company alarmed at the noise were in equal apprehension and surprise but ere montrose could almost see what had happened allan maulay had rushed past him and descended the castle stairs like lightning guards shut the gate exclaimed montroseseize himkill him if he resistshe shall die if he were my brother  but allan prostrated with a second blow of his dagger a sentinel who was upon dutytraversed the camp like a mountaindeer though pursued by all who caught the alarmthrew himself into the river and swimming to the opposite side was soon lost among the woods in the course of the same evening his brother angus and his followers left montroses camp and taking the road homeward never again rejoined him  of allan himself it is said that in a wonderfully short space after the deed was committed he burst into a room in the castle of inverary where argyle was sitting in council and flung on the table his bloody dirk  is it the blood of james grahame said argyle a ghastly expression of hope mixing with the terror which the sudden apparition naturally excited  it is the blood of his minion answered maulayit is the blood which i was predestined to shed though i would rather have spilt my own  having thus spoken he turned and left the castle and from that moment nothing certain is known of his fate as the boy kenneth with three of the children of the mist were seen soon afterwards to cross lochfine it is supposed they dogged his course and that he perished by their hand in some obscure wilderness another opinion maintains that allan maulay went abroad and died a monk of the carthusian order but nothing beyond bare presumption could ever be brought in support of either opinion  his vengeance was much less complete than he probably fancied for menteith though so severely wounded as to remain long in a dangerous state was by having adopted major dalgettys fortunate recommendation of a cuirass as a bridalgarment happily secured from the worst consequences of the blow but his services were lost to montrose and it was thought best that he should be conveyed with his intended countess now truly a mourning bride and should accompany his wounded fatherinlaw to the castle of sir duncan at ardenvohr dalgetty followed them to the waters edge reminding menteith of the necessity of erecting a sconce on drumsnab to cover his ladys newlyacquired inheritance  they performed their voyage in safety and menteith was in a few weeks so well in health as to be united to annot in the castle of her father  the highlanders were somewhat puzzled to reconcile menteiths recovery with the visions of the second sight and the more experienced seers were displeased with him for not having died but others thought the credit of the vision sufficiently fulfilled by the wound inflicted by the hand and with the weapon foretold and all were of opinion that the incident of the ring with the deaths head related to the death of the brides father who did not survive her marriage many months the incredulous held that all this was idle dreaming and that allans supposed vision was but a consequence of the private suggestions of his own passion which having long seen in menteith a rival more beloved than himself struggled with his better nature and impressed upon him as it were involuntarily the idea of killing his competitor  menteith did not recover sufficiently to join montrose during his brief and glorious career and when that heroic general disbanded his army and retired from scotland menteith resolved to adopt the life of privacy which he led till the restoration after that happy event he occupied a situation in the land befitting his rank lived long happy alike in public regard and in domestic affection and died at a good old age  our dramatis personae have been so limited that excepting montrose whose exploits and fate are the theme of history we have only to mention sir dugald dalgetty this gentleman continued with the most rigorous punctuality to discharge his duty and to receive his pay until he was made prisoner among others upon the field of philiphaugh he was condemned to share the fate of his fellowofficers upon that occasion who were doomed to death rather by denunciations from the pulpit than the sentence either of civil or military tribunal their blood being considered as a sort of sinoffering to take away the guilt of the land and the fate imposed upon the canaanites under a special dispensation being impiously and cruelly applied to them  several lowland officers in the service of the covenanters interceded for dalgetty on this occasion representing him as a person whose skill would be useful in their army and who would be readily induced to change his service but on this point they found sir dugald unexpectedly obstinate he had engaged with the king for a certain term and till that was expired his principles would not permit any shadow of changing the covenanters again understood no such nice distinction and he was in the utmost danger of falling a martyr not to this or that political principle but merely to his own strict ideas of a military enlistment fortunately his friends discovered by computation that there remained but a fortnight to elapse of the engagement he had formed and to which though certain it was never to be renewed no power on earth could make him false with some difficulty they procured a reprieve for this short space after which they found him perfectly willing to come under any engagements they chose to dictate he entered the service of the estates accordingly and wrought himself forward to be major in gilbert kers corps commonly called the kirks own regiment of horse of his farther history we know nothing until we find him in possession of his paternal estate of drumthwacket which he acquired not by the sword but by a pacific intermarriage with hannah strachan a matron somewhat stricken in years the widow of the aberdeenshire covenanter  sir dugald is supposed to have survived the revolution as traditions of no very distant date represent him as cruising about in that country very old very deaf and very full

same resemblance to ariel as he at whose voice he rose doth to the sage prospero and yet so fond are we of the fictions of our own fancy that i part with him and all his imaginary localities with idle reluctance i am aware this is a feeling in which the reader will little sympathize but he cannot be more sensible than i am that sufficient varieties have now been exhibited of the scottish character
