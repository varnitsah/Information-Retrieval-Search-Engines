43567849	tonobungay  by hg wells     book the first  the days before tonobungay was invented     chapter the first  of bladesover house and my mother and the constitution of society   i  most people in this world seem to live in character they have a beginning a middle and an end and the three are congruous one with another and true to the rules of their type you can speak of them as being of this sort of people or that they are as theatrical people say no more and no less than character actors they have a class they have a place they know what is becoming in them and what is due to them and their proper size of tombstone tells at last how properly they have played the part but there is also another kind of life that is not so much living as a miscellaneous tasting of life one gets hit by some unusual transverse force one is jerked out of ones stratum and lives crosswise for the rest of the time and as it were in a succession of samples that has been my lot and that is what has set me at last writing something in the nature of a novel i have got an unusual series of impressions that i want very urgently to tell i have seen life at very different levels and at all these levels i have seen it with a sort of intimacy and in good faith i have been a native in many social countries i have been the unwelcome guest of a working baker my cousin who has since died in the chatham infirmary i have eaten illegal snacksthe unjustifiable gifts of footmenin pantries and been despised for my want of style and subsequently married and divorced by the daughter of a gasworks clerk andto go to my other extremei was onceoh glittering daysan item in the houseparty of a countess she was i admit a countess with a financial aspect but still you know a countess ive seen these people at various angles at the dinnertable ive met not simply the titled but the great on one occasionit is my brightest memoryi upset my champagne over the trousers of the greatest statesman in the empireheaven forbid i should be so invidious as to name himin the warmth of our mutual admiration  and once though it is the most incidental thing in my life i murdered a man  yes ive seen a curious variety of people and ways of living altogether odd people they all are great and small very much alike at bottom and curiously different on their surfaces i wish i had ranged just a little further both up and down seeing i have ranged so far royalty must be worth knowing and very great fun but my contacts with princes have been limited to quite public occasions nor at the other end of the scale have i had what i should call an inside acquaintance with that dusty but attractive class of people who go about on the highroads drunk but enfamille so redeeming the minor lapse in the summertime with a perambulator lavender to sell sunbrown children a smell and ambiguous bundles that fire the imagination navvies farmlabourers sailormen and stokers all such as sit in 1834 beerhouses are beyond me also and i suppose must remain so now for ever my intercourse with the ducal rank too has been negligible i once went shooting with a duke and in an outburst of what was no doubt snobbishness did my best to get him in the legs but that failed  im sorry i havent done the whole lot though  you will ask by what merit i achieved this remarkable social range this extensive crosssection of the british social organism it was the accident of birth it always is in england  indeed if i may make the remark so cosmic everything is but that is by the way i was my uncles nephew and my uncle was no less a person than edward ponderevo whose cometlike transit of the financial heavens happenedit is now ten years ago do you remember the days of ponderevo the great days i mean of ponderevo perhaps you had a trifle in some worldshaking enterprise then you know him only too well astraddle on tonobungay he flashed athwart the empty heavenslike a cometrather like a stupendous rocketand overawed investors spoke of his star at his zenith he burst into a cloud of the most magnificent promotions what a time that was the napoleon of domestic conveniences  i was his nephew his peculiar and intimate nephew i was hanging on to his coattails all the way through i made pills with him in the chemists shop at wimblehurst before he began i was you might say the stick of his rocket and after our tremendous soar after he had played with millions a golden rain in the sky after my birdseye view of the modern world i fell again a little scarred and blistered perhaps two and twenty years older with my youth gone my manhood eaten in upon but greatly edified into this thamesside yard into these white heats and hammerings amidst the fine realites of steelto think it all over in my leisure and jot down the notes and inconsecutive observations that make this book it was more you know than a figurative soar the zenith of that career was surely our flight across the channel in the lord roberts b  i warn you this book is going to be something of an agglomeration i want to trace my social trajectory and my uncles as the main line of my story but as this is my first novel and almost certainly my last i want to get in too all sorts of things that struck me things that amused me and impressions i goteven although they dont minister directly to my narrative at all i want to set out my own queer love experiences too such as they are for they troubled and distressed and swayed me hugely and they still seem to me to contain all sorts of irrational and debatable elements that i shall be the clearerheaded for getting on paper and possibly i may even flow into descriptions of people who are really no more than people seen in transit just because it amuses me to recall what they said and did to us and more particularly how they behaved in the brief but splendid glare of tonobungay and its still more glaring offspring it lit some of them up i can assure you indeed i want to get in all sorts of things my ideas of a novel all through are comprehensive rather than austere  tonobungay still figures on the hoardings it stands in rows in every chemists storeroom it still assuages the coughs of age and brightens the elderly eye and loosens the elderly tongue but its social glory its financial illumination have faded from the world for ever and i sole scorched survivor from the blaze sit writing of it here in an air that is never still for the clang and thunder of machines on a table littered with working drawings and amid fragments of models and notes about velocities and air and water pressures and trajectoriesof an altogether different sort from that of tonobungay  ii  i write that much and look at it and wonder whether after all this is any fair statement of what i am attempting in this book ive given i see an impression that i want to make simply a hotchpotch of anecdotes and experiences with my uncle swimming in the middle as the largest lump of victual ill own that here with the pen already started i realise what a fermenting mass of things learnt and emotions experienced and theories formed ive got to deal with and how in a sense hopeless my book must be from the very outset i suppose what im really trying to render is nothing more nor less than lifeas one man has found it i want to tellmyself and my impressions of the thing as a whole to say things i have come to feel intensely of the laws traditions usages and ideas we call society and how we poor individuals get driven and lured and stranded among these windy perplexing shoals and channels ive got i suppose to a time of life when things begin to take on shapes that have an air of reality and become no longer material for dreaming but interesting in themselves ive reached the criticising novelwriting age and here i am writing minemy one novelwithout having any of the discipline to refrain and omit that i suppose the regular novelwriter acquires  ive read an average share of novels and made some starts before this beginning and ive found the restraints and rules of the art as i made them out impossible for me i like to write i am keenly interested in writing but it is not my technique im an engineer with a patent or two and a set of ideas most of whatever artist there is in me has been given to turbine machines and boat building and the problem of flying and do what i will i fail to see how i can be other than a lax undisciplined storyteller i must sprawl and flounder comment and theorise if i am to get the thing out i have in mind and it isnt a constructed tale i have to tell but unmanageable realities my lovestoryand if only i can keep up the spirit of truthtelling all through as strongly as i have now you shall have it allfalls into no sort of neat scheme of telling it involves three separate feminine persons its all mixed up with the other things  but ive said enough i hope to excuse myself for the method or want of method in what follows and i think i had better tell without further delay of my boyhood and my early impressions in the shadow of bladesover house  iii  there came a time when i realised that bladesover house was not all it seemed but when i was a little boy i took the place with the entirest faith as a complete authentic microcosm i believed that the bladesover system was a little workingmodeland not so very little eitherof the whole world  let me try and give you the effect of it  bladesover lies up on the kentish downs eight miles perhaps from ashborough and its old pavilion a little wooden parody of the temple of vesta at tibur upon the hill crest behind the house commands in theory at least a view of either sea of the channel southward and the thames to the northeast the park is the second largest in kent finely wooded with wellplaced beeches many elms and some sweet chestnuts abounding in little valleys and hollows of bracken with springs and a stream and three fine ponds and multitudes of fallow deer the house was built in the eighteenth century it is of pale red brick in the style of a french chateau and save for one pass among the crests which opens to blue distances to minute remote oastset farmhouses and copses and wheat fields and the occasional gleam of water its hundred and seventeen windows look on nothing but its own wide and handsome territories a semicircular screen of great beeches masks the church and village which cluster picturesquely about the high road along the skirts of the great park northward at the remotest corner of that enclosure is a second dependent village ropedean less fortunate in its greater distance and also on account of a rector this divine was indeed rich but he was vindictively economical because of some shrinkage of his tithes and by reason of his use of the word eucharist for the lords supper he had become altogether estranged from the great ladies of bladesover so that ropedean was in the shadows through all that youthful time  now the unavoidable suggestion of that wide park and that fair large house dominating church village and the country side was that they represented the thing that mattered supremely in the world and that all other things had significance only in relation to them they represented the gentry the quality by and through and for whom the rest of the world the farming folk and the labouring folk the tradespeople of ashborough and the upper servants and the lower servants and the servants of the estate breathed and lived and were permitted and the quality did it so quietly and thoroughly the great house mingled so solidly and effectually earth and sky the contrast of its spacious hall and saloon and galleries its airy housekeepers room and warren of offices with the meagre dignities of the vicar and the pinched and stuffy rooms of even the postoffice people and the grocer so enforced these suggestions that it was only when i was a boy of thirteen or fourteen and some queer inherited strain of scepticism had set me doubting whether mr bartlett the vicar did really know with certainty all about god that as a further and deeper step in doubting i began to question the final rightness of the gentlefolks their primary necessity in the scheme of things but once that scepticism had awakened it took me fast and far by fourteen i had achieved terrible blasphemies and sacrilege i had resolved to marry a viscounts daughter and i had blacked the left eyei think it was the leftof her halfbrother in open and declared rebellion  but of that in its place  the great house the church the village and the labourers and the servants in their stations and degrees seemed to me i say to be a closed and complete social system about us were other villages and great estates and from house to house interlacing correlated the gentry the fine olympians came and went the country towns seemed mere collections of ships marketing places for the tenantry centres for such education as they needed as entirely dependent on the gentry as the village and scarcely less directly so i thought this was the order of the whole world i thought london was only a greater country town where the gentlefolk kept townhouses and did their greater shopping under the magnificent shadow of the greatest of all fine gentlewomen the queen it seemed to be in the divine order that all this fine appearance was already sapped that there were forces at work that might presently carry all this elaborate social system in which my mother instructed me so carefully that i might understand my place to limbo had scarcely dawned upon me even by the time that tonobungay was fairly launched upon the world  there are many people in england today upon whom it has not yet dawned there are times when i doubt whether any but a very inconsiderable minority of english people realise how extensively this ostensible order has even now passed away the great houses stand in the parks still the cottages cluster respectfully on their borders touching their eaves with their creepers the english countrysideyou can range through kent from bladesover northward and see persists obstinately in looking what it was it is like an early day in a fine october the hand of change rests on it all unfelt unseen resting for awhile as it were half reluctantly before it grips and ends the thing for ever one frost and the whole face of things will be bare links snap patience end our fine foliage of pretences lie glowing in the mire  for that we have still to wait a little while the new order may have gone far towards shaping itself but just as in that sort of lantern show that used to be known in the village as the dissolving views the scene that is going remains upon the mind traceable and evident and the newer picture is yet enigmatical long after the lines that are to replace those former ones have grown bright and strong so that the new england of our childrens children is still a riddle to me the ideas of democracy of equality and above all of promiscuous fraternity have certainly never really entered into the english mind but what is coming into it all this book i hope will bear a little on that our people never formulates it keeps words for jests and ironies in the meanwhile the old shapes the old attitudes remain subtly changed and changing still sheltering strange tenants bladesover house is now let furnished to sir reuben lichtenstein and has been since old lady drew died it was my odd experience to visit there in the house of which my mother had been housekeeper when my uncle was at the climax of tonobungay it was curious to notice then the little differences that had come to things with this substitution to borrow an image from my mineralogical days these jews were not so much a new british gentry as pseudomorphous after the gentry they are a very clever people the jews but not clever enough to suppress their cleverness i wished i could have gone downstairs to savour the tone of the pantry it would have been very different i know hawksnest over beyond i noted had its pseudomorph too a newspaper proprietor of the type that hustles along with stolen ideas from one loud sinkorswim enterprise to another had bought the place outright redgrave was in the hands of brewers  but the people in the villages so far as i could detect saw no difference in their world two little girls bobbed and an old labourer touched his hat convulsively as i walked through the village he still thought he knew his placeand mine i did not know him but i would have liked dearly to have asked him if he remembered my mother if either my uncle or old lichtenstein had been man enough to stand being given away like that  in that english countryside of my boyhood every human being had a place it belonged to you from your birth like the colour of your eyes it was inextricably your destiny above you were your betters below you were your inferiors and there were even an unstable questionable few cases so disputable that you might for the rough purposes of every day at least regard them as your equals head and centre of our system was lady drew her leddyship shrivelled garrulous with a wonderful memory for genealogies and very very old and beside her and nearly as old miss somerville her cousin and companion these two old souls lived like driedup kernels in the great shell of bladesover house the shell that had once been gaily full of fops of fine ladies in powder and patches and courtly gentlemen with swords and when there was no company they spent whole days in the corner parlour just over the housekeepers room between reading and slumber and caressing their two pet dogs when i was a boy i used always to think of these two poor old creatures as superior beings living like god somewhere through the ceiling occasionally they bumped about a bit and one even heard them overhead which gave them a greater effect of reality without mitigating their vertical predominance sometimes too i saw them of course if i came upon them in the park or in the shrubbery where i was a trespasser i hid or fled in pious horror but i was upon due occasion taken into the presence by request i remember her leddyship then as a thing of black silks and a golden chain a quavering injunction to me to be a good boy a very shrunken looseskinned face and neck and a ropy hand that trembled a halfcrown into mine miss somerville hovered behind a paler thing of broken lavender and white and black with screwed up sandylashed eyes her hair was yellow and her colour bright and when we sat in the housekeepers room of a winters night warming our toes and sipping elder wine her maid would tell us the simple secrets of that belated flush after my fight with young garvell i was of course banished and i never saw those poor old painted goddesses again  then there came and went on these floors over our respectful heads the company people i rarely saw but whose tricks and manners were imitated and discussed by their maids and valets in the housekeepers room and the stewards roomso that i had them through a medium at second hand i gathered that none of the company were really lady drews equals they were greater and lesser after the manner of all things in our world once i remember there was a prince with a real live gentleman in attendance and that was a little above our customary levels and excited us all and perhaps raised our expectations unduly afterwards rabbits the butler came into my mothers room downstairs red with indignation and with tears in his eyes look at that gasped rabbits my mother was speechless with horror that was a sovereign a mere sovereign such as you might get from any commoner  after company i remember came anxious days for the poor old women upstairs were left tired and cross and vindictive and in a state of physical and emotional indigestion after their social efforts  on the lowest fringe of these real olympians hung the vicarage people and next to them came those ambiguous beings who are neither quality nor subjects the vicarage people certainly hold a place by themselves in the typical english scheme nothing is more remarkable than the progress the church has madesociallyin the last two hundred years in the early eighteenth century the vicar was rather under than over the housesteward and was deemed a fitting match for the housekeeper or any not too morally discredited discard the eighteenth century literature is full of his complaints that he might not remain at table to share the pie he rose above these indignities because of the abundance of younger sons when i meet the large assumptions of the contemporary cleric i am apt to think of these things it is curious to note that today that downtrodden organplaying creature the church of england village schoolmaster holds much the same position as the seventeenth century parson the doctor in bladesover ranked below the vicar but above the vet artists and summer visitors squeezed in above or below this point according to their appearance and expenditure and then in a carefully arranged scale came the tenantry the butler and housekeeper the village shopkeeper the head keeper the cook the publican the second keeper the blacksmith whose status was complicated by his daughter keeping the postofficeand a fine hash she used to make of telegrams too the village shopkeepers eldest son the first footman younger sons of the village shopkeeper his first assistant and so forth  all these conceptions and applications of a universal precedence and much else i drank in at bladesover as i listened to the talk of valets ladiesmaids rabbits the butler and my mother in the muchcupboarded whitepainted chintzbrightened housekeepers room where the upper servants assembled or of footmen and rabbits and estate men of all sorts among the green baize and windsor chairs of the pantrywhere rabbits being above the law sold beer without a license or any compunctionor of housemaids and stillroom maids in the bleak mattingcarpeted stillroom or of the cook and her kitchen maids and casual friends among the bright copper and hot glow of the kitchens  of course their own ranks and places came by implication to these people and it was with the ranks and places of the olympians that the talk mainly concerned itself there was an old peerage and a crockford together with the books of recipes the whitakers almanack the old moores almanack and the eighteenth century dictionary on the little dresser that broke the cupboards on one side of my mothers room there was another peerage with the covers off in the pantry there was a new peerage in the billiardroom and i seem to remember another in the anomalous apartment that held the upper servants bagatelle board and in which after the hall dinner they partook of the luxury of sweets and if you had asked any of those upper servants how such and such a prince of battenberg was related to let us say mr cunninghame graham or the duke of argyle you would have been told upon the nail as a boy i heard a great deal of that sort of thing and if to this day i am still a little vague about courtesy titles and the exact application of honorifics it is i can assure you because i hardened my heart and not from any lack of adequate opportunity of mastering these succulent particulars  dominating all these memories is the figure of my mothermy mother who did not love me because i grew liker my father every dayand who knew with inflexible decision her place and the place of every one in the worldexcept the place that concealed my fatherand in some details mine subtle points were put to her i can see and hear her saying now no miss fison peers of england go in before peers of the united kingdom and he is merely a peer of the united kingdom she had much exercise in placing peoples servants about her teatable where the etiquette was very strict i wonder sometimes if the etiquette of housekeepers rooms is as strict today and what my mother would have made of a chauffeur  on the whole i am glad that i saw so much as i did of bladesoverif for no other reason than because seeing it when i did quite naively believing in it thoroughly and then coming to analyse it has enabled me to understand much that would be absolutely incomprehensible in the structure of english society bladesover is i am convinced the clue to almost all that is distinctively british and perplexing to the foreign inquirer in england and the englishspeaking peoples grasp firmly that england was all bladesover two hundred years ago that it has had reform acts indeed and suchlike changes of formula but no essential revolution since then that all that is modern and different has come in as a thing intruded or as a gloss upon this predominant formula either impertinently or apologetically and you will perceive at once the reasonableness the necessity of that snobbishness which is the distinctive quality of english thought everybody who is not actually in the shadow of a bladesover is as it were perpetually seeking after lost orientations we have never broken with our tradition never even symbolically hewed it to pieces as the french did in quivering fact in the terror but all the organizing ideas have slackened the old habitual bonds have relaxed or altogether come undone and america too is as it were a detached outlying part of that estate which has expanded in queer ways george washington esquire was of the gentlefolk and he came near being a king it was plutarch you know and nothing intrinsically american that prevented george washington being a king  iv  i hated teatime in the housekeepers room more than anything else at bladesover and more particularly i hated it when mrs mackridge and mrs booch and mrs latudefernay were staying in the house they were all three of them pensionedoff servants  old friends of lady drews had rewarded them posthumously for a prolonged devotion to their minor comforts and mrs booch was also trustee for a favourite skye terrier every year lady drew gave them an invitationa reward and encouragement of virtue with especial reference to my mother and miss fison the maid they sat about in black and shiny and flouncey clothing adorned with gimp and beads eating great quantities of cake drinking much tea in a stately manner and reverberating remarks  i remember these women as immense no doubt they were of negotiable size but i was only a very little chap and they have assumed nightmare proportions in my mind they loomed they bulged they impended mrs mackridge was large and dark there was a marvel about her head inasmuch as she was bald she wore a dignified cap and in front of that upon her brow hair was painted i have never seen the like since she had been maid to the widow of sir roderick blenderhasset impey some sort of governor or suchlike portent in the east indies and from her remainsin mrs mackridgei judge lady impey was a very stupendous and crushing creature indeed lady impey had been of the juno type haughty unapproachable given to irony and a caustic wit mrs mackridge had no wit but she had acquired the caustic voice and gestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady when she told you it was a fine morning she seemed also to be telling you you were a fool and a low fool to boot when she was spoken to she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous scornful haw that made you want to burn her alive she also had a way of saying indade with a droop of the eyelids  mrs booch was a smaller woman brown haired with queer little curls on either side of her face large blue eyes and a small set of stereotyped remarks that constituted her entire mental range mrs latudefernay has left oddly enough no memory at all except her name and the effect of a greengrey silk dress all set with gold and blue buttons i fancy she was a large blonde then there was miss fison the maid who served both lady drew and miss somerville and at the end of the table opposite my mother sat rabbits the butler rabbits for a butler was an unassuming man and at tea he was not as you know butlers but in a morning coat and a black tie with blue spots still he was large with side whiskers even if his cleanshaven mouth was weak and little i sat among these people on a high hard early gregorian chair trying to exist like a feeble seedling amidst great rocks and my mother sat with an eye upon me resolute to suppress the slightest manifestation of vitality it was hard on me but perhaps it was also hard upon these rather overfed ageing pretending people that my youthful restlessness and rebellious unbelieving eyes should be thrust in among their dignities  tea lasted for nearly threequarters of an hour and i sat it out perforce and day after day the talk was exactly the same  sugar mrs mackridge my mother used to ask  sugar mrs latudefernay  the word sugar would stir the mind of mrs mackridge they say she would begin issuing her proclamationat least half her sentences began they saysugar is fattaning nowadays many of the best people do not take it at all  not with their tea maam said rabbits intelligently  not with anything said mrs mackridge with an air of crushing repartee and drank  what wont they say next said miss fison  they do say such things said mrs booch  they say said mrs mackridge inflexibly the doctors are not recommanding it now  my mother no maam  mrs mackridge no maam  then to the table at large poor sir roderick before he died consumed great quantaties of sugar i have sometimes fancied it may have hastened his end  this ended the first skirmish a certain gloom of manner and a pause was considered due to the sacred memory of sir roderick  george said my mother dont kick the chair  then perhaps mrs booch would produce a favourite piece from her repertoire the evenings are drawing out nicely she would say or if the season was decadent how the evenings draw in it was an invaluable remark to her i do not know how she would have got along without it  my mother who sat with her back to the window would always consider it due to mrs booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of elongation or contraction whichever phase it might be  a brisk discussion of how long we were to the longest or shortest day would ensue and die away at last exhausted  mrs mackridge perhaps would reopen she had many intelligent habits among others she read the paperthe morning post the other ladies would at times tackle that sheet but only to read the births marriages and deaths on the front page it was of course the old morning post that cost threepence not the brisk coruscating young thing of today they say she would open that lord tweedums is to go to canada  ah said mr rabbits dew they  isnt he said my mother the earl of slumgolds cousin she knew he was it was an entirely irrelevant and unnecessary remark but still something to say  the same maam said mrs mackridge they say he was extremelay popular in new south wales they looked up to him greatlay i knew him maam as a young man a very nice pleasant young fella  interlude of respect  is predecessor said rabbits who had acquired from some clerical model a precise emphatic articulation without acquiring at the same time the aspirates that would have graced it got into trouble at sydney  haw said mrs mackridge scornfully so am tawled  e came to templemorton after e came back and i remember them talking im over after ed gone again  haw said mrs mackridge interrogatively  is fuss was quotin poetry maam e saidwhat was it e saidthey lef their country for their countrys goodwhich in some way was took to remind them of their being originally convics though now reformed every one i eard speak agreed it was takless of im  sir roderick used to say said mrs mackridge that the first thinghere mrs mackridge paused and looked dreadfully at meand the second thinghere she fixed me againand the third thingnow i was releasedneeded in a colonial governor is tact she became aware of my doubts again and added predominantly it has always struck me that that was a singularly true remark  i resolved that if ever i found this polypus of tact growing up in my soul i would tear it out by the roots throw it forth and stamp on it  theyre queer peoplecolonials said rabbits very queer when i was at templemorton i see something of em queer fellows some of em very respectful of course free with their money in a spasammy sort of way butsome of em i must confess make me nervous they have an eye on you they watch youas you wait they let themselves appear to be lookin at you  my mother said nothing in that discussion the word colonies always upset her she was afraid i think that if she turned her mind in that direction my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary she did not want to rediscover my father at all  it is curious that when i was a little listening boy i had such an idea of our colonies that i jeered in my heart at mrs mackridges colonial ascendancy these brave emancipated sunburnt english of the open i thought suffer these aristocratic invaders as a quaint anachronism but as for being gratified  i dont jeer now im not so sure  v  it is a little difficult to explain why i did not come to do what was the natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do and take my world for granted a certain innate scepticism i think explains it and a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation my father i believe was a sceptic my mother was certainly a hard woman  i was an only child and to this day i do not know whether my father is living or dead he fled my mothers virtues before my distincter memories began he left no traces in his flight and she in her indignation destroyed every vestige that she could of him never a photograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have i seen and it was i know only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented her destroying her marriage certificate and me and so making a clean sweep of her matrimonial humiliation i suppose i must inherit something of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a holocaust of every little personal thing she had of him there must have been presents made by him as a lover for examplebooks with kindly inscriptions letters perhaps a flattened flower a ring or suchlike gage she kept her weddingring of course but all the others she destroyed she never told me his christian name or indeed spoke a word to me of him though at times i came near daring to ask her add what i have of himit isnt muchi got from his brother my hero my uncle ponderevo she wore her ring her marriage certificate she kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk and me she sustained at a private school among the kentish hills you must not think i was always at bladesovereven in my holidays if at the time these came round lady drew was vexed by recent company or for any other reason wished to take it out of my mother then she used to ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her and i stayed on at the school  but such occasions were rare and i suppose that between ten and fourteen i averaged fifty days a year at bladesover  dont imagine i deny that was a fine thing for me bladesover in absorbing the whole countryside had not altogether missed greatness the bladesover system has at least done one good thing for england it has abolished the peasant habit of mind if many of us still live and breathe pantry and housekeepers room we are quit of the dream of living by economising parasitically on hens and pigs about that park there were some elements of a liberal education there was a great space of greensward not given over to manure and food grubbing there was mystery there was matter for the imagination it was still a park of deer i saw something of the life of these dappled creatures heard the belling of stags came upon young fawns among the bracken found bones skulls and antlers in lonely places there were corners that gave a gleam of meaning to the word forest glimpses of unstudied natural splendour there was a slope of bluebells in the broken sunlight under the newly green beeches in the west wood that is now precious sapphire in my memory it was the first time that i knowingly met beauty  and in the house there were books the rubbish old lady drew read i never saw stuff of the maria monk type i have since gathered had a fascination for her but back in the past there had been a drew of intellectual enterprise sir cuthbert the son of sir matthew who built the house and thrust away neglected and despised in an old room upstairs were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout among during a spell of wintry wet sitting under a dormer window on a shelf above great stores of tea and spices i became familiar with much of hogarth in a big portfolio with raphael there was a great book of engravings from the stanzas of raphael in the vaticanand with most of the capitals of europe as they had looked about 1780 by means of several pig ironmoulded books of views there was also a broad eighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me mightily it had splendid adornments about each map title holland showed a fisherman and his boat russia a cossack japan remarkable people attired in pagodasi say it deliberately pagodas there were terrae incognitae in every continent then poland sarmatia lands since lost and many a voyage i made with a blunted pin about that large incorrect and dignified world the books in that little old closet had been banished i suppose from the saloon during the victorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy but my mother had no suspicion of their character so i read and understood the good sound rhetoric of tom paines rights of man and his common sense excellent books once praised by bishops and since sedulously lied about gulliver was there unexpurgated strong meat for a boy perhaps but not too strong i holdi have never regretted that i escaped niceness in these affairs the satire of traldragdubh made my blood boil as it was meant to do but i hated swift for the houyhnhnms and never quite liked a horse afterwards then i remember also a translation of voltaires candide and rasselas and vast book though it was i really believe i read in a muzzy sort of way of course from end to end and even with some reference now and then to the atlas gibbonin twelve volumes  these readings whetted my taste for more and surreptitiously i raided the bookcases in the big saloon i got through quite a number of books before my sacrilegious temerity was discovered by ann the old headhousemaid i remember that among others i tried a translation of platos republic then and found extraordinarily little interest in it i was much too young for that but vathekvathek was glorious stuff that kicking affair when everybody had to kick  the thought of vathek always brings back with it my boyish memory of the big saloon at bladesover  it was a huge long room with many windows opening upon the park and each windowthere were a dozen or more reaching from the floor uphad its elaborate silk or satin curtains heavily fringed a canopy is it above its completely white shutters folding into the deep thickness of the wall at either end of that great still place was an immense marble chimneypiece the end by the bookcase showed the wolf and romulus and remus with homer and virgil for supporters the design of the other end i have forgotten frederick prince of wales swaggered flatly over the one twice lifesize but mellowed by the surface gleam of oil and over the other was an equally colossal group of departed drews as sylvan deities scantily clad against a stormrent sky down the centre of the elaborate ceiling were three chandeliers each bearing some hundreds of dangling glass lustres and over the interminable carpetit impressed me as about as big as sarmatia in the storeroom atlaswere islands and archipelagoes of chintzcovered chairs and couches tables great sevres vases on pedestals a bronze man and horse somewhere in this wilderness one came i remember upona big harp beside a lyreshaped music stand and a grand piano  the bookborrowing raid was one of extraordinary dash and danger  one came down the main service stairsthat was legal and illegality began in a little landing when very cautiously one went through a red baize door a little passage led to the hall and here one reconnoitered for ann the old headhousemaidthe younger housemaids were friendly and did not count ann located came a dash across the open space at the foot of that great staircase that has never been properly descended since powder went out of fashion and so to the saloon door a beast of an oscillating chinaman in china as large as life grimaced and quivered to ones lightest steps that door was the perilous place it was double with the thickness of the wall between so that one could not listen beforehand for the whisk of the featherbrush on the other side oddly ratlike is it not this darting into enormous places in pursuit of the abandoned crumbs of thought  and i found langhornes plutarch too i remember on those shelves it seems queer to me now to think that i acquired pride and selfrespect the idea of a state and the germ of public spirit in such a furtive fashion queer too that it should rest with an old greek dead these eighteen hundred years to teach that  vi  the school i went to was the sort of school the bladesover system permitted the public schools that add comic into existence in the brief glow of the renascence had been taken possession of by the ruling class the lower classes were not supposed to stand in need of schools and our middle stratum got the schools it deserved private schools schools any unqualified pretender was free to establish mine was kept by a man who had had the energy to get himself a college of preceptors diploma and considering how cheap his charges were i will readily admit the place might have been worse the building was a dingy yellowbrick residence outside the village with the schoolroom as an outbuilding of lath and plaster  i do not remember that my schooldays were unhappyindeed i recall a good lot of fine mixed fun in thembut i cannot without grave risk of misinterpretation declare that we were at all nice and refined we fought much not sound formal fighting but scrapping of a sincere and murderous kind into which one might bring ones bootsit made us tough at any rateand several of us were the sons of london publicans who distinguished scraps where one meant to hurt from ordered pugilism practising both arts and having moreover precocious linguistic gifts our cricketfield was bald about the wickets and we played without style and disputed with the umpire and the teaching was chiefly in the hands of a lout of nineteen who wore readymade clothes and taught despicably the headmaster and proprietor taught us arithmetic algebra and euclid and to the older boys even trigonometry himself he had a strong mathematical bias and i think now that by the standard of a british public school he did rather well by us  we had one inestimable privilege at that school and that was spiritual neglect we dealt with one another with the forcible simplicity of natural boys we cheeked and punched and clouted we thought ourselves red indians and cowboys and suchlike honourable things and not young english gentlemen we never felt the strain of onward christian soldiers nor were swayed by any premature piety in the cold oak pew of our sunday devotions all that was good we spent our rare pennies in the uncensored reading matter of the village dames shop on the boys of england and honest penny dreadfulsripping stuff stuff that anticipated haggard and stevenson badly printed and queerly illustrated and very very good for us on our halfholidays we were allowed the unusual freedom of rambling in twos and threes wide and far about the land talking experimentally dreaming wildly there was much in those walks to this day the landscape of the kentish world with its low broad distances its hop gardens and golden stretches of wheat its oasts and square church towers its background of downland and hangers has for me a faint sense of adventure added to the pleasure of its beauty we smoked on occasion but nobody put us up to the proper boyish things to do we never robbed an orchard for example though there were orchards all about us we thought stealing was sinful we stole incidental apples and turnips and strawberries from the fields indeed but in a criminal inglorious fashion and afterwards we were ashamed we had our days of adventure but they were natural accidents our own adventures there was one hot day when several of us walking out towards maidstone were incited by the devil to despise ginger beer and we fuddled ourselves dreadfully with ale and a time when our young minds were infected to the pitch of buying pistols by the legend of the wild west young roots from highbury came back with a revolver and cartridges and we went off six strong to live a free wild life one holiday afternoon we fired our first shot deep in the old flint mine at chiselstead and nearly burst our ear drums then we fired in a primrose studded wood by pickthorn green and i gave a false alarm of keeper and we fled in disorder for a mile after which roots suddenly shot at a pheasant in the high road by chiselstead and then young barker told lies about the severity of the game laws and made roots sore afraid and we hid the pistol in a dry ditch outside the school field a day or so after we got in again and ignoring a certain fouling and rusting of the barrel tried for a rabbit at three hundred yards young roots blew a molehill at twenty paces into a dust cloud burnt his fingers and scorched his face and the weapon having once displayed this strange disposition to flame back upon the shooter was not subsequently fired  one main source of excitement for us was cheeking people in vans and carts upon the goudhurst road and getting myself into a monstrous white mess in the chalk pits beyond the village and catching yellow jaundice as a sequel to bathing stark naked with three other adamites old ewart leading that function in the rivulet across hicksons meadows are among my memorabilia those free imaginative afternoons how much they were for us how much they did for us all streams came from the then undiscovered sources of the nile in those days all thickets were indian jungles and our best game i say it with pride i invented i got it out of the bladesover saloon we found a wood where trespassing was forbidden and did the retreat of the ten thousand through it from end to end cutting our way bravely through a host of nettle beds that barred our path and not forgetting to weep and kneel when at last we emerged within sight of the high road sea so we have burst at times weeping and rejoicing upon startled wayfarers usually i took the part of that distinguished general xenophenand please note the quantity of the o i have all my classical names like thatsocrates rhymes with bates for me and except when the bleak eye of some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment i use those dear old mispronunciations still the little splash into latin made during my days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit wellif i met those great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly adjusted i did at least meet them alive as an equal and in a living tongue altogether my school might easily have been worse for me and among other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out  this was ewart who is now a monumental artist at woking after many vicissitudes dear chap how he did stick out of his clothes to be sure he was a longlimbed lout ridiculously tall beside my more youth full compactness and except that there was no black moustache under his nose blob he had the same round knobby face as he has today the same bright and active hazel brown eyes the stare the meditative moment the insinuating reply surely no boy ever played the fool as bob ewart used to play it no boy had a readier knack of mantling the world with wonder commonness vanished before ewart at his expository touch all things became memorable and rare from him i first heard tell of love but only after its barbs were already sticking in my heart he was i know now the bastard of that great improvident artist rickmann ewart he brought the light of a lax world that at least had not turned its back upon beauty into the growing fermentation of my mind  i won his heart by a version of vathek and after that we were inseparable yarning friends we merged our intellectual stock so completely that i wonder sometimes how much i did not become ewart how much ewart is not vicariously and derivatively me  vii  and then when i had newly passed my fourteenth birthday came my tragic disgrace  it was in my midsummer holidays that the thing happened and it was through the honourable beatrice normandy she had come into my life as they say before i was twelve  she descended unexpectedly into a peaceful interlude that followed the annual going of those three great women she came into the old nursery upstairs and every day she had tea with us in the housekeepers room she was eight and she came with a nurse called nannie and to begin with i did not like her at all  nobody liked this irruption into the downstairs rooms the two gave troublea dire offence nannies sense of duty to her charge led to requests and demands that took my mothers breath away eggs at unusual times the reboiling of milk the rejection of an excellent milk puddingnot negotiated respectfully but dictated as of right nannie was a dark longfeatured taciturn woman in a grey dress she had a furtive inflexibility of manner that finally dismayed and crushed and overcame she conveyed she was under orderslike a greek tragedy she was that strange product of the old time a devoted trusted servant she had as it were banked all her pride and will with the greater more powerful people who employed her in return for a lifelong security of servitudethe bargain was nonetheless binding for being implicit finally they were to pension her and she would die the hated treasure of a boardinghouse she had built up in herself an enormous habit of reference to these upstairs people she had curbed down all discordant murmurings of her soul her very instincts were perverted or surrendered she was sexless her personal pride was all transferred she mothered another womans child with a hard joyless devotion that was at least entirely compatible with a stoical separation she treated us all as things that counted for nothing save to fetch and carry for her charge but the honourable beatrice could condescend  the queer chances of later years come between me and a distinctly separated memory of that childish face when i think of beatrice i think of her as i came to know her at a later time when at last i came to know her so well that indeed now i could draw her and show a hundred little delicate things you would miss in looking at her but even then i remember how i noted the infinite delicacy of her childish skin and the fine eyebrow finer than the finest feather that ever one felt on the breast of a bird she was one of those elfin rather precocious little girls quick coloured with dark hair naturally curling dusky hair that was sometimes astray over her eyes and eyes that were sometimes impishly dark and sometimes a clear brown yellow and from the very outset after a most cursory attention to rabbits she decided that the only really interesting thing at the teatable was myself  the elders talked in their formal dull waytelling nannie the trite old things about the park and the village that they told every one and beatrice watched me across the table with a pitiless little curiosity that made me uncomfortable  nannie she said pointing and nannie left a question of my mothers disregarded to attend to her is he a servant boy  sssh said nannie hes master ponderevo  is he a servant boy repeated beatrice  hes a schoolboy said my mother  then may i talk to him nannie  nannie surveyed me with brutal inhumanity you mustnt talk too much she said to her charge and cut cake into fingers for her  no she added decisively as beatrice made to speak  beatrice became malignant her eyes explored me with unjustifiable hostility hes got dirty hands she said stabbing at the forbidden fruit and theres a fray to his collar  then she gave herself up to cake with an appearance of entire forgetfulness of me that filled me with hate and a passionate desire to compel her to admire me and the next day before tea i did for the first time in my life freely without command or any compulsion wash my hands  so our acquaintance began and presently was deepened by a whim of hers she had a cold and was kept indoors and confronted nannie suddenly with the alternative of being hopelessly naughty which in her case involved a generous amount of screaming unsuitable for the ears of an elderly shaky rich aunt or having me up to the nursery to play with her all the afternoon nannie came downstairs and borrowed me in a careworn manner and i was handed over to the little creature as if i was some large variety of kitten i had never had anything to do with a little girl before i thought she was more beautiful and wonderful and bright than anything else could possibly be in life and she found me the gentlest of slavesthough at the same time as i made evident fairly strong and nannie was amazed to find the afternoon slip cheerfully and rapidly away she praised my manners to lady drew and to my mother who said she was glad to hear well of me and after that i played with beatrice several times the toys she had remain in my memory still as great splendid things gigantic to all my previous experience of toys and we even went to the great dolls house on the nursery landing to play discreetly with that the great dolls house that the prince regent had given sir harry drews firstborn who died at five that was a not ineffectual model of bladesover itself and contained eightyfive dolls and had cost hundreds of pounds i played under imperious direction with that toy of glory  i went back to school when that holiday was over dreaming of beautiful things and got ewart to talk to me of love and i made a great story out of the dolls house a story that taken over into ewarts hands speedily grew to an island dolls city all our own  one of the dolls i privately decided was like beatrice  one other holiday there was when i saw something of heroddly enough my memory of that second holiday in which she played a part is vagueand then came a gap of a year and then my disgrace  viii  now i sit down to write my story and tell over again things in their order i find for the first time how inconsecutive and irrational a thing the memory can be one recalls acts and cannot recall motives one recalls quite vividly moments that stand out inexplicablythings adrift joining on to nothing leading nowhere i think i must have seen beatrice and her halfbrother quite a number of times in my last holiday at bladesover but i really cannot recall more than a little of the quality of the circumstances that great crisis of my boyhood stands out very vividly as an effect as a sort of cardinal thing for me but when i look for details particularly details that led up to the crisisi cannot find them in any developing order at all this halfbrother archie garvell was a new factor in the affair i remember him clearly as a fairhaired supercilious looking weedilylank boy much taller than i but i should imagine very little heavier and that we hated each other by a sort of instinct from the beginning and yet i cannot remember my first meeting with him at all  looking back into these past thingsit is like rummaging in a neglected attic that has experienced the attentions of some whimsical robberi cannot even account for the presence of these children at bladesover they were i know among the innumerable cousins of lady drew and according to the theories of downstairs candidates for the ultimate possession of bladesover if they were their candidature was unsuccessful but that great place with all its faded splendour its fine furniture its large traditions was entirely at the old ladys disposition and i am inclined to think it is true that she used this fact to torment and dominate a number of eligible people lord osprey was among the number of these and she showed these hospitalities to his motherless child and stepchild partly no doubt because he was poor but quite as much i nowadays imagine in the dim hope of finding some affectionate or imaginative outcome of contact with them nannie had dropped out of the world this second time and beatrice was in the charge of an extremely amiable and ineffectual poor armyclass young woman whose name i never knew they were i think two remarkably illmanaged and enterprising children i seem to remember too that it was understood that i was not a fit companion for them and that our meetings had to be as unostentatious as possible it was beatrice who insisted upon our meeting  i am certain i knew quite a lot about love at fourteen and that i was quite as much in love with beatrice then as any impassioned adult could be and that beatrice was in her way in love with me it is part of the decent and useful pretences of our world that children of the age at which we were think nothing feel nothing know nothing of love it is wonderful what people the english are for keeping up pretences but indeed i cannot avoid telling that beatrice and i talked of love and kissed and embraced one another  i recall something of one talk under the overhanging bushes of the shrubberyi on the park side of the stone wall and the lady of my worship a little inelegantly astride thereon inelegantly do i say you should have seen the sweet imp as i remember her just her poise on the wall comes suddenly clear before me and behind her the light various branches of the bushes of the shrubbery that my feet might not profane and far away and high behind her dim and stately the cornice of the great facade of bladesover rose against the dappled sky our talk must have been serious and businesslike for we were discussing my social position  i dont love archie she had said apropos of nothing and then in a whisper leaning forward with the hair about her face i love you  but she had been a little pressing to have it clear that i was not and could not be a servant  youll never be a servantever  i swore that very readily and it is a vow i have kept by nature  what will you be said she  i ran my mind hastily over the professions  will you be a soldier she asked  and be bawled at by duffers no fear said i leave that to the ploughboys  but an officer  i dont know i said evading a shameful difficulty  id rather go into the navy  wouldnt you like to fight  id like to fight i said but a common soldier its no honour to have to be told to fight and to be looked down upon while you do it and how could i be an officer  couldnt you be she said and looked at me doubtfully and the spaces of the social system opened between us  then as became a male of spirit i took upon myself to brag and lie my way through this trouble i said i was a poor man and poor men went into the navy that i knew mathematics which no army officer did and i claimed nelson for an exemplar and spoke very highly of my outlook upon blue water he loved lady hamilton i said although she was a ladyand i will love you  we were somewhere near that when the egregious governess became audible calling beeeeatrice beeeeeatrice  snifty beast said my lady and tried to get on with the conversation but that governess made things impossible  come here said my lady suddenly holding out a grubby hand and i went very close to her and she put her little head down upon the wall until her black fog of hair tickled my cheek  you are my humble faithful lover she demanded in a whisper her warm flushed face near touching mine and her eyes very dark and lustrous  i am your humble faithful lover i whispered back  and she put her arm about my head and put out her lips and we kissed and boy though i was i was all atremble so we two kissed for the first time  beeeeeeatrice fearfully close  my lady had vanished with one wild kick of her blackstocking leg a moment after i heard her sustaining the reproaches of her governess and explaining her failure to answer with an admirable lucidity and disingenuousness  i felt it was unnecessary for me to be seen just then and i vanished guiltily round the corner into the west wood and so to lovedreams and singlehanded play wandering along one of those meandering bracken valleys that varied bladesover park and that day and for many days that kiss upon my lips was a seal and by night the seed of dreams  then i remember an expedition we madeshe i and her halfbrotherinto those west woodsthey two were supposed to be playing in the shrubberyand how we were indians there and made a wigwam out of a pile of beech logs and how we stalked deer crept near and watched rabbits feeding in a glade and almost got a squirrel it was play seasoned with plentiful disputing between me and young garvell for each firmly insisted upon the leading roles and only my wider readingi had read ten stories to his onegave me the ascendency over him also i scored over him by knowing how to find the eagle in a bracken stem and somehowi dont remember what led to it at alli and beatrice two hot and ruffled creatures crept in among the tall bracken and hid from him the great fronds rose above us five feet or more and as i had learnt how to wriggle through that undergrowth with the minimum of betrayal by tossing greenery above i led the way the ground under bracken is beautifully clear and faintly scented in warm weather the stems come up black and then green if you crawl flat it is a tropical forest in miniature i led the way and beatrice crawled behind and then as the green of the further glade opened before us stopped she crawled up to me her hot little face came close to mine once more she looked and breathed close to me and suddenly she flung her arm about my neck and dragged me to earth beside her and kissed me and kissed me again we kissed we embraced and kissed again all without a word we desisted we stared and hesitatedthen in a suddenly damped mood and a little perplexed at ourselves crawled out to be presently run down and caught in the tamest way by archie  that comes back very clearly to me and other vague memoriesi know old hall and his gun out shooting at jackdaws came into our common experiences but i dont remember how and then at last abruptly our fight in the warren stands out the warren like most places in england that have that name was not particularly a warren it was a long slope of thorns and beeches through which a path ran and made an alternative route to the downhill carriage road between bladesover and ropedean i dont know how we three got there but i have an uncertain fancy it was connected with a visit paid by the governess to the ropedean vicarage people but suddenly archie and i in discussing a game fell into a dispute for beatrice i had made him the fairest offer i was to be a spanish nobleman she was to be my wife and he was to be a tribe of indians trying to carry her off it seems to me a fairly attractive offer to a boy to be a whole tribe of indians with a chance of such a booty but archie suddenly took offence  no he said we cant have that  cant have what  you cant be a gentleman because you arent and you cant play beatrice is your wife itsits impertinent  but i said and looked at her  some earlier grudge in the days affairs must have been in archies mind we let you play with us said archie but we cant have things like that  what rot said beatrice he can if he likes  but he carried his point i let him carry it and only began to grow angry three or four minutes later then we were still discussing play and disputing about another game nothing seemed right for all of us  we dont want you to play with us at all said archie  yes we do said beatrice  he drops his aitches like anything  no e doesnt said i in the heat of the moment  there you go he cried e he says e e e  he pointed a finger at me he had struck to the heart of my shame i made the only possible reply by a rush at him hello he cried at my blackavised attack he dropped back into an attitude that had some style in it parried my blow got back at my cheek and laughed with surprise and relief at his own success whereupon i became a thing of murderous rage he could box as well or better than ihe had yet to realise i knew anything of that at allbut i had fought once or twice to a finish with bare fists i was used to inflicting and enduring savage hurting and i doubt if he had ever fought i hadnt fought ten seconds before i felt this softness in him realised all that quality of modern upperclass england that never goes to the quick that hedges about rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate comminution of honour that claims credit for things demonstrably half done he seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others were going to matter that i ought to give in when presently my lip bled and dripped blood upon my clothes so before we had been at it a minute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts and i was knocking him about almost as i wanted to do and demanding breathlessly and fiercely after our school manner whether he had had enough not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was equally impossible for him to either buckup and beat me or give in  i have a very distinct impression of beatrice dancing about us during the affair in a state of unladylike appreciation but i was too preoccupied to hear much of what she was saying but she certainly backed us both and i am inclined to think nowit may be the disillusionment of my ripened yearswhichever she thought was winning  then young garvell giving way before my slogging stumbled and fell over a big flint and i still following the tradition of my class and school promptly flung myself on him to finish him we were busy with each other on the ground when we became aware of a dreadful interruption  shut up you fool said archie  oh lady drew i heard beatrice cry theyre fighting theyre fighting something awful  i looked over my shoulder archies wish to get up became irresistible and my resolve to go on with him vanished altogether  i became aware of the two old ladies presences of black and purple silk and fur and shining dark things they had walked up through the warren while the horses took the hill easily and so had come upon us beatrice had gone to them at once with an air of taking refuge and stood beside and a little behind them we both rose dejectedly the two old ladies were evidently quite dreadfully shocked and peering at us with their poor old eyes and never had i seen such a tremblement in lady drews lorgnettes  youve never been fighting said lady drew  you have been fighting  it wasnt proper fighting snapped archie with accusing eyes on me  its mrs ponderevos george said miss somerville so adding a conviction for ingratitude to my evident sacrilege  how could he dare cried lady drew becoming very awful  he broke the rules said archie sobbing for breath i slipped andhe hit me while i was down he knelt on me  how could you dare said lady drew  i produced an experienced handkerchief rolled up into a tight ball and wiped the blood from my chin but i offered no explanation of my daring among other things that prevented that i was too short of breath  he didnt fight fair sobbed archie  beatrice from behind the old ladies regarded me intently and without hostility i am inclined to think the modification of my face through the damage to my lip interested her it became dimly apparent to my confused intelligence that i must not say these two had been playing with me that would not be after the rules of their game i resolved in this difficult situation upon a sulky silence and to take whatever consequences might follow  ix  the powers of justice in bladesover made an extraordinary mess of my case  i have regretfully to admit that the honourable beatrice normandy did at the age of ten betray me abandon me and lie most abominably about me she was as a matter of fact panicstricken about me conscience stricken too she bolted from the very thought of my being her affianced lover and so forth from the faintest memory of kissing she was indeed altogether disgraceful and human in her betrayal she and her halfbrother lied in perfect concord and i was presented as a wanton assailant of my social betters they were waiting about in the warren when i came up and spoke to them etc  on the whole i now perceive lady drews decisions were in the light of the evidence reasonable and merciful  they were conveyed to me by my mother who was i really believe even more shocked by the grossness of my social insubordination than lady drew she dilated on her ladyships kindnesses to me on the effrontery and wickedness of my procedure and so came at last to the terms of my penance you must go up to young mr garvell and beg his pardon  i wont beg his pardon i said speaking for the first time  my mother paused incredulous  i folded my arms on her tablecloth and delivered my wicked little ultimatum i wont beg his pardon nohow i said see  then you will have to go off to your uncle frapp at chatham  i dont care where i have to go or what i have to do i wont beg his pardon i said  and i didnt  after that i was one against the world perhaps in my mothers heart there lurked some pity for me but she did not show it she took the side of the young gentleman she tried hard she tried very hard to make me say i was sorry i had struck him sorry  i couldnt explain  so i went into exile in the dogcart to redwood station with jukes the coachman coldly silent driving me and all my personal belongings in a small american cloth portmanteau behind  i felt i had much to embitter me the game had and the beginnings of fairness by any standards i knew but the thing that embittered me most was that the honourable beatrice normandy should have repudiated and fled from me as though i was some sort of leper and not even have taken a chance or so to give me a goodbye she might have done that anyhow supposing i had told on her but the son of a servant counts as a servant she had forgotten and now remembered  i solaced myself with some extraordinary dream of coming back to bladesover stern powerful after the fashion of coriolanus i do not recall the details but i have no doubt i displayed great magnanimity  well anyhow i never said i was sorry for pounding young garvell and i am not sorry to this day   chapter the second  of my launch into the world and the last i saw of bladesover  i  when i was thus banished from bladesover house as it was then thought for good and all i was sent by my mother in a vindictive spirit first to her cousin nicodemus frapp and then as a fully indentured apprentice to my uncle ponderevo  i ran away from the care of my cousin nicodemus back to bladesover house  my cousin nicodemus frapp was a baker in a back streeta slum ratherjust off that miserable narrow mean high road that threads those exquisite beads rochester and chatham he was i must admit a shock to me much dominated by a young plump prolific malingering wife a bent slowmoving unwilling dark man with flour in his hair and eyelashes in the lines of his face and the seams of his coat ive never had a chance to correct my early impression of him and he still remains an almost dreadful memory a sort of caricature of incompetent simplicity as i remember him indeed he presented the servile tradition perfected he had no pride in his person fine clothes and dressing up wasnt for the likes of him so that he got his wife who was no artist at it to cut his black hair at irregular intervals and let his nails become disagreeable to the fastidious eye he had no pride in his business nor any initiative his only virtues were not doing certain things and hard work your uncle said my motherall grownup cousins were uncles by courtesy among the victorian middleclassisnt much to look at or talk to but hes a good hardworking man there was a sort of base honourableness about toil however needless in that system of inversion another point of honour was to rise at or before dawn and then laboriously muddle about  it was very distinctly impressed on my mind that the good hardworking man would have thought it fallallish to own a pocket handkerchief poor old frappdirty and crushed by product of bladesovers magnificence he made no fight against the world at all he was floundering in small debts that were not so small but that finally they overwhelmed him whenever there was occasion for any exertion his wife fell back upon pains and her condition and god sent them many children most of whom died and so by their coming and going gave a double exercise in the virtues of submission  resignation to gods will was the common device of these people in the face of every duty and every emergency there were no books in the house i doubt if either of them had retained the capacity for reading consecutively for more than a minute or so and it was with amazement that day after day over and above stale bread one beheld food and again more food amidst the litter that held permanent session on the livingroom table  one might have doubted if either of them felt discomfort in this dusty darkness of existence if it was not that they did visibly seek consolation they sought this and found it of a sunday not in strong drink and raving but in imaginary draughts of blood they met with twenty or thirty other darkened and unclean people all dressed in dingy colours that would not show the dirt in a little brickbuilt chapel equipped with a spavined roarer of a harmonium and there solaced their minds on the thought that all that was fair and free in life all that struggled all that planned and made all pride and beauty and honour all fine and enjoyable things were irrevocably damned to everlasting torments they were the selfappointed confidants of gods mockery of his own creation so at any rate they stick in my mind vaguer and yet hardly less agreeable than this cosmic jest this coming yah clever and general serving out and showing up of the lucky the bold and the cheerful was their own predestination to glory       there is a fountain filled with blood      drawn from emmanuels veins  so they sang i hear the drone and wheeze of that hymn now i hated them with the bitter uncharitable condemnation of boyhood and a twinge of that hate comes back to me as i write the words the sounds and then the scene return these obscure undignified people a fat woman with asthma an old welsh milkseller with a tumour on his bald head who was the intellectual leader of the sect a hugevoiced haberdasher with a big black beard a whitefaced extraordinarily pregnant woman his wife a spectacled rate collector with a bent back i hear the talk about souls the strange battered old phrases that were coined ages ago in the seaports of the sundry levant of balm of gilead and manna in the desert of gourds that give shade and water in a thirsty land i recall again the way in which at the conclusion of the service the talk remained pious in form but became medical in substance and how the women got together for obstetric whisperings i as a boy did not matter and might overhear  if bladesover is my key for the explanation of england i think my invincible persuasion that i understand russia was engendered by the circle of uncle frapp  i slept in a dingy sheeted bed with the two elder survivors of frapp fecundity and spent my week days in helping in the laborious disorder of the shop and bakehouse in incidental deliveries of bread and so forth and in parrying the probings of my uncle into my relations with the blood and his confidential explanations that ten shillings a weekwhich was what my mother paid himwas not enough to cover my accommodation he was very anxious to keep that but also he wanted more there were neither books nor any seat nor corner in that house where reading was possible no newspaper ever brought the clash of worldly things into its heavenward seclusion horror of it all grew in me daily and whenever i could i escaped into the streets and tramped about chatham the news shops appealed to me particularly one saw there smudgy illustrated sheets the police news in particular in which vilely drawn pictures brought home to the dullest intelligence an interminable succession of squalid crimes women murdered and put into boxes buried under floors old men bludgeoned at midnight by robbers people thrust suddenly out of trains happy lovers shot vitrioled and so forth by rivals i got my first glimpse of the life of pleasure in foully drawn pictures of police raids on this and that interspersed with these sheets were others in which sloper the urban john bull had his fling with gin bottle and obese umbrella or the kindly empty faces of the royal family appeared and reappeared visiting this opening that getting married getting offspring lying in state doing everything but anything a wonderful goodmeaning impenetrable race apart  i have never revisited chatham the impression it has left on my mind is one of squalid compression unlit by any gleam of a maturer charity all its effects arranged themselves as antithetical to the bladesover effects they confirmed and intensified all that bladesover suggested bladesover declared itself to be the land to be essentially england i have already told how its airy spaciousness its wide dignity seemed to thrust village church and vicarage into corners into a secondary and conditional significance here one gathered the corollary of that since the whole wide country of kent was made up of contiguous bladesovers and for the gentlefolk the surplus of population all who were not good tenants nor good labourers church of england submissive and respectful were necessarily thrust together jostled out of sight to fester as they might in this place that had the colours and even the smells of a wellpacked dustbin they should be grateful even for that that one felt was the theory of it all  and i loafed about this wilderness of crowded dinginess with young receptive wideopen eyes and through the blessing or curse of some fairy godmother of mine asking and asking again but after all why  i wandered up through rochester once and had a glimpse of the stour valley above the town all horrible with cement works and foully smoking chimneys and rows of workmens cottages minute ugly uncomfortable and grimy so i had my first intimation of how industrialism must live in a landlords land i spent some hours too in the streets that give upon the river drawn by the spell of the sea but i saw barges and ships stripped of magic and mostly devoted to cement ice timber and coal the sailors looked to me gross and slovenly men and the shipping struck me as clumsy ugly old and dirty i discovered that most sails dont fit the ships that hoist them and that there may be as pitiful and squalid a display of poverty with a vessel as with a man when i saw colliers unloading watched the workers in the hold filling up silly little sacks and the succession of blackened halfnaked men that ran to and fro with these along a plank over a thirtyfoot drop into filth and mud i was first seized with admiration of their courage and toughness and then but after all why and the stupid ugliness of all this waste of muscle and endurance came home to me among other things it obviously wasted and deteriorated the coal and i had imagined great things of the sea  well anyhow for a time that vocation was stilled  but such impressions came into my leisure and of that i had no excess most of my time was spent doing things for uncle frapp and my evenings and nights perforce in the company of the two eldest of my cousins he was errand boy at an oil shop and fervently pious and of him i saw nothing until the evening except at meals the other was enjoying the midsummer holidays without any great elation a singularly thin and abject stunted creature he was whose chief liveliness was to pretend to be a monkey and who i am now convinced had some secret disease that drained his vitality away if i met him now i should think him a pitiful little creature and be extremely sorry for him then i felt only a wondering aversion he sniffed horribly he was tired out by a couple of miles of loafing he never started any conversation and he seemed to prefer his own company to mine his mother poor woman said he was the thoughtful one  serious trouble came suddenly out of a conversation we held in bed one night some particularly pious phrase of my elder cousins irritated me extremely and i avowed outright my entire disbelief in the whole scheme of revealed religion i had never said a word about my doubts to any one before except to ewart who had first evolved them i had never settled my doubts until at this moment when i spoke but it came to me then that the whole scheme of salvation of the frappes was not simply doubtful but impossible i fired this discovery out into the darkness with the greatest promptitude  my abrupt denials certainly scared my cousin amazingly  at first they could not understand what i was saying and when they did i fully believe they expected an instant answer in thunderbolts and flames they gave me more room in the bed forthwith and then the elder sat up and expressed his sense of my awfulness i was already a little frightened at my temerity but when he asked me categorically to unsay what i had said what could i do but confirm my repudiation  theres no hell i said and no eternal punishment no god would be such a fool as that  my elder cousin cried aloud in horror and the younger lay scared but listening then you mean said my elder cousin when at last he could bring himself to argue you might do just as you liked  if you were cad enough said i  our little voices went on interminably and at one stage my cousin got out of bed and made his brother do likewise and knelt in the night dimness and prayed at me that i found trying but i held out valiantly forgive him said my cousin he knows not what he sayeth  you can pray if you like i said but if youre going to cheek me in your prayers i draw the line  the last i remember of that great discussion was my cousin deploring the fact that he should ever sleep in the same bed with an infidel  the next day he astonished me by telling the whole business to his father this was quite outside all my codes uncle nicodemus sprang it upon me at the midday meal  you been sayin queer things george he said abruptly you better mind what youre saying  what did he say father said mrs frapp  things i couldnt repeat said he  what things i asked hotly  ask im said my uncle pointing with his knife to his informant and making me realise the nature of my offence my aunt looked at the witness not she framed a question  wuss said my uncle blarsphemy  my aunt couldnt touch another mouthful i was already a little troubled in my conscience by my daring and now i began to feel the black enormity of the course upon which i had embarked  i was only talking sense i said  i had a still more dreadful moment when presently i met my cousin in the brick alley behind the yard that led back to his grocers shop  you sneak i said and smacked his face hard forthwith now then said i  he started back astonished and alarmed his eyes met mine and i saw a sudden gleam of resolution he turned his other cheek to me  it it he saidit it ill forgive you  i felt i had never encountered a more detestable way of evading a licking i shoved him against the wall and left him there forgiving me and went back into the house  you better not speak to your cousins george said my aunt till youre in a better state of mind  i became an outcast forthwith at supper that night a gloomy silence was broken by my cousin saying  e it me for telling you and i turned the other cheek muvver  es got the evil one beind im now a ridin on is back said my aunt to the grave discomfort of the eldest girl who sat beside me  after supper my uncle in a few illchosen words prayed me to repent before i slept  suppose you was took in your sleep george he said whered you be then you jest think of that me boy by this time i was thoroughly miserable and frightened and this suggestion unnerved me dreadfully but i kept up an impenitent front to wake in ell said uncle nicodemus in gentle tones you dont want to wake in ell george burnin and screamin for ever do you you wouldnt like that  he tried very hard to get me to jest ave a look at the bakeouse fire before i retired it might move you he said  i was awake longest that night my cousins slept the sleep of faith on either side of me i decided i would whisper my prayers and stopped midway because i was ashamed and perhaps also because i had an idea one didnt square god like that  no i said with a sudden confidence damn me if youre coward enough but youre not no you couldnt be  i woke my cousins up with emphatic digs and told them as much triumphantly and went very peacefully to sleep with my act of faith accomplished  i slept not only through that night but for all my nights since then so far as any fear of divine injustice goes i sleep soundly and shall i know to the end of things that declaration was an epoch in my spiritual life  ii  but i didnt expect to have the whole meeting on sunday turned on to me  it was it all comes back to me that convergence of attention even the faint leathery smell of its atmosphere returns and the coarse feel of my aunts black dress beside me in contact with my hand i see again the old welsh milkman wrestling with me they all wrestled with me by prayer or exhortation and i was holding out stoutly though convinced now by the contagion of their universal conviction that by doing so i was certainly and hopelessly damned i felt that they were right that god was probably like them and that on the whole it didnt matter and to simplify the business thoroughly i had declared i didnt believe anything at all they confuted me by texts from scripture which i now perceive was an illegitimate method of reply when i got home still impenitent and eternally lost and secretly very lonely and miserable and alarmed uncle nicodemus docked my sunday pudding  one person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of wrath and that was the younger frapp he came up to me in the afternoon while i was confined upstairs with a bible and my own thoughts  ello he said and fretted about  dyou mean to say there isntno one he said funking the word  no one  no one watching yeralways  why should there be i asked  you cant elp thoughts said my cousin anyhow you mean he stopped hovering i spose i oughtnt to be talking to you  he hesitated and flitted away with a guilty back glance over his shoulder  the following week made life quite intolerable for me these people forced me at last into an atheism that terrified me when i learnt that next sunday the wrestling was to be resumed my courage failed me altogether  i happened upon a map of kent in a stationers window on saturday and that set me thinking of one form of release i studied it intently for half an hour perhaps on saturday night got a route list of villages well fixed in my memory and got up and started for bladesover about five on sunday morning while my two bed mates were still fast asleep  iii  i remember something but not so much of it as i should like to recall of my long tramp to bladesover house the distance from chatham is almost exactly seventeen miles and it took me until nearly one it was very interesting and i do not think i was very fatigued though i got rather pinched by one boot  the morning must have been very clear because i remember that near itchinstow hall i looked back and saw the estuary of the thames that river that has since played so large a part in my life but at the time i did not know it was the thames i thought this great expanse of mud flats and water was the sea which i had never yet seen nearly and out upon it stood ships sailing ships and a steamer or so going up to london or down out into the great seas of the world i stood for a long time watching these and thinking whether after all i should not have done better to have run away to sea  the nearer i drew to bladesover the more doubtful i grew of the duality of my reception and the more i regretted that alternative i suppose it was the dirty clumsiness of the shipping i had seen nearly that put me out of mind of that i took a short cut through the warren across the corner of the main park to intercept the people from the church i wanted to avoid meeting any one before i met my mother and so i went to a place where the path passed between banks and without exactly hiding stood up among the bushes this place among other advantages eliminated any chance of seeing lady drew who would drive round by the carriage road  standing up to waylay in this fashion i had a queer feeling of brigandage as though i was some intrusive sort of bandit among these orderly things it is the first time i remember having that outlaw feeling distinctly a feeling that has played a large part in my subsequent life i felt there existed no place for me that i had to drive myself in  presently down the hill the servants appeared straggling by twos and threes first some of the garden people and the butlers wife with them then the two laundry maids odd inseparable old creatures then the first footman talking to the butlers little girl and at last walking grave and breathless beside old ann and miss fison the black figure of my mother  my boyish mind suggested the adoption of a playful form of appearance cooee mother said i coming out against the sky cooee  my mother looked up went very white and put her hand to her bosom  i suppose there was a fearful fuss about me and of course i was quite unable to explain my reappearance but i held out stoutly i wont go back to chatham ill drown myself first the next day my mother carried me off to wimblehurst took me fiercely and aggressively to an uncle i had never heard of before near though the place was to us she gave me no word as to what was to happen and i was too subdued by her manifest wrath and humiliation at my last misdemeanour to demand information i dont for one moment think lady drew was nice about me the finality of my banishment was endorsed and underlined and stamped home i wished very much now that i had run away to sea in spite of the coal dust and squalour rochester had revealed to me perhaps over seas one came to different lands   iv  i do not remember much of my journey to wimblehurst with my mother except the image of her as sitting bolt upright as rather disdaining the thirdclass carriage in which we traveled and how she looked away from me out of the window when she spoke of my uncle i have not seen your uncle she said since he was a boy she added grudgingly then he was supposed to be clever  she took little interest in such qualities as cleverness  he married about three years ago and set up for himself in wimblehurst so i suppose she had some money  she mused on scenes she had long dismissed from her mind teddy she said at last in the tone of one who has been feeling in the dark and finds he was called teddy about your age now he must be twentysix or seven  i thought of my uncle as teddy directly i saw him there was something in his personal appearance that in the light of that memory phrased itself at once as teddinessa certain teddidity to describe it in and other terms is more difficult it is nimbleness without grace and alertness without intelligence he whisked out of his shop upon the pavement a short figure in grey and wearing grey carpet slippers one had a sense of a young fattish face behind gilt glasses wiry hair that stuck up and forward over the forehead an irregular nose that had its aquiline moments and that the body betrayed an equatorial laxity an incipient bow window as the image goes he jerked out of the shop came to a stand on the pavement outside regarded something in the window with infinite appreciation stroked his chin and as abruptly shot sideways into the door again charging through it as it were behind an extended hand  that must be him said my mother catching at her breath  we came past the window whose contents i was presently to know by heart a very ordinary chemists window except that there was a frictional electrical machine an air pump and two or three tripods and retorts replacing the customary blue yellow and red bottles above there was a plaster of paris horse to indicate veterinary medicines among these breakables and below were scent packets and diffusers and sponges and sodawater syphons and suchlike things only in the middle there was a rubricated card very neatly painted by hand with these words        buy ponderevos cough linctus now      now      why      twopence cheaper than in winter      you store apples why not the medicine      you are bound to need  in which appeal i was to recognise presently my uncles distinctive note  my uncles face appeared above a card of infants comforters in the glass pane of the door i perceived his eyes were brown and that his glasses creased his nose it was manifest he did not know us from adam a stare of scrutiny allowed an expression of commercial deference to appear in front of it and my uncle flung open the door  you dont know me panted my mother  my uncle would not own he did not but his curiosity was manifest my mother sat down on one of the little chairs before the soap and patent medicinepiled counter and her lips opened and closed  a glass of water madam said my uncle waved his hand in a sort of curve and shot away  my mother drank the water and spoke that boy she said takes after his father he grows more like him every day and so i have brought him to you  his father madam  george  for a moment the chemist was still at a loss he stood behind the counter with the glass my mother had returned to him in his hand then comprehension grew  by gosh he said lord he cried his glasses fell off he disappeared replacing them behind a pile of boxedup bottles of blood mixture eleven thousand virgins i heard him cry the glass was banged down oriental gums  he shot away out of the shop through some masked door one heard his voice susan susan  then he reappeared with an extended hand well how are you he said i was never so surprised in my life fancy you  he shook my mothers impassive hand and then mine very warmly holding his glasses on with his left forefinger  come right in he criedcome right in better late than never and led the way into the parlour behind the shop  after bladesover that apartment struck me as stuffy and petty but it was very comfortable in comparison with the frapp livingroom it had a faint disintegrating smell of meals about it and my most immediate impression was of the remarkable fact that something was hung about or wrapped round or draped over everything there was brightpatterned muslin round the gasbracket in the middle of the room round the mirror over the mantel stuff with ballfringe along the mantel and casing in the fireplacei first saw ballfringe hereand even the lamp on the little bureau wore a shade like a large muslin hat the tablecloth had ballfringe and so had the window curtains and the carpet was a bed of roses there were little cupboards on either side of the fireplace and in the recesses illmade shelves packed with books and enriched with pinked american cloth there was a dictionary lying face downward on the table and the open bureau was littered with foolscap paper and the evidences of recently abandoned toil my eye caught the ponderevo patent flat a machine you can live in written in large firm letters my uncle opened a little door like a cupboard door in the corner of this room and revealed the narrowest twist of staircase i had ever set eyes upon susan he bawled again wantje some one to see you surprisin  there came an inaudible reply and a sudden loud bump over our heads as of some article of domestic utility pettishly flung aside then the cautious steps of someone descending the twist and then my aunt appeared in the doorway with her hand upon the jamb  its aunt ponderevo cried my uncle georges wifeand shes brought over her son his eye roamed about the room he darted to the bureau with a sudden impulse and turned the sheet about the patent flat face down then he waved his glasses at us you know susan my elder brother george i told you about im lots of times  he fretted across to the hearthrug and took up a position there replaced his glasses and coughed  my aunt susan seemed to be taking it in she was then rather a pretty slender woman of twentythree or four i suppose and i remember being struck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear freshness of her complexion she had little features a button nose a pretty chin and a long graceful neck that stuck out of her pale blue cotton morning dress there was a look of halfassumed perplexity on her face a little quizzical wrinkle of the brow that suggested a faintly amused attempt to follow my uncles mental operations a vain attempt and a certain hopelessness that had in succession become habitual she seemed to be saying oh lord whats he giving me this time and as came to know her better i detected as a complication of her effort of apprehension a subsidiary riddle to whats he giving me and that wasto borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language is it keeps she looked at my mother and me and back to her husband again  you know he said george  well she said to my mother descending the last three steps of the staircase and holding out her hand youre welcome though its a surprise i cant ask you to have anything im afraid for there isnt anything in the house she smiled and looked at her husband banteringly unless he makes up something with his old chemicals which hes quite equal to doing  my mother shook hands stiffly and told me to kiss my aunt  well lets all sit down said my uncle suddenly whistling through his clenched teeth and briskly rubbing his hands together he put up a chair for my mother raised the blind of the little window lowered it again and returned to his hearthrug im sure he said as one who decides im very glad to see you  v  as they talked i gave my attention pretty exclusively to my uncle  i noted him in great detail i remember now his partially unbuttoned waistcoat as though something had occurred to distract him as he did it up and a little cut upon his chin i liked a certain humour in his eyes i watched too with the fascination that things have for an observant boy the play of his lipsthey were a little oblique and there was something slipshod if one may strain a word so far about his mouth so that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the coming and going of a curious expression triumphant in quality it was upon his face as he talked he fingered his glasses which did not seem to fit his nose fretted with things in his waistcoat pockets or put his hands behind him looked over our heads and ever and again rose to his toes and dropped back on his heels he had a way of drawing air in at times through his teeth that gave a whispering zest to his speech its a sound i can only represent as a soft zzzz  he did most of the talking my mother repeated what she had already said in the shop i have brought george over to you and then desisted for a time from the real business in hand you find this a comfortable house she asked and this being affirmed it looksvery convenient not too big to be a troubleno you like wimblehurst i suppose  my uncle retorted with some inquiries about the great people of bladesover and my mother answered in the character of a personal friend of lady drews the talk hung for a time and then my uncle embarked upon a dissertation upon wimblehurst  this place he began isnt of course quite the place i ought to be in  my mother nodded as though she had expected that  it gives me no scope he went on its deadandalive nothing happens  hes always wanting something to happen said my aunt susan some day hell get a shower of things and theyll be too much for him  not they said my uncle buoyantly  do you find businessslack asked my mother  oh one rubs along but theres no developmentno growth they just come along here and buy pills when they want emand a horseball or such theyve got to be ill before theres a prescription that sort they are you cant get em to launch out you cant get em to take up anything new for instance ive been trying latelyinduce them to buy their medicines in advance and in larger quantities but they wont look for it then i tried to float a little notion of mine sort of an insurance scheme for colds you pay so much a week and when youve got a cold you get a bottle of cough linctus so long as you can produce a substantial sniff see but lord theyve no capacity for ideas they dont catch on no jump about the place no life livethey trickle and what one has to do here is to trickle toozzzz  ah said my mother  it doesnt suit me said my uncle im the cascading sort  george was that said my mother after a pondering moment  my aunt susan took up the parable with an affectionate glance at her husband  hes always trying to make his old business jump she said always putting fresh cards in the window or getting up to something youd hardly believe it makes me jump sometimes  but it does no good said my uncle  it does no good said his wife its not his miloo  presently they came upon a wide pause  from the beginning of their conversation there had been the promise of this pause and i pricked my ears i knew perfectly what was bound to come they were going to talk of my father i was enormously strengthened in my persuasion when i found my mothers eyes resting thoughtfully upon me in the silence and than my uncle looked at me and then my aunt i struggled unavailingly to produce an expression of meek stupidity  i think said my uncle that george will find it more amusing to have a turn in the marketplace than to sit here talking with us theres a pair of stocks there georgevery interesting oldfashioned stocks  i dont mind sitting here i said  my uncle rose and in the most friendly way led me through the shop he stood on his doorstep and jerked amiable directions to me  aint it sleepy george eh theres the butchers dog over there asleep in the roadhalf an hour from midday if the last trump sounded i dont believe it would wake nobody would wake the chaps up there in the churchyardtheyd just turn over and say naaryou dont catch us you dont see well youll find the stocks just round that corner  he watched me out of sight  so i never heard what they said about my father after all  vi  when i returned my uncle had in some remarkable way become larger and central thachu george he cried when the shopdoor bell sounded come right through and i found him as it were in the chairmans place before the draped grate  the three of them regarded me  we have been talking of making you a chemist george said my uncle  my mother looked at me i had hoped she said that lady drew would have done something for him she stopped  in what way said my uncle  she might have spoken to some one got him into something perhaps she had the servants invincible persuasion that all good things are done by patronage  he is not the sort of boy for whom things are done she added dismissing these dreams he doesnt accommodate himself when he thinks lady drew wishes a thing he seems not to wish it towards mr redgrave too he has beendisrespectfulhe is like his father  whos mr redgrave  the vicar  a bit independent said my uncle briskly  disobedient said my mother he has no idea of his place he seems to think he can get on by slighting people and flouting them hell learn perhaps before it is too late  my uncle stroked his cut chin and me have you learnt any latin he asked abruptly  i said i had not  hell have to learn a little latin he explained to my mother to qualify hm he could go down to the chap at the grammar school hereits just been routed into existence again by the charity commissioners and have lessons  what me learn latin i cried with emotion  a little he said  ive always wanted i said and latin  i had long been obsessed by the idea that having no latin was a disadvantage in the world and archie garvell had driven the point of this pretty earnestly home the literature i had read at bladesover had all tended that way latin had had a quality of emancipation for me that i find it difficult to convey and suddenly when i had supposed all learning was at an end for me i heard this  its no good to you of course said my uncle except to pass exams with but there you are  youll have to learn latin because you have to learn latin said my mother not because you want to and afterwards you will have to learn all sorts of other things  the idea that i was to go on learning that to read and master the contents of books was still to be justifiable as a duty overwhelmed all other facts i had had it rather clear in my mind for some weeks that all that kind of opportunity might close to me for ever i began to take a lively interest in this new project  then shall i live here i asked with you and study as well as work in the shop  thats the way of it said my uncle  i parted from my mother that day in a dream so sudden and important was this new aspect of things to me i was to learn latin now that the humiliation of my failure at bladesover was past for her now that she had a little got over her first intense repugnance at this resort to my uncle and contrived something that seemed like a possible provision for my future the tenderness natural to a parting far more significant than any of our previous partings crept into her manner  she sat in the train to return i remember and i stood at the open door of her compartment and neither of us knew how soon we should cease for ever to be a trouble to one another  you must be a good boy george she said you must learn and you mustnt set yourself up against those who are above you and better than you or envy them  no mother i said  i promised carelessly her eyes were fixed upon me i was wondering whether i could by any means begin latin that night  something touched her heart then some thought some memory perhaps some premonition the solitary porter began slamming carriage doors  george she said hastily almost shamefully kiss me  i stepped up into her compartment as she bent downward  she caught me in her arms quite eagerly she pressed me to hera strange thing for her to do i perceived her eyes were extraordinarily bright and then this brightness burst along the lower lids and rolled down her cheeks  for the first and last time in my life i saw my mothers tears then she had gone leaving me discomforted and perplexed forgetting for a time even that i was to learn latin thinking of my mother as of something new and strange  the thing recurred though i sought to dismiss it it stuck itself into my memory against the day of fuller understanding poor proud habitual sternly narrow soul poor difficult and misunderstanding son it was the first time that ever it dawned upon me that my mother also might perhaps feel  vii  my mother died suddenly and it was thought by lady drew inconsiderately the following spring her ladyship instantly fled to folkestone with miss somerville and fison until the funeral should be over and my mothers successor installed  my uncle took me over to the funeral i remember there was a sort of prolonged crisis in the days preceding this because directly he heard of my loss he had sent a pair of check trousers to the judkins people in london to be dyed black and they did not come back in time he became very excited on the third day and sent a number of increasingly fiery telegrams without any result whatever and succumbed next morning with a very ill grace to my aunt susans insistence upon the resources of his dresssuit in my memory those black legs of his in a particularly thin and shiny black clothfor evidently his dresssuit dated from adolescent and slenderer daysstraddle like the colossus of rhodes over my approach to my mothers funeral moreover i was inconvenienced and distracted by a silk hat he had bought me my first silk hat much ennobled as his was also by a deep mourning band  i remember but rather indistinctly my mothers white paneled housekeepers room and the touch of oddness about it that she was not there and the various familiar faces made strange by black and i seem to recall the exaggerated selfconsciousness that arose out of their focussed attention no doubt the sense of the new silk hat came and went and came again in my emotional chaos then something comes out clear and sorrowful rises out clear and sheer from among all these rather base and inconsequent things and once again i walk before all the other mourners close behind her coffin as it is carried along the churchyard path to her grave with the old vicars slow voice saying regretfully and unconvincingly above me triumphant solemn things  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die  never die the day was a high and glorious morning in spring and all the trees were budding and bursting into green everywhere there were blossoms and flowers the pear trees and cherry trees in the sextons garden were sunlit snow there were nodding daffodils and early tulips in the graveyard beds great multitudes of daisies and everywhere the birds seemed singing and in the middle was the brown coffin end tilting on mens shoulders and half occluded by the vicars oxford hood  and so we came to my mothers waiting grave  for a time i was very observant watching the coffin lowered hearing the words of the ritual it seemed a very curious business altogether  suddenly as the service drew to its end i felt something had still to be said which had not been said realised that she had withdrawn in silence neither forgiving me nor hearing from methose now lost assurances suddenly i knew i had not understood suddenly i saw her tenderly remembered not so much tender or kindly things of her as her crossed wishes and the ways in which i had thwarted her surprisingly i realised that behind all her hardness and severity she had loved me that i was the only thing she had ever loved and that until this moment i had never loved her and now she was there and deaf and blind to me pitifully defeated in her designs for me covered from me so that she could not know  i dug my nails into the palms of my hands i set my teeth but tears blinded me sobs would have choked me had speech been required of me the old vicar read on there came a mumbled responseand so on to the end i wept as it were internally and only when we had come out of the churchyard could i think and speak calmly again  stamped across this memory are the little black figures of my uncle and rabbits telling avebury the sexton and undertaker that it had all passed off very wellvery well indeed  viii  that is the last i shall tell of bladesover the dropscene falls on that and it comes no more as an actual presence into this novel i did indeed go back there once again but under circumstances quite immaterial to my story but in a sense bladesover has never left me it is as i said at the outset one of those dominant explanatory impressions that make the framework of my mind bladesover illuminates england it has become all that is spacious dignified pretentious and truly conservative in english life it is my social datum that is why i have drawn it here on so large a scale  when i came back at last to the real bladesover on an inconsequent visit everything was far smaller than i could have supposed possible it was as though everything had shivered and shrivelled a little at the lichtenstein touch the harp was still in the saloon but there was a different grand piano with a painted lid and a metrostyle pianola and an extraordinary quantity of artistic litter and bricabrac scattered about there was the trail of the bond street showroom over it all the furniture was still under chintz but it wasnt the same sort of chintz although it pretended to be and the lustredangling chandeliers had passed away lady lichtensteins books replaced the brown volumes i had browsed amongthey were mostly presentation copies of contemporary novels and the national review and the empire review and the nineteenth century and after jostled current books on the tablesenglish new books in gaudy catchpenny artistic covers french and italian novels in yellow german art handbooks of almost incredible ugliness there were abundant evidences that her ladyship was playing with the keltic renascence and a great number of ugly cats made of chinashe collected china and stoneware catsstood about everywherein all colours in all kinds of deliberately comic highly glazed distortion  it is nonsense to pretend that finance makes any better aristocrats than rent nothing can make an aristocrat but pride knowledge training and the sword these people were no improvement on the drews none whatever there was no effect of a beneficial replacement of passive unintelligent people by active intelligent ones one felt that a smaller but more enterprising and intensely undignified variety of stupidity had replaced the large dullness of the old gentry and that was all bladesover i thought had undergone just the same change between the seventies and the new century that had overtaken the dear old times and heaven knows how much more of the decorous british fabric these lichtensteins and their like seem to have no promise in them at all of any fresh vitality for the kingdom i do not believe in their intelligence or their powerthey have nothing new about them at all nothing creative nor rejuvenescent no more than a disorderly instinct of acquisition and the prevalence of them and their kind is but a phase in the broad slow decay of the great social organism of england they could not have made bladesover they cannot replace it they just happen to break out over itsaprophytically  wellthat was my last impression of bladesover   chapter the third  the wimblehurst apprenticeship  i  so far as i can remember now except for that one emotional phase by the graveside i passed through all these experiences rather callously i had already with the facility of youth changed my world ceased to think at all of the old school routine and put bladesover aside for digestion at a latter stage i took up my new world in wimblehurst with the chemists shop as its hub set to work at latin and materia medica and concentrated upon the present with all my heart wimblehurst is an exceptionally quiet and grey sussex town rare among south of england towns in being largely built of stone i found something very agreeable and picturesque in its clean cobbled streets its odd turnings and abrupt corners and in the pleasant park that crowds up one side of the town the whole place is under the eastry dominion and it was the eastry influence and dignity that kept its railway station a mile and threequarters away eastry house is so close that it dominates the whole one goes across the marketplace with its old lockup and stocks past the great prereformation church a fine grey shell like some empty skull from which the life has fled and there at once are the huge wroughtiron gates and one peeps through them to see the facade of this place very white and large and fine down a long avenue of yews eastry was far greater than bladesover and an altogether completer example of the eighteenth century system it ruled not two villages but a borough that had sent its sons and cousins to parliament almost as a matter of right so long as its franchise endured every one was in the system every oneexcept my uncle he stood out and complained  my uncle was the first real breach i found in the great front of bladesover the world had presented me for chatham was not so much a breach as a confirmation but my uncle had no respect for bladesover and eastrynone whatever he did not believe in them he was blind even to what they were he propounded strange phrases about them he exfoliated and wagged about novel and incredible ideas  this place said my uncle surveying it from his open doorway in the dignified stillness of a summer afternoon wants waking up  i was sorting up patent medicines in the corner  id like to let a dozen young americans loose into it said my uncle then wed see  i made a tick against mother shiptons sleeping syrup we had cleared our forward stock  things must be happening somewhere george he broke out in a querulously rising note as he came back into the little shop he fiddled with the piled dummy boxes of fancy soap and scent and so forth that adorned the end of the counter then turned about petulantly stuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew one to scratch his head i must do something he said i cant stand it  i must invent something and shove it i could  or a play theres a deal of money in a play george what would you think of me writing a play eh theres all sorts of things to be done  or the stogigschange  he fell into that meditative whistling of his  sacramental wine he swore this isnt the worldits cold mutton fat thats what wimblehurst is cold mutton fatdead and stiff and im buried in it up to the arm pits nothing ever happens nobody wants things to happen scept me up in london george things happen america i wish to heaven george id been born americanwhere things hum  what can one do here how can one grow while were sleepin here with our capital oozing away into lord eastrys pockets for rentmen are up there he indicated london as remotely over the top of the dispensing counter and then as a scene of great activity by a whirl of the hand and a wink and a meaning smile at me  what sort of things do they do i asked  rush about he said do things somethin glorious theres cover gambling ever heard of that george he drew the air in through his teeth you put down a hundred say and buy ten thousand pounds worth see thats a cover of one per cent things go up one you sell realise cent per cent down whiff its gone try again cent per cent george every day men are made or done for in an hour and the shoutin zzzz well thats one way george then another waytheres corners  theyre rather big things arent they i ventured  oh if you go in for wheat or steelyes but suppose you tackled a little thing george just some little thing that only needed a few thousands drugs for example shoved all you had into itstaked your liver on it so to speak take a drugtake ipecac for example take a lot of ipecac take all there is see there you are there arent unlimited supplies of ipecacuanhacant beand its a thing people must have then quinine again you watch your chance wait

for themselves by jove yes theyll do you if they can and you do them like brigands that makes it romantic thats the romance of commerce george youre in the mountains there think of having all the quinine in the world and some millionaires pampered wife gone ill with malaria eh thats a squeeze george eh eh millionaire on his motor car outside offering you any price you liked that ud wake up wimblehurst lord you havent an idea down here not an idea zzzz  he passed into a rapt dream from which escaped such fragments as fifty per cent advance sir securitytomorrow zzzz  the idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort of irresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be permitted to do in reality it was the sort of nonsense one would talk to make ewart laugh and set him going on to still odder possibilities i thought it was part of my uncles way of talking but ive learnt differently since the whole trend of modern moneymaking is to foresee something that will presently be needed and put it out of reach and then to haggle yourself wealthy you buy up land upon which people will presently want to build houses you secure rights that will bar vitally important developments and so on and so on of course the naive intelligence of a boy does not grasp the subtler developments of human inadequacy he begins life with a disposition to believe in the wisdom of grownup people he does not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the development of law and custom and he thinks that somewhere in the state there is a power as irresistible as a head masters to check mischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort i will confess that when my uncle talked of cornering quinine i had a clear impression that any one who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to jail now i know that any one who could really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the house of lords  my uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers for a while dreaming of corners in this and that but at last he reverted to wimblehurst again  you got to be in london when these things are in hand down here  jeerusalem he cried why did i plant myself here everythings done the games over heres lord eastry and hes got everything except what his lawyers get and before you get any more change this way youll have to dynamite himand them he doesnt want anything more to happen why should he any chance ud be a loss to him he wants everything to burble along and burble along and go on as its going for the next ten thousand years eastry after eastry one parson down another come one grocer dead get another any one with any ideas better go away they have gone away look at all these blessed people in this place look at em all fast asleep doing their business out of habitin a sort of dream stuffed men would do just as welljust theyve all shook down into their places they dont want anything to happen either theyre all broken in there you are only what are they all alive for  why cant they get a clockwork chemist  he concluded as he often concluded these talks i must invent somethingthats about what i must do zzzz some convenience something people want strike out you cant think george of anything everybody wants and hasnt got i mean something you could turn out retail under a shilling say well you think whenever you havent got anything better to do see  ii  so i remember my uncle in that first phase young but already a little fat restless fretful garrulous putting in my fermenting head all sorts of discrepant ideas certainly he was educational  for me the years at wimblehurst were years of pretty active growth most of my leisure and much of my time in the shop i spent in study i speedily mastered the modicum of latin necessary for my qualifying examinations anda little assisted by the government science and art department classes that were held in the grammar schoolwent on with my mathematics there were classes in physics in chemistry in mathematics and machine drawing and i took up these subjects with considerable avidity exercise i got chiefly in the form of walks there was some cricket in the summer and football in the winter sustained by young mens clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the big people and the sitting member but i was never very keen at these games i didnt find any very close companions among the youths of wimblehurst they struck me after my cockney schoolmates as loutish and slow servile and furtive spiteful and mean we used to swagger but these countrymen dragged their feet and hated an equal who didnt we talked loud but you only got the real thoughts of wimblehurst in a knowing undertone behind its hand and even then they werent much in the way of thoughts  no i didnt like those young countrymen and im no believer in the english countryside under the bladesover system as a breeding ground for honourable men one hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the rural exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population to my mind the english townsman even in the slums is infinitely better spiritually more courageous more imaginative and cleaner than his agricultural cousin ive seen them both when they didnt think they were being observed and i know there was something about my wimblehurst companions that disgusted me its hard to define heaven knows that at that cockney boardingschool at goudhurst we were coarse enough the wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to dofor our bad language for example but on the other hand they displayed a sort of sluggish real lewdness lewdness is the worda baseness of attitude whatever we exiled urbans did at goudhurst was touched with something however coarse of romantic imagination we had read the boys of england and told each other stories in the english countryside there are no books at all no songs no drama no valiant sin even all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago and the imagination aborts and bestialises that i think is where the real difference against the english rural man lies it is because i know this that i do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns they starve they suffer no doubt but they come out of it hardened they come out of it with souls  of an evening the wimblehurst blade shinyfaced from a wash and with some loud finery a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie would betake himself to the eastry arms billiardroom or to the bar parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played one soon sickened of his slow knowingness the cunning observation of his deadened eyes his idea of a good story always always told in undertones poor dirty worm his shrewd elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage a drink to the good or suchlike deal there rises before my eyes as i write young hopley dodd the son of the wimblehurst auctioneer the pride of wimblehurst its finest flower with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog pipe his riding breecheshe had no horseand his gaiters as he used to sit leaning forward and watching the billiardtable from under the brim of his artfully tilted hat a halfdozen phrases constituted his conversation hard lines he used to say and good baazness in a bass bleat moreover he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment night after night he was there  also you knew he would not understand that i could play billiards and regarded every stroke i made as a fluke for a beginner i didnt play so badly i thought im not so sure now that was my opinion at the time but young dodds scepticism and the good baazness finally cured me of my disposition to frequent the eastry arms and so these noises had their value in my world  i made no friends among the young men of the place at all and though i was entering upon adolescence i have no loveaffair to tell of here not that i was not waking up to that aspect of life in my middle teens i did indeed in various slightly informal ways scrape acquaintance with casual wimblehurst girls with a little dressmakers apprentice i got upon shyly speaking terms and a pupil teacher in the national school went further and was talked about in connection with me but i was not by any means touched by any reality of passion for either of these young people lovelove as yet came to me only in my dreams i only kissed these girls once or twice they rather disconcerted than developed those dreams they were so clearly not it i shall have much to say of love in this story but i may break it to the reader now that it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover desire i knew well enoughindeed too well but love i have been shy of in all my early enterprises in the war of the sexes i was torn between the urgency of the body and a habit of romantic fantasy that wanted every phase of the adventure to be generous and beautiful and i had a curiously haunting memory of beatrice of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the wall that somehow pitched the standard too high for wimblehursts opportunities i will not deny i did in a boyish way attempt a shy rude adventure or so in lovemaking at wimblehurst but through these various influences i didnt bring things off to any extent at all i left behind me no devastating memories no splendid reputation i came away at last still inexperienced and a little thwarted with only a natural growth of interest and desire in sexual things  if i fell in love with any one in wimblehurst it was with my aunt she treated me with a kindliness that was only half maternalshe petted my books she knew about my certificates she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her quite unconsciously i grew fond of her  my adolescent years at wimblehurst were on the whole laborious uneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many ways nearly a man years so uneventful that the calculus of variations is associated with one winter and an examination in physics for science and art department honours marks an epoch many divergent impulses stirred within me but the master impulse was a grave young disposition to work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get out of the wimblehurst world into which i had fallen i wrote with some frequency to ewart selfconscious but as i remember them not intelligent letters dated in latin and with lapses into latin quotation that roused ewart to parody there was something about me in those days more than a little priggish but it was to do myself justice something more than the petty pride of learning i had a very grave sense of discipline and preparation that i am not ashamed at all to remember i was serious more serious than i am at the present time more serious indeed than any adult seems to be i was capable then of effortsof nobilities they are beyond me now i dont see why at forty i shouldnt confess i respect my own youth i had dropped being a boy quite abruptly i thought i was presently to go out into a larger and quite important world and do significant things there i thought i was destined to do something definite to a world that had a definite purpose i did not understand then as i do now that life was to consist largely in the worlds doing things to me young people never do seem to understand that aspect of things and as i say among my educational influences my uncle all unsuspected played a leading part and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with wimblehurst my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque emptiness a form and expression that helped to emphasise it in a way that definition made me patient presently i shall get to london i said echoing him  i remember him now as talking always talking in those days he talked to me of theology he talked of politics of the wonders of science and the marvels of art of the passions and the affections of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs but predominantly and constantly he talked of getting on of enterprises of inventions and great fortunes of rothschilds silver kings vanderbilts goulds flotations realisations and the marvelous ways of chance with menin all localities that is to say that are not absolutely sunken to the level of cold mutton fat  when i think of those early talks i figure him always in one of three positions either we were in the dispensing lair behind a high barrier he pounding up things in a mortar perhaps and i rolling pillstuff into long rolls and cutting it up with a sort of broad fluted knife or he stood looking out of the shop door against the case of sponges and spraydiffusers while i surveyed him from behind the counter or he leant against the little drawers behind the counter and i hovered dusting in front the thought of those early days brings back to my nostrils the faint smell of scent that was always in the air marbled now with streaks of this drug and now of that and to my eyes the rows of jejune glass bottles with gold labels mirrorreflected that stood behind him my aunt i remember used sometimes to come into the shop in a state of aggressive sprightliness a sort of connubial ragging expedition and get much fun over the abbreviated latinity of those gilt inscriptions ol amjig george she would read derisively and he pretends its almond oil snapand thats mustard did you ever george  look at him george looking dignified id like to put an old label on to him round the middle like his bottles are with ol pondo on it thats latin for impostor george must be hed look lovely with a stopper  you want a stopper said my uncle projecting his face  my aunt dear soul was in those days quite thin and slender with a delicate rosebud completion and a disposition to connubial badinage to a sort of gentle skylarking there was a silvery ghost of lisping in her speech she was a great humourist and as the constraint of my presence at meals wore off i became more and more aware of a filmy but extensive net of nonsense she had woven about her domestic relations until it had become the reality of her life she affected a derisive attitude to the world at large and applied the epithet old to more things than i have ever heard linked to it before or since heres the old newspaper she used to sayto my uncle now dont go and get it in the butter you silly old sardine  whats the day of the week susan my uncle would ask  old monday sossidge she would say and add i got all my old washing to do dont i know it  she had evidently been the wit and joy of a large circle of schoolfellows and this style had become a second nature with her it made her very delightful to me in that quiet place her customary walk even had a sort of hello in it her chief preoccupation in life was i believe to make my uncle laugh and when by some new nickname some new quaintness or absurdity she achieved that end she was behind a mask of sober amazement the happiest woman on earth my uncles laugh when it did come i must admit was as baedeker says rewarding it began with gusty blowings and snortings and opened into a clear ha ha but in fullest development it included in those youthful days falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly and whackings of the stomach and tears and cries of anguish i never in my life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her he was commonly too much in earnest for that and he didnt laugh much at all to my knowledge after those early years also she threw things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of wimblehurst sponges out of stock she threw cushions balls of paper clean washing bread and once up the yard when they thought that i and the errand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way she smashed a boxful of eightounce bottles i had left to drain assaulting my uncle with a new soft broom sometimes she would shy things at mebut not often there seemed always laughter round and about herall three of us would share hysterics at timesand on one occasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of themselves because of a storm of mirth during the sermon the vicar it seems had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the customary pockethandkerchief and afterwards she had picked up her own glove by the finger and looking innocently but intently sideways had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether we had it all over again at dinner  but it shows you cried my uncle suddenly becoming grave what wimblehurst is to have us all laughing at a little thing like that we werent the only ones that giggled not by any means and lord it was funny  socially my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated in places like wimblehurst the tradesmens lives always are isolated socially all of them unless they have a sister or a bosom friend among the other wives but the husbands met in various barparlours or in the billiardroom of the eastry arms but my uncle for the most part spent his evenings at home when first he arrived in wimblehurst i think he had spread his effect of abounding ideas and enterprise rather too aggressively and wimblehurst after a temporary subjugation had rebelled and done its best to make a butt of him his appearance in a publichouse led to a pause in any conversation that was going on  come to tell us about everything mr pondrevo some one would say politely  you wait my uncle used to answer disconcerted and sulk for the rest of his visit  or some one with an immense air of innocence would remark to the world generally theyre talkin of rebuildin wimblehurst all over again im told anybody heard anything of it going to make it a reglar smartgoin enterprisin placekind of crystal pallas  earthquake and a pestilence before you get that my uncle would mutter to the infinite delight of every one and add something inaudible about cold mutton fat  iii  we were torn apart by a financial accident to my uncle of which i did not at first grasp the full bearings he had developed what i regarded as an innocent intellectual recreation which he called stockmarket meteorology i think he got the idea from one use of curves in the graphic presentation of associated variations that he saw me plotting he secured some of my squared paper and having cast about for a time decided to trace the rise and fall of certain lines and railways theres something in this george he said and i little dreamt that among other things that were in it was the whole of his spare money and most of what my mother had left to him in trust for me  its as plain as can be he said see heres one system of waves and heres another these are prices for union pacificsextending over a month now next week mark my words theyll be down one whole point were getting near the steep part of the curve again see its absolutely scientific its verifiable well and apply it you buy in the hollow and sell on the crest and there you are  i was so convinced of the triviality of this amusement that to find at last that he had taken it in the most disastrous earnest overwhelmed me  he took me for a long walk to break it to me over the hills towards yare and across the great gorse commons by hazelbrow  there are ups and downs in life george he saidhalfway across that great open space and paused against the sky i left out one factor in the union pacific analysis  did you i said struck by the sudden chance in his voice but you dont mean  i stopped and turned on him in the narrow sandy rut of pathway and he stopped likewise  i do george i do mean its bust me im a bankrupt here and now  then  the shops bust too i shall have to get out of that  and me  oh youyoure all right you can transfer your apprenticeship anderwell im not the sort of man to be careless with trust funds you can be sure i kept that aspect in mind theres some of it left georgetrust mequite a decent little sum  but you and aunt  it isnt quite the way we meant to leave wimblehurst george but we shall have to go sale all the things shoved about and ticketedlot a hundred and one ugh its been a larky little house in some ways the first we had furnishinga spree in its way very happy his face winced at some memory lets go on george he said shortly near choking i could see  i turned my back on him and did not look round again for a little while  thats how it is you see george i heard him after a time  when we were back in the high road again he came alongside and for a time we walked in silence  dont say anything home yet he said presently fortunes of war i got to pick the proper time with susanelse shell get depressed not that she isnt a firstrate brick whatever comes along  all right i said ill be careful and it seemed to me for the time altogether too selfish to bother him with any further inquiries about his responsibility as my trustee he gave a little sigh of relief at my note of assent and was presently talking quite cheerfully of his plans but he had i remember one lapse into moodiness that came and went suddenly those others he said as though the thought had stung him for the first time  what others i asked  damn them said he  but what others  all those damned stickinthemudanddieslowly tradespeople ruck the butcher marbel the grocer snape gord george how theyll grin  i thought him over in the next few weeks and i remember now in great detail the last talk we had together before he handed over the shop and me to his successor for he had the good luck to sell his business lock stock and barrelin which expression i found myself and my indentures included the horrors of a sale by auction of the furniture even were avoided  i remember that either coming or going on that occasion ruck the butcher stood in his doorway and regarded us with a grin that showed his long teeth  you halfwitted hog said my uncle you grinning hyaena and then pleasant day mr ruck  goin to make your fortun in london then said mr ruck with slow enjoyment  that last excursion took us along the causeway to beeching and so up the downs and round almost as far as steadhurst home my moods as we went made a mingled web by this time i had really grasped the fact that my uncle had in plain english robbed me the little accumulations of my mother six hundred pounds and more that would have educated me and started me in business had been eaten into and was mostly gone into the unexpected hollow that ought to have been a crest of the union pacific curve and of the remainder he still gave no account i was too young and inexperienced to insist on this or know how to get it but the thought of it all made streaks of decidedly black anger in that scheme of interwoven feelings and you know i was also acutely sorry for himalmost as sorry as i was for my aunt susan even then i had quite found him out i knew him to be weaker than myself his incurable irresponsible childishness was as clear to me then as it was on his deathbed his redeeming and excusing imaginative silliness through some odd mental twist perhaps i was disposed to exonerate him even at the cost of blaming my poor old mother who had left things in his untrustworthy hands  i should have forgiven him altogether i believe if he had been in any manner apologetic to me but he wasnt that he kept reassuring me in a way i found irritating mostly however his solicitude was for aunt susan and himself  its these crises george he said try character your aunts come out well my boy  he made meditative noises for a space  had her cry of coursethe thing had been only too painfully evident to me in her eyes and swollen facewho wouldnt but nowbuoyant again shes a corker  well be sorry to leave the little house of course its a bit like adam and eve you know lord what a chap old milton was       the world was all before them where to choose      their place of rest and providence their guide  it sounds george providence their guide wellthank goodness theres no imeedgit prospect of either cain or abel  after all it wont be so bad up there not the scenery perhaps or the air we get here butlife weve got very comfortable little rooms very comfortable considering and i shall rise were not done yet were not beaten dont think that george i shall pay twenty shillings in the pound before ive doneyou mark my words georgetwentyfive to you i got this situation within twentyfour hoursothers offered its an important firmone of the best in london i looked to that i might have got four or five shillings a week moreelsewhere quarters i could name but i said to them plainly wages to go on with but opportunitys my gamedevelopment we understood each other  he threw out his chest and the little round eyes behind his glasses rested valiantly on imaginary employers  we would go on in silence for a space while he revised and restated that encounter then he would break out abruptly with some banal phrase  the battle of life george my boy he would cry or ups and downs  he ignored or waived the poor little attempts i made to ascertain my own position thats all right he would say or leave all that to me ill look after them and he would drift away towards the philosophy and moral of the situation what was i to do  never put all your resources into one chance george thats the lesson i draw from this have forces in reserve it was a hundred to one george that i was righta hundred to one i worked it out afterwards and here we are spiked on the offchance if id have only kept back a little id have had it on up next day like a shot and come out on the rise there you are  his thoughts took a graver turn  its where youll bump up against chance like this george that you feel the need of religion your hardandfast scientific menyour spencers and huxleysthey dont understand that i do ive thought of it a lot latelyin bed and about i was thinking of it this morning while i shaved its not irreverent for me to say it i hopebut god comes in on the offchance george see dont you be too cocksure of anything good or bad thats what i make out of it i could have sworn well do you think iparticular as i amwould have touched those union pacifics with trust money at all if i hadnt thought it a thoroughly good thinggood without spot or blemish and it was bad  its a lesson to me you start in to get a hundred percent and you come out with that it means in a way a reproof for pride ive thought of that georgein the night watches i was thinking this morning when i was shaving that thats where the good of it all comes in at the bottom im a mystic in these affairs you calculate youre going to do this or that but at bottom who knows at all what hes doing when you most think youre doing things theyre being done right over your head youre being donein a sense take a hundredto one chance or one to a hundredwhat does it matter youre being led  its odd that i heard this at the time with unutterable contempt and now that i recall itwell i ask myself what have i got better  i wish said i becoming for a moment outrageous you were being led to give me some account of my money uncle  not without a bit of paper to figure on george i cant but you trust me about that never fear you trust me  and in the end i had to  i think the bankruptcy hit my aunt pretty hard there was so far as i can remember now a complete cessation of all those cheerful outbreaks of elasticity no more skylarking in the shop nor scampering about the house but there was no fuss that i saw and only little signs in her complexion of the fits of weeping that must have taken her she didnt cry at the end though to me her face with its strain of selfpossession was more pathetic than any weeping well she said to me as she came through the shop to the cab heres old orf george orf to mome number two goodbye and she took me in her arms and kissed me and pressed me to her then she dived straight for the cab before i could answer her  my uncle followed and he seemed to me a trifle too valiant and confident in his bearing for reality he was unusually white in the face he spoke to his successor at the counter here we go he said one down the other up youll find it a quiet little business so long as you run it on quiet linesa nice quiet little business theres nothing more no well if you want to know anything write to me ill always explain fully anythingbusiness place or people youll find pil antibil a little overstocked bytheby i found it soothed my mind the day before yesterday making em and i made em all day thousands and wheres george ah there you are ill write to you george fully about all that affair fully  it became clear to me as if for the first time that i was really parting from my aunt susan i went out on to the pavement and saw her head craned forward her wideopen blue eyes and her little face intent on the shop that had combined for her all the charms of a big dolls house and a little home of her very own goodbye she said to it and to me our eyes met for a momentperplexed my uncle bustled out and gave a few totally unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in beside her all right asked the driver right said i and he woke up the horse with a flick of his whip my aunts eyes surveyed me again stick to your old science and things george and write and tell me when they make you a professor she said cheerfully  she stared at me for a second longer with eyes growing wider and brighter and a smile that had become fixed glanced again at the bright little shop still saying ponderevo with all the emphasis of its fascia and then flopped back hastily out of sight of me into the recesses of the cab then it had gone from before me and i beheld mr snape the hairdresser inside his store regarding its departure with a quiet satisfaction and exchanging smiles and significant headshakes with mr marbel  iv  i was left i say as part of the lock stock and barrel at wimblehurst with my new master a mr mantell who plays no part in the progress of this story except in so far as he effaced my uncles traces so soon as the freshness of this new personality faded i began to find wimblehurst not only a dull but a lonely place and to miss my aunt susan immensely the advertisements of the summer terms for cough linctus were removed the bottles of coloured waterred green and yellowrestored to their places the horse announcing veterinary medicine which my uncle sizzling all the while had coloured in careful portraiture of a goodwood favourite rewhitened and i turned myself even more resolutely than before to latin until the passing of my preliminary examination enabled me to drop that and then to mathematics and science  there were classes in electricity and magnetism at the grammar school i took a little elementary prize in that in my first year and a medal in my third and in chemistry and human physiology and sound light and heat i did well there was also a lighter more discursive subject called physiography in which one ranged among the sciences and encountered geology as a process of evolution from eozoon to eastry house and astronomy as a record of celestial movements of the most austere and invariable integrity i learnt out of badlywritten condensed little textbooks and with the minimum of experiment but still i learnt only thirty years ago it was and i remember i learnt of the electric light as an expensive impracticable toy the telephone as a curiosity electric traction as a practical absurdity there was no argon no radium no phagocytesat least to my knowledge and aluminium was a dear infrequent metal the fastest ships in the world went then at nineteen knots and no one but a lunatic here and there ever thought it possible that men might fly  many things have happened since then but the last glance i had of wimblehurst two years ago remarked no change whatever in its pleasant tranquillity they had not even built any fresh housesat least not actually in the town though about the station there had been some building but it was a good place to do work in for all its quiescence i was soon beyond the small requirements of the pharmaceutical societys examination and as they do not permit candidates to sit for that until one and twenty i was presently filling up my time and preventing my studies becoming too desultory by making an attack upon the london university degree of bachelor of science which impressed me then as a very splendid but almost impossible achievement the degree in mathematics and chemistry appealed to me as particularly congenialalbeit giddily inaccessible i set to work i had presently to arrange a holiday and go to london to matriculate and so it was i came upon my aunt and uncle again in many ways that visit marked an epoch it was my first impression of london at all i was then nineteen and by a conspiracy of chances my nearest approach to that human wilderness had been my brief visit to chatham chatham too had been my largest town so that i got london at last with an exceptional freshness of effect as the sudden revelation of a whole unsuspected other side to life  i came to it on a dull and smoky day by the south eastern railway and our train was half an hour late stopping and going on and stopping again i marked beyond chiselhurst the growing multitude of villas and so came stage by stage through multiplying houses and diminishing interspaces of market garden and dingy grass to regions of interlacing railway lines big factories gasometers and wide reeking swamps of dingy little homes more of them and more and more the number of these and their dinginess and poverty increased and here rose a great public house and here a board school and there a gaunt factory and away to the east there loomed for a time a queer incongruous forest of masts and spars the congestion of houses intensified and piled up presently into tenements i marveled more and more at this boundless world of dingy people whiffs of industrial smell of leather of brewing drifted into the carriage the sky darkened i rumbled thunderously over bridges vancrowded streets peered down on and crossed the thames with an abrupt eclat of sound i got an effect of tall warehouses of grey water barge crowded of broad banks of indescribable mud and then i was in cannon street stationa monstrous dirty cavern with trains packed across its vast floor and more porters standing along the platform than i had ever been in my life before i alighted with my portmanteau and struggled along realising for the first time just how small and weak i could still upon occasion feel in this world i felt an honours medal in electricity and magnetism counted for nothing at all  afterwards i drove in a cab down a canon of rushing street between high warehouses and peeped up astonished at the blackened greys of saint pauls the traffic of cheapsideit was mostly in horse omnibuses in those daysseemed stupendous its roar was stupendous i wondered where the money came from to employ so many cabs what industry could support the endless jostling stream of silkhatted frockcoated hurrying men down a turning i found the temperance hotel mr mantell had recommended to me the porter in a green uniform who took over my portmanteau seemed i thought to despise me a good deal  v  matriculation kept me for four full days and then came an afternoon to spare and i sought out tottenham court road through a perplexing network of various and crowded streets but this london was vast it was endless it seemed the whole world had changed into packed frontages and hoardings and street spaces i got there at last and made inquiries and i found my uncle behind the counter of the pharmacy he managed an establishment that did not impress me as doing a particularly highclass trade lord he said at the sight of me i was wanting something to happen  he greeted me warmly i had grown taller and he i thought had grown shorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was unchanged he struck me as being rather shabby and the silk hat he produced and put on when after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me was past its first youth but he was as buoyant and confident as ever  come to ask me about all that he cried ive never written yet  oh among other things said i with a sudden regrettable politeness and waived the topic of his trusteeship to ask after my aunt susan  well have her out of it he said suddenly well go somewhere we dont get you in london every day  its my first visit i said ive never seen london before and that made him ask me what i thought of it and the rest of the talk was london london to the exclusion of all smaller topics he took me up the hampstead road almost to the cobden statue plunged into some back streets to the left and came at last to a blistered front door that responded to his latchkey one of a long series of blistered front doors with fanlights and apartment cards above we found ourselves in a drabcoloured passage that was not only narrow and dirty but desolatingly empty and then he opened a door and revealed my aunt sitting at the window with a little sewingmachine on a bamboo occasional table before her and worka plumcoloured walking dress i judged at its most analytical stagescattered over the rest of the apartment  at the first glance i judged my aunt was plumper than she had been but her complexion was just as fresh and her china blue eye as bright as in the old days  london she said didnt get blacks on her  she still cheeked my uncle i was pleased to find what are you old poking in for at this timegubbitt she said when he appeared and she still looked with a practised eye for the facetious side of things when she saw me behind him she gave a little cry and stood up radiant then she became grave  i was surprised at my own emotion in seeing her she held me at arms length for a moment a hand on each shoulder and looked at me with a sort of glad scrutiny she seemed to hesitate and then pecked little kiss off my cheek  youre a man george she said as she released me and continued to look at me for a while  their menage was one of a very common type in london they occupied what is called the diningroom floor of a small house and they had the use of a little inconvenient kitchen in the basement that had once been scullery the two rooms bedroom behind and living room in front were separated by foldingdoors that were never now thrown back and indeed in the presence of a visitor not used at all there was of course no bathroom or anything of that sort available and there was no water supply except to the kitchen below my aunt did all the domestic work though she could have afforded to pay for help if the build of the place had not rendered that inconvenient to the pitch of impossibility there was no sort of help available except that of indoor servants for whom she had no accommodation the furniture was their own it was partly secondhand but on the whole it seemed cheerful to my eye and my aunts bias for cheap gayfigured muslin had found ample score in many ways i should think it must have been an extremely inconvenient and cramped sort of home but at the time i took it as i was taking everything as being there and in the nature of things i did not see the oddness of solvent decent people living in a habitation so clearly neither designed nor adapted for their needs so wasteful of labour and so devoid of beauty as this was and it is only now as i describe this that i find myself thinking of the essential absurdity of an intelligent community living in such makeshift homes it strikes me now as the next thing to wearing secondhand clothes  you see it was a natural growth part of that system to which bladesover i hold is the key there are wide regions of london miles of streets of houses that appear to have been originally designed for prosperousmiddleclass homes of the early victorian type there must have been a perfect fury of such building in the thirties forties and fifties street after street must have been rushed into being campden town way pentonville way brompton way west kensington way in the victoria region and all over the minor suburbs of the south side  i am doubtful if many of these houses had any long use as the residences of single families if from the very first almost their tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet they were built with basements in which their servants worked and livedservants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs the diningroom with folding doors was a little above the ground level and in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to follow was consumed and the numerous family read and worked in the evening and above was the drawingroom also with folding doors where the infrequent callers were received that was the vision at which those industrious builders aimed even while these houses were being run up the threads upon the loom of fate were shaping to abolish altogether the type of household that would have fitted them means of transit were developing to carry the moderately prosperous middleclass families out of london education and factory employment were whittling away at the supply of rough hardworking obedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these places new classes of hardup middleclass people such as my uncle employees of various types were coming into existence for whom no homes were provided none of these classes have ideas of what they ought to be or fit in any legitimate way into the bladesover theory that dominates our minds it was nobodys concern to see them housed under civilised conditions and the beautiful laws of supply and demand had free play they had to squeeze in the landlords came out financially intact from their blundering enterprise more and more these houses fell into the hands of married artisans or struggling widows or old servants with savings who became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by subletting furnished or unfurnished apartments  i remember now that a poor greyhaired old woman who had an air of having been roused from a nap in the dust bin came out into the area and looked up at us as we three went out from the front door to see london under my uncles direction she was the subletting occupier she squeezed out a precarious living by taking the house whole and subletting it in detail and she made her food and got the shelter of an attic above and a basement below by the transaction and if she didnt chance to let steadily out she went to pauperdom and some other poor sordid old adventurer tried in her place  it is a foolish community that can house whole classes useful and helpful honest and loyal classes in such squalidly unsuitable dwellings it is by no means the social economy it seems to use up old women savings and inexperience in order to meet the landlords demands but any one who doubts this thing is going on right up to today need only spend an afternoon in hunting for lodgings in any of the regions of london i have named  but where has my story got to my uncle i say decided i must be shown london and out we three went as soon as my aunt had got her hat on to catch all that was left of the day  vi  it pleased my uncle extremely to find i had never seen london before he took possession of the metropolis forthwith london george he said takes a lot of understanding its a great place immense the richest town in the world the biggest port the greatest manufacturing town the imperial citythe centre of civilisation the heart of the world see those sandwich men down there that third ones hat fair treat you dont see poverty like that in wimblehurst george and many of them high oxford honour men too brought down by drink its a wonderful place georgea whirlpool a maelstrom whirls you up and whirls you down  i have a very confused memory of that afternoons inspection of london my uncle took us to and fro showing us over his london talking erratically following a route of his own sometimes we were walking sometimes we were on the tops of great staggering horse omnibuses in a heaving jumble of traffic and at one point we had tea in an aerated bread shop but i remember very distinctly how we passed down park lane under an overcast sky and how my uncle pointed out the house of this child of good fortune and that with succulent appreciation  i remember too that as he talked i would find my aunt watching my face as if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression  been in love yet george she asked suddenly over a bun in the teashop  too busy aunt i told her  she bit her bun extensively and gesticulated with the remnant to indicate that she had more to say  how are you going to make your fortune she said so soon as she could speak again you havent told us that  lectricity said my uncle taking breath after a deep draught of tea  if i make it at all i said for my part i think shall be satisfied with something less than a fortune  were going to make ourssuddenly she said  so he old says she jerked her head at my uncle  he wont tell me whenso i cant get anything ready but its coming going to ride in our carriage and have a garden gardenlike a bishops  she finished her bun and twiddled crumbs from her fingers i shall be glad of the garden she said its going to be a real big one with rosaries and things fountains in it pampas grass hothouses  youll get it all right said my uncle who had reddened a little  grey horses in the carriage george she said its nice to think about when ones dull and dinners in restaurants often and often and theatresin the stalls and money and money and money  you may joke said my uncle and hummed for a moment  just as though an old porpoise like him would ever make money she said turning her eyes upon his profile with a sudden lapse to affection hell just porpoise about  ill do something said my uncle you bet zzzz and rapped with a shilling on the marble table  when you do youll have to buy me a new pair of gloves she said anyhow that fingers past mending look you cabbageyou and she held the split under his nose and pulled a face of comical fierceness  my uncle smiled at these sallies at the time but afterwards when i went back with him to the pharmacythe lowclass business grew brisker in the evening and they kept open latehe reverted to it in a low expository tone your aunts a bit impatient george she gets at me its only natural a woman doesnt understand how long it takes to build up a position no in certain directions nowi amquietlybuilding up a position now here i get this room i have my three assistants zzzz its a position that judged by the criterion of imeedjit income isnt perhaps so good as i deserve but strategicallyyes its what i want i make my plans i rally my attack  what plans i said are you making  well george theres one thing you can rely upon im doing nothing in a hurry i turn over this one and that and i dont talkindiscreetly theresno i dont think i can tell you that and yet why not  he got up and closed the door into the shop ive told no one he remarked as he sat down again i owe you something  his face flushed slightly he leant forward over the little table towards me  listen he said  i listened  tonobungay said my uncle very slowly and distinctly  i thought he was asking me to hear some remote strange noise i dont hear anything i said reluctantly to his expectant face he smiled undefeated try again he said and repeated tonobungay  oh that i said  eh said he  but what is it  ah said my uncle rejoicing and expanding what is it thats what you got to ask what wont it be he dug me violently in what he supposed to be my ribs george he criedgeorge watch this place theres more to follow  and that was all i could get from him  that i believe was the very first time that the words tonobungay ever heard on earthunless my uncle indulged in monologues in his chambera highly probable thing its utterance certainly did not seem to me at the time to mark any sort of epoch and had i been told this word was the open sesame to whatever pride and pleasure the grimy front of london hid from us that evening i should have laughed aloud  coming now to business i said after a pause and with a chill sense of effort and i opened the question of his trust  my uncle sighed and leant back in his chair i wish i could make all this business as clear to you as it is to me he said howevergo on say what you have to say  vii  after i left my uncle that evening i gave way to a feeling of profound depression my uncle and aunt seemed to me to be leadingi have already used the word too often but i must use it againdingy lives they seemed to be adrift in a limitless crowd of dingy people wearing shabby clothes living uncomfortably in shabby secondhand houses going to and fro on pavements that had always a thin veneer of greasy slippery mud under grey skies that showed no gleam of hope of anything for them but dinginess until they died it seemed absolutely clear to me that my mothers little savings had been swallowed up and that my own prospect was all too certainly to drop into and be swallowed up myself sooner or later by this dingy london ocean the london that was to be an adventurous escape from the slumber of wimblehurst had vanished from my dreams i saw my uncle pointing to the houses in park lane and showing a frayed shirtcuff as he did so i heard my aunt im to ride in my carriage then so he old says  my feelings towards my uncle were extraordinarily mixed i was intensely sorry not only for my aunt susan but for himfor it seemed indisputable that as they were living then so they must go onand at the same time i was angry with the garrulous vanity and illness that had elipped all my chance of independent study and imprisoned her in those grey apartments when i got back to wimblehurst i allowed myself to write him a boyishly sarcastic and sincerely bitter letter he never replied then believing it to be the only way of escape for me i set myself far more grimly and resolutely to my studies than i had ever done before after a time i wrote to him in more moderate terms and he answered me evasively and then i tried to dismiss him from my mind and went on working  yes that first raid upon london under the moist and chilly depression of january had an immense effect upon me it was for me an epochmaking disappointment i had thought of london as a large free welcoming adventurous place and i saw it slovenly and harsh and irresponsive  i did not realise at all what human things might be found behind those grey frontages what weakness that whole forbidding facade might presently confess it is the constant error of youth to overestimate the will in things i did not see that the dirt the discouragement the discomfort of london could be due simply to the fact that london was a witless old giantess of a town too slack and stupid to keep herself clean and maintain a brave face to the word no i suffered from the sort of illusion that burnt witches in the seventeenth century i endued her grubby disorder with a sinister and magnificent quality of intention  and my uncles gestures and promises filled me with doubt and a sort of fear for him he seemed to me a lost little creature too silly to be silent in a vast implacable condemnation i was full of pity and a sort of tenderness for my aunt susan who was doomed to follow his erratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent promises  i was to learn better but i worked with the terror of the grim underside of london in my soul during all my last year at wimblehurst      book the second  the rise of tonobungay    chapter the first  how i became a london student and went astray  i came to live in london as i shall tell you when i was nearly twentytwo wimblehurst dwindles in perspective is now in this book a little place far off bladesover no more than a small pinkish speck of frontage among the distant kentish hills the scene broadens out becomes multitudinous and limitless full of the sense of vast irrelevant movement i do not remember my second coming to london as i do my first for my early impressions save that an october memory of softened amber sunshine stands out amber sunshine falling on grey house fronts i know not where that and a sense of a large tranquillity  i could fill a book i think with a more or less imaginary account of how i came to apprehend london how first in one aspect and then in another it grew in my mind each day my accumulating impressions were added to and qualified and brought into relationship with new ones they fused inseparably with others that were purely personal and accidental i find myself with a certain comprehensive perception of london complete indeed incurably indistinct in places and yet in some way a whole that began with my first visit and is still being mellowed and enriched  london  at first no doubt it was a chaos of streets and people and buildings and reasonless going to and fro i do not remember that i ever struggled very steadily to understand it or explored it with any but a personal and adventurous intention yet in time there has grown up in me a kind of theory of london i do think i see lines of an ordered structure out of which it has grown detected a process that is something more than a confusion of casual accidents though indeed it may be no more than a process of disease  i said at the outset of my first book that i find in bladesover the clue to all england well i certainly imagine it is the clue to the structure of london there have been no revolutions no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in england since the days of the fine gentry since 1688 or thereabouts the days when bladesover was built there have been changes dissolving forest replacing forest if you will but then it was that the broad lines of the english system set firmly and as i have gone to and fro in london in certain regions constantly the thought has recurred this is bladesover house this answers to bladesover house the fine gentry may have gone they have indeed largely gone i think rich merchants may have replaced them financial adventurers or what not that does not matter the shape is still bladesover  i am most reminded of bladesover and eastry by all those regions round about the west end parks for example estate parks each more or less in relation to a palace or group of great houses the roads and back ways of mayfair and all about st jamess again albeit perhaps of a later growth in point of time were of the very spirit and architectural texture of the bladesover passages and yards they had the same smells the space the large cleanest and always going to and fro where one met unmistakable olympians and even more unmistakable valets butlers footmen in mufti there were moments when i seemed to glimpse down areas the white panelling the very chintz of my mothers room again  i could trace out now on a map what i would call the greathouse region passing southwestward into belgravia becoming diffused and sporadic westward finding its last systematic outbreak round and about regents park the duke of devonshires place in piccadilly in all its insolent ugliness pleases me particularly it is the quintessence of the thing apsley house is all in the manner of my theory park lane has its quite typical mansions and they run along the border of the green park and st jamess and i struck out a truth one day in cromwell road quite suddenly as i looked over the natural history museum by jove said i but this is the little assemblage of cases of stuffed birds and animals upon the bladesover staircase grown enormous and yonder as the corresponding thing to the bladesover curios and porcelain is the art museume and there in the little observatories in exhibition road is old sir cuthberts gregorian telescope that i hunted out in the storeroom and put together and diving into the art museum under this inspiration i came to a little readingroom and found as i had inferred old brown books  it was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy i did that day all these museums and libraries that are dotted over london between piccadilly and west kensington and indeed the museum and library movement throughout the world sprang from the elegant leisure of the gentlemen of taste theirs were the first libraries the first houses of culture by my ratlike raids into the bladesover saloon i became as it were the last dwindled representative of such a man of letters as swift but now these things have escaped out of the great house altogether and taken on a strange independent life of their own  it is this idea of escaping parts from the seventeenth century system of bladesover of proliferating and overgrowing elements from the estates that to this day seems to me the best explanation not simply of london but of all england england is a country of great renascence landed gentlefolk who have been unconsciously outgrown and overgrown the proper shops for bladesover custom were still to be found in regent street and bond street in my early london days in those days they had been but lightly touched by the americans profaning handand in piccadilly i found the doctors house of the country village or country town up and down harley street multiplied but not otherwise different and the family solicitor by the hundred further eastward in the abandoned houses of a previous generation of gentlepeople and down in westminster behind palladian fronts the public offices sheltered in large bladesoverish rooms and looked out on st jamess park the parliament houses of lords and gentlemen the parliament house that was horrified when merchants and brewers came thrusting into it a hundred years ago stood out upon its terrace gathering the whole system together into a head  and the more i have paralleled these things with my bladesovereastry model the more evident it has become to me that the balance is not the same and the more evident is the presence of great new forces blind forces of invasion of growth the railway termini on the north side of london have been kept as remote as eastry had kept the railwaystation from wimblehurst they stop on the very outskirts of the estates but from the south the south eastern railway had butted its great stupid rusty iron head of charing cross station that great head that came smashing down in 1905clean across the river between somerset house and whitehall the south side had no protecting estate factory chimneys smoke right over against westminster with an air of carelessly not having permission and the whole effect of industrial london and of all london east of temple bar and of the huge dingy immensity of london port is to me of something disproportionately large something morbidly expanded without plan or intention dark and sinister toward the clean clear social assurance of the west end and south of this central london southeast southwest far west northwest all round the northern hills are similar disproportionate growths endless streets of undistinguished houses undistinguished industries shabby families secondrate shops inexplicable people who in a once fashionable phrase do not exist all these aspects have suggested to my mind at times do suggest to this day the unorganised abundant substance of some tumorous growthprocess a process which indeed bursts all the outlines of the affected carcass and protrudes such masses as ignoble comfortable croydon as tragic impoverished west ham to this day i ask myself will those masses ever become structural will they indeed shape into anything new whatever or is that cancerous image their true and ultimate diagnosis  moreover together with this hypertrophy there is an immigration of elements that have never understood and never will understand the great tradition wedges of foreign settlement embedded in the heart of this yeasty english expansion one day i remember wandering eastward out of pure curiosityit must have been in my early student daysand discovering a shabbily bright foreign quarter shops displaying hebrew placards and weird unfamiliar commodities and a concourse of brighteyed eaglenosed people talking some incomprehensible gibberish between the shops and the barrows and soon i became quite familiar with the devious vicious dirtilypleasant eroticism of soho i found those crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of brompton where i lodged and lived my daily life in soho indeed i got my first inkling of the factor of replacement that is so important in both the english and the american process  even in the west end in mayfair and the square about pall mall ewart was presently to remind me the face of the old aristocratic dignity was fairer than its substance here were actors and actresses here money lenders and jews here bold financial adventurers and i thought of my uncles frayed cuff as he pointed out this house in park lane and that that was so and sos who made a corner in borax and that palace belonged to that hero among modern adventurers barmentrude who used to be an idban illicit diamond buyer that is to say a city of bladesovers the capital of a kingdom of bladesovers all much shaken and many altogether in decay parasitically occupied insidiously replaced by alien unsympathetic and irresponsible elements and with a ruling an adventitious and miscellaneous empire of a quarter of this daedal earth complex laws intricate social necessities disturbing insatiable suggestions followed from this such was the world into which i had come into which i had in some way to thrust myself and fit my problem my temptations my efforts my patriotic instinct all my moral instincts my physical appetites my dreams and my sanity  london i came up to it young and without advisers rather priggish rather dangerously openminded and very openeyed and with somethingit is i think the common gift of imaginative youth and i claim it unblushinglyfine in me finer than the world and seeking fine responses i did not want simply to live or simply to live happily or well i wanted to serve and do and makewith some nobility it was in me it is in half the youth of the world  ii  i had come to london as a scholar i had taken the vincent bradley scholarship of the pharmaceutical society but i threw this up when i found that my work of the science and art department in mathematics physics and chemistry had given me one of the minor technical board scholarships at the consolidated technical schools at south kensington this latter was in mechanics and metallurgy and i hesitated between the two the vincent bradley gave me l70 a year and quite the best startoff a pharmaceutical chemist could have the south kensington thing was worth about twentytwo shillings a week and the prospects it opened were vague but it meant far more scientific work than the former and i was still under the impulse of that great intellectual appetite that is part of the adolescence of men of my type moreover it seemed to lead towards engineering in which i imaginedi imagine to this daymy particular use is to be found i took its greater uncertainty as a fair risk i came up very keen not doubting that the really hard and steady industry that had carried me through wimblehurst would go on still in the new surroundings  only from the very first it didnt  when i look back now at my wimblehurst days i still find myself surprised at the amount of steady grinding study of strenuous selfdiscipline that i maintained throughout my apprenticeship in many ways i think that time was the most honourable period in my life i wish i could say with a certain mind that my motives in working so well were large and honourable too to a certain extent they were so there was a fine sincere curiosity a desire for the strength and power of scientific knowledge and a passion for intellectual exercise but i do not think those forces alone would have kept me at it so grimly and closely if wimblehurst had not been so dull so limited and so observant directly i came into the london atmosphere tasting freedom tasting irresponsibility and the pull of new forces altogether my discipline fell from me like a garment wimblehurst to a youngster in my position offered no temptations worth counting no interests to conflict with study no vicessuch vices as it offered were coarsely stripped of any imaginative glamourfull drunkenness clumsy leering shameful lust no social intercourse even to waste ones time and on the other hand it would minister greatly to the selfesteem of a conspicuously industrious student one was marked as clever one played up to the part and ones little accomplishment stood out finely in ones private reckoning against the sunlit small ignorance of that agreeable place one went with an intent rush across the market square one took ones exercise with as dramatic a sense of an ordered day as an oxford don one burnt the midnight oil quite consciously at the rare respectful benighted passerby and one stood out finely in the local paper with ones unapproachable yearly harvest of certificates thus i was not only a genuinely keen student but also a little of a prig and poseur in those daysand the latter kept the former at it as london made clear  moreover wimblehurst had given me no outlet in any other direction  but i did not realise all this when i came to london did not perceive how the change of atmosphere began at once to warp and distribute my energies in the first place i became invisible if i idled for a day no one except my fellowstudents who evidently had no awe for me remarked it no one saw my midnight taper no one pointed me out as i crossed the street as an astonishing intellectual phenomenon in the next place i became inconsiderable in wimblehurst i felt i stood for science nobody there seemed to have so much as i and to have it so fully and completely in london i walked ignorant in an immensity and it was clear that among my fellowstudents from the midlands and the north i was illequipped and undertrained with the utmost exertion i should only take a secondary position among them and finally in the third place i was distracted by voluminous new interests london took hold of me and science which had been the universe shrank back to the dimensions of tiresome little formulae compacted in a book i came to london in late september and it was a very different london from that great greylyovercast smokestained housewilderness of my first impressions i reached it by victoria and not by cannon street and its centre was now in exhibition road it shone pale amber bluegrey and tenderly spacious and fine under clear autumnal skies a london of hugely handsome buildings and vistas and distances a london of gardens and labyrinthine tall museums of old trees and remote palaces and artificial waters i lodged near by in west brompton at a house in a little square  so london faced me the second time making me forget altogether for a while the grey drizzling city visage that had first looked upon me i settled down and went to and fro to my lectures and laboratory in the beginning i worked hard and only slowly did the curiosity that presently possessed me to know more of this huge urban province arise the desire to find something beyond mechanism that i could serve some use other than learning with this was a growing sense of loneliness a desire for adventure and intercourse i found myself in the evenings poring over a map of london i had bought instead of copying out lecture notesand on sundays i made explorations taking omnibus rides east and west and north and south and to enlarging and broadening the sense of great swarming hinterlands of humanity with whom i had no dealings of whom i knew nothing  the whole illimitable place teemed with suggestions of indefinite and sometimes outrageous possibility of hidden but magnificent meanings  it wasnt simply that i received a vast impression of space and multitude and opportunity intimate things also were suddenly dragged from neglected veiled and darkened corners into an acute vividness of perception close at hand in the big art museum i came for the first time upon the beauty of nudity which i had hitherto held to be a shameful secret flaunted and gloried in i was made aware of beauty as not only permissible but desirable and frequent and of a thousand hitherto unsuspected rich aspects of life one night in a real rapture i walked round the upper gallery of the albert hall and listened for the first time to great music i believe now that it was a rendering of beethovens ninth symphony  my apprehension of spaces and places was reinforced by a quickened apprehension of persons a constant stream of people passed by me eyes met and challenged mine and passedmore and more i wanted then to stayif i went eastward towards piccadilly women who seemed then to my boyish inexperience softly splendid and alluring murmured to me as they passed extraordinarily life unveiled the very hoardings clamoured strangely at ones senses and curiosities one bought pamphlets and papers full of strange and daring ideas transcending ones boldest in the parks one heard men discussing the very existence of god denying the rights of property debating a hundred things that one dared not think about in wimblehurst and after the ordinary overcast day after dull mornings came twilight and london lit up and became a thing of white and yellow and red jewels of light and wonderful floods of golden illumination and stupendous and unfathomable shadowsand there were no longer any mean or shabby peoplebut a great mysterious movement of unaccountable beings  always i was coming on the queerest new aspects late one saturday night i found myself one of a great slowmoving crowd between the blazing shops and the flaring barrows in the harrow road i got into conversation with two boldeyed girls bought them boxes of chocolate made the acquaintance of father and mother and various younger brothers and sisters sat in a publichouse hilariously with them all standing and being stood drinks and left them in the small hours at the door of home never to see them again and once i was accosted on the outskirts of a salvation army meeting in one of the parks by a silkhatted young man of eager and serious discourse who argued against scepticism with me invited me home to tea into a clean and cheerful family of brothers and sisters and friends and there i spent the evening singing hymns to the harmonium which reminded me of halfforgotten chatham and wishing all the sisters were not so obviously engaged  then on the remote hill of this boundless cityworld i found ewart  iii  how well i remember the first morning a bright sunday morning in early october when i raided in upon ewart i found my old schoolfellow in bed in a room over an oilshop in a back street at the foot of highgate hill his landlady a pleasant dirty young woman with softbrown eyes brought down his message for me to come up and up i went the room presented itself as ample and interesting in detail and shabby with a quite commendable shabbiness i had an impression of brown wallsthey were papered with brown paperof a long shelf along one side of the room with dusty plaster casts and a small cheap lay figure of a horse of a table and something of grey wax partially covered with a cloth and of scattered drawings there was a gas stove in one corner and some enameled ware that had been used for overnight cooking the oilcloth on the floor was streaked with a peculiar white dust ewart himself was not in the first instance visible but only a fourfold canvas screen at the end of the room from which shouts proceeded of come on then his wiry black hair very much rumpled and a staring redbrown eye and his stump of a nose came round the edge of this at a height of about three feet from the ground its old ponderevo he said the early bird and hes caught the worm by jove but its cold this morning come round here and sit on the bed  i walked round wrung his hand and we surveyed one another  he was lying on a small wooden foldup bed the scanty covering of which was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still cheerful pair of check trousers and he was wearing pajamas of a virulent pink and green his neck seemed longer and more stringy than it had been even in our schooldays and his upper lip had a wiry black moustache the rest of his ruddy knobby countenance his erratic hair and his general hairy leanness had not evento my perceptions grown  by jove he said youve got quite decentlooking ponderevo what do you think of me  youre all right what are you doing here  art my sonsculpture and incidentally he hesitated i ply a trade will you hand me that pipe and those smoking things so you cant make coffee eh well try your hand cast down this screennofold it up and so well go into the other room ill keep in bed all the same the fires a gas stove yes dont make it bang too loud as you light iti cant stand it this morning you wont smoke  well it does me good to see you again ponderevo tell me what youre doing and how youre getting on  he directed me in the service of his simple hospitality and presently i came back to his bed and sat down and smiled at him there smoking comfortably with his hands under his head surveying me  hows lifes morning ponderevo by jove it must be nearly six years since we met theyve got moustaches weve fleshed ourselves a bit eh and you  i felt a pipe was becoming after all and that lit i gave him a favourable sketch of my career  science and youve worked like that while ive been potting round doing odd jobs for stonemasons and people and trying to get to sculpture ive a sort of feeling that the chiseli began with painting ponderevo and found i was colourblind colourblind enough to stop it ive drawn about and thought aboutthought more particularly i give myself three days a week as an art student and the rest of the time ive a sort of trade that keeps me and were still in the beginning of things young men starting do you remember the old times at goudhurst our dollshouse island the retreat of the ten thousand young holmes and the rabbits eh its surprising if you think of it to find we are still young and we used to talk of what we would be and we used to talk of love i suppose you know all about that now ponderevo  i finished and hesitated on some vague foolish lie no i said a little ashamed of the truth do you ive been too busy  im just beginningjust as we were then things happen  he sucked at his pipe for a space and stared at the plaster cast of a flayed hand that hung on the wall  the fact is ponderevo im beginning to find life a most extraordinary queer setout the things that pull one the things that dont the wantsthis business of sex its a net no end to it no way out of it no sense in it there are times when women take possession of me when my mind is like a painted ceiling at hampton court with the pride of the flesh sprawling all over it why and then again sometimes when i have to encounter a woman i am overwhelmed by a terror of tantalising boredomi fly i hide i do anything youve got your scientific explanations perhaps whats nature and the universe up to in that matter  its her way i gather of securing the continuity of the species  but it doesnt said ewart thats just it no i have succumbed todissipationdown the hill there euston road way and it was damned ugly and mean and i hate having done it and the continuity of the specieslord and why does nature make a man so infernally ready for drinks theres no sense in that anyhow he sat up in bed to put this question with the greater earnestness and why has she given me a most violent desire towards sculpture and an equally violent desire to leave off work directly i begin it eh lets have some more coffee i put it to you these things puzzle me ponderevo they dishearten me they keep me in bed  he had an air of having saved up these difficulties for me for some time he sat with his chin almost touching his knees sucking at his pipe  thats what i mean he went on when i say life is getting on to me as extraordinarily queer i dont see my game nor why i was invited and i dont make anything of the world outside either what do you make of it  london i began itsso enormous  isnt it and its all up to nothing you find chaps keeping grocers shopswhy the devil ponderevo do they keep grocers shops they all do it very carefully very steadily very meanly you find people running about and doing the most remarkable things being policemen for example and burglars they go about these businesses quite gravely and earnestly i somehowcant go about mine is there any sense in it at allanywhere  there must be sense in it i said were young  were youngyes but one must inquire the grocers a grocer because i suppose he sees he comes in there feels that on the whole it amounts to a call but the bother is i dont see where i come in at all do you  where you come in  no where you come in  not exactly yet i said i want to do some good in the worldsomethingsomething effectual before i die i have a sort of idea my scientific worki dont know  yes he mused and ive got a sort of idea my sculpturebut now it is to come in and whyive no idea at all he hugged his knees for a space thats what puzzles me ponderevo no end  he became animated if you will look in that cupboard he said you will find an old respectable looking roll on a plate and a knife somewhere and a gallipot containing butter you give them me and ill make my breakfast and then if you dont mind watching me paddle about at my simple toilet ill get up then well go for a walk and talk about this affair of life further and about art and literature and anything else that crops up on the way yes thats the gallipot cockroach got in it chuck him outdamned interloper  so in the first five minutes of our talk as i seem to remember it now old ewart struck the note that ran through all that mornings intercourse  to me it was a most memorable talk because it opened out quite new horizons of thought id been working rather close and out of touch with ewarts free gesticulating way he was pessimistic that day and sceptical to the very root of things he made me feel clearly what i had not felt at all before the general adventurousness of life particularly of life at the stage we had reached and also the absence of definite objects of any concerted purpose in the lives that were going on all round us he made me feel too how ready i was to take up commonplace assumptions just as i had always imagined that somewhere in social arrangements there was certainly a headmaster who would intervene if one went too far so i had always had a sort of implicit belief that in our england there were somewhere people who understood what we were all as a nation about that crumpled into his pit of doubt and vanished  he brought out sharply cut and certain the immense effect of purposelessness in london that i was already indistinctly feeling we found ourselves at last returning through highgate cemetery and waterlow parkand ewart was talking  look at it there he said stopping and pointing to the great vale of london spreading wide and far its like a seaand we swim in it and at last down we go and then up we comewashed up here he swung his arms to the long slopes about us tombs and headstones in long perspectives in limitless rows  were young ponderevo but sooner or later our whitened memories will wash up on one of these beaches on some such beach as this george ponderevo frs sidney ewart rip look at the rows of em  he paused do you see that hand the hand i mean pointing upward on the top of a blunted obelisk yes well thats what i do for a livingwhen im not thinking or drinking or prowling or making love or pretending im trying to be a sculptor without either the money or the morals for a model see and i do those hearts afire and those pensive angel guardians with the palm of peace damned well i do em and damned cheap im a sweated victim ponderevo  that was the way of it anyhow i drank deep of talk that day we went into theology into philosophy i had my first glimpse of socialism i felt as though i had been silent in a silence since i and he had parted at the thought of socialism ewarts moods changed for a time to a sort of energy after all all this confounded vagueness might be altered if you could get men to work together  it was a good talk that rambled through all the universe i thought i was giving my mind refreshment but indeed it was dissipation all sorts of ideas even now carry me back as it were to a fountainhead to waterlow park and my resuscitated ewart there stretches away south of us long garden slopes and white gravestones and the wide expanse of london and somewhere in the picture is a red old wall sunwarmed and a great blaze of michaelmas daisies set off with late golden sunflowers and a drift of mottled bloodred fallen leaves it was with me that day as though i had lifted my head suddenly out of dull and immediate things and looked at life altogether but it played the very devil with the copying up of my arrears of notes to which i had vowed the latter half of that day  after that reunion ewart and i met much and talked much and in our subsequent encounters his monologue was interrupted and i took my share he had exercised me so greatly that i lay awake at nights thinking him over and discoursed and answered him in my head as i went in the morning to the college i am by nature a doer and only by the way a critic his philosophical assertion of the incalculable vagueness of life which fitted his natural indolence roused my more irritable and energetic nature to active protests its all so pointless i said because people are slack and because its in the ebb of an age but youre a socialist well lets bring that about and theres a purpose there you are  ewart gave me all my first conceptions of socialism in a little while i was an enthusiastic socialist and he was a passive resister to the practical exposition of the theories he had taught me we must join some organisation i said we ought to do things we ought to go and speak at street corners people dont know  you must figure me a rather illdressed young man in a state of great earnestness standing up in that shabby studio of his and saying these things perhaps with some gesticulations and ewart with a claysmudged face dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and trousers with a pipe in his mouth squatting philosophically at a table working at some chunk of clay that never got beyond suggestion  i wonder why one doesnt want to he said  it was only very slowly i came to gauge ewarts real position in the scheme of things to understand how deliberate and complete was this detachment of his from the moral condemnation and responsibilities that played so fine a part in his talk his was essentially the nature of an artistic appreciator he could find interest and beauty in endless aspects of things that i marked as evil or at least as not negotiable and the impulse i had towards selfdeception to sustained and consistent selfdevotion disturbed and detached and pointless as it was at that time he had indeed a sort of admiration for but no sympathy like many fantastic and ample talkers he was at bottom secretive and he gave me a series of little shocks of discovery throughout our intercourse  the first of these came in the realisation that he quite seriously meant to do nothing in the world at all towards reforming the evils he laid bare in so easy and dexterous a manner the next came in the sudden appearance of a person called millyive forgotten her surnamewhom i found in his room one evening simply attired in a blue wrapthe rest of her costume behind the screensmoking cigarettes and sharing a flagon of an amazingly cheap and selfassertive grocers wine ewart affected called canary sack hullo said ewart as i came in this is milly you know shes been being a modelshe is a model really keep calm ponderevo have some sack  milly was a woman of thirty perhaps with a broad rather pretty face a placid disposition a bad accent and delightful blond hair that waved off her head with an irrepressible variety of charm and whenever ewart spoke she beamed at him ewart was always sketching this hair of hers and embarking upon clay statuettes of her that were never finished she was i know now a woman of the streets whom ewart had picked up in the most casual manner and who had fallen in love with him but my inexperience in those days was too great for me to place her then and ewart offered no elucidations she came to him he went to her they took holidays together in the country when certainly she sustained her fair share of their expenditure i suspect him now even of taking money from her odd old ewart it was a relationship so alien to my orderly conceptions of honour to what i could imagine any friend of mine doing that i really hardly saw it with it there under my nose but i see it and i think i understand it now  before i fully grasped the discursive manner in which ewart was committed to his particular way in life i did i say as the broad constructive ideas of socialism took hold of me try to get him to work with me in some definite fashion as a socialist  we ought to join on to other socialists i said  theyve got something  lets go and look at some first  after some pains we discovered the office of the fabian society lurking in a cellar in clements inn and we went and interviewed a rather discouraging secretary who stood astraddle in front of a fire and questioned us severely and seemed to doubt the integrity of our intentions profoundly he advised us to attend the next open meeting in cliffords inn and gave us the necessary data we both contrived to get to the affair and heard a discursive gritty paper on trusts and one of the most inconclusive discussions you can imagine threequarters of the speakers seemed under some jocular obsession which took the form of pretending to be conceited it was a sort of family joke and as strangers to the family we did not like it as we came out through the narrow passage from cliffords inn to the strand ewart suddenly pitched upon a wizened spectacled little man in a vast felt hat and a large orange tie  how many members are there in this fabian society of yours he asked  the little man became at once defensive in his manner  about seven hundred he said perhaps eight  likelike the ones here  the little man gave a nervous selfsatisfied laugh i suppose theyre up to sample he said  the little man dropped out of existence and we emerged upon the strand ewart twisted his arm into a queerly eloquent gesture that gathered up all the tall facades of the banks the business places the projecting clock and towers of the law courts the advertisements the luminous signs into one social immensity into a capitalistic system gigantic and invincible  these socialists have no sense of proportion he said what can you expect of them  iv  ewart as the embodiment of talk was certainly a leading factor in my conspicuous failure to go on studying social theory in its first crude form of democratic socialism gripped my intelligence more and more powerfully i argued in the laboratory with the man who shared my bench until we quarreled and did not speak and also i fell in love  the ferment of sex had been creeping into my being like a slowly advancing tide through all my wimblehurst days the stimulus of london was like the rising of a wind out of the sea that brings the waves in fast and high ewart had his share in that more and more acutely and unmistakably did my perception of beauty form and sound my desire for adventure my desire for intercourse converge on this central and commanding business of the individual life i had to get me a mate  i began to fall in love faintly with girls i passed in the street with women who sat before me in trains with girl fellowstudents with ladies in passing carriages with loiterers at the corners with neathanded waitresses in shops and tearooms with pictures even of girls and women on my rare visits to the theatre i always became exalted and found the actresses and even the spectators about me mysterious attractive creatures of deep interest and desire i had a stronger and stronger sense that among these glancing passing multitudes there was somewhere one who was for me and in spite of every antagonistic force in the world there was something in my very marrow that insisted stop look at this one think of her wont she do this signifiesthis before all things signifies stop why are you hurrying by this may be the predestined personbefore all others  it is odd that i cant remember when first i saw marion who became my wifewhom i was to make wretched who was to make me wretched who was to pluck that fine generalised possibility of love out of my early manhood and make it a personal conflict i became aware of her as one of a number of interesting attractive figures that moved about in my world that glanced back at my eyes that flitted by with a kind of averted watchfulness i would meet her coming through the art museum which was my short cut to the brompton road or see her sitting reading as i thought in one of the bays of the education library but really as i found out afterwards she never read she used to come there to eat a bun in quiet she was a very gracefullymoving figure of a girl then very plainly dressed with dark brown hair i remember in a knot low on her neck behind that confessed the pretty roundness of her head and harmonised with the admirable lines of ears and cheek the grave serenity of mouth and brow  she stood out among the other girls very distinctly because they dressed more than she did struck emphatic notes of colour startled one by novelties in hats and bows and things ive always hated the rustle the disconcerting colour boundaries the smart unnatural angles of womens clothes her plain black dress gave her a starkness  i do remember though how one afternoon i discovered the peculiar appeal of her form for me i had been restless with my work and had finally slipped out of the laboratory and come over to the art museum to lounge among the pictures i came upon her in an odd corner of the sheepshanks gallery intently copying something from a picture that hung high i had just been in the gallery of casts from the antique my mind was all alive with my newly awakened sense of line and there she stood with face upturned her body drooping forward from the hips just a littlememorably gracefulfeminine  after that i know i sought to see her felt a distinctive emotion at her presence began to imagine things about her i no longer thought of generalised womanhood or of this casual person or that i thought of her  an accident brought us together i found myself one monday morning in an omnibus staggering westward from victoriai was returning from a sunday id spent at wimblehurst in response to a unique freak of hospitality on the part of mr mantell she was the sole other inside passenger and when the time came to pay her fare she became an extremely scared disconcerted and fumbling young woman she had left her purse at home  luckily i had some money  she looked at me with startled troubled brown eyes she permitted my proffered payment to the conductor with a certain ungraciousness that seemed a part of her shyness and then as she rose to go she thanked me with an obvious affectation of ease  thank you so much she said in a pleasant soft voice and then less gracefully awfully kind of you you know  i fancy i made polite noises but just then i wasnt disposed to be critical i was full of the sense of her presence her arm was stretched out over me as she moved past me the gracious slenderness of her body was near me the words we used didnt seem very greatly to matter i had vague ideas of getting out with herand i didnt  that encounter i have no doubt exercised me enormously i lay awake at night rehearsing it and wondering about the next phase of our relationship that took the form of the return of my twopence i was in the science library digging something out of the encyclopedia britannica when she appeared beside me and placed on the open page an evidently premeditated thin envelope bulgingly confessing the coins within  it was so very kind of you she said the other day i dont know what i should have done mr  i supplied my name i knew i said you were a student here  not exactly a student i  well anyhow i knew you were here frequently and im a student myself at the consolidated technical schools  i plunged into autobiography and questionings and so entangled her in a conversation that got a quality of intimacy through the fact that out of deference to our fellowreaders we were obliged to speak in undertones and i have no doubt that in substance it was singularly banal indeed i have an impression that all our early conversations were incredibly banal we met several times in a manner halfaccidental half furtive and wholly awkward mentally i didnt take hold of her i never did take hold of her mentally her talk i now know all too clearly was shallow pretentious evasive onlyeven to this dayi dont remember it as in any way vulgar she was i could see quite clearly anxious to overstate or conceal her real social status a little desirous to be taken for a student in the art school and a little ashamed that she wasnt she came to the museum to copy things and this i gathered had something to do with some way of partially earning her living that i wasnt to inquire into i told her things about myself vain things that i felt might appeal to her but that i learnt long afterwards made her think me conceited we talked of books but there she was very much on her guard and secretive and rather more freely of pictures she liked pictures i think from the outset i appreciated and did not for a moment resent that hers was a commonplace mind that she was the unconscious custodian of something that had gripped my most intimate instinct that she embodied the hope of a possibility was the careless proprietor of a physical quality that had turned my head like strong wine i felt i had to stick to our acquaintance flat as it was presently we should get through these irrelevant exterior things and come to the reality of love beneath  i saw her in dreams released as it were from herself beautiful worshipful glowing and sometimes when we were together we would come on silences through sheer lack of matter and then my eyes would feast on her and the silence seemed like the drawing back of a curtainher superficial self odd i confess odd particularly the enormous hold of certain things about her upon me a certain slight rounded duskiness of skin a certain perfection of modelling in her lips her brow a certain fine flow about the shoulders she wasnt indeed beautiful to many peoplethese things are beyond explaining she had manifest defects of form and feature and they didnt matter at all her complexion was bad but i dont think it would have mattered if it had been positively unwholesome i had extraordinarily limited extraordinarily painful desires i longed intolerably to kiss her lips  v  the affair was immensely serious and commanding to me i dont remember that in these earlier phases i had any thought of turning back at all it was clear to me that she regarded me with an eye entirely more critical than i had for her that she didnt like my scholarly untidiness my want of even the most commonplace style why do you wear collars like that she said and sent me in pursuit of gentlemanly neckwear i remember when she invited me a little abruptly one day to come to tea at her home on the following sunday and meet her father and mother and aunt that i immediately doubted whether my hitherto unsuspected best clothes would create the impression she desired me to make on her belongings i put off the encounter until the sunday after to get myself in order i had a morning coat made and i bought a silk hat and had my reward in the first glance of admiration she ever gave me i wonder how many of my sex are as preposterous i was you see abandoning all my beliefs my conventions unasked i was forgetting myself immensely and there was a conscious shame in it all never a worddid i breathe to ewartto any living soul of what was going on  her father and mother and aunt struck me as the dismalest of people and her home in walham green was chiefly notable for its black and amber tapestry carpets and curtains and tablecloths and the age and irrelevance of its books mostly books with faded gilt on the covers the windows were fortified against the intrusive eye by cheap lace curtains and an art pot upon an unstable octagonal table several framed art school drawings of marions bearing official south kensington marks of approval adorned the room and there was a black and gilt piano with a hymnbook on the top of it there were draped mirrors over all the mantels and above the sideboard in the diningroom in which we sat at tea was a portrait of her father villainously truthful after the manner of such works i couldnt see a trace of the beauty i found in her in either parent yet she somehow contrived to be like them both  these people pretended in a way that reminded me of the three great women in my mothers room but they had not nearly so much social knowledge and did not do it nearly so well also i remarked they did it with an eye on marion they had wanted to thank me they said for the kindness to their daughter in the matter of the bus fare and so accounted for anything unusual in their invitation they posed as simple gentlefolk a little hostile to the rush and gaddingabout of london preferring a secluded and unpretentious quiet  when marion got out the white tablecloth from the sideboarddrawer for tea a card bearing the word apartments fell to the floor i picked it up and gave it to her before i realised from her quickened colour that i should not have seen it that probably had been removed from the window in honour of my coming  her father spoke once in a large remote way of he claims of business engagements and it was only long afterwards i realised that he was a supernumerary clerk in the walham green gas works and otherwise a useful man at home he was a large loose fattish man with unintelligent brown eyes magnified by spectacles he wore an illfitting frockcoat and a paper collar and he showed me as his great treasure and interest a large bible which he had grangerised with photographs of pictures also he cultivated the little gardenyard behind the house and he had a small greenhouse with tomatoes i wish i ad eat he said one can do such a lot with eat but i suppose you cant ave everything you want in this world  both he and marions mother treated her with a deference that struck me as the most natural thing in the world her own manner changed became more authoritative and watchful her shyness disappeared she had taken a line of her own i gathered draped the mirror got the secondhand piano and broken her parents in  her mother must once have been a pretty woman she had regular features and marions hair without its lustre but she was thin and careworn the aunt miss ramboat was a large abnormally shy person very like her brother and i dont recall anything she said on this occasion  to begin with there was a good deal of tension marion was frightfully nervous and every one was under the necessity of behaving in a mysteriously unreal fashion until i plunged became talkative and made a certain ease and interest i told them of the schools of my lodgings of wimblehurst and my apprenticeship days theres a lot of this science about nowadays mr ramboat reflected but i sometimes wonder a bit what good it is  i was young enough to be led into what he called a bit of a discussion which marion truncated before our voices became unduly raised i dare say she said theres much to be said on both sides  i remember marions mother asked me what church i attended and that i replied evasively after tea there was music and we sang hymns i doubted if i had a voice when this was proposed but that was held to be a trivial objection and i found sitting close beside the sweep of hair from marions brow had many compensations i discovered her mother sitting in the horsehair armchair and regarding us sentimentally i went for a walk with marion towards putney bridge and then there was more singing and a supper of cold bacon and pie after which mr ramboat and i smoked during that walk i remember she told me the import of her sketchings and copyings in the museum a cousin of a friend of hers whom she spoke of as smithie had developed an original business in a sort of teagown garment which she called a persian robe a plain sort of wrap with a gaily embroidered yoke and marion went there and worked in the busy times in the times that werent busy she designed novelties in yokes by an assiduous use of eyes and notebook in the museum and went home and traced out the captured forms on the foundation material i dont get much said marion but its interesting and in the busy times we work all day of course the workgirls are dreadfully common but we dont say much to them and smithie talks enough for ten  i quite understood the workgirls were dreadfully common  i dont remember that the walham green menage and the quality of these people nor the light they threw on marion detracted in the slightest degree at that time from the intent resolve that held me to make her mine i didnt like them but i took them as part of the affair indeed on the whole i think they threw her up by an effect of contrast she was so obviously controlling them so consciously superior to them  more and more of my time did i give to this passion that possessed me i began to think chiefly of ways of pleasing marion of acts of devotion of treats of sumptuous presents for her of appeals she would understand if at times she was manifestly unintelligent in her ignorance became indisputable i told myself her simple instincts were worth all the education and intelligence in the world and to this day i think i wasnt really wrong about her there was something extraordinarily fine about her something simple and high that flickered in and out of her ignorance and commonness and limitations like the tongue from the mouth of a snake  one night i was privileged to meet her and bring her home from an entertainment at the birkbeck institute we came back on the underground railway and we travelled firstclassthat being the highest class available we were alone in the carriage and for the first time i ventured to put my arm about her  you mustnt she said feebly  i love you i whispered suddenly with my heart beating wildly drew her to me drew all her beauty to me and kissed her cool and unresisting lips  love me she said struggling away from me dont and then as the train ran into a station you must tell no one i dont know you shouldnt have done that  then two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for a time  when we found ourselves alone together walking towards battersea she had decided to be offended i parted from her unforgiven and terribly distressed  when we met again she told me i must never say that again  i had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction but it was indeed only the beginning of desires i told her my one ambition was to marry her  but she said youre not in a positionwhats the good of talking like that  i stared at her i mean to i said  you cant she answered it will be years  but i love you i insisted  i stood not a yard from the sweet lips i had kissed i stood within arms length of the inanimate beauty i desired to quicken and i saw opening between us a gulf of years toil waiting disappointments and an immense uncertainty  i love you i said dont you love me  she looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes  i dont know she said i like you of course one has to be sensibl  i can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient reply i should have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening fire but how was i to know i had let myself come to want her my imagination endowed her with infinite possibilities i wanted her and wanted her stupidly and instinctively  but i said love  one has to be sensible she replied i like going about with you cant we keep as we are  vi  well you begin to understand my breakdown now i have been copious enough with these apologia my work got more and more spiritless my behaviour degenerated my punctuality declined i was more and more outclassed in the steady grind by my fellowstudents such supplies of moral energy as i still had at command shaped now in the direction of serving marion rather than science  i fell away dreadfully more and more i shirked and skulked the humped men from the north the pale men with thin clenched minds the intent hardbreathing students i found against me fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt even a girl got above me upon one of the lists then indeed i made it a point of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that i really did not even pretend to try  so one day i found myself sitting in a mood of considerable astonishment in kensington gardens reacting on a recent heated interview with the school registrar in which i had displayed more spirit than sense i was astonished chiefly at my stupendous falling away from all the militant ideals of unflinching study i had brought up from wimblehurst i had displayed myself as the registrar put it an unmitigated rotter my failure to get marks in the written examination had only been equalled by the insufficiency of my practical work  i ask you the registrar had said what will become of you when your scholarship runs out  it certainly was an interesting question what was going to become of me  it was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as i had once dared to hope there seemed indeed scarcely anything in the world except an illpaid assistantship in some provincial organized science school or grammar school i knew that for that sort of work without a degree or any qualification one earned hardly a bare living and had little leisure to struggle up to anything better if only i had even as little as fifty pounds i might hold out in london and take my bsc degree and quadruple my chances my bitterness against my uncle returned at the thought after all he had some of my money still or ought to have why shouldnt i act within my rights threaten to take proceedings i meditated for a space on the idea and then returned to the science library and wrote him a very considerable and occasionally pungent letter  that letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure its remarkable consequences which ended my student days altogether i will tell in the next chapter  i say my failure yet there are times when i can even doubt whether that period was a failure at all when i become defensively critical of those exacting courses i did not follow the encyclopaedic process of scientific exhaustion from which i was distracted my mind was not inactive even if it fed on forbidden food i did not learn what my professors and demonstrators had resolved i should learn but i learnt many things my mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself  after all those other fellows who took high places in the college examinations and were the professors model boys havent done so amazingly some are professors themselves some technical experts not one can show things done such as i following my own interest have achieved for i have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes no one ever dreamt of such boats until i built them and i have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries in the unexpected hidingplaces of nature i have come nearer flying than any man has done could i have done as much if i had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind if i had been trained in researchthat ridiculous contradiction in termsshould i have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions of which there are already too many i see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter even by the standards of worldly success i am by the side of my fellowstudents no failure i had my frs by the time i was thirtyseven and if i am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the spanish inquisition suppose i had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to things worked by soandsos excellent method and soandsos indications where should i be now  i may be all wrong in this it may be i should be a far more efficient man than i am if i had cut off all those divergent expenditures of energy plugged up my curiosity about society with more currently acceptable rubbish or other abandoned ewart evaded marion instead of pursuing her concentrated but i dont believe it  however i certainly believed it completely and was filled with remorse on that afternoon when i sat dejectedly in kensington gardens and reviewed in the light of the registrars pertinent questions my first two years in london    chapter the second  the dawn comes and my uncle appears in a new silk hat  i  throughout my student days i had not seen my uncle i refrained from going to him in spite of an occasional regret that in this way i estranged myself from my aunt susan and i maintained a sulky attitude of mind towards him and i dont think that once in all that time i gave a thought to that mystic word of his that was to alter all the world for us yet i had not altogether forgotten it it was with a touch of memory dim transient perplexity if no morewhy did this thing seem in some way personalthat i read a new inscription upon the hoardings       the secret of vigour      tonobungay  that was all it was simple and yet in some way arresting i found myself repeating the word after i had passed it roused ones attention like the sound of distant guns tonowhats that and deep rich unhurryingbungay  then came my uncles amazing telegram his answer to my hostile note come to me at once you are wanted three hundred a year certain tonobungay  by jove i cried of course  its something a patentmedicine i wonder what he wants with me  in his napoleonic way my uncle had omitted to give an address his telegram had been handed in at farringdon road and after complex meditations i replied to ponderevo farringdon road trusting to the rarity of our surname to reach him  where are you i asked  his reply came promptly  192a raggett street ec  the next day i took an unsanctioned holiday after the mornings lecture i discovered my uncle in a wonderfully new silk hatoh a splendid hat with a rolling brim that went beyond the common fashion it was decidedly too big for himthat was its only fault it was stuck on the back of his head and he was in a white waistcoat and shirt sleeves he welcomed me with a forgetfulness of my bitter satire and my hostile abstinence that was almost divine his glasses fell off at the sight of me his round inexpressive eyes shone brightly he held out his plump short hand  here we are george what did i tell you neednt whisper it now my boy shout itloud spread it about tell every one tonotono tonobungay  raggett street you must understand was a thoroughfare over which some one had distributed large quantities of cabbage stumps and leaves it opened out of the upper end of farringdon street and 192a was a shop with the plateglass front coloured chocolate on which several of the same bills i had read upon the hoardings had been stuck the floor was covered by street mud that had been brought in on dirty boots and three energetic young men of the hooligan type in neckwraps and caps were packing wooden cases with paperedup bottles amidst much straw and confusion the counter was littered with these same swathed bottles of a pattern then novel but now amazingly familiar in the world the blue paper with the coruscating figure of a genially nude giant and the printed directions of how under practically all circumstances to take tonobungay beyond the counter on one side opened a staircase down which i seem to remember a girl descending with a further consignment of bottles and the rest of the background was a high partition also chocolate with temporary laboratory inscribed upon it in white letters and over a door that pierced it office here i rapped inaudible amid much hammering and then entered unanswered to find my uncle dressed as i have described one hand gripping a sheath of letters and the other scratching his head as he dictated to one of three toiling typewriter girls behind him was a further partition and a door inscribed absolutely privateno admission thereon this partition was of wood painted the universal chocolate up to about eight feet from the ground and then of glass through the glass i saw dimly a crowded suggestion of crucibles and glass retorts andby joveyesthe dear old wimblehurst airpump still it gave me quite a little thrillthat airpump and beside it was the electrical machinebut somethingsome serious troublehad happened to that all these were evidently placed on a shelf just at the level to show  come right into the sanctum said my uncle after he had finished something about esteemed consideration and whisked me through the door into a room that quite amazingly failed to verify the promise of that apparatus it was papered with dingy wallpaper that had peeled in places it contained a fireplace an easychair with a cushion a table on which stood two or three big bottles a number of cigarboxes on the mantel whisky tantalus and a row of soda syphons he shut the door after me carefully  well here we are he said going strong have a whisky george nowise man neither will i you see me at it at ithard  hard at what  read it and he thrust into my hand a labelthat label that has now become one of the most familiar objects of the chemists shop the greenishblue rather oldfashioned bordering the legend the name in good black type very clear and the strong man all set about with lightning flashes above the double column of skilful lies in redthe label of tonobungay its afloat he said as i stood puzzling at this its afloat im afloat and suddenly he burst out singing in that throaty tenor of his  im afloat im afloat on the fierce flowing tide the oceans my home and my bark is my bride  ripping song that is george not so much a bark as a solution but stillit does here we are at it bytheby half a mo ive thought of a thing he whisked out leaving me to examine this nuclear spot at leisure while his voice became dictatorial without the den struck me as in its large grey dirty way quite unprecedented and extraordinary the bottles were all labelled simply a b c and so forth and that dear old apparatus above seen from this side was even more patiently on the shelf than when it had been used to impress wimblehurst i saw nothing for it but to sit down in the chair and await my uncles explanations i remarked a frockcoat with satin lapels behind the door there was a dignified umbrella in the corner and a clothesbrush and a hatbrush stood on a sidetable my uncle returned in five minutes looking at his watcha gold watchgettin lunchtime george he said youd better come and have lunch with me  hows aunt susan i asked  exuberant never saw her so larky this has bucked her up something wonderfulall this  all what  tonobungay  what is tonobungay i asked  my uncle hesitated tell you after lunch george he said come along and having locked up the sanctum after himself led the way along a narrow dirty pavement lined with barrows and swept at times by avalanchelike porters bearing burthens to vans to farringdon street he hailed a passing cab superbly and the cabman was infinitely respectful schafers he said and off we went side by sideand with me more and more amazed at all these thingsto schafers hotel the second of the two big places with huge lace curtaincovered windows near the corner of blackfriars bridge  i will confess i felt a magic charm in our relative proportions as the two colossal paleblueandred liveried porters of schafers held open the inner doors for us with a respectful salutation that in some manner they seemed to confine wholly to my uncle instead of being about four inches taller i felt at least the same size as he and very much slenderer still more respectfulwaiters relieved him of the new hat and the dignified umbrella and took his orders for our lunch he gave them with a fine assurance  he nodded to several of the waiters  they know me george already he said point me out live place eye for coming men  the detailed business of the lunch engaged our attention for a while and then i leant across my plate and now said i  its the secret of vigour didnt you read that label  yes but  its selling like hot cakes  and what is it i pressed  well said my uncle and then leant forward and spoke softly under cover of his hand its nothing more or less than  but here an unfortunate scruple intervenes after all tonobungay is still a marketable commodity and in the hands of purchasers who bought it fromamong other vendorsme no i am afraid i cannot give it away  you see said my uncle in a slow confidential whisper with eyes very wide and a creased forehead its nice because of the here he mentioned a flavouring matter and an aromatic spirit its stimulating because of here he mentioned two very vivid tonics one with a marked action on the kidney and the here he mentioned two other ingredients makes it pretty intoxicating cocks their tails then theres but i touch on the essential secret and there you are i got it out of an old book of recipesall except the here he mentioned the more virulent substance the one that assails the kidneys which is my idea modern touch there you are  he reverted to the direction of our lunch  presently he was leading the way to the loungesumptuous piece in red morocco and yellow glazed crockery with incredible vistas of settees and sofas and things and there i found myself grouped with him in two excessively upholstered chairs with an earthenware moorish table between us bearing coffee and benedictine and i was tasting the delights of a tenpenny cigar my uncle smoked a similar cigar in an habituated manner and he looked energetic and knowing and luxurious and most unexpectedly a little bounder round the end of it it was just a trivial flaw upon our swagger perhaps that we both were clear our cigars had to be mild he got obliquely across the spaces of his great armchair so as to incline confidentially to my ear he curled up his little legs and i in my longer way adopted a corresponding receptive obliquity i felt that we should strike an unbiased observer as a couple of very deep and wily and developing and repulsive persons  i want to let you into thispuffgeorge said my uncle round the end of his cigar for many reasons  his voice grew lower and more cunning he made explanations that to my inexperience did not completely explain i retain an impression of a long credit and a share with a firm of wholesale chemists of a credit and a prospective share with some pirate printers of a third share for a leading magazine and newspaper proprietor  i played em off one against the other said my uncle i took his point in an instant he had gone to each of them in turn and said the others had come in  i put up four hundred pounds said my uncle myself and my all and you know  he assumed a brisk confidence i hadnt five hundred pence at least  for a moment he really was just a little embarrassed i did he said produce capital you see there was that trust affair of yoursi ought i supposein strict legalityto have put that straight first zzzz  it was a bold thing to do said my uncle shifting the venue from the region of honour to the region of courage and then with a characteristic outburst of piety thank god its all come right  and now i suppose you ask where do you come in well fact is ive always believed in you george youve gotits a sort of dismal grit bark your shins rouse you and youll go youd rush any position you had a mind to rush i know a bit about character georgetrust me youve got he clenched his hands and thrust them out suddenly and at the same time said with explosive violence wooosh yes you have the way you put away that latin at wimblehurst ive never forgotten it  woooooosh your science and all that woooooosh i know my limitations theres things i can do and he spoke in a whisper as though this was the first hint of his lifes secret theres things i cant well i can create this business but i cant make it go im too voluminousim a boilerover not a simmering stickatit you keep on hotting up and hotting up papins digester thats you steady and long and piling upthen woooooooosh come in and stiffen these niggers teach them that woooooooosh there you are thats what im after you nobody else believes youre more than a boy come right in with me and be a man eh george think of the fun of ita thing on the goa real live thing wooshing it up making it buzz and spin whoooooohe made alluring expanding circles in the air with his hand eh  his proposal sinking to confidential undertones again took more definite shape i was to give all my time and energy to developing and organising you shant write a single advertisement or give a single assurance he declared i can do all that and the telegram was no flourish i was to have three hundred a year three hundred a year thats nothing said my uncle the thing to freeze on to when the time comes is your tenth of the vendors share  three hundred a year certain anyhow it was an enormous income to me for a moment i was altogether staggered could there be that much money in the whole concern i looked about me at the sumptuous furniture of schafers hotel no doubt there were many such incomes  my head was spinning with unwonted benedictine and burgundy  let me go back and look at the game again i said let me see upstairs and round about  i did  what do you think of it all my uncle asked at last  well for one thing i said why dont you have those girls working in a decently ventilated room apart from any other consideration theyd work twice as briskly and they ought to cover the corks before labelling round the bottle  why said my uncle  becausethey sometimes make a mucker of the cork job and then the labels wasted  come and change it george said my uncle with sudden fervour come here and make a machine of it you can make it all slick and then make it woosh i know you can oh i know you can  ii  i seem to remember very quick changes of mind after that lunch the muzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly to a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance which is one of my habitual mental states it is intermittent it leaves me for weeks together i know but back it comes at last like justice on circuit and calls up all my impression all my illusions all my willful and passionate proceedings we came downstairs again into that inner room which pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass lights and indeed was a lurking place my uncle pressed a cigarette on me and i took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped his umbrella in the corner deposited the new silk hat that was a little too big for him on the table blew copiously and produced a second cigar  it came into my head that he had shrunken very much in size since the wimblehurst days that the cannon ball he had swallowed was rather more evident and shameless than it had been his skin less fresh and the nose between his glasses which still didnt quite fit much redder and just then he seemed much laxer in his muscles and not quite as alertly quick in his movements but he evidently wasnt aware of the degenerative nature of his changes as he sat there looking suddenly quite little under my eyes  well george he said quite happily unconscious of my silent criticism what do you think of it all  well i said in the first placeits a damned swindle  tut tut said my uncle its as straight asits fair trading  so much the worse for trading i said  its the sort of thing everybody does after all theres no harm in the stuffand it may do good it might do a lot of goodgiving people confidence frinstance against an epidemic see why not dont see where your swindle comes in  hm i said its a thing you either see or dont see  id like to know what sort of trading isnt a swindle in its way everybody who does a large advertised trade is selling something common on the strength of saying its uncommon look at chicksonthey made him a baronet look at lord radmore who did it on lying about the alkali in soap rippin ads those were of his too  you dont mean to say you think doing this stuff up in bottles and swearing its the quintessence of strength and making poor devils buy it at that is straight  why not george how do we know it maynt be the quintessence to them so far as theyre concerned  oh i said and shrugged my shoulders  theres faith you put faith in em i grant our labels are a bit emphatic christian science really no good setting people against the medicine tell me a solitary trade nowadays that hasnt to beemphatic its the modern way everybody understands iteverybody allows for it  but the world would be no worse and rather better if all this stuff of yours was run down a conduit into the thames  dont see that george at all mong other things all our people would be out of work unemployed i grant you tonobungay may benot quite so good a find for the world as peruvian bark but the point is georgeit makes trade and the world lives on trade commerce a romantic exchange of commodities and property romance magination see you must look at these things in a broad light look at the woodand forget the trees and hang it george we got to do these things theres no way unless you do what do you mean to doanyhow  theres ways of living i said without either fraud or lying  youre a bit stiff george theres no fraud in this affair ill bet my hat but what do you propose to do go as chemist to some one who is running a business and draw a salary without a share like i offer you much sense in that it comes out of the swindle as you call itjust the same  some businesses are straight and quiet anyhow supply a sound article that is really needed dont shout advertisements  no george there youre behind the times the last of that sort was sold up bout five years ago  well theres scientific research  and who pays for that who put up that big city and guilds place at south kensington enterprising business men they fancy theyll have a bit of science going on they want a handy expert ever and again and there you are and what do you get for research when youve done it just a bare living and no outlook they just keep you to make discoveries and if they fancy theyll use em they do  one can teach  how much a year george how much a year i suppose you must respect carlyle well you take carlyles testsolvency lord what a book that french revolution of his is see what the world pays teachers and discoverers and what it pays business men that shows the ones it really wants theres a justice in these big things george over and above the apparent injustice i tell you it wants trade its trade that makes the world go round argosies venice empire  my uncle suddenly rose to his feet  you think it over george you think it over and come up on sunday to the new placewe got rooms in gower street nowand see your aunt shes often asked for you george often and often and thrown it up at me about that bit of propertythough ive always said and always will that twentyfive shillings in the pound is what ill pay you and interest up to the nail and think it over it isnt me i ask you to help its yourself its your aunt susan its the whole concern its the commerce of your country and we want you badly i tell you straight i know my limitations you could take this place you could make it go i can see you at itlooking rather sour woosh is the word george  and he smiled endearingly  i got to dictate a letter he said ending the smile and vanished into the outer room  iii  i didnt succumb without a struggle to my uncles allurements indeed i held out for a week while i contemplated life and my prospects it was a crowded and muddled contemplation it invaded even my sleep  my interview with the registrar my talk with my uncle my abrupt discovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for marion had combined to bring me to sense of crisis what was i going to do with life  i remember certain phases of my indecisions very well  i remember going home from our talk i went down farringdon street to the embankment because i thought to go home by holborn and oxford street would be too crowded for thinking that piece of embankment from blackfriars to westminster still reminds me of that momentous hesitation  you know from first to last i saw the business with my eyes open i saw its ethical and moral values quite clearly never for a moment do i remember myself faltering from my persuasion that the sale of tonobungay was a thoroughly dishonest proceeding the stuff was i perceived a mischievous trash slightly stimulating aromatic and attractive likely to become a bad habit and train people in the habitual use of stronger tonics and insidiously dangerous to people with defective kidneys it would cost about sevenpence the large bottle to make including bottling and we were to sell it at half a crown plus the cost of the patent medicine stamp a thing that i will confess deterred me from the outset far more than the sense of dishonesty in this affair was the supreme silliness of the whole concern i still clung to the idea that the world of men was or should be a sane and just organisation and the idea that i should set myself gravely just at the fine springtime of my life to developing a monstrous bottling and packing warehouse bottling rubbish for the consumption of foolish credulous and depressed people had in it a touch of insanity my early beliefs still clung to me i felt assured that somewhere there must be a hitch in the fine prospect of ease and wealth under such conditions that somewhere a little overgrown perhaps but still traceable lay a neglected wasted path of use and honour for me  my inclination to refuse the whole thing increased rather than diminished at first as i went along the embankment in my uncles presence there had been a sort of glamour that had prevented an outright refusal it was a revival of affection for him i felt in his presence i think in part and in part an instinctive feeling that i must consider him as my host but much more was it a curious persuasion he had the knack of inspiringa persuasion not so much of his integrity and capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the world one felt that he was silly and wild but in some way silly and wild after the fashion of the universe after all one must live somehow i astonished him and myself by temporising  no said i ill think it over  and as i went along the embankment the first effect was all against my uncle he shrankfor a little while he continued to shrinkin perspective until he was only a very small shabby little man in a dirty back street sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish buyers the great buildings on the right of us the inns and the school board placeas it was thensomerset house the big hotels the great bridges westminsters outlines ahead had an effect of grey largeness that reduced him to the proportions of a busy black beetle in a crack in the floor  and then my eye caught the advertisements on the south side of sorbers food of cracknells ferric wine very bright and prosperous signs illuminated at night and i realised how astonishingly they looked at home there how evidently part they were in the whole thing  i saw a man come charging out of palace yardthe policeman touched his helmet to himwith a hat and a bearing astonishingly like my uncles after alldidnt cracknell himself sit in the house  tonobungay shouted at me from a hoarding near adelphi terrace i saw it afar off near carfax street it cried out again upon me in kensington high street and burst into a perfect clamour six or seven times i saw it as i drew near my diggings it certainly had an air of being something more than a dream  yes i thought it overthoroughly enough trade rules the world wealth rather than trade the thing was true and true too was my uncles proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle he was frightfully right after all pecunnia non oleta roman emperor said that perhaps my great heroes in plutarch were no more than such men fine now only because they are distant perhaps after all this socialism to which i had been drawn was only a foolish dream only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true morris and these others played with it wittingly it gave a zest a touch of substance to their aesthetic pleasures never would there be good faith enough to bring such things about they knew it every one except a few young fools knew it as i crossed the corner of st jamess park wrapped in thought i dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys a stout commonlooking woman very magnificently dressed regarded me from the carriage with a scornful eye no doubt thought i a pillvendors wife  running through all my thoughts surging out like a refrain was my uncles masterstroke his admirable touch of praise make it all slickand then make it go woosh i know you can oh i know you can  iv  ewart as a moral influence was unsatisfactory i had made up my mind to put the whole thing before him partly to see how he took it and partly to hear how it sounded when it was said i asked him to come and eat with me in an italian place near panton street where one could get a curious interesting glutting sort of dinner for eighteenpence he came with a disconcerting blackeye that he wouldnt explain not so much a blackeye he said as the aftermath of a purple patch whats your difficulty  ill tell you with the salad i said  but as a matter of fact i didnt tell him i threw out that i was doubtful whether i ought to go into trade or stick to teaching in view of my deepening socialist proclivities and he warming with the unaccustomed generosity of a sixteenpenny chianti ran on from that without any further inquiry as to my trouble  his utterances roved wide and loose  the reality of life my dear ponderevo i remember him saying very impressively and punctuating with the nutcrackers as he spoke is chromatic conflict  and form get hold of that and let all these other questions go the socialist will tell you one sort of colour and shape is right the individualist another what does it all amount to what does it all amount to nothing i have no advice to give anyoneexcept to avoid regrets be yourself seek after such beautiful things as your own sense determines to be beautiful and dont mind the headache in the morning for what after all is a morning ponderevo it isnt like the upper part of a day  he paused impressively  what rot i cried after a confused attempt to apprehend him  isnt it and its my bedrock wisdom in the matter take it or leave it my dear george take it or leave it he put down the nutcrackers out of my reach and lugged a greasylooking notebook from his pocket im going to steal this mustard pot he said  i made noises of remonstrance  only as a matter of design ive got to do an old beasts tomb  wholesale grocer ill put it on his cornersfour mustard pots i dare say hed be glad of a mustard plaster now to cool him poor devil where he is but anyhowhere goes  v  it came to me in the small hours that the real moral touchstone for this great doubting of mind was marion i lay composing statements of my problem and imagined myself delivering them to herand she goddesslike and beautiful giving her fine simplyworded judgment  you see its just to give ones self over to the capitalistic system i imagined myself saying in good socialist jargon its surrendering all ones beliefs we may succeed we may grow rich but where would the satisfaction be  then she would say no that wouldnt be right  but the alternative is to wait  then suddenly she would become a goddess she would turn upon me frankly and nobly with shining eyes with arms held out no she would say we love one another nothing ignoble shall ever touch us we love one another why wait to tell each other that dear what does it matter that we are poor and may keep poor  but indeed the conversation didnt go at all in that direction at the sight of her my nocturnal eloquence became preposterous and all the moral values altered altogether i had waited for her outside the door of the parsianrobe establishment in kensington high street and walked home with her thence i remember how she emerged into the warm evening light and that she wore a brown straw hat that made her for once not only beautiful but pretty  i like that hat i said by way of opening and she smiled her rare delightful smile at me  i love you i said in an undertone as we jostled closer on the pavement  she shook her head forbiddingly but she still smiled thenbe sensible  the high street pavement is too narrow and crowded for conversation and we were some way westward before we spoke again  look here i said i want you marion dont you understand i want you  now she cried warningly  i do not know if the reader will understand how a passionate lover an immense admiration and desire can be shot with a gleam of positive hatred such a gleam there was in me at the serene selfcomplacency of that now it vanished almost before i felt it i found no warning in it of the antagonisms latent between us  marion i said this isnt a trifling matter to me i love you i would die to get you dont you care  but what is the good  you dont care i cried you dont care a rap  you know i care she answered if i didntif i didnt like you very much should i let you come and meet mego about with you  well then i said promise to marry me  if i do what difference will it make  we were separated by two men carrying a ladder who drove between us unawares  marion i asked when we got together again i tell you i want you to marry me  we cant  why not  we cant marryin the street  we could take our chance  i wish you wouldnt go on talking like this what is the good  she suddenly gave way to gloom its no good marrying she said ones only miserable ive seen other girls when ones alone one has a little pocketmoney anyhow one can go about a little but think of being married and no money and perhaps childrenyou cant be sure  she poured out this concentrated philosophy of her class and type in jerky uncompleted sentences with knitted brows with discontented eyes towards the westward glowforgetful it seemed for a moment even of me  look here marion i said abruptly what would you marry on  what is the good she began  would you marry on three hundred a year  she looked at me for a moment thats six pounds a week she said one could manage on that easily smithies brotherno he only gets two hundred and fifty he married a typewriting girl  will you marry me if i get three hundred a year  she looked at me again with a curious gleam of hope  if she said  i held out my hand and looked her in the eyes its a bargain i said  she hesitated and touched my hand for an instant its silly she remarked as she did so it means really were she paused  yes said i  engaged youll have to wait years what good can it do you  not so many years i answered  for a moment she brooded  then she glanced at me with a smile halfsweet halfwistful that has stuck in my memory for ever  i like you she said i shall like to be engaged to you  and faint on the threshold of hearing i caught her ventured dear its odd that in writing this down my memory passed over all that intervened and i feel it all again and once again im marions boyish lover taking great joy in such rare and little things  vi  at last i went to the address my uncle had given me in gower street and found my aunt susan waiting tea for him  directly i came into the room i appreciated the change in outlook that the achievement of tonobungay had made almost as vividly as when i saw my uncles new hat the furniture of the room struck upon my eye as almost stately the chairs and sofa were covered with chintz which gave it a dim remote flavour of bladesover the mantel the cornice the gas pendant were larger and finer than the sort of thing i had grown accustomed to in london and i was shown in by a real housemaid with real tails to her cap and great quantities of reddish hair there was my aunt too looking bright and pretty in a bluepatterned teawrap with bows that seemed to me the quintessence of fashion she was sitting in a chair by the open window with quite a pile of yellowlabelled books on the occasional table beside her before the large paperdecorated fireplace stood a threetiered cakestand displaying assorted cakes and a tray with all the tea equipage except the teapot was on the large centretable the carpet was thick and a spice of adventure was given it by a number of dyed sheepskin mats  hello said my aunt as i appeared its george  shall i serve the tea now mem said the real housemaid surveying our greeting coldly  not till mr ponderevo comes meggie said my aunt and grimaced with extraordinary swiftness and virulence as the housemaid turned her back  meggie she calls herself said my aunt as the door closed and left me to infer a certain want of sympathy  youre looking very jolly aunt said i  what do you think of all this old business hes got asked my aunt  seems a promising thing i said  i suppose there is a business somewhere  havent you seen it  fraid id say something at it george if i did so he wont let me it came on quite suddenly brooding he was and writing letters and sizzling something awfullike a chestnut going to pop then he came home one day saying tonobungay till i thought he was clean off his onion and singingwhat was it  im afloat im afloat i guessed  the very thing youve heard him and saying our fortunes were made took me out to the hoburm restaurant georgedinner and we had champagne stuff that blows up the back of your nose and makes you go so and he said at last hed got things worthy of meand we moved here next day its a swell house george three pounds a week for the rooms and he says the businessll stand it  she looked at me doubtfully  either do that or smash i said profoundly  we discussed the question for a moment mutely with our eyes my aunt slapped the pile of books from mudies  ive been having such a go of reading george you never did  what do you think of the business i asked  well theyve let him have money she said and thought and raised her eyebrows  its been a time she went on the flapping about me sitting doing nothing and him on the go like a rocket hes done wonders but he wants you georgehe wants you sometimes hes full of hopetalks of when were going to have a carriage and be in societymakes it seem so natural and topsyturvy i hardly know whether my old heels arent up here listening to him and my old head on the floor then he gets depressed says he wants restraint says he can make a splash but cant keep on says if you dont come in everything will smashbut you are coming in  she paused and looked at me  well  you dont say you wont come in  but look here aunt i said do you understand quite its a quack medicine its trash  theres no law against selling quack medicine that i know of said my aunt she thought for a minute and became unusually grave its our only chance george she said if it doesnt go  there came the slamming of a door and a loud bellowing from the next apartment through the folding doors hereer shee rulk lies poo tom booling  silly old concertina hark at him george she raised her voice dont sing that you old walrus you sing im afloat  one leaf of the folding doors opened and my uncle appeared  hullo george come along at last gossome teacake susan  thought it over george he said abruptly  yes said i  coming in  i paused for a last moment and nodded yes  ah he cried why couldnt you say that a week ago  ive had false ideas about the world i said oh they dont matter now yes ill come ill take my chance with you i wont hesitate again  and i didnt i stuck to that resolution for seven long years   chapter the third  how we made tonobungay hum  i  so i made my peace with my uncle and we set out upon this bright enterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at oneandthreehalfpence and twoandnine a bottle including the government stamp we made tonobungay hum it brought us wealth influence respect the confidence of endless people all that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement tonobungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of scientific research no passionate service of humanity could ever have given me  it was my uncles genius that did it no doubt he needed mei was i will admit his indispensable right hand but his was the brain to conceive he wrote every advertisement some of them even he sketched you must remember that his were the days before the time took to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that antiquated encyclopedia that alluring buttonholing letme justtellyouquitesoberlysomethingyououghttoknow style of newspaper advertisement with every now and then a convulsive jump of some attractive phrase into capitals was then almost a novelty many people who are moderately well think they are quite well was one of his early efforts the jerks in capitals were do not need drugs or medicine and simply a proper regimen to get you in tone one was warned against the chemist or druggist who pushed muchadvertised nostrums on ones attention that trash did more harm than good the thing needed was regimenand tonobungay  very early too was that bright little quarter column at least it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers hilaritytonobungay like mountain air in the veins the penetrating trio of questions are you bored with your business are you bored with your dinner are you bored with your wifethat too was in our gower street days both these we had in our first campaign when we worked london south central and west and then too we had our first posterthe health beauty and strength one that was his design i happen still to have got by me the first sketch he made for it i have reproduced it here with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of london  the second one is about eighteen months later the germ of the wellknown fog poster the third was designed for an influenza epidemic but never issued  these things were only incidental in my department  i had to polish them up for the artist and arrange the business of printing and distribution and after my uncle had had a violent and needless quarrel with the advertising manager of the daily regulator about the amount of display given to one of his happy thoughts i also took up the negotiations of advertisements for the press  we discussed and worked out distribution together first in the drawingroom floor in gower street with my aunt sometimes helping very shrewdly and then with a steadily improving type of cigar and older and older whisky in his smuggery at their first house the one in beckenham often we worked far into the night sometimes until dawn  we really worked infernally hard and i recall we worked with a very decided enthusiasm not simply on my uncles part but mine it was a game an absurd but absurdly interesting game and the points were scored in cases of bottles people think a happy notion is enough to make a man rich that fortunes can be made without toil its a dream as every millionaire except one or two lucky gamblers can testify i doubt if jd rockefeller in the early days of standard oil worked harder than we did we worked far into the nightand we also worked all day we made a rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced to keep things rightfor at first we could afford no properly responsible underlingsand we traveled london pretending to be our own representatives and making all sorts of special arrangements  but none of this was my special work and as soon as we could get other men in i dropped the traveling though my uncle found it particularly interesting and kept it up for years does me good george to see the chaps behind their counters like i was once he explained my special and distinctive duty was to give tonobungay substance and an outward and visible bottle to translate my uncles great imaginings into the creation of case after case of labelled bottles of nonsense and the punctual discharge of them by railway road and steamer towards their ultimate goal in the great stomach of the people by all modern standards the business was as my uncle would say absolutely bona fide we sold our stuff and got the money and spent the money honestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff section by section we spread it over the whole of the british isles first working the middleclass london suburbs then the outer suburbs then the home counties then going with new bills and a more pious style of ad into wales a great field always for a new patentmedicine and then into lancashire  my uncle had in his inner office a big map of england and as we took up fresh sections of the local press and our consignments invaded new areas flags for advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed our progress  the romance of modern commerce george my uncle would say rubbing his hands together and drawing in air through his teeth the romance of modern commerce eh conquest province by province like sogers  we subjugated england and wales we rolled over the cheviots with a special adaptation containing eleven per cent of absolute alcohol tonobungay thistle brand we also had the fog poster adapted to a kilted briton in a misty highland scene  under the shadow of our great leading line we were presently taking subsidiary specialties into action tonobungay hair stimulant was our first supplement then came concentrated tonobungay for the eyes that didnt go but we had a considerable success with the hair stimulant we broached the subject i remember in a little catechism beginning why does the hair fall out because the follicles are fagged what are the follicles so it went on to the climax that the hair stimulant contained all the essential principles of that most reviving tonic tonobungay together with an emollient and nutritious oil derived from crude neats foot oil by a process of refinement separation and deodorization it will be manifest to any one of scientific attainments that in neats foot oil derived from the hoofs and horns of beasts we must necessarily have a natural skin and hair lubricant  and we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries tonobungay lozenges and tonobungay chocolate these we urged upon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain we gave them posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously vertical cliffs cyclist champions upon the track mounted messengers engaged in aixtoghent rides soldiers lying out in action under a hot sun you can go for twentyfour hours we declared on tonobungay chocolate we didnt say whether you could return on the same commodity we also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister wig sidewhiskers teeth a horribly lifelike portrait of all existing barristers talking at a table and beneath this legend a four hours speech on tonobungay lozenges and as fresh as when he began then brought in regiments of schoolteachers revivalist ministers politicians and the like i really do believe there was an element of kick in the strychnine in these lozenges especially in those made according to our earlier formula for we altered all our formulaeinvariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead  in a little whileso it seems to me nowwe were employing travelers and opening up great britain at the rate of a hundred square miles a day all the organisation throughout was sketched in a crude entangled halfinspired fashion by my uncle and all of it had to be worked out into a practicable scheme of quantities and expenditure by me we had a lot of trouble finding our travelers in the end at least half of them were irishamericans a wonderful breed for selling medicine we had still more trouble over our factory manager because of the secrets of the inner room and in the end we got a very capable woman mrs hampton diggs who had formerly managed a large millinery workroom whom we could trust to keep everything in good working order without finding out anything that wasnt put exactly under her loyal and energetic nose she conceived a high opinion of tonobungay and took it in all forms and large quantities so long as i knew her it didnt seem to do her any harm and she kept the girls going quite wonderfully  my uncles last addition to the tonobungay group was the tonobungay mouthwash the reader has probably read a hundred times that inspiring inquiry of his you are young yet but are you sure nothing has aged your gums  and after that we took over the agency for three or four good american lines that worked in with our own and could be handled with it texan embrocation and 23to clear the system were the chief  i set down these bare facts to me they are all linked with the figure of my uncle in some of the old seventeenth and early eighteenth century prayerbooks at bladesover there used to be illustrations with long scrolls coming out of the mouths of the woodcut figures i wish i could write all this last chapter on a scroll coming out of the head of my uncle show it all the time as unfolding and pouring out from a short fattening smalllegged man with stiff cropped hair disobedient glasses on a perky little nose and a round stare behind them i wish i could show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose as his pen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or a picture page and make you hear his voice charged with solemn import like the voice of a squeaky prophet saying george listn i got an ideer i got a notion george  i should put myself into the same picture best setting for us i think would be the beckenham snuggery because there we worked hardest it would be the lamplit room of the early nineties and the clock upon the mantel would indicate midnight or later we would be sitting on either side of the fire i with a pipe my uncle with a cigar or cigarette there would be glasses standing inside the brass fender our expressions would be very grave my uncle used to sit right back in his armchair his toes always turned in when he was sitting down and his legs had a way of looking curved as though they hadnt bones or joints but were stuffed with sawdust  george whadyer think of tb for seasickness he would say  no good that i can imagine  oom no harm trying george we can but try  i would suck my pipe hard to get at unless we sold our stuff specially at the docks might do a special at cooks office or in the continental bradshaw  it ud give em confidence george  he would zzzz with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing coals  no good hiding our light under a bushel he would remark  i never really determined whether my uncle regarded tonobungay as a fraud or whether he didnt come to believe in it in a kind of way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions i think that his average attitude was one of kindly almost parental toleration i remember saying on one occasion but you dont suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good all and how his face assumed a look of protest as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism  youve a hard nature george he said youre too ready to run things down how can one tell how can one venture to tell  i suppose any creative and developing game would have interested me in those years at any rate i know i put as much zeal into this tonobungay as any young lieutenant could have done who suddenly found himself in command of a ship it was extraordinarily interesting to me to figure out the advantage accruing from this shortening of the process or that and to weigh it against the capital cost of the alteration i made a sort of machine for sticking on the labels that i patented to this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from that i also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated got the bottles which all came sliding down a guarded slantway nearly filled with distilled water at one tap and dripped our magic ingredients in at the next this was an immense economy of space for the inner sanctum for the bottling we needed special taps and these too i invented and patented  we had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an inclined glass trough made slippery with running water at one end a girl held them up to the light put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough the filling was automatic at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet each tank the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water had a level indicator and inside i had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers who slipped them into their outer papers and put them with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packingcase it sounds wild i know but i believe i was the first man in the city of london to pack patent medicines through the side of the packingcase to discover there was a better way in than by the lid our cases packed themselves practically had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side our girls moreover packed with corrugated paper and matchbookwood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw many breakages and much waste and confusion  ii  as i look back at them now those energetic years seem all compacted to a year or so from the days of our first hazardous beginning in farringdon street with barely a thousand pounds worth of stuff or credit all toldand that got by something perilously like snatchingto the days when my uncle went to the public on behalf of himself and me onetenth share and our silent partners the drug wholesalers and the printing people and the owner of that group of magazines and newspapers to ask with honest confidence for l150000 those silent partners were remarkably sorry i know that they had not taken larger shares and given us longer credit when the subscriptions came pouring in my uncle had a clear half to play with including the onetenth understood to be mine  l150000think of itfor the goodwill in a string of lies and a trade in bottles of mitigated water do you realise the madness of the world that sanctions such a thing perhaps you dont at times use and wont certainly blinded me if it had not been for ewart i dont think i should have had an inkling of the wonderfulness of this development of my fortunes i should have grown accustomed to it fallen in with all its delusions as completely as my uncle presently did he was immensely proud of the flotation theyve never been given such value he said for a dozen years but ewart with his gesticulating hairy hands and bony wrists his singlehanded chorus to all this as it played itself over again in my memory and he kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time  its just on all fours with the rest of things he remarked only more so you neednt think youre anything out of the way  i remember one disquisition very distinctly it was just after ewart had been to paris on a mysterious expedition to rough in some work for a rising american sculptor this young man had a commission for an allegorical figure of truth draped of course for his state capitol and he needed help ewart had returned with his hair cut en brosse and with his costume completely translated into french he wore i remember a bicycling suit of purplishbrown baggy beyond ageingthe only creditable thing about it was that it had evidently not been made for hima voluminous black tie a decadent soft felt hat and several french expletives of a sinister description silly clothes arent they he said at the sight of my startled eye i dont know why i gotm they seemed all right over there  he had come down to our raggett street place to discuss a benevolent project of mine for a poster by him and he scattered remarkable discourse over the heads i hope it was over the heads of our bottlers  what i like about it all ponderevo is its poetry thats where we get the pull of the animals no animal would ever run a factory like this think one remembers the beaver of course he might very possibly bottle things but would he stick a label round em and sell em the beaver is a dreamy fool ill admit him and his dams but after all theres a sort of protection about em a kind of muddy practicality they prevent things getting at him and its not your poetry only its the poetry of the customer too poet answering to poetsoul to soul health strength and beautyin a bottlethe magic philtre like a fairy tale  think of the people to whom your bottles of footle go im calling it footle ponderevo out of praise he said in parenthesis  think of the little clerks and jaded women and overworked people people overstrained with wanting to do people overstrained with wanting to be people in fact overstrained the real trouble of life ponderevo isnt that we existthats a vulgar error the real trouble is that we dont really exist and we want to thats what thisin the highest sensejust stands for the hunger to befor oncereally aliveto the finger tips  nobody wants to do and be the things people arenobody you dont want to preside over thisthis bottling i dont want to wear these beastly clothes and be led about by you nobody wants to keep on sticking labels on silly bottles at so many farthings a gross that isnt existing thatssussubstratum none of us want to be what we are or to do what we do except as a sort of basis what do we want you know i know nobody confesses what we all want to be is something perpetually young and beautifulyoung jovesyoung joves ponderevohis voice became loud harsh and declamatorypursuing coy halfwilling nymphs through everlasting forests  there was a justperceptible listening hang in the work about us  come downstairs i interrupted we can talk better there  i can talk better here he answered  he was just going on but fortunately the implacable face of mrs hampton diggs appeared down the aisle of bottling machines  all right he said ill come  in the little sanctum below my uncle was taking a digestive pause after his lunch and by no means alert his presence sent ewart back to the theme of modern commerce over the excellent cigar my uncle gave him he behaved with the elaborate deference due to a business magnate from an unknown man  what i was pointing out to your nephew sir said ewart putting both elbows on the table was the poetry of commerce he doesnt you know seem to see it at all  my uncle nodded brightly whad i tell im he said round his cigar  we are artists you and i sir can talk if you will permit me as one artist to another its advertisement hasdone it advertisement has revolutionised trade and industry it is going to revolutionise the world the old merchant used to tote about commodities the new one creates values doesnt need to tote he takes something that isnt worth anythingor something that isnt particularly worth anythingand he makes it worth something he takes mustard that is just like anybody elses mustard and he goes about saying shouting singing chalking on walls writing inside peoples books putting it everywhere smiths mustard is the best and behold it is the best  true said my uncle chubbily and with a dreamy sense of mysticism true  its just like an artist he takes a lump of white marble on the verge of a limekiln he chips it about he makeshe makes a monument to himselfand othersa monument the world will not willingly let die talking of mustard sir i was at clapham junction the other day and all the banks are overgrown with horse radish thats got loose from a garden somewhere you know what horseradish isgrows like wildfirespreadsspreads i stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it like fame i thought rank and wild where it isnt wanted why dont the really good things in life grow like horseradish i thought my mind went off in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tini bought some the other day for a ham i had it came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard i had a sort of idea that i could plunge into business on that get rich and come back to my own proper monumental art again and then i said but why adulterate i dont like the idea of adulteration  shabby said my uncle nodding his head bound to get found out  and totally unnecessary too why not do up a mixturethreequarters pounded horseradish and a quarter mustardgive it a fancy nameand sell it at twice the mustard price see i very nearly started the business straight away only something happened my train came along  jolly good ideer said my uncle he looked at me that really is an ideer george he said  take shavins again you know that poem of longfellows sir that sounds exactly like the first declension what is itmarrs a maker men say  my uncle nodded and gurgled some quotation that died away  jolly good poem george he said in an aside to me  well its about a carpenter and a poetic victorian child you know and some shavins the child made no end out of the shavins so might you powder em they might be anything soak em in jipperxylotobacco powderem and get a little tar and turpentinous smell inwoodpacking for hot bathsa certain cure for the scourge of influenza theres all these patent grain foodswhat americans call cereals i believe im right sir in saying theyre sawdust  no said my uncle removing his cigar as far as i can find out its really grainspoilt grain ive been going into that  well there you are said ewart say its spoilt grain it carried out my case just as well your modern commerce is no more buying and selling than sculpture its mercyits salvation its rescue work it takes all sorts of fallen commodities by the hand and raises them cana isnt in it you turn waterinto tonobungay  tonobungays all right said my uncle suddenly grave we arent talking of tonobungay  your nephew sir is hard he wants everything to go to a sort of predestinated end hes a calvinist of commerce offer him a dustbin full of stuff he calls it refusepasses by on the other side now you sir youd make cinders respect themselves  my uncle regarded him dubiously for a moment but there was a touch of appreciation in his eye  might make em into a sort of sanitary brick he reflected over his cigar end  or a friable biscuit why not you might advertise why are birds so bright because they digest their food perfectly why do they digest their food so perfectly because they have a gizzard why hasnt man a gizzard because he can buy ponderevos asphalt triturating friable biscuitwhich is better  he delivered the last words in a shout with his hairy hand flourished in the air  damn clever fellow said my uncle after he had one i know a man when i see one hed do but drunk i should say but that only makes some chap brighter if he wants to do that poster he can zzzz that ideer of his about the horseradish theres something in that george im going to think over that  i may say at once that my poster project came to nothing in the end though ewart devoted an interesting week to the matter he let his unfortunate disposition to irony run away with him he produced a picture of two beavers with a subtle likeness he said to myself and my unclethe likeness to my uncle certainly wasnt half badand they were bottling rows and rows of tonobungay with the legend modern commerce it certainly wouldnt have sold a case though he urged it on me one cheerful evening on the ground that it would arouse curiosity in addition he produced a quite shocking study of my uncle excessively and needlessly nude but so far as i was able to judge an admirable likeness engaged in feats of strength of a gargantuan type before an audience of deboshed and shattered ladies the legend health beauty strength below gave a needed point to his parody this he hung up in the studio over the oil shop with a flap of brown paper by way of a curtain over it to accentuate its libellous offence   chapter the fourth  marion i  as i look back on those days in which we built up the great tonobungay property out of human hope and credit for bottles and rent and printing i see my life as it were arranged in two parallel columns of unequal width a wider more diffused eventful and various one which continually broadens out the business side of my life and a narrow darker and darkling one shot ever and again with a gleam of happiness my homelife with marion for of course i married marion  i didnt as a matter of fact marry her until a year after tonobungay was thoroughly afloat and then only after conflicts and discussions of a quite strenuous sort by that time i was twentyfour it seems the next thing to childhood now we were both in certain directions unusually ignorant and simple we were temperamentally antagonistic and we hadnti dont think we were capable ofan idea in common she was young and extraordinarily conventionalshe seemed never to have an idea of her own but always the idea of her classand i was young and sceptical enterprising and passionate the two links that held us together were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for me and her appreciation of her importance in my thoughts there can be no doubt of my passion for her in her i had discovered woman desired the nights i have lain awake on account of her writhing biting my wrists in a fever of longing   i have told how i got myself a silk hat and black coat to please her on sundayto the derision of some of my fellowstudents who charged to meet me and how we became engaged but that was only the beginning of our difference to her that meant the beginning of a not unpleasant little secrecy an occasional use of verbal endearments perhaps even kisses it was something to go on indefinitely interfering in no way with her gossiping spells of work at smithies to me it was a pledge to come together into the utmost intimacy of soul and body so soon as we could contrive it  i dont know if it will strike the reader that i am setting out to discuss the queer unwise love relationship and my bungle of a marriage with excessive solemnity but to me it seems to reach out to vastly wider issues than our little personal affair ive thought over my life in these last few years ive tried to get at least a little wisdom out of it and in particular ive thought over this part of my life im enormously impressed by the ignorant unguided way in which we two entangled ourselves with each other it seems to me the queerest thing in all this network of misunderstandings and misstatements and faulty and ramshackle conventions which makes up our social order as the individual meets it that we should have come together so accidentally and so blindly because we were no more than samples of the common fate love is not only the cardinal fact in the individual life but the most important concern of the community after all the way in which the young people of this generation pair off determines the fate of the nation all the other affairs of the state are subsidiary to that and we leave it to flushed and blundering youth to stumble on its own significance with nothing to guide in but shocked looks and sentimental twaddle and base whisperings and cantsmeared examples  i have tried to indicate something of my own sexual development in the preceding chapter nobody was ever frank and decent with me in this relation nobody no book ever came and said to me thus and thus is the world made and so and so is necessary everything came obscurely indefinitely perplexingly and all i knew of law or convention in the matter had the form of threatenings and prohibitions except through the furtive shameful talk of my coevals at goudhurst and wimblehurst i was not even warned against quite horrible dangers my ideas were made partly of instinct partly of a romantic imagination partly woven out of a medley of scraps of suggestion that came to me haphazard i had read widely and confusedly vathek shelley tom paine plutarch carlyle haeckel william morris the bible the freethinker the clarion the woman who didi mention the ingredients that come first to mind all sorts of ideas were jumbled up in me and never a lucid explanation but it was evident to me that the world regarded shelley for example as a very heroic as well as beautiful person and that to defy convention and succumb magnificently to passion was the proper thing to do to gain the respect and affection of all decent people  and the makeup of marions mind in the matter was an equally irrational affair her training had been one not simply of silences but suppressions an enormous force of suggestion had so shaped her that the intense natural fastidiousness of girlhood had developed into an absolute perversion of instinct for all that is cardinal in this essential business of life she had one inseparable epithethorrid without any such training she would have been a shy lover but now she was an impossible one for the rest she had derived i suppose partly from the sort of fiction she got from the public library and partly from the workroom talk at smithies so far as the former origin went she had an idea of love as a state of worship and service on the part of the man and of condescension on the part of the woman there was nothing horrid about it in any fiction she had read the man gave presents did services sought to be in every way delightful the woman went out with him smiled at him was kissed by him in decorous secrecy and if he chanced to offend denied her countenance and presence usually she did something for his good to him made him go to church made him give up smoking or gambling smartened him up quite at the end of the story came a marriage and after that the interest ceased  that was the tenor of marions fiction but i think the worktable conversation at smithies did something to modify that at smithies it was recognised i think that a fellow was a possession to be desired that it was better to be engaged to a fellow than not that fellows had to be keptthey might be mislaid they might even be stolen there was a case of stealing at smithies and many tears  smithie i met before we were married and afterwards she became a frequent visitor to our house at ealing she was a thin brighteyed hawknosed girl of thirtyodd with prominent teeth a highpitched eager voice and a disposition to be urgently smart in her dress her hats were startling and various but invariably disconcerting and she talked in a rapid nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty and broken by little screams of oh my dear and you never did she was the first woman i ever met who used scent poor old smithie what a harmless kindly soul she really was and how heartily i detested her out of the profits on the persian robes she supported a sisters family of three children she helped a worthless brother and overflowed in help even to her workgirls but that didnt weigh with me in those youthfullynarrow times it was one of the intense minor irritations of my married life that smithies whirlwind chatter seemed to me to have far more influence with marion than anything i had to say before all things i coveted her grip upon marions inaccessible mind  in the workroom at smithies i gathered they always spoke of me demurely as a certain person i was rumoured to be dreadfully clever and there were doubtsnot altogether without justificationof the sweetness of my temper  ii  well these general explanations will enable the reader to understand the distressful times we two had together when presently i began to feel on a footing with marion and to fumble conversationally for the mind and the wonderful passion i felt obstinately and stupidity must be in her i think she thought me the maddest of sane men clever in fact which at smithies was i suppose the next thing to insanity a word intimating incomprehensible and incalculable motives she could be shocked at anything she misunderstood everything and her weapon was a sulky silence that knitted her brows spoilt her mouth and robbed her face of beauty well if we cant agree i dont see why you should go on talking she used to say that would always enrage me beyond measure or im afraid im not clever enough to understand that  silly little people i see it all now but then i was no older than she and i couldnt see anything but that marion for some inexplicable reason wouldnt come alive  we would contrive semisurreptitious walks on sunday and part speechless with the anger of indefinable offences poor marion the things i tried to put before her my fermenting ideas about theology about socialism about aestheticsthe very words appalled her gave her the faint chill of approaching impropriety the terror of a very present intellectual impossibility then by an enormous effort i would suppress myself for a time and continue a talk that made her happy about smithies brother about the new girl who had come to the workroom about the house we would presently live in but there we differed a little i wanted to be accessible to st pauls or cannon street station and she had set her mind quite resolutely upon eating it wasnt by any means quarreling all the time you understand she liked me to play the lover nicely she liked the effect of going aboutwe had lunches we went to earls court to kew to theatres and concerts but not often to concerts because though marion liked music she didnt like too much of it to picture showsand there was a nonsensical sort of babytalk i picked upi forget where nowthat became a mighty peacemaker  her worst offence for me was an occasional excursion into the smithie style of dressing debased west kensington for she had no sense at all of her own beauty she had no comprehension whatever of beauty of the body and she could slash her beautiful lines to rags with hatbrims and trimmings thank heaven a natural refinement a natural timidity and her extremely slender purse kept her from the real smithie efflorescence poor simple beautiful kindly limited marion now that i am fortyfive i can look back at her with all my old admiration and none of my old bitterness with a new affection and not a scrap of passion and take her part against the equally stupid drivinglyenergetic sensuous intellectual sprawl i used to be i was a young beast for her to have marrieda hound beast with her it was my business to understand and controland i exacted fellowship passion  we became engaged as i have told we broke it off and joined again we went through a succession of such phases we had no sort of idea what was wrong with us presently we were formally engaged i had a wonderful interview with her father in which he was stupendously grave and hless wanted to know about my origins and was tolerant exasperatingly tolerant because my mother was a servant and afterwards her mother took to kissing me and i bought a ring but the speechless aunt i gathered didnt approvehaving doubts of my religiosity whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days and to begin with every such separation was a relief and then i would want her a restless longing would come upon me i would think of the flow of her arms of the soft gracious bend of her body i would lie awake or dream of a transfigured marion of light and fire it was indeed dame nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid inexorable way but i thought it was the need of marion that troubled me so i always went back to marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us and more and more i urged her to marry me  in the long run that became a fixed idea it entangled my will and my pride i told myself i was not going to be beaten i hardened to the business i think as a matter of fact my real passion for marion had waned enormously long before we were married that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness when i felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for delay twelve months delay to see how things would turn out there were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out irritatingly against something i had to settle moreover i began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of tonobungays success by the change and movement in things the going to and fro i would forget her for days together and then desire her with an irritating intensity at last one saturday afternoon after a brooding morning i determined almost savagely that these delays must end  i went off to the little home at walham green and made marion come with me to putney common marion wasnt at home when i got there and i had to fret for a time and talk to her father who was just back from his office he explained and enjoying himself in his own way in the greenhouse  im going to ask your daughter to marry me i said i think weve been waiting long enough  i dont approve of long engagements either said her father but marion will have her own way about it anyhow seen this new powdered fertiliser  i went in to talk to mrs ramboat shell want time to get her things said mrs ramboat  i and marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees at the top of putney hill and i came to my point abruptly  look here marion i said are you going to marry me or are you not  she smiled at me well she said were engagedarent we  that cant go on for ever will you marry me next week  she looked me in the face we cant she said  you promised to marry me when i had three hundred a year  she was silent for a space cant we go on for a time as we are we could marry on three hundred a year but it means a very little house theres smithies brother they manage on two hundred and fifty but thats very little she says they have a semidetached house almost on the road and hardly a bit of garden and the wall to nextdoor is so thin they hear everything when her baby criesthey rap and people stand against the railings and talk cant we wait youre doing so well  an extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity i answered her with immense restraint  if i said we could have a doublefronted detached houseat ealing saywith a square patch of lawn in front and a garden behindandand a tiled bathroom  that would be sixty pounds a year at least  which means five hundred a year yes well you see i told my uncle i wanted that and ive got it  got what  five hundred pounds a year  five hundred pounds  i burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness  yes i said really and now what do you think  yes she said a little flushed but be sensible do you really mean youve got a rise all at once of two hundred a year  to marry onyes  she scrutinised me a moment youve done this as a surprise she said and laughed at my laughter she had become radiant and that made me radiant too  yes i said yes and laughed no longer bitterly  she clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes  she was so pleased that i forgot absolutely my disgust of a moment before i forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a year and that i had bought her at that  come i said standing up lets go towards the sunset dear and talk about it all do you knowthis is a most beautiful world an amazingly beautiful world and when the sunset falls upon you it makes you into shining gold no not goldinto golden glass into something better that either glass or gold  and for all that evening i wooed her and kept her glad she made me repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little  we furnished that doublefronted house from atticit ran to an atticto cellar and created a garden  do you know pampas grass said marion i love pampas grass if there is room  you shall have pampas grass i declared and there were moments as we went in imagination about that house together when my whole being cried out to take her in my armsnow but i refrained on that aspect of life i touched very lightly in that talk very lightly because i had had my lessons she promised to marry me within two months time shyly reluctantly she named a day and next afternoon in heat and wrath we broke it off again for the last time we split upon procedure i refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake in white favours carriages and the rest of it it dawned upon me suddenly in conversation with her and her mother that this was implied i blurted out my objection forthwith and this time it wasnt any ordinary difference of opinion it was a row i dont remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that dispute i remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance but george dear you must have a caketo send home i think we all reiterated things i seem to remember a refrain of my own a marriage is too sacred a thing too private a thing for this display her father came in and stood behind me against the wall and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms looking from speaker to speaker a sternly gratified prophetess it didnt occur to me then how painful it was to marion for these people to witness my rebellion  but george said her father what sort of marriage do you want you dont want to go to one of those there registry offices  thats exactly what id like to do marriage is too private a thing  i shouldnt feel married said mrs ramboat  look here marion i said we are going to be married at a registry office i dont believe in all these fripperies and superstitions and i wont submit to them ive agreed to all sorts of things to please you  whats he agreed to said her fatherunheeded  i cant marry at a registry office said marion sallowwhite  very well i said ill marry nowhere else  i cant marry at a registry office  very well i said standing up white and tense and it amazed me but i was also exultant then we wont marry at all  she leant forward over the table staring blankly but presently her halfaverted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the table and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder  iii  the next day i did an unexampled thing i sent a telegram to my uncle bad temper not coming to business and set off for highgate and ewart he was actually at workon a bust of millie and seemed very glad for any interruption  ewart you old fool i said knock off and come for a days gossip im rotten theres a sympathetic sort of lunacy about you lets go to staines and paddle up to windsor  girl said ewart putting down a chisel  yes  that was all i told him of my affair  ive got no money he remarked to clear up ambiguity in my invitation  we got a jar of shandygaff some food and on ewarts suggestion two japanese sunshades in staines we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and meditation our boat moored in a shady place this side of windsor i seem to remember ewart with a cushion forward only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing a voice and no more against the shining smoothlystreaming mirror of the trees and bushes  its not worth it was the burthen of the voice youd better get yourself a millie ponderevo and then you wouldnt feel so upset  no i said decidedly thats not my way  a thread of smoke ascended from ewart for a while like smoke from an altar  everythings a muddle and you think it isnt nobody knows where we arebecause as a matter of fact we arent anywhere are women propertyor are they fellowcreatures or a sort of proprietary goddesses theyre so obviously fellowcreatures you believe in the goddess  no i said thats not my idea  what is your idea  well  hm said ewart in my pause  my idea i said is to meet one person who will belong to meto whom i shall belongbody and soul no halfgods wait till she comes if she comes at all we must come to each other young and pure  theres no such thing as a pure person or an impure person mixed to begin with  this was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether  and if you belong to her and she to you ponderevowhich ends the head  i made no answer except an impatient oh  for a time we smoked in silence  did i tell you ponderevo of a wonderful discovery ive made ewart began presently  no i said what is it  theres no mrs grundy  no  no practically not ive just thought all that business out shes merely an instrument ponderevo shes borne the blame grundys a man grundy unmasked rather lean and out of sorts early middle age with bunchy black whiskers and a worried eye been good so far and its fretting him moods theres grundy in a state of sexual panic for examplefor gods sake cover it up they get togetherthey get together its too exciting the most dreadful things are happening rushing aboutlong arms going like a windmill they must be kept apart starts out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute separations one side of the road for men and the other for women and a hoardingwithout posters between them every boy and girl to be sewed up in a sack and sealed just the head and hands and feet out until twentyone music abolished calico garments for the lower animals sparrows to be suppressedabsolutely  i laughed abruptly  well thats mr grundy in one moodand it puts mrs grundyshes a muchmaligned person ponderevoa rake at heartand it puts her in a most painful state of flustermost painful shes an amenable creature when grundy tells her things are shocking shes shockedpink and breathless she goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of guilt behind a haughty expression  grundy meanwhile is in a state of complete whirlabout long lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating theyre still thinking of thingsthinking of things its dreadful they get it out of books i cant imagine where they get it i must watch therere people over there whispering nobody ought to whispertheres something suggestive in the mere act then pictures in the museumthings too dreadful for words why cant we have pure artwith the anatomy all wrong and pure and niceand pure fiction pure poetry instead of all this stuff with allusionsallusions excuse me theres something up behind that locked door the keyhole in the interests of public moralityyes sir as a pure good mani insistill lookit wont hurt mei insist on looking my dutymmmthe keyhole  he kicked his legs about extravagantly and i laughed again  thats grundy in one mood ponderevo it isnt mrs grundy thats one of the lies we tell about women theyre too simple simple woman are simple they take on just what men tell em  ewart meditated for a space just exactly as its put to them he said and resumed the moods of mr grundy  then you get old grundy in another mood ever caught him nosing ponderevo mad with the idea of mysterious unknown wicked delicious things things that arent respectable wow things he mustnt do any one who knows about these things knows theres just as much mystery and deliciousness about grundys forbidden things as there is about eating ham jolly nice if its a bright morning and youre well and hungry and having breakfast in the open air jolly unattractive if youre off colour but grundys covered it all up and hidden it and put mucky shades and covers over it until hes forgotten it begins to fester round it in his mind has dreadful struggleswith himself about impure thoughts then you set grundy with hot earscurious in undertones grundy on the loose grundy in a hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive movementsmaking things indecent evolvingin dense vapoursindecency  grundy sins oh yes hes a hypocrite sneaks round a corner and sins ugly its grundy and his dark corners that make vice vice we artistswe have no vices  and then hes frantic with repentance and wants to be cruel to fallen women and decent harmless sculptors of the simple nudelike meand so back to his panic again  mrs grundy i suppose doesnt know he sins i remarked  no im not so sure but bless her heart shes a woman shes a woman then again you get grundy with a large greasy smilelike an accident to a butter tuball over his face being liberal mindedgrundy in his antipuritan moments trying not to see harm in itgrundy the friend of innocent pleasure he makes you sick with the harm hes trying not to see in it  and thats why everythings wrong ponderevo grundy damn him stands in the light and we young people cant see his moods affect us we catch his gusts of panic his disease of nosing his greasiness we dont know what we may think what we may say he does his silly utmost to prevent our reading and seeing the one thing the one sort of discussion we findquite naturally and properlysupremely interesting so we dont adolescence we blunder up to sex daredare to lookand he may dirt you for ever the girls are terrorstricken to silence by his significant whiskers by the bleary something in his eyes  suddenly ewart with an almost jackinthebox effect sat up  hes about us everywhere ponderevo he said very solemnly sometimessometimes i think he isin our blood in mine  he regarded me for my opinion very earnestly with his pipe in the corner of his mouth  youre the remotest cousin he ever had i said  i reflected look here ewart i asked how would you have things different  he wrinkled up his queer face regarded the wait and made his pipe gurgle for a space thinking deeply  there are complications i admit weve grown up under the terror of grundy and that innocent but docile andyesformidable lady his wife i dont know how far the complications arent a disease a sort of bleaching under the grundy shadow it is possible there are things i have still to learn about women man has eaten of the tree of knowledge his innocence is gone you cant have your cake and eat it were in for knowledge lets have it plain and straight i should begin i think by abolishing the ideas of decency and indecency  grundy would have fits i injected  grundy ponderevo would have cold douchespubliclyif the sight was not too painfulthree times a day but i dont think mind you that i should let the sexes run about together no the fact behind the sexesis sex its no good humbugging it trails abouteven in the best mixed company tugs at your ankle the men get showing off and quarrellingand the women or theyre bored i suppose the ancestral males have competed for the ancestral females ever since they were both some sort of grubby little reptile you arent going to alter that in a thousand years or so never should you have a mixed company neverexcept with only one man or only one woman how would that be  or duets only  how to manage it some rule of etiquette perhaps he became portentously grave  then his long hand went out in weird gestures  i seem to seei seem to seea sort of city of women ponderevo yes a walled enclosuregood stonemasons worka city wall high as the walls of rome going about a garden dozens of square miles of gardentreesfountainsarbourslakes lawns on which the women play avenues in which they gossip boats women like that sort of thing any woman whos been to a good eventful girls school lives on the memory of it for the rest of her life its one of the pathetic things about womenthe superiority of school and collegeto anything they get afterwards and this citygarden of women will have beautiful places for music places for beautiful dresses places for beautiful work everything a woman can want nurseries kindergartens schools and no manexcept to do rough work perhapsever comes in the men live in a world where they can hunt and engineer invent and mine and manufacture sail ships drink deep and practice the arts and fight  yes i said but  he stilled me with a gesture  im coming to that the homes of the women ponderevo will be set in the wall of their city each woman will have her own particular house and home furnished after her own heart in her own mannerwith a little balcony on the outside wall built into the walland a little balcony and there she will go and look out when the mood takes her and all round the city there will be a broad road and seats and great shady trees and men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine company when for instance they want to talk about their souls or their characters or any of the things that only women will stand the women will lean over and look at the men and smile and talk to them as they fancy and each woman will have this she will have a little silken ladder she can let down if she choosesif she wants to talk closer  the men would still be competing  there perhapsyes but theyd have to abide by the womens decisions  i raised one or two difficulties and for a while we played with this idea  ewart i said this is like dolls island  suppose i reflected an unsuccessful man laid siege to a balcony and wouldnt let his rival come near it  move him on said ewart by a special regulation as one does organgrinders no difficulty about that and you could forbid itmake it against the etiquette no life is decent without etiquette and people obey etiquette sooner than laws  hm i said and was struck by an idea that is remote in the world of a young man how about children i asked in the city girls are all very well but boys for examplegrow up  ah said ewart yes i forgot they mustnt grow up inside theyd turn out the boys when they were seven the father must come with a little pony and a little gun and manly wear and take the boy away then one could come afterwards to ones mothers balcony it must be fine to have a mother the father and the son  this is all very pretty in its way i said at last but its a dream lets come back to reality what i want to know is what are you going to do in brompton let us say or walham green now  oh damn it he remarked walham green what a chap you are ponderevo and he made an abrupt end to his discourse he wouldnt even reply to my tentatives for a time  while i was talking just now he remarked presently  i had a quite different idea  what  for a masterpiece a series like the busts of the caesars only not heads you know we dont see the people who do things to us nowadays  how will you do it then  handsa series of hands the hands of the twentieth century ill do it some day some one will discover itgo theresee what i have done and what is meant by it  see it where  on the tombs why not the unknown master of the highgate slope all the little soft feminine hands the nervous ugly males the hands of the flops and the hands of the snatchers and grundys loose lean knuckly affairgrundy the terrorthe little wrinkles and the thumb only it ought to hold all the others togetherin a slightly disturbing squeezelike rodins great handyou know the thing  iv  i forget how many days intervened between that last breaking off of our engagement and marions surrender but i recall now the sharpness of my emotion the concentrated spirit of tears and laughter in my throat as i read the words of her unexpected letteri have thought over everything and i was selfish i rushed off to walham green that evening to give back all she had given me to beat her altogether at giving she was extraordinarily gentle and generous that time i remember and when at last i left her she kissed me very sweetly  so we were married  we were married with all the customary incongruity i gaveperhaps after a while not altogether ungrudginglyand what i gave marion took with a manifest satisfaction after all i was being sensible so that we had three livery carriages to the church one of the pairs of horses matched and coachmenwith improvised flavour and very shabby silk hatsbearing white favours on their whips and my uncle intervened with splendour and insisted upon having a wedding breakfast sent in from a caterers in hammersmith the table had a great display of chrysanthemums and there was orange blossom in the significant place and a wonderful cake we also circulated upwards of a score of wedges of that accompanied by silverprinted cards in which marions name of ramboat was stricken out by an arrow in favour of ponderevo we had a little rally of marions relations and several friends and friends friends from smithies appeared in the church and drifted vestryward i produced my aunt and uncle a select group of two the effect in that shabby little house was one of exhilarating congestion the sideboard in which lived the tablecloth and the apartments card was used for a display of the presents eked out by the unused balance of the silverprinted cards  marion wore the white raiment of a bride white silk and satin that did not suit her that made her seem large and strange to me she obtruded bows and unfamiliar contours she went through all this strange ritual of an english wedding with a sacramental gravity that i was altogether too young and egotistical to comprehend it was all extraordinarily central and important to her it was no more than an offensive complicated and disconcerting intrusion of a world i was already beginning to criticise very bitterly to me what was all this fuss for the mere indecent advertisement that i had been passionately in love with marion i think however that marion was only very remotely aware of my smouldering exasperation at having in the end behaved nicely i had playedup to the extent of dressing my part i had an admirably cut frockcoat a new silk hat trousers as light as i could endure themlighter in facta white waistcoat night tie light gloves marion seeing me despondent had the unusual enterprise to whisper to me that i looked lovely i knew too well i didnt look myself i looked like a special coloured supplement to mens wear or the tailor and cutter full dress for ceremonial occasions i had even the disconcerting sensations of an unfamiliar collar i felt lostin a strange body and when i glanced down myself for reassurance the straight white abdomen the alien legs confirmed that impression  my uncle was my best man and looked like a bankera little bankerin flower he wore a white rose in his buttonhole he wasnt i think particularly talkative at least i recall very little from him  george he said once or twice this is a great occasion for youa very great occasion he spoke a little doubtfully  you see i had told him nothing about marion until about a week before the wedding both he and my aunt had been taken altogether by surprise they couldnt as people say make it out my aunt was intensely interested much more than my uncle it was then i think for the first time that i really saw that she cared for me she got me alone i remember after i had made my announcement now george she said tell me everything about her why didnt you tellme at leastbefore  i was surprised to find how difficult it was to tell her about marion i perplexed her  then is she beautiful she asked at last  i dont know what youll think of her i parried i think  yes  i think she might be the most beautiful person in the world  and isnt she to you  of course i said nodding my head yes she is  and while i dont remember anything my uncle said or did at the wedding i do remember very distinctly certain little things scrutiny solicitude a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunts eyes it dawned on me that i wasnt hiding anything from her at all she was dressed very smartly wearing a bigplumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on marion perplexed into selfforgetfulness it wasnt somehow funny she was i do believe giving my marriage more thought than i had done she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and marions blindness she was looking with eyes that knew what loving isfor love  in the vestry she turned away as we signed and i verily believe she was crying though to this day i cant say why she should have cried and she was near crying too when she squeezed my hand at partingand she never said a word or looked at me but just squeezed my hand  if i had not been so grim in spirit i think i should have found much of my wedding amusing i remember a lot of ridiculous detail that still declines to be funny in my memory the officiating clergyman had a cold and turned his ns to ds and he made the most mechanical compliment conceivable about the brides age when the register was signed every bride he had ever married had had it one knew and two middleaged spinsters cousins of marions and dressmakers at barking stand out they wore marvellously bright and gay blouses and dim old skirts and had an immense respect for mr ramboat they threw rice they brought a whole bag with them and gave handfuls away to unknown little boys at the church door and so created a lilliputian riot and one had meant to throw a slipper it was a very warm old silk slipper i know because she dropped it out of a pocket in the aislethere was a sort of jumble in the aisleand i picked it up for her i dont think she actually threw it for as we drove away from the church i saw her in a dreadful and it seemed to me hopeless struggle with her pocket and afterwards my eye caught the missile of good fortune lying it or its fellow most obviously mislaid behind the umbrellastand in the hall  the whole business was much more absurd more incoherent more human than i had anticipated but i was far too young and serious to let the latter quality atone for its shortcomings i am so remote from this phase of my youth that i can look back at it all as dispassionately as one looks at a pictureat some wonderful perfect sort of picture that is inexhaustible but at the time these things filled me with unspeakable resentment now i go round it all look into its details generalise about its aspects im interested for example to square it with my bladesover theory of the british social scheme under stress of tradition we were all of us trying in the fermenting chaos of london to carry out the marriage ceremonies of a bladesover tenant or one of the chubby middling sort of people in some dependent country town there a marriage is a public function with a public significance there the church is to a large extent the gatheringplace of the community and your going to be married a thing of importance to every one you pass on the road it is a change of status that quite legitimately interests the whole neighbourhood but in london there are no neighbours nobody knows nobody cares an absolute stranger in an office took my notice and our banns were proclaimed to ears that had never previously heard our names the clergyman even who married us had never seen us before and didnt in any degree intimate that he wanted to see us again  neighbours in london the ramboats did not know the names of the people on either side of them as i waited for marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight mr ramboat i remember came and stood beside me and stared out of the window  there was a funeral over there yesterday he said by way of making conversation and moved his head at the house opposite quite a smart affair it was with a glass earse  and our little procession of three carriages with whitefavouradorned horses and drivers went through all the huge noisy indifferent traffic like a lost china image in the coalchute of an ironclad nobody made way for us nobody cared for us the driver of an omnibus jeered for a long time we crawled behind an unamiable dustcart the irrelevant clatter and tumult gave a queer flavour of indecency to this public coming together of lovers we seemed to have obtruded ourselves shamelessly the crowd that gathered outside the church would have gathered in the same spirit and with greater alacrity for a street accident  at charing crosswe were going to hastingsthe experienced eye of the guard detected the significance of our unusual costume and he secured us a compartment  well said i as the train moved out of the station thats all over and i turned to mariona little unfamiliar still in her unfamiliar clothesand smiled  she regarded me gravely timidly  youre not cross she asked  cross why  at having it all proper  my dear marion said i and by way of answer took and kissed her whitegloved leatherscented hand  i dont remember much else about the journey an hour or so it was of undistinguished timefor we were both confused and a little fatigued and marion had a slight headache and did not want caresses i fell into a reverie about my aunt and realised as if it were a new discovery that i cared for her very greatly i was acutely sorry i had not told her earlier of my marriage  but you will not want to hear the history of my honeymoon i have told all that was needed to serve my present purpose thus and thus it was the will in things had its way with me driven by forces i did not understand diverted altogether from the science the curiosities and work to which i had once given myself i fought my way through a tangle of traditions customs obstacles and absurdities enraged myself limited myself gave myself to occupations i saw with the clearest vision were dishonourable and vain and at last achieved the end of purblind nature the relentless immediacy of her desire and held far short of happiness marion weeping and reluctant in my arms  v  who can tell the story of the slow estrangement of two married people the weakening of first this bond and then that of that complex contact least of all can one of the two participants even now with an interval of fifteen years to clear it up for me i still find a mass of impressions of marion as confused as discordant as unsystematic and selfcontradictory as life i think of this thing and love her of that and hate herof a hundred aspects in which i can now see her with an unimpassioned sympathy as i sit here trying to render some vision of this infinitely confused process i recall moments of hard and fierce estrangement moments of clouded intimacy the passage of transition all forgotten we talked a little language together whence were friends and i was mutney and she was ming and we kept up such an outward show that till the very end smithie thought our household the most amiable in the world  i cannot tell to the full how marion thwarted me and failed in that life of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love that life of intimate emotions is made up of little things a beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost infinitesimally small i find myself setting down little things and little things none of them do more than demonstrate those essential temperamental discords i have already sought to make clear some readers will understandto others i shall seem no more than an unfeeling brute who couldnt make allowances its easy to make allowances now but to be young and ardent and to make allowances to see ones married life open before one the life that seemed in its dawn a glory a garden of roses a place of deep sweet mysteries and heart throbs and wonderful silences and to see it a vista of tolerations and babytalk a compromise the least effectual thing in all ones life  every love romance i read seemed to mock our dull intercourse every poem every beautiful picture reflected upon the uneventful succession of grey hours we had together i think our real difference was one of aesthetic sensibility  i do still recall as the worst and most disastrous aspect of all that time her absolute disregard of her own beauty its the pettiest thing to record i know but she could wear curlpapers in my presence it was her idea too to wear out her old clothes and her failures at home when no one was likely to see herno one being myself she allowed me to accumulate a store of ungracious and slovenly memories  all our conceptions of life differed i remember how we differed about furniture we spent three or four days in tottenham court road and she chose the things she fancied with an inexorable resolutionsweeping aside my suggestions withoh you want such queer things she pursued some limited clearly seen and experienced idealthat excluded all other possibilities over every mantel was a mirror that was draped our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grogtubs smithie approved it all there wasnt a place where one could sit and read in the whole house my books went upon shelves in the diningroom recess and we had a piano though marions playing was at an elementary level  you know it was the cruelest luck for marion that i with my restlessness my scepticism my constantly developing ideas had insisted on marriage with her she had no faculty of growth or change she had taken her mould she had set in the limited ideas of her peculiar class she preserved her conception of what was right in drawingroom chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in every relation of life with a simple and luminous honesty and conviction with an immense unimaginative inflexibilityas a tailorbird builds its nest or a beaver makes its dam  let me hasten over this history of disappointments and separation i might tell of waxings and waning of love between us but the whole was waning sometimes she would do things for me make me a tie or a pair of slippers and fill me with none the less gratitude because the things were absurd she ran our home and our one servant with a hard bright efficiency she was inordinately proud of house and garden always by her lights she did her duty by me  presently the rapid development of tonobungay began to take me into the provinces and i would be away sometimes for a week together this she did not like it left her dull she said but after a time she began to go to smithies again and to develop an independence of me at smithies she was now a woman with a position she had money to spend she would take smithie to theatres and out to lunch and talk interminably of the business and smithie became a sort of permanent weekender with us also marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with the minor arts with pokerwork and a kodak and hyacinths in glasses she called once on a neighbour her parents left walham greenher father severed his connection with the gasworksand came to live in a small house i took for them near us and they were much with us  odd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the fountains of life are embittered my fatherinlaw was perpetually catching me in moody moments and urging me to take to gardening he irritated me beyond measure  you think too much he would say if you was to let in a bit with a spade you might soon ave that garden of yours a vision of flowers thats better than thinking george  or in a torrent of exasperation i carnt think george why you dont get a bit of glass ere this sunny corner you cd do wonders with a bit of glass  and in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort of conjuring trick in the hall and taking cucumbers and tomatoes from unexpected points of his person all out o my little bit hed say in exemplary tones he left a trail of vegetable produce in the most unusual places on mantel boards sideboards the tops of pictures heavens how the sudden unexpected tomato could annoy me  it did much to widen our estrangement that marion and my aunt failed to make friends became by a sort of instinct antagonistic  my aunt to begin with called rather frequently for she was really anxious to know marion at first she would arrive like a whirlwind and pervade the house with an atmosphere of hello she dressed already with that cheerfully extravagant abandon that signalised her accession to fortune and dressed her best for these visits  she wanted to play the mother to me i fancy to tell marion occult secrets about the way i wore out my boots and how i never could think to put on thicker things in cold weather but marion received her with that defensive suspiciousness of the shy person thinking only of the possible criticism of herself and my aunt perceiving this became nervous and slangy  she says such queer things said marion once discussing her but i suppose its witty  yes i said it is witty  if i said things like she does  the queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things she didnt say i remember her in our drawingroom one day and how she cocked her eyeits the only expressionat the indiarubber plant in a doultonware pot which marion had placed on the corner of the piano  she was on the very verge of speech then suddenly she caught my expression and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered looking at the milk  then a wicked impulse took her  didnt say an old word george she insisted looking me full in the eye  i smiled youre a dear i said not to as marion came lowering into the room to welcome her but i felt extraordinarily like a traitorto the indiarubber plant i supposefor all that nothing had been said  your aunt makes game of people was marions verdict and openmindedly i suppose its all right for her  several times we went to the house in beckenham for lunch and once or twice to dinner my aunt did her peculiar best to be friends but marion was implacable she was also i know intensely uncomfortable and she adopted as her social method an exhausting silence replying compactly and without giving openings to anything that was said to her  the gaps between my aunts visits grew wider and wider  my married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in the broad expanse of interests in which i was living i went about the world i met a great number of varied personalities i read endless books in trains as i went to and fro i developed social relationships at my uncles house that marion did not share the seeds of new ideas poured in upon me and grew in me those early and middle years of ones third decade are i suppose for a man the years of greatest mental growth they are restless years and full of vague enterprise  each time i returned to ealing life there seemed more alien narrow and unattractiveand marion less beautiful and more limited and difficultuntil at last she was robbed of every particle of her magic she gave me always a cooler welcome i think until she seemed entirely apathetic i never asked myself then what heartaches she might hide or what her discontents might be  i would come home hoping nothing expecting nothing  this was my fated life and i had chosen it i became more sensitive to the defects i had once disregarded altogether i began to associate her sallow complexion with her temperamental insufficiency and the heavier lines of her mouth and nostril with her moods of discontent we drifted apart wider and wider the gap opened i tired of babytalk and stereotyped little fondlings i tired of the latest intelligence from those wonderful workrooms and showed it all too plainly we hardly spoke when we were alone together the mere unreciprocated physical residue of my passion remainedan exasperation between us  no children came to save us marion had acquired at smithies a disgust and dread of maternity all that was the fruition and quintessence of the horrid elements in life a disgusting thing a last indignity that overtook unwary women i doubt indeed a little if children would have saved us we should have differed so fatally about their upbringing  altogether i remember my life with marion as a long distress now hard now tender it was in those days that i first became critical of my life and burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment i would lie awake in the night asking myself the purpose of things reviewing my unsatisfying ungainly homelife my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbishselling contrasting all i was being and doing with my adolescent ambitions my wimblehurst dreams my circumstances had an air of finality and i asked myself in vain why i had forced myself into them  vi  the end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and unexpectedly but in a way that i suppose was almost inevitable  my alienated affections wandered and i was unfaithful to marion  i wont pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct i was a young and fairly vigorous male all my appetite for love had been roused and whetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love affair and my marriage i had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty to the disregard of all else and it had failed me it had faded when i had hoped it would grow brighter i despaired of life and was embittered and things happened as i am telling i dont draw any moral at all in the matter and as for social remedies i leave them to the social reformer ive got to a time of life when the only theories that interest me are generalisations about realities  to go to our inner office in raggett street i had to walk through a room in which the typists worked they were the correspondence typists our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure on either side of us i was i must confess always in a faintly cloudilyemotional way aware of that collection of for the most part roundshouldered femininity but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention i appreciated her at first as a straight little back a neater back than any of the others as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls as chestnut hair very neatly doneand as a sidelong glance presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me  my eye would seek her as i went through on business thingsi dictated some letters to her and so discovered she had pretty softlooking hands with pink nails once or twice meeting casually we looked one another for the flash of a second in the eyes  that was all but it was enough in the mysterious freemasonry of sex to say essential things we had a secret between us  one day i came into raggett street at lunch time and she was alone sitting at her desk she glanced up as i entered and then became very still with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table i walked right by her to the door of the inner office stopped came back and stood over her  we neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time i was trembling violently  is that one of the new typewriters i asked at last for the sake of speaking  she looked up at me without a word with her face flushed and her eyes alight and i bent down and kissed her lips she leant back to put an arm about me drew my face to her and kissed me again and again i lifted her and held her in my arms she gave a little smothered cry to feel herself so held  never before had i known the quality of passionate kisses  somebody became audible in the shop outside  we started back from one another with flushed faces and bright and burning eyes  we cant talk here i whispered with a confident intimacy where do you go at five  along the embankment to charing cross she answered as intimately none of the others go that way  about halfpast five  yes halfpast five  the door from the shop opened and she sat down very quickly  im glad i said in a commonplace voice that these new typewriters are all right  i went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in order to find her nameeffie rink and did no work at all that afternoon i fretted about that dingy little den like a beast in a cage  when presently i went out effie was working with an extraordinary appearance of calmand there was no look for me at all  we met and had our talk that evening a talk in whispers when there was none to overhear we came to an understanding it was strangely unlike any dream of romance i had ever entertained  vii  i came back after a weeks absence to my home againa changed man i had lived out my first rush of passion for effie had come to a contemplation of my position i had gauged effies place in the scheme of things and parted from her for a time she was back in her place at raggett street after a temporary indisposition i did not feel in any way penitent or ashamed i know as i opened the little castiron gate that kept marions front grader and pampas grass from the wandering dog indeed if anything i felt as if i had vindicated some right that had been in question i came back to marion with no sense of wrongdoing at all with indeed a new friendliness towards her i dont know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions that is how i felt  i followed her in our drawingroom standing beside the tall lampstand that half filled the bay as though she had just turned from watching for me at the window there was something in her pale face that arrested me she looked as if she had not been sleeping she did not come forward to greet me  youve come home she said  as i wrote to you  she stood very still a dusky figure against the bright window  where have you been she asked  east coast i said easily  she paused for a moment i know she said  i stared at her it was the most amazing moment in any life  by jove i said at last i believe you do  and then you come home to me  i walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding this new situation  i didnt dream she began how could you do such a thing  it seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word  who knows about it i asked at last  smithies brother they were at cromer  confound cromer yes  how could you bring yourself  i felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe  i should like to wring smithies brothers neck i said  marion spoke in dry broken fragments of sentences you id always thought that anyhow you couldnt deceive me i suppose all men are horridabout this  it doesnt strike me as horrid it seems to me the most necessary consequenceand natural thing in the world  i became aware of some one moving about in the passage and went and shut the door of the room then i walked back to the hearthrug and turned  its rough on you i said but i didnt mean you to know youve never cared for me ive had the devil of a time why should you mind  she sat down in a draped armchair i have cared for you she said  i shrugged my shoulders  i suppose she said she cares for you  i had no answer  where is she now  oh does it matter to you look here marion thisthis i didnt anticipate i didnt mean this thing to smash down on you like this but you know something had to happen im sorrysorry to the bottom of my heart that things have come to this between us but indeed im taken by surprise i dont know where i ami dont know how we got here things took me by surprise i found myself alone with her one day i kissed her i went on it seemed stupid to go back and besideswhy should i have gone back why should i from first to last ive hardly thought of it as touching you damn  she scrutinised my face and pulled at the ballfringe of the little table beside her  to think of it she said i dont believe i can ever touch you again  we kept a long silence i was only beginning to realise in the most superficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened between us enormous issues had rushed upon us i felt unprepared and altogether inadequate i was unreasonably angry there came a rush of stupid expressions to my mind that my rising sense of the supreme importance of the moment saved me from saying the gap of silence widened until it threatened to become the vast memorable margin of some one among a thousand trivial possibilities of speech that would vex our relations for ever  our little general servant tapped at the doormarion always liked the servant to tapand appeared  tea mm she saidand vanished leaving the door open  i will go upstairs said i and stopped i will go upstairs i repeated and put my bag in the spare room  we remained motionless and silent for a few seconds  mother is having tea with us today marion remarked at last and dropped the worried end of ballfringe and stood up slowly  and so with this immense discussion of our changed relations hanging over us we presently had tea with the unsuspecting mrs ramboat and the spaniel mrs ramboat was too well trained in her position to remark upon our somber preoccupation she kept a thin trickle of talk going and told us i remember that mr ramboat was troubled about his cannas  they dont come up and they wont come up hes been round and had an explanation with the man who sold him the bulbsand hes very heated and upset  the spaniel was a great bore begging and doing small tricks first at one and then at the other of us neither of us used his name you see we had called him miggles and made a sort of trio in the babytalk of mutney and miggles and ming  viii   then presently we resumed our monstrous momentous dialogue i cant now make out how long that dialogue went on it spread itself i know in heavy fragments over either three days or four i remember myself grouped with marion talking sitting on our bed in her room talking standing in our diningroom saving this thing or that twice we went for long walks and we had a long evening alone together with jaded nerves and hearts that fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition of facts and on my part at least a strange unwonted tenderness because in some extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual apathy and made us feel one another again  it was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps of talk that failed to join on to their predecessors that began again at a different level higher or lower that assumed new aspects in the intervals and assimilated new considerations we discussed the fact that we two were no longer lovers never before had we faced that it seems a strange thing to write but as i look back i see clearly that those several days were the time when marion and i were closest together looked for the first and last time faithfully and steadfastly into each others soul for those days only there were no pretences i made no concessions to her nor she to me we concealed nothing exaggerated nothing we had done with pretending we had it out plainly and soberly with each other mood followed mood and got its stark expression  of course there was quarreling between us bitter quarreling and we said things to one anotherlong pentup things that bruised and crushed and cut but over it all in my memory now is an effect of deliberate confrontation and the figure of marion stands up pale melancholy tearstained injured implacable and dignified  you love her she asked once and jerked that doubt into my mind  i struggled with tangled ideas and emotions i dont know what love is its all sorts of thingsits made of a dozen strands twisted in a thousand ways  but you want her you want her nowwhen you think of her  yes i reflected i want herright enough  and me where do i come in  i suppose you come in here  well but what are you going to do  do i said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon me what do you want me to do  as i look back upon all that timeacross a gulf of fifteen active yearsi find i see it with an understanding judgment i see it as if it were the business of some one elseindeed of two other peopleintimately known yet judged without passion i see now that this shock this sudden immense disillusionment did in real fact bring out a mind and soul in marion that for the first time she emerged from habits timidities imitations phrases and a certain narrow willimpulse and became a personality  her ruling motive at first was i think an indignant and outraged pride this situation must end she asked me categorically to give up effie and i full of fresh and glowing memories absolutely refused  its too late marion i said it cant be done like that  then we cant very well go on living together she said can we  very well i deliberated if you must have it so  well can we  can you stay in this house i meanif i go away  i dont know i dont think i could  thenwhat do you want  slowly we worked our way from point to point until at last the word divorce was before us  if we cant live together we ought to be free said marion  i dont know anything of divorce i saidif you mean that i dont know how it is done i shall have to ask somebodyor look it up perhaps after all it is the thing to do we may as well face it  we began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our divergent futures might be i came back on the evening of that day with my questions answered by a solicitor  we cant as a matter of fact i said get divorced as things are apparently so far as the law goes youve got to stand this sort of thing its silly but that is the law however its easy to arrange a divorce in addition to adultery there must be desertion or cruelty to establish cruelty i should have to strike you or something of that sort before witnesses thats impossiblebut its simple to desert you legally i have to go away from you thats all i can go on sending you moneyand you bring a suit what is itfor restitution of conjugal rights the court orders me to return i disobey then you can go on to divorce me you get a decree nisi and once more the court tries to make me come back if we dont make it up within six months and if you dont behave scandalously the decree is made absolute thats the end of the fuss thats how one gets unmarried its easier you see to marry than unmarry  and thenhow do i live what becomes of me  youll have an income they call it alimony from a third to a half of my present incomemore if you likei dont mindthree hundred a year say youve got your old people to keep and youll need all that  and thenthen youll be free  both of us  and all this life youve hated  i looked up at her wrung and bitter face i havent hated it i lied my voice near breaking with the pain of it all have you  ix  the perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of reality of things and relations alike nothing is simple every wrong done has a certain justice in it and every good deed has dregs of evil as for us young still and still without selfknowledge resounded a hundred discordant notes in the harsh angle of that shock we were furiously angry with each other tender with each other callously selfish generously selfsacrificing  i remember marion saying innumerable detached things that didnt hang together one with another that contradicted one another that were nevertheless all in their places profoundly true and sincere i see them now as so many vain experiments in her effort to apprehend the crumpled confusions of our complex moral landslide some i found irritating beyond measure i answered hersometimes quite abominably  of course she would say again and again my life has been a failure  ive besieged you for three years i would retort asking it not to be youve done as you pleased if ive turned away at last  or again she would revive all the stresses before our marriage  how you must hate me i made you wait well nowi suppose you have your revenge  revenge i echoed  then she would try over the aspects of our new separated lives  i ought to earn my own living she would insist  i want to be quite independent ive always hated london perhaps i shall try a poultry farm and bees you wont mind at first my being a burden afterwards  weve settled all that i said  i suppose you will hate me anyhow  there were times when she seemed to regard our separation with absolute complacency when she would plan all sorts of freedoms and characteristic interests  i shall go out a lot with smithie she said  and once she said an ugly thing that i did indeed hate her for that i cannot even now quite forgive her  your aunt will rejoice at all this she never cared for me  into my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of smithie fullcharged with emotion so breathless in the presence of the horrid villain of the piece that she could make no articulate sounds she had long tearful confidences with marion i know sympathetic close clingings there were moments when only absolute speechlessness prevented her giving me a stupendous talkingtoi could see it in her eye the wrong things she would have said and i recall too mrs ramboats slow awakening to something in the air the growing expression of solicitude in her eye only her welltrained fear of marion keeping her from speech  and at last through all this welter like a thing fated and altogether beyond our control parting came to marion and me  i hardened my heart or i could not have gone for at the last it came to marion that she was parting from me for ever that overbore all other things had turned our last hour to anguish she forgot for a time the prospect of moving into a new house she forgot the outrage on her proprietorship and pride for the first time in her life she really showed strong emotions in regard to me for the first time perhaps they really came to her she began to weep slow reluctant tears i came into her room and found her asprawl on the bed weeping  i didnt know she cried oh i didnt understand  ive been a fool all my life is a wreck  i shall be alonemutney mutney dont leave me oh mutney i didnt understand  i had to harden my heart indeed for it seemed to me at moments in those last hours together that at last too late the longedfor thing had happened and marion had come alive a newborn hunger for me lit her eyes  dont leave me she said dont leave me she clung to me she kissed me with tearsalt lips  i was promised now and pledged and i hardened my heart against this impossible dawn yet it seems to me that there were moments when it needed but a cry but one word to have united us again for all our lives could we have united again would that passage have enlightened us for ever or should we have fallen back in a week or so into the old estrangement the old temperamental opposition  of that there is now no telling our own resolve carried us on our predestined way we behaved more and more like separating lovers parting inexorably but all the preparations we had set going worked on like a machine and we made no attempt to stop them my trunks and boxes went to the station i packed my bag with marion standing before me we were like children who had hurt each other horribly in sheer stupidity who didnt know now how to remedy it we belonged to each other immenselyimmensely the cab came to the little iron gate  goodbye i said  goodbye  for a moment we held one another in each others arms and kissedincredibly without malice we heard our little servant in the passage going to open the door for the last time we pressed ourselves to one another we were not lovers nor enemies but two human souls in a frank community of pain i tore myself from her  go away i said to the servant seeing that marion had followed me down  i felt her standing behind me as i spoke to the cab man  i got into the cab resolutely not looking back and then as it started jumped up craned out and looked at the door  it was wide open but she had disappeared  i wonderi suppose she ran upstairs  x  so i parted from marion at an extremity of perturbation and regret and went as i had promised and arranged to effie who was waiting for me in apartments near orpington i remember her upon the station platform a bright flitting figure looking along the train for me and our walk over the fields in the twilight i had expected an immense sense of relief where at last the stresses of separation were over but now i found i was beyond measure wretched and perplexed full of the profoundest persuasion of irreparable error the dusk and somber marion were so alike her sorrow seemed to be all about me i had to hold myself to my own plans to remember that i must keep faith with effie with effie who had made no terms exacted no guarantees but flung herself into my hands  we went across the evening fields in silence towards a sky of deepening gold and purple and effie was close beside me always very close glancing up ever and again at my face  certainly she knew i grieved for marion that ours was now no joyful reunion but she showed no resentment and no jealousy extraordinarily she did not compete against marion never once in all our time together did she say an adverse word of marion  she set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the trouble of a child she made herself my glad and pretty slave and handmaid she forced me at last to rejoice in her yet at the back of it all marion remained stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful so that i was almost intolerably unhappy for herfor her and the dead body of my married love  it is all as i tell it now unaccountable to me i go back into these remote parts these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory and it seems to me still a strange country i had thought i might be going to some sensuous paradise with effie but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction vanishes utterly like the going of daylightwith achievement all the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold it was an upland of melancholy questionings a region from which i saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects i had outflanked passion and romance  i had come into a condition of vast perplexities for the first time in my life at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect i looked at my existence as a whole  since this was nothing what was i doing what was i for  i was going to and fro about tonobungaythe business i had taken up to secure marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separationand snatching odd weekends and nights for orpington and all the while i struggled with these obstinate interrogations i used to fall into musing in the trains i became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business things i have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward seven oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country and that i was thinking out my destiny i could almost write my thought down now i believe as they came to me that afternoon effie restless little cockney that she was rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below gathering flowers discovering flowers she had never seen before i had i remember a letter from marion in my pocket i had even made some tentatives for return for a reconciliation heaven knows now how i had put it but her cold illwritten letter repelled me i perceived i could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again that stagnant disappointment that anyhow wasnt possible but what was possible i could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all  what am i to do with life that was the question that besieged me  i wondered if all the world was even as i urged to this by one motive and to that by another creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning traditions had i indeed to abide by what i had said and done and chosen was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for effie go back penitent to marion and keep to my trade in rubbishor find some fresh oneand so work out the residue of my days i didnt accept that for a moment but what else was i to do i wondered if my case was the case of many men whether in former ages too men had been so guideless so uncharted so haphazard in their journey into life in the middle ages in the old catholic days one went to a priest and he said with all the finality of natural law this you are and this you must do i wondered whether even in the middle ages i should have accepted that ruling without question  i remember too very distinctly how effie came and sat beside me on a little box that was before the casement window of our room  gloomkins said she  i smiled and remained head on hand looking out of the window forgetful of her  did you love your wife so well she whispered softly  oh i cried recalled again i dont know i dont understand these things life is a thing that hurts my dear it hurts without logic or reason ive blundered i didnt understand anyhowthere is no need to go hurting you is there  and i turned about and drew her to me and kissed her ear  yes i had a very bad timei still recall i suffered i suppose from a sort of ennui of the imagination i found myself without an object to hold my will together i sought i read restlessly and discursively i tried ewart and got no help from him as i regard it all now in this retrospect it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims i discovered myself for the first time before that i had seen only the world and things in it had sought them selfforgetful of all but my impulse now i found myself grouped with a system of appetites and satisfactions with much work to doand no desire it seemed left in me  there were moments when i thought of suicide at times my life appeared before me in bleak relentless light a series of ignorances crude blunderings degradation and cruelty i had what the old theologians call a conviction of sin i sought salvationnot perhaps in the formula a methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless  men find their salvation nowadays in many ways names and forms dont i think matter very much the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one i have known a man find that determining factor in a dryplate factory and another in writing a history of the manor so long as it holds one it does not matter many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of socialism or social reform but socialism for me has always been a little bit too human too set about with personalities and foolishness it isnt my line i dont like things so human i dont think im blind to the fun the surprises the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life to the humour of it as people say and to adventure but that isnt the root of the matter with me theres no humour in my blood im in earnest in warp and woof i stumble and flounder but i know that over all these merry immediate things there are other things that are great and serene very high beautiful thingsthe reality i havent got it but its there nevertheless im a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses ive never seen the goddesses nor ever shallbut it takes all the fun out of the mudand at times i fear it takes all the kindliness too  but im talking of things i cant expect the reader to understand because i dont half understand them myself there is something links things for me a sunset or so a mood or so the high air something there was in marions form and colour something i find and lose in mantegnas pictures something in the lines of these boats i make you should see x2 my last and best  i cant explain myself i perceive perhaps it all comes to this that i am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits naturally i resist that as a complete solution anyhow i had a sense of inexorable need of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it  in the end of this particular crisis of which i tell so badly i idealised science i decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life the secret that would fill my need that to these things i would give myself  i emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long  i came into the inner office suddenly one dayit must have been just before the time of marions suit for restitutionand sat down before my uncle  look here i said im sick of this  hullo he answered and put some papers aside  whats up george  things are wrong  as how  my life i said its a mess an infinite mess  shes been a stupid girl george he said i partly understand but youre quit of her now practically and theres just as good fish in the sea  oh its not that i cried thats only the part that shows im sickim sick of all this damned rascality  eh eh said my uncle whatrascality  oh you know i want some stuff man i want something to hold on to i shall go amok if i dont get it im a different sort of beast from you you float in all this bunkum i feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds up and downs east and west i cant stand it i must get my foot on something solid ori dont know what  i laughed at the consternation in his face  i mean it i said ive been thinking it over ive made up my mind its no good arguing i shall go in for workreal work no this isnt work its only laborious cheating but ive got an idea its an old ideai thought of years ago but it came back to me look here why should i fence about with you i believe the time has come for flying to be possible real flying  flying  i stuck to that and it helped me through the worst time in my life my uncle after some halfhearted resistance and a talk with my aunt behaved like the father of a spoilt son he fixed up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with released me from too constant a solicitude for the newer business developmentsthis was in what i may call the later moggs period of our enterprisesand i went to work at once with grim intensity  but i will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place ive been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long i wanted merely to tell how it was i took to this work i took to these experiments after i had sought something that marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise i toiled and forgot myself for a time and did many things science too has been something of an irresponsive mistress since though ive served her better than i served marion but at the time science with her order her inhuman distance yet steely certainties saved me from despair  well i have still to fly but incidentally i have invented the lightest engines in the world  i am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me its hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right but this is a novel not a treatise dont imagine that i am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties here among my drawings and hammerings now i still question unanswering problems all my life has been at bottom seeking disbelieving always dissatisfied always with the thing seen and the thing believed seeking something in toil in force in danger something whose name and nature i do not clearly understand something beautiful worshipful enduring mine profoundly and fundamentally and the utter redemption of myself i dont knowall i can tell is that it is something i have ever failed to find  xi  but before i finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the great adventure of my uncles career i may perhaps tell what else remains to tell of marion and effie and then for a time set my private life behind me  for a time marion and i corresponded with some regularity writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things the clumsy process of divorce completed itself  she left the house at ealing and went into the country with her aunt and parents taking a small farm near lewes in sussex she put up glass she put in heat for her father happy man and spoke of figs and peaches the thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and summer but the sussex winter after london was too much for the ramboats they got very muddy and dull mr ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding and that disheartened them all a twelvemonth saw the enterprise in difficulties i had to help her out of this and then they returned to london and she went into partnership with smithie at streatham and ran a business that was intimated on the firms stationery as robes the parents and aunt were stowed away in a cottage somewhere after that the letters became infrequent but in one i remember a postscript that had a little stab of our old intimacy poor old miggles is dead  nearly eight years slipped by i grew up i grew in experience in capacity until i was fully a man but with many new interests living on a larger scale in a wider world than i could have dreamt of in my marion days her letters become rare and insignificant at last came a gap of silence that made me curious for eighteen months or more i had nothing from marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank then i damned at smithie and wrote a card to marion  dear marion i said how goes it  she astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married againa mr wachorn a leading agent in the paperpattern trade but she still wrote on the ponderevo and smith robes notepaper from the ponderevo and smith address  and that except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger and the use of my name by the firm which also annoyed me is the end of marions history for me and she vanishes out of this story i do not know where she is or what she is doing i do not know whether she is alive or dead it seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and i should be so separated but so it is between us  effie too i have parted from though i still see her at times between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of soul she had a sudden fierce hotblooded passion for me and i for her but i was not her first lover nor her last she was in another world from marion she had a queer delightful nature ive no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious she wasindeed she was magnificentlyeupeptic that i think was the central secret of her agreeableness and moreover that she was infinitely kindhearted i helped her at last into an opening she coveted and she amazed me by a sudden display of business capacity she has now a typewriting bureau in riffles inn and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable success albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her and she still loves her kind she married a year or so ago a boy half her agea wretch of a poet a wretched poet and given to drugs a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes and limp legs she did it she said because he needed nursing  but enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love affairs i have told all that is needed for my picture to explain how i came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science let me get back to my essential story to tonobungay and my uncles promotions and to the vision of the world these things have given me      book the third  the great days of tonobungay    chapter the first  the hardingham hotel and how we became big people  i  but now that i resume the main line of my story it may be well to describe the personal appearance of my uncle as i remember him during those magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to finance the little man plumped up very considerably during the creation of the tonobungay property but with the increasing excitements that followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away his abdomenif the reader will pardon my taking his features in the order of their valuehad at first a nice full roundness but afterwards it lost tone without however losing size he always went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as possible to the last his movements remained quick and sudden his short firm legs as he walked seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissorsstride of common humanity and he never seemed to have knees but instead a dispersed flexibility of limb  there was i seem to remember a secular intensification of his features his nose developed character became aggressive stuck out at the world more and more the obliquity of his mouth i think increased from the face that returns to my memory projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner that sometimes droops from the lowerit was as eloquent as a dogs tail and he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech he assumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses and wore them more and more askew as time went on his hair seemed to stiffen with success but towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown and he brushed it hard back over his ears where however it stuck out fiercely it always stuck out fiercely over his forehead up and forward  he adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of tonobungay and rarely abandoned it he preferred silk hats with ample rich brims often a trifle large for him by modern ideas and he wore them at various angles to his axis his taste in trouserings was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat he liked his frockcoat long and full although that seemed to shorten him he displayed a number of valuable rings and i remember one upon his left little finger with a large red stone bearing gnostic symbols clever chaps those gnostics george he told me means a lot lucky he never had any but a black mohair watchchair in the country he affected grey and a large grey cloth tophat except when motoring then he would have a brown deerstalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of bootend to the trousers of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold studs he hated diamonds flashy he said they were might as well wearan income taxreceipt all very well for park lane unsold stock not my style sober financier george  so much for his visible presence for a time it was very familiar to the world for at the crest of the boom he allowed quite a number of photographs and at least one pencil sketch to be published in the sixpenny papers  his voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a flat rich quality of sound that my knowledge of music is inadequate to describe his zzzing inrush of air became less frequent as he ripened but returned in moments of excitement throughout his career in spite of his increasing and at last astounding opulence his more intimate habits remained as simple as they had been at wimblehurst he would never avail himself of the services of a valet at the very climax of his greatness his trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders brushed as he left his house or hotel he became wary about breakfast as life advanced and at one time talked much of dr haig and uric acid but for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous he was something of a gastronome and would eat anything he particularly liked in an audible manner and perspire upon his forehead he was a studiously moderate drinkerexcept when the spirit of some public banquet or some great occasion caught him and bore him beyond his warinessthere he would as it were drink inadvertently and become flushed and talkativeabout everything but his business projects  to make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of sudden quick bursts of movement like the jumps of a chinesecracker to indicate that his pose whatever it is has been preceded and will be followed by a rush if i were painting him i should certainly give him for a background that distressed uneasy sky that was popular in the eighteenth century and at a convenient distance a throbbing motorcar very big and contemporary a secretary hurrying with papers and an alert chauffeur  such was the figure that created and directed the great property of tonobungay and from the successful reconstruction of that company passed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations and promotions until the whole world of investors marveled i have already i think mentioned how long before we offered tono bungay to the public we took over the english agency of certain american specialties to this was presently added our exploitation of moggs domestic soap and so he took up the domestic convenience campaign that coupled with his equatorial rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings won my uncle his napoleonic title  ii  it illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my uncle met young moggs at a city dinneri think it was the bottlemakers companywhen both were some way advanced beyond the initial sobriety of the occasion this was the grandson of the original moggs and a very typical instance of an educated cultivated degenerate plutocrat his people had taken him about in his youth as the ruskins took their john and fostered a passion for history in him and the actual management of the moggs industry had devolved upon a cousin and a junior partner  mr moggs being of a studious and refined disposition had just decidedafter a careful search for a congenial subject in which he would not be constantly reminded of soapto devote himself to the history of the thebaid when this cousin died suddenly and precipitated responsibilities upon him in the frankness of conviviality moggs bewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust into his hands and my uncle offered to lighten his burden by a partnership then and there they even got to termsextremely muzzy terms but terms nevertheless  each gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his cuff and they separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness and next morning neither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt from the wash until it was too late my uncle made a painful struggleit was one of my business morningsto recall name and particulars  he was an aquariumfaced long blond sort of chap george with glasses and a genteel accent he said  i was puzzled aquariumfaced  you know how they look at you his stuff was soap im pretty nearly certain and he had a nameand the thing was the straightest bitofallright you ever i was clear enough to spot that  we went out at last with knitted brows and wandered up into finsbury seeking a good wellstocked looking grocer we called first on a chemist for a pickmeup for my uncle and then we found the shop we needed  i want said my uncle half a pound of every sort of soap you got yes i want to take them now wait a moment george now what sort of soap dyou call that  at the third repetition of that question the young man said moggs domestic  right said my uncle you neednt guess again come along george lets go to a telephone and get on to moggs ohthe order certainly i confirm it send it allsend it all to the bishop of london hell have some good use for itfirstrate man george he ischarities and all thatand put it down to me heres a cardponderevotonobungay  then we went on to moggs and found him in a camelhair dressingjacket in a luxurious bed drinking china tea and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time  young moggs enlarged my mind considerably he was a sort of thing i hadnt met before he seemed quite clean and wellinformed and he assured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form at all delicate skin he said  no objection to our advertising you wide and free said my uncle  i draw the line at railway stations said moggs southcoast cliffs theatre programmes books by me and poetry generallysceneryohand the mercure de france  well get along said my uncle  so long as you dont annoy me said moggs lighting a cigarette you can make me as rich as you like  we certainly made him no poorer his was the first firm that was advertised by a circumstantial history we even got to illustrated magazine articles telling of the quaint past of moggs we concocted moggsiana trusting to our partners preoccupation with the uncommercial aspects of life we gave graceful historyof moggs the first moggs the second moggs the third and moggs the fourth you must unless you are very young remember some of them and our admirable block of a georgian shop window my uncle brought early nineteenthcentury memoirs soaked himself in the style and devised stories about old moggs the first and the duke of wellington george the third and the soap dealer almost certainly old moggs very soon we had added to the original moggs primrose several varieties of scented and superfatted a special nurseries used in the household of the duke of kent and for the old queen in infancy a plate powder the paragon and a knife powder we roped in a good little secondrate blacklead firm and carried their origins back into the mists of antiquity it was my uncles own unaided idea that we should associate that commodity with the black prince he became industriously curious about the past of blacklead i remember his buttonholing the president of the pepys society  i say is there any blacklead in pepys you knowblackleadfor grates or does he pass it over as a matter of course  he became in those days the terror of eminent historians dont want your drum and trumpet historyno fear he used to say dont want to know who was whos mistress and why soandso devastated such a province thats bound to be all lies and upsydown anyhow not my affair nobodys affair now chaps who did it didnt clearly know what i want to know is in the middle ages did they do anything for housemaids knee what did they put in their hot baths after jousting and was the black princeyou know the black princewas he enameled or painted or what i think myself blackleadedvery likelylike pipeclaybut did they use blacking so early  so it came about that in designing and writing those moggs soap advertisements that wrought a revolution in that department of literature my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked among the little articles the dustpans and mincers the mousetraps and carpetsweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic ironmonger he was recalled to one of the dreams of his youth to his conception of the ponderevo patent flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before i went to serve him at wimblehurst the home george he said wants straightening up silly muddle things that get in the way got to organise it  for a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine social reformer in relation to these matters  weve got to bring the home up to date thats my idee george we got to make a civilised domestic machine out of these relics of barbarism im going to hunt up inventors make a corner in dmestic ideas everything balls of string that wont dissolve into a tangle and gum that wont dry into horn see then after conveniencesbeauty beauty george all these few things ought to be made fit to look at its your aunts idea that beautiful jampots get one of those new art chaps to design all the things they make ugly now patent carpetsweepers by these greenwood chaps housemaids boxes itll be a pleasure to fall overrich coloured houseflannels zzzz pails frinstance hang em up on the walls like warmingpans all the polishes and things in such tinsyoull want to cuddle em george see the notion sted of all the silly ugly things we got  we had some magnificent visions they so affected me that when i passed ironmongers and oilshops they seemed to me as full of promise as trees in late winter flushed with the effort to burst into leaf and flower and really we did do much towards that very brightness these shops display they were dingy things in the eighties compared to what our efforts have made them now grey quiet displays  well i dont intend to write down here the tortuous financial history of moggs limited which was our first development of moggs and sons nor will i tell very much of how from that we spread ourselves with a larger and larger conception throughout the chandlery and minor ironmongery how we became agents for this little commodity partners in that got a tentacle round the neck of a specialised manufacturer or so secured a pull upon this or that supply of raw material and so prepared the way for our second flotation domestic utilities do it they reordered it in the city and then came the reconstruction of tonobungay and then household services and the boom  that sort of development is not to be told in detail in a novel i have indeed told much of it elsewhere it is to be found set out at length painfully at length in my uncles examination and mine in the bankruptcy proceedings and in my own various statements after his death some people know everything in that story some know it all too well most do not want the details it is the story of a man of imagination among figures and unless you are prepared to collate columns of pounds shillings and pence compare dates and check additions you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing and after all you wouldnt find the early figures so much wrong as strained in the matter of moggs and do ut as in the first tonobungay promotion and in its reconstruction we left the court by city standards without a stain on our characters the great amalgamation of household services was my uncles first really bigscale enterprise and his first display of bolder methods for this we bought back do ut moggs going strong with a seven per cent dividend and acquired skinnertons polishes the riffleshaw properties and the runcorns mincer and coffeemill business to that amalgamation i was really not a party i left it to my uncle because i was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments i had taken on from the results then to hand of lilienthal pilcher and the wright brothers i was developing a glider into a flyer i meant to apply power to this glider as soon as i could work out one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability i knew that i had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of bridgers light turbine but i knew too that until i had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon me the application of an engine would be little short of suicide  but that i will tell about later the point i was coming to was that i did not realise until after the crash how recklessly my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent on the ordinary shares of that hugely overcapitalised enterprise household services  i drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than either i or my uncle had contemplated finance was much less to my taste than the organisation of the tonobungay factory in the new field of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing and gambling of taking chances and concealing material factsand these are hateful things to the scientific type of mind it wasnt fear i felt so much as an uneasy inaccuracy i didnt realise dangers i simply disliked the sloppy relaxing quality of this new sort of work i was at last constantly making excuses not to come up to him in london the latter part of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any particular life i lived more or less with him i talked i advised i helped him at times to fight his sunday crowd at crest hill but i did not follow nor guide him from the do ut time onward he rushed up the financial world like a bubble in water and left me like some busy waterthing down below in the deeps  anyhow he was an immense success the public was i think particularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of workyou never lost sight of your investment they felt with the name on the houseflannel and shavingstropand its allegiance was secured by the egyptian solidity of his apparent results tonobungay after its reconstruction paid thirteen moggs seven domestic utilities had been a safelooking nine here was household services with eight on such a showing he had merely to buy and sell roeburns antiseptic fluid razor soaks and bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty thousand pounds  i do think that as a matter of fact roeburns was good value at the price at which he gave it to the public at least until it was strained by illconserved advertisement it was a period of expansion and confidence much money was seeking investment and industrials were the fashion prices were rising all round there remained little more for my uncle to do therefore in his climb to the high unstable crest of financial greatness but as he said to grasp the cosmic oyster george while it gaped which being translated meant for him to buy respectable businesses confidently and courageously at the vendors estimate add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them again his sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of the load of shares that each of these transactions left upon his hands but i thought so little of these later things that i never fully appreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until it was too late to help him  iii  when i think of my uncle near the days of his great boom and in connection with the actualities of his enterprises i think of him as i used to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the hardingham hotel seated at a great old oak writingtable smoking drinking and incoherently busy that was his typical financial aspectour evenings our mornings our holidays our motorcar expeditions lady grove and crest hill belong to an altogether different set of memories  these rooms in the hardingham were a string of apartments along one handsome thickcarpeted corridor all the doors upon the corridor were locked except the first and my uncles bedroom breakfastroom and private sanctum were the least accessible and served by an entrance from the adjacent passage which he also used at times as a means of escape from importunate callers the most eternal room was a general waitingroom and very businesslike in quality it had one or two uneasy sofas a number of chairs a green baize table and a collection of the very best moggs and tone posters and the plush carpets normal to the hardingham had been replaced by a greygreen cork linoleum here i would always find a remarkable miscellany of people presided over by a peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking commissioner ropper who guarded the door that led a step nearer my uncle usually there would be a parson or so and one or two widows hairy eyeglassy middleaged gentlemen some of them looking singularly like edward ponderevos who hadnt come off a variety of young and youngish men more or less attractively dressed some with papers protruding from their pockets others with their papers decently concealed and wonderful incidental frowsy people  all these persons maintained a practically hopeless siegesometimes for weeks together they had better have stayed at home next came a room full of people who had some sort of appointment and here one would find smartlooking people brilliantly dressed nervous women hiding behind magazines nonconformist divines clergy in gaiters real business men these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable morning dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncles taste in water colours manfully and sometimes by the hour together young men again were here of various social origins young americans treasonable clerks from other concerns university young men keenlooking most of them resolute reserved but on a sort of hair trigger ready at any moment to be most voluble most persuasive  this room had a window too looking out into the hotel courtyard with its fernset fountains and mosaic pavement and the young men would stand against this and sometimes even mutter one day i heard one repeating in all urgent whisper as i passed but you dont quite see mr ponderevo the full advantages the full advantages i met his eye and he was embarrassed  then came a room with a couple of secretariesno typewriters because my uncle hated the clatterand a casual person or two sitting about projectors whose projects were being entertained here and in a further room nearer the private apartments my uncles correspondence underwent an exhaustive process of pruning and digestion before it reached him then the two little rooms in which my uncle talked my magic uncle who had got the investing publicto whom all things were possible as one came in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an expression of dubious beatitude upon his face while some one urged him to grow still richer by this or that  thatju george he used to say come in heres a thing tell himmisterover again have a drink george no wise man lissn  i was always ready to listen all sorts of financial marvels came out of the hardingham more particularly during my uncles last great flurry but they were nothing to the projects that passed in it was the little brown and gold room he sat in usually he had had it redecorated by bordingly and half a dozen sussex pictures by webster hung about it latterly he wore a velveteen jacket of a goldenbrown colour in this apartment that i think overemphasised its esthetic intention and he also added some gross chinese bronzes  he was on the whole a very happy man throughout all that wildly enterprising time he made and as i shall tell in its place spent great sums of money he was constantly in violent motion constantly stimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired about him was an atmosphere of immense deference much of his waking life was triumphal and all his dreams i doubt if he had any dissatisfaction with himself at all until the crash bore him down things must have gone very rapidly with him i think he must have been very happy  as i sit here writing about all these things jerking down notes and throwing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form to the tale of our promotions the marvel of it all comes to me as if it came for the first time the supreme unreason of it at the climax of his boom my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in substance and credit about two million poundsworth of property to set off against his vague colossal liabilities and from first to last he must have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions  this irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him that paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it lies for he created nothing he invented nothing he economised nothing i cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all several like tonobungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money and the things the hardingham gave out i repeat were nothing to the things that came in i think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that now it was a device for selling bread under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weightthis was afterwards floated as the decorticated healthbread company and bumped against the lawnow it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity now the treachery of a too wellinformed employee anxious to become our partner it was all put to us tentatively persuasively sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudoboyish frankness now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer now some earnest specially dressed youth with an eyeglass and a buttonhole now some homelyspeaking shrewd manchester man or some scotchman eager to be very clear and full  many came in couples or trios often in tow of an explanatory solicitor some were white and earnest some flustered beyond measure at their opportunity some of them begged and prayed to be taken up my uncle chose what he wanted and left the rest he became very autocratic to these applicants  he felt he could make them and they felt so too he had but to say no and they faded out of existence he had become a sort of vortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord his possessions increased by heaps his shares his leaseholds and mortgages and debentures  behind his firstline things he found it necessary at last and sanctioned by all the precincts to set up three general trading companies the london and african investment company the british traders loan company and business organisations limited this was in the culminating time when i had least to do with affairs i dont say that with any desire to exculpate myself i admit i was a director of all three and i will confess i was willfully incurious in that capacity each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters and paying a dividend out of the proceeds i sat at the table and agreed that was our method of equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the bubble  you perceive now however the nature of the services for which this fantastic community have him unmanageable wealth and power and real respect it was all a monstrous payment for courageous fiction a gratuity in return for the one reality of human lifeillusion we gave them a feeling of hope and profit we sent a tidal wave of water and confidence into their stranded affairs we mint faith george said my uncle one day thats what we do and by jove we got to keep minting we been making human confidence ever since i drove the first cork of tonobungay  coining would have been a better word than minting and yet you know in a sense he was right civilisation is possible only through confidence so that we can bank our money and go unarmed about the streets the bank reserve or a policeman keeping order in a jostling multitude of people are only slightly less impudent bluffs than my uncles prospectuses they couldnt for a moment make good if the quarter of what they guarantee was demanded of them the whole of this modern mercantile investing civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams are made of a mass of people swelters and toils great railway systems grow cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far mines are opened factories hum foundries roar ships plough the seas countries are settled about this busy striving world the rich owners go controlling all enjoying all confident and creating the confidence that draws us all together into a reluctant nearly unconscious brotherhood i wonder and plan my engines the flags flutter the crowds cheer the legislatures meet yet it seems to me indeed at times that all this present commercial civilisation is no more than my poor uncles career writ large a swelling thinning bubble of assurances that its arithmetic is just as unsound its dividends as illadvised its ultimate aim as vague and forgotten that it all drifts on perhaps to some tremendous parallel to his individual disaster  well so it was we boomed and for four years and a half we lived a life of mingled substance and moonshine until our particular unsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of motorcars upon tangible high roads made ourselves conspicuous and stately in splendid houses ate sumptuously and had a perpetual stream of notes and money trickling into our pockets hundreds of thousands of men and women respected us saluted us and gave us toil and honour i asked and my worksheets rose my aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness to scare the downland pewits my uncle waved his hand and lady grove and all its associations of chivalry and ancient peace were his waved again and architects were busy planning the great palace he never finished at crest hill and an army of folkmen gathered to do his bidding blue marble came from canada and timber from new zealand and beneath it all you know there was nothing but fictitious values as evanescent as rainbow gold  iv  i pass the hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the great archway at the fountain and the ferns and think of those receding days when i was so near the centre of our eddy of greed and enterprise i see again my uncles face white and intent and hear him discourse hear him make consciously napoleonic decisions grip his nettles put his finger on the spot bluff say snap he became particularly addicted to the last idiom towards the end every conceivable act took the form of saying snap  the odd fish that came to us and among others came gordonnasmyth that queer blend of romance and illegality who was destined to drag me into the most irrelevant adventure in my life the mordet island affair and leave me as they say with blood upon my hands it is remarkable how little it troubles my conscience and how much it stirs my imagination that particular memory of the life i took the story of mordet island has been told in a government report and told all wrong there are still excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places but the liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out altogether  ive still the vividest memory of gordonnasmyths appearance in the inner sanctum a lank sunburnt person in tweeds with a yellowbrown hatchet face and one faded blue eyethe other was a closed and sunken lidand how he told us with a stiff affectation of ease his incredible story of this great heap of quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on the beach behind mordets island among white dead mangroves and the black ooze of brackish water  whats quap said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the word  they call it quap or quab or quabb said gordonnasmyth but our relations werent friendly enough to get the accent right  but there the stuff is for the taking they dont know about it nobody knows about it i got down to the damned place in a canoe alone the boys wouldnt come i pretended to be botanising   to begin with gordonnasmyth was inclined to be dramatic  look here he said when he first came in shutting the door rather carefully behind him as he spoke do you two menyes or nowant to put up six thousandfora clear good chance of fifteen hundred per cent on your money in a year  were always getting chances like that said my uncle cocking his cigar offensively wiping his glasses and tilting his chair back we stick to a safe twenty  gordonnasmyths quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of his attitude  dont you believe him said i getting up before he could reply youre different and i know your books were very glad youve come to us confound it uncle its gordonnasmyth sit down what is it minerals  quap said gordonnasmyth fixing his eye on me in heaps  in heaps said my uncle softly with his glasses very oblique  youre only fit for the grocery said gordonnasmyth scornfully sitting down and helping himself to one of my uncles cigars im sorry i came but still now im here and first as to quap quap sir is the most radioactive stuff in the world thats quap its a festering mass of earths and heavy metals polonium radium ythorium thorium carium and new things too theres a stuff called xkprovisionally there they are mucked up together in a sort of rotting sand what it is how it got made i dont know its like as if some young creator had been playing about there there it lies in two heaps one small one great and the world for miles about it is blasted and scorched and dead you can have it for the getting youve got to take itthats all  that sounds all right said i have you samples  wellshould i you can have anythingup to two ounces  where is it  his blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me he smoked and was fragmentary for a time fending off my questions then his story began to piece itself together he conjured up a vision of this strange forgotten kink in the worlds littoral of the long meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of atlantic surf of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker he gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay and told how at last comes a break among these things an arena fringed with bonewhite dead trees a sight of the hardblue sea line beyond the dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud bleached and scarred a little way off among charred dead weeds stands the abandoned stationabandoned because every man who stayed two months at that station stayed to die eaten up mysteriously like a leper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and oblique piles and planks still insecurely possible  and in the midst two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs one small one great sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space acrossquap  there it is said gordonnasmyth worth three pounds an ounce if its worth a penny two great heaps of it rotten stuff and soft ready to shovel and wheel and you may get it by the ton  how did it get there  god knows  there it isfor the taking in a country where you mustnt trade in a country where the company waits for good kind men to find it riches and then take em away from em there you have itderelict  cant you do any sort of deal  theyre too damned stupid youve got to go and take it thats all  they might catch you  they might of course but theyre not great at catching  we went into the particulars of that difficulty they wouldnt catch me because id sink first give me a yacht said gordonnasmyth thats all i need  but if you get caught said my uncle  i am inclined to think gordonnasmyth imagined we would give him a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk it was very good talk but we didnt do that i stipulated for samples of his stuff for analysis and he consentedreluctantly  i think on the whole he would rather i didnt examine samples he made a motion pocketwards that gave us an invincible persuasion that he had a sample upon him and that at the last instant he decided not to produce it prematurely  there was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him he didnt like to give us samples and he wouldnt indicate within three hundred miles the position of this mordet island of his he had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense value and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go with business people and so presently to gain time for these hesitations of his he began to talk of other things he talked very well he talked of the dutch east indies and of the congo of portuguese east africa and paraguay of malays and rich chinese merchants dyaks and negroes and the spread of the mahometan world in africa today and all this time he was trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his adventure our cosy inner office became a little place and all our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of strange minglings of men of slayings unavenged and curious customs of trade where no writs run and the dark treacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels  we had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on paris our world was england are the places of origin of half the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland or the forest of arden but gordonnasmyth made it so real and intimate for us that afternoonfor me at any ratethat it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now again remembered  and in the end he produced his sample a little lump of muddy clay speckled with brownish grains in a glass bottle wrapped about with lead and flannelred flannel it was i remembera hue which is i know popularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel  dont carry it about on you said gordonnasmyth it makes a sore  i took the stuff to thorold and thorold had the exquisite agony of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis he has christened them and published since but at the time gordonnasmyth wouldnt hear for a moment of our publication of any facts at all indeed he flew into a violent passion and abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to thorold i thought you were going to analyse it yourself he said with the touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences  i made some commercial inquiries and there seemed even then much truth in gordonnasmyths estimate of the value of the stuff it was before the days of caperns discovery of the value of canadium and his use of it in the capern filament but the cerium and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the gasmantles then in vogue there were however doubts indeed there were numerous doubts what were the limits of the gasmantle trade how much thorium not to speak of cerium could they take at a maximum suppose that quantity was high enough to justify our shipload came doubts in another quarter were the heaps up to sample were they as big as he said was gordonnasmythimaginative and if these values held could we after all get the stuff it wasnt ours it was on forbidden ground you see there were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this adventure  we went some way nevertheless in the discussion of his project though i think we tried his patience then suddenly he vanished from london and i saw no more of him for a year and a half  my uncle said that was what he had expected and when at last gordonnasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he had been to paraguay on private and we guessed passionate affairs the business of the quap expedition had to be begun again at the beginning my uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical but i wasnt so decided i think i was drawn by its picturesque aspects but we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until caperns discovery  nasmyths story had laid hold of my imagination like one small intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs i kept it going during gordonnasmyths intermittent appearances in england every now and then he and i would meet and reinforce its effect we would lunch in london or he would cone to see my gliders at crest hill and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now with me now alone  at times they became a sort of fairystory with us an imaginative exercise and there came caperns discovery of what he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the business side of quap for the ideal filament needed five per cent of canadium and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile but to thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap i told my uncle and we jumped on to the process at once we found that gordonnasmyth still unaware of the altered value of the stuff and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium had got hold of a cousin named pollack made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy and was buying a brig we put in put down three thousand pounds and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air leaving pollack i regret to say in the brig and in the secretexcept so far as canadium and the filament wentas residuum we discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all to put it plainly stealing  but that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis and i will tell of it in its place  so it was quap came into our affairs came in as a fairytale and became real more and more real it grew until at last it was real until at last i saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination had seen for so long and felt between my fingers again that halfgritty half soft texture of quap like sanded moistsugar mixed with clay in which there stirs something  one must feel it to understand  v  all sorts of things came to the hardingham and offered themselves to my uncle gordonnasmyth stands but only because he played a part at last in the crisis of our fortunes so much came to us that it seemed to me at times as though the whole world of human affairs was ready to prostitute itself to our real and imaginary millions as i look back i am still dazzled and incredulous to think of the quality of our opportunities  we did the most extraordinary things things that it seems absurd to me to leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who cares to do them i had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money among other things that my uncle offered for he tried very hard to buy the british medical journal and the lancet and run them on what he called modern lines and when they resisted him he talked very vigorously for a time of organising a rival enterprise that was a very magnificent idea indeed in its way it would have given a tremendous advantage in the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed i scarcely know how far it would not have put the medical profession in our grip it still amazes mei shall die amazedthat such a thing can be possible in the modern state if my uncle failed to bring the thing off some one else may succeed but i doubt even if he had got both these weeklies whether his peculiar style would have suited them the change of purpose would have shown he would have found it difficult to keep up their dignity  he certainly did not keep up the dignity of the sacred grove an important critical organ which he acquired one dayby saying snapfor eight hundred pounds he got it lock stock and barrelunder one or other of which three aspects the editor was included even at that price it didnt pay if you are a literary person you will remember the bright new cover he gave that representative organ of british intellectual culture and how his sound business instincts jarred with the exalted pretensions of a vanishing age one old wrapper i discovered the other day runs       the sacred grove       weekly magazine of art philosophy science and      belles lettres             have you a nasty taste in your mouth      it is liver       you need one twentythree  pill       just one       not a drug but a live american remedy             contents       a hitherto

fiction etc            the best pill in the world for an irregular liver  i suppose it is some lingering traces of the bladesover tradition to me that makes this combination of letters and pills seem so incongruous just as i suppose it is a lingering trace of plutarch and my ineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom our state should be wise sane and dignified that makes me think a country which leaves its medical and literary criticism or indeed any such vitally important criticism entirely to private enterprise and open to the advances of any purchaser must be in a frankly hopeless condition these are ideal conceptions of mine  as a matter of fact nothing would be more entirely natural and representative of the relations of learning thought and the economic situation in the world at the present time than this cover of the sacred grovethe quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other the contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment and extreme mental immobility  vi  there comes back too among these hardingham memories an impression of a drizzling november day and how we looked out of the windows upon a procession of the london unemployed  it was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether world some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the west eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and insubstantial threat it is work we need not charity  there they were halfphantom through the fog a silent footdragging interminable grey procession they carried wet dirty banners they rattled boxes for pence these men who had not said snap in the right place the men who had snapped too eagerly the men who had never said snap the men who had never had a chance of saying snap a shambling shameful stream they made oozing along the street the gutter waste of competitive civilisation and we stood high out of it all as high as if we looked godlike from another world standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished skillfully warmed filled with costly things  there thought i but for the grace of god go george and edward ponderevo  but my uncles thoughts ran in a different channel and he made that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon tariff reform   chapter the second  our progress from camden town to crest hill  i  so far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his industrial and financial exploits but side by side with that history of inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another development the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of the camden town lodging to the lavish munificence of the crest hill marble staircase and my aunts golden bed the bed that was facsimiled from fontainebleau and the odd thing is that as i come to this nearer part of my story i find it much more difficult to tell than the clear little perspective memories of the earlier days impressions crowd upon one another and overlap one another i was presently to fall in love again to be seized by a passion to which i still faintly respond a passion that still clouds my mind i came and went between ealing and my aunt and uncle and presently between effie and clubland and then between business and a life of research that became far more continuous infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these other sets of experiences i didnt witness a regular social progress therefore my aunt and uncle went up in the world so far as i was concerned as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph with little jumps and flickers  as i recall this side of our life the figure of my roundeyes buttonnosed pinkandwhite aunt susan tends always to the central position we drove the car and sustained the car she sat in it with a magnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck and always with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can rendercommented on and illuminated the new aspects  ive already sketched the little home behind the wimblehurst chemists shop the lodging near the cobden statue and the apartments in gower street thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in redgauntlet mansions there they lived when i married it was a compact flat with very little for a woman to do in it in those days my aunt i think used to find the time heavy upon her hands and so she took to books and reading and after a time even to going to lectures in the afternoon i began to find unexpected books upon her table sociological books travels shaws plays hullo i said at the sight of some volume of the latter  im keeping a mind george she explained  eh  keeping a mind dogs i never cared for its been a tossup between setting up a mind and setting up a soul its jolly lucky for him and you its a mind ive joined the london library and im going in for the royal institution and every blessed lecture that comes along next winter youd better look out  and i remember her coming in late one evening with a notebook in her hand  where ya been susan said my uncle  birkbeckphysiology im getting on she sat down and took off her gloves youre just glass to me she sighed and then in a note of grave reproach you old package i had no idea the things youve kept from me  presently they were setting up the house at beckengham and my aunt intermitted her intellectual activities the house at beckengham was something of an enterprise for them at that time a reasonably large place by the standards of the early years of tonobungay it was a big rather gaunt villa with a conservatory and a shrubbery a tennislawn a quite considerable vegetable garden and a small disused coachhouse i had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration but not many because of the estrangement between my aunt and marion  my aunt went into that house with considerable zest and my uncle distinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the repainting and replumbing he had all the drains up and most of the garden with them and stood administrative on heapsadministrating whisky to the workmen i found him there one day most napoleonic on a little elba of dirt in an atmosphere that defies print he also i remember chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for the painting of the woodwork this exasperated my aunt extremelyshe called him a pestilential old splosher with an unusual note of earnestnessand he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving each bedroom the name of some favourite herocliff napoleon caesar and so forthand having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a black label martin luther was kept for me only her respect for domestic discipline she said prevented her retaliating with old pondo on the housemaids cupboard  also he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden requisites i have ever seenand had them all painted a hard clear blue my aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated and this done she found great joy in the garden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer leaving her mind indeed to damp evenings and the winter months when i think of her at beckenham i always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected with her arms in huge gauntleted gardening gloves a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy and promising annual limp and very younglooking and sheepish in the other  beckenham in the persons of a vicar a doctors wife and a large proud lady called hogberry called on my uncle and aunt almost at once so soon in fact as the lawn was down again and afterwards my aunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door a propos of an overhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence so she resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the disaster of wimblehurst she made a partially facetious study of the etiquette of her position had cards engraved and retaliated calls and then she received a card for one of mrs hogberrys at homes gave an old garden party herself participated in a bazaar and sale of work and was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in beckenham society when she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and transplanted to chiselhurst  old trek george she said compactly onward and up when i found her superintending the loading of two big furniture vans go up and say goodbye to martin luther and then ill see what you can do to help me  ii  i look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory and beckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase but really they were there several years through nearly all my married life in fact and far longer than the year and odd months we lived together at wimblehurst but the wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory by far then the beckenham period there comes back to me with a quite considerable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my aunts and of a little social misbehaviour of which i was guilty on that occasion its like a scrap from another life its all set in what is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling the feeling of rather illcut city clothes frock coat and grey trousers and of a high collar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers i have still a quite vivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn of the gathering and particularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering of the parlourmaid and the blue teacups and of the magnificent presence of mrs hogberry and of her clear resonant voice it was a voice that would have gone with a garden party on a larger scale it went into adjacent premises it included the gardener who was far up the vegetable patch and technically out of play the only other men were my aunts doctor two of the clergy amiable contrasted men and mrs hogberrys imperfectly grownup son a youth just bursting into collar the rest were women except for a young girl or so in a state of speechless good behaviour marion also was there  marion and i had arrived a little estranged and i remember her as a silent presence a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of intercourse we had embittered each other with one of those miserable little disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us she had with the help of smithie dressed rather elaborately for the occasion and when she saw me prepared to accompany her in i think it was a grey suit she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative i was recalcitrant she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party with the king present and finally i capitulatedbut after my evil habit resentfully eh dear those old quarrels how pitiful they were how trivial and how sorrowful they are to recall i think they grow more sorrowful as i grow older and all the small passionate reasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory  the impression that beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a modest unreality they were all maintaining a front of unspecified social pretension and evading the display of the economic facts of the case most of the husbands were in business off stage it would have been outrageous to ask what the business wasand the wives were giving their energies to produce with the assistance of novels and the illustrated magazines a moralised version of the afternoon life of the aristocratic class they hadnt the intellectual or moral enterprise of the upperclass woman they had no political interests they had no views about anything and consequently they were i remember extremely difficult to talk to they all sat about in the summerhouse and in gardenchairs and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady three ladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity broken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate oh whacking me about again augh  the dominant social fact that afternoon was mrs hogberry she took up a certain position commanding the croquet and went on as my aunt said to me in an incidental aside like an old roundabout she talked of the way in which beckenham society was getting mixed and turned on to a touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at little gossdean followed a loud account of little gossdean and how much she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there my poor mother was quite a little queen there she said and such nice common people people say the country labourers are getting disrespectful nowadays it isnt sonot if theyre properly treated here of course in beckenham its different i wont call the people we get here a poortheyre certainly not a proper poor theyre masses i always tell mr bugshoot theyre masses and ought to be treated as such  dim memories of mrs mackridge floated through my mind as i listened to her  i was whirled on this roundabout for a bit and then had the fortune to fall off into a teteatete with a lady whom my aunt introduced as mrs mumblebut then she introduced everybody to me as mumble that afternoon either by way of humour or necessity  that must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite conversation and i remember that i began by criticising the local railway service and that at the third sentence or thereabouts mrs mumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared i was a very frivolous person  i wonder now what it was i said that was frivolous  i dont know what happened to end that conversation or if it had an end i remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather awkwardly and being given a sort of topographical history of beckenham which he assured me time after time was quite an old place quite an old place as though i had treated it as new and he meant to be very patient but very convincing then we hung up in a distinct pause and my aunt rescued me george she said in a confidential undertone keep the pot aboiling and then audibly i say will you both old trot about with tea a bit  only too delighted to trot for you mrs ponderevo said the clergyman becoming fearfully expert and in his elements only too delighted  i found we were near a rustic table and that the housemaid was behind us in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea things  trot repeated the clergyman to me much amused excellent expression and i just saved him from the tray as he turned about  we handed tea for a while  give em cakes said my aunt flushed but well in hand helps em to talk george always talk best after a little nourishment like throwing a bit of turf down an old geyser  she surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped herself to tea  they keep on going stiff she said in an undertone ive done my best  its been a huge success i said encouragingly  that boy has had his legs crossed in that position and hasnt spoken for ten minutes stiffer and stiffer brittle hes beginning a dry coughalways a bad sign george walk em about shall irub their noses with snow  happily she didnt i got myself involved with the gentlewoman from next door a pensive languidlooking little woman with a low voice and fell talking our topic cats and dogs and which it was we liked best  i always feel said the pensive little woman that theres something about a doga cat hasnt got it  yes i found myself admitting with great enthusiasm there is something and yet again  oh i know theres something about a cat too but it isnt the same  not quite the same i admitted but still its something  ah but such a different something  more sinuous  much more  ever so much more  it makes all the difference dont you think  yes i said all  she glanced at me gravely and sighed a long deeply felt yes a long pause  the thing seemed to me to amount to a stalemate fear came into my heart and much perplexity  theerroses i said i felt like a drowning man those rosesdont you think they arevery beautiful flowers  arent they she agreed gently there seems to be something in rosessomethingi dont know how to express it  something i said helpfully  yes she said something isnt there  so few people see it i said mores the pity  she sighed and said again very softly yes  there was another long pause i looked at her and she was thinking dreamily the drowning sensation returned the fear and enfeeblement i perceived by a sort of inspiration that her teacup was empty  let me take your cup i said abruptly and that secured made for the table by the summerhouse i had no intention then of deserting my aunt but close at hand the big french window of the drawingroom yawned inviting and suggestive i can feel all that temptation now and particularly the provocation of my collar in an instant i was lost i wouldjust for a moment  i dashed in put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled upstairs softly swiftly three steps at a time to the sanctuary of my uncles study his snuggery i arrived there breathless convinced there was no return for me i was very glad and ashamed of myself and desperate by means of a penknife i contrived to break open his cabinet of cigars drew a chair to the window took off my coat collar and tie and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously and peeping through the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether gone  the clergymen i thought were wonderful  iii  a few such pictures of those early days at beckenham stand out and then i find myself among the chiselhurst memories the chiselhurst mansion had grounds rather than a mere garden and there was a gardeners cottage and a little lodge at the gate the ascendant movement was always far more in evidence there than at beckenham the velocity was increasing  one night picks itself out as typical as in its way marking an epoch i was there i think about some advertisement stuff on some sort of business anyhow and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly from a dinner at the runcorns even there he was nibbling at runcorn with the idea of our great amalgamation budding in his mind i got down there i suppose about eleven i found the two of them sitting in the study my aunt on a chairarm with a whimsical pensiveness on her face regarding my uncle and he much extended and very rotund in the low armchair drawn up to the fender  look here george said my uncle after my first greetings i just been saying we arent oh fay  eh  not oh fay socially  old fly he means georgefrench  oh didnt think of french one never knows where to have him whats gone wrong tonight  i been thinking it isnt any particular thing i ate too much of that fishy stuff at first like salt frog spawn and was a bit confused by olives andwell i didnt know which wine was which had to say that each time it puts your talk all wrong and she wasnt in evening dress not like the others we cant go on in that style georgenot a proper ad  im not sure you were right i said in having a fly  we got to do it all better said my uncle we got to do it in style smart business smart men she tries to pass it off as humorousmy aunt pulled a grimaceit isnt humorous see were on the upgrade now fair and square were going to be big we arent going to be laughed at as poovenoos see  nobody laughed at you said my aunt old bladder  nobody isnt going to laugh at me said my uncle glancing at his contours and suddenly sitting up  my aunt raised her eyebrows slightly swung her foot and said nothing  we arent keeping pace with our own progress george we got to were bumping against new people and they set up to be gentlefolksetiquette dinners and all the rest of it they give themselves airs and expect us to be fishoutofwater we arent going to be they think weve no style well we give them style for our advertisements and were going to give em style all through you neednt be born to it to dance well on the wires of the bond street tradesmen see  i handed him the cigarbox  runcorn hadnt cigars like these he said truncating one lovingly we beat him at cigars well beat him all round  my aunt and i regarded him full of apprehensions  i got idees he said darkly to the cigar deepening our dread  he pocketed his cigarcutter and spoke again  we got to learn all the rotten little game first see frinstance we got to get samples of all the blessed wines there areand learn em up stern smoor burgundy all of em she took stern tonightand when she tasted it firstyou pulled a face susan you did i saw you it surprised you you bunched your nose we got to get used to wine and not do that we got to get used to wearing evening dressyou susan too  always have had a tendency to stick out of my clothes said my aunt howeverwho cares she shrugged her shoulders  i had never seen my uncle so immensely serious  got to get the hang of etiquette he went on to the fire horses even practise everything dine every night in evening dress get a brougham or something learn up golf and tennis and things country gentleman oh fay it isnt only freedom from goochery  eh i said  ohgawshery if you like  french george said my aunt but im not ol gooch i made that face for fun  it isnt only freedom from gawshery we got to have style see style just all right and one better thats what i call style we can do it and we will  he mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space leaning forward and looking into the fire  what is it he asked after all what is it tips about eating tips about drinking clothes how to hold yourself and not say jes the few little things they know for certain are wrongjes the shibboleth things  he was silent again and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards the zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased  learn the whole bag of tricks in six months he said becoming more cheerful ah susan beat it out george you in particular ought to get hold of it ought to get into a good club and all that  always ready to learn i said ever since you gave me the chance of latin so far we dont seem to have hit upon any latinspeaking stratum in the population  weve come to french said my aunt anyhow  its a very useful language said my uncle put a point on things zzzz as for accent no englishman has an accent no englishman pronounces french properly dont you tell me its a bluffits all a bluff lifes a bluffpractically thats why its so important susan for us to attend to style le steel say lum the style its the man whad you laughing at susan george youre not smoking these cigars are good for the mind what do you think of it all we got to adapt ourselves we haveso far not going to be beat by these silly things  iv  what do you think of it george he insisted  what i said i thought of it i dont now recall only i have very distinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunts impenetrable eye and anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy to rape the mysteries of the costly life and become the calmest of its lords on the whole i think he did itthoroughly i have crowded memories a little difficult to disentangle of his experimental stages his experimental proceedings its hard at times to say which memory comes in front of which i recall him as presenting on the whole a series of small surprises as being again and again unexpectedly a little more selfconfident a little more polished a little richer and finer a little more aware of the positions and values of things and men  there was a timeit must have been very earlywhen i saw him deeply impressed by the splendours of the diningroom of the national liberal club heaven knows who our host was or what that particular little feed was about nowall that sticks is the impression of our straggling entry a string of six or seven guests and my uncle looking about him at the numerous bright redshaded tables at the exotics in great majolica jars at the shining ceramic columns and pilasters at the impressive portraits of liberal statesmen and heroes and all that contributes to the ensemble of that palatial spectacle he was betrayed into a whisper to me this is all right george he said that artless comment seems almost incredible as i set it down there came a time so speedily when not even the clubs of new york could have overawed my uncle and when he could walk through the bowing magnificence of the royal grand hotel to his chosen table in that aggressively exquisite gallery upon the river with all the easy calm of one of earths legitimate kings  the two of them learnt the new game rapidly and well they experimented abroad they experimented at home at chiselhurst with the aid of a new very costly but highly instructive cook they tried over everything they heard of that roused their curiosity and had any reputation for difficulty from asparagus to plovers eggs they afterwards got a gardener who could wait at tableand he brought the soil home to one then there came a butler  i remember my aunts first dinnergown very brightly and how she stood before the fire in the drawingroom confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed and looking over her shoulder at herself in a mirror  a ham she remarked reflectively must feel like this just a necklace  i attempted i think some commonplace compliment  my uncle appeared at the door in a white waistcoat and with his hands in his trouser pockets he halted and surveyed her critically  couldnt tell you from a duchess susan he remarked id like to have you painted standin at the fire like that sargent you lookspirited somehow lordi wish some of those damned tradesmen at wimblehurst could see you  they did a lot of weekending at hotels and sometimes i went down with them we seemed to fall into a vast drifting crowd of social learners i dont know whether it is due simply to my changed circumstances but it seems to me there have been immensely disproportionate developments of the hotelfrequenting and restaurantusing population during the last twenty years it is not only i think that there are crowds of people who like we were are in the economically ascendant phase but whole masses of the prosperous section of the population must be altering its habits giving up hightea for dinner and taking to evening dress using the weekend hotels as a practiseground for these new social arts a swift and systematic conversion to gentility has been going on i am convinced throughout the whole commercial uppermiddle class since i was twentyone curiously mixed was the personal quality of the people one saw in these raids there were conscientiously refined and lowvoiced people reeking with proud bashfulness there were aggressively smart people using pet diminutives for each other loudly and seeking fresh occasions for brilliant rudeness there were awkward husbands and wives quarrelling furtively about their manners and ill at ease under the eye of the winter cheerfully amiable and often discrepant couples with a disposition to inconspicuous corners and the jolly sort affecting an unaffected ease plump happy ladies who laughed too loud and gentlemen in evening dress who subsequently got their pipes and nobody you knew was anybody however expensively they dressed and whatever rooms they took  i look back now with a curious remoteness of spirit to those crowded diningrooms with their dispersed tables and their inevitable redshaded lights and the unsympathetic unskillful waiters and the choice of thig or glear sir ive not dined in that way in that sort of place now for five yearsit must be quite five years so specialised and narrow is my life becoming  my uncles earlier motorcar phases work in with these associations and there stands out a little bright vignette of the hall of the magnificent bexhillonsea and people dressed for dinner and sitting about amidst the scarlet furnituresatin and whiteenameled woodwork until the gong should gather them and my aunt is there very marvelously wrapped about in a dust cloak and a cagelike veil and there are hotel porters and underporters very alert and an obsequious manager and the tall young lady in black from the office is surprised into admiration and in the middle of the picture is my uncle making his first appearance in that esquimaux costume i have already mentioned a short figure compactly immense hugely goggled wearing a sort of brown rubber proboscis and surmounted by a tableland of motoring cap  v  so it was we recognised our new needs as fresh invaders of the upper levels of the social system and set ourselves quite consciously to the acquisition of style and savoir faire we became part of what is nowadays quite an important element in the confusion of our world that multitude of economically ascendant people who are learning how to spend money it is made up of financial people the owners of the businesses that are eating up their competitors inventors of new sources of wealth such as ourselves it includes nearly all america as one sees it on the european stage it is a various multitude having only this in common they are all moving and particularly their womankind are moving from conditions in which means were insistently finite things were few and customs simple towards a limitless expenditure and the sphere of attraction of bond street fifth avenue and paris their general effect is one of progressive revolution of limitless rope  they discover suddenly indulgences their moral code never foresaw and has no provision for elaborations ornaments possessions beyond their wildest dreams with an immense astonished zest they begin shopping begin a systematic adaptation to a new life crowded and brilliant with things shopped with jewels maids butlers coachmen electric broughams hired town and country houses they plunge into it as one plunges into a career as a class they talk think and dream possessions their literature their press turns all on that immense illustrated weeklies of unsurpassed magnificence guide them in domestic architecture in the art of owning a garden in the achievement of the sumptuous in motorcars in an elaborate sporting equipment in the purchase and control of their estates in travel and stupendous hotels once they begin to move they go far and fast acquisition becomes the substance of their lives they find a world organised to gratify that passion in a brief year or so they are connoisseurs they join in the plunder of the eighteenth century buy rare old books fine old pictures good old furniture their first crude conception of dazzling suites of the newly perfect is replaced almost from the outset by a jackdaw dream of accumulating costly discrepant old things  i seem to remember my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly in the beckenham days and in the early chiselhurst days he was chiefly interested in getting money and except for his onslaught on the beckenham house bothered very little about his personal surroundings and possessions i forget now when the change came and he began to spend some accident must have revealed to him this new source of power or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain he began to spend and shop so soon as he began to shop he began to shop violently he began buying pictures and then oddly enough old clocks for the chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather clocks and three copper warming pans after that he bought much furniture then he plunged into art patronage and began to commission pictures and to make presents to churches and institutions his buying increased with a regular acceleration its development was a part of the mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last four years of his ascent towards the climax he was a furious spender he shopped with large unexpected purchases he shopped like a mind seeking expression he shopped to astonish and dismay shopped crescendo shopped fortissimo con molto espressione until the magnificent smash of crest hill eroded his shopping for ever always it was he who shopped my aunt did not shine as a purchaser it is a curious thing due to i know not what fine strain in her composition that my aunt never set any great store upon possessions she plunged through that crowded bazaar of vanity fair during those feverish years spending no doubt freely and largely but spending with detachment and a touch of humorous contempt for the things even the old things that money can buy it came to me suddenly one afternoon just how detached she was as i saw her going towards the hardingham sitting up as she always did rather stiffly in her electric brougham regarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent blue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment no one i thought would sit so apart if she hadnt dreamsand what are her dreams  id never thought  and i remember too an outburst of scornful description after she had lunched with a party of women at the imperial cosmic club she came round to my rooms on the chance of finding me there and i gave her tea she professed herself tired and cross and flung herself into my chair  george she cried the things women are do i stink of money  lunching i asked  she nodded  plutocratic ladies  yes  oriental type  oh like a burst hareem bragging of possessions they feel you they feel your clothes george to see if they are good  i soothed her as well as i could they are good arent they i said  its the old pawnshop in their blood she said drinking tea and then in infinite disgust they run their hands over your clothesthey paw you  i had a moment of doubt whether perhaps she had not been discovered in possession of unsuspected forgeries i dont know after that my eyes were quickened and i began to see for myself women running their hands over other womens furs scrutinising their lace even demanding to handle jewelry appraising envying testing they have a kind of etiquette the woman who feels says what beautiful sables what lovely lace the woman felt admits proudly its real you know or disavows pretension modestly and hastily its rot good in each others houses they peer at the pictures handle the selvage of hangings look at the bottoms of china  i wonder if it is the old pawnshop in the blood  i doubt if lady drew and the olympians did that sort of thing but here i may be only clinging to another of my former illusions about aristocracy and the state perhaps always possessions have been booty and never anywhere has there been such a thing as house and furnishings native and natural to the women and men who made use of them  vi  for me at least it marked an epoch in my uncles career when i learnt one day that he had shopped lady grove i realised a fresh wide unpreluded step he took me by surprise with the sudden change of scale from such portable possessions as jewels and motorcars to a stretch of countryside the transaction was napoleonic he was told of the place he said snap there were no preliminary desirings or searchings then he came home and said what he had done even my aunt was for a day or so measurably awestricken by this exploit in purchase and we both went down with him to see the house in a mood near consternation it struck us then as a very lordly place indeed i remember the three of us standing on the terrace that looked westward surveying the skyreflecting windows of the house and a feeling of unwarrantable intrusion comes back to me  lady grove you know is a very beautiful house indeed a still and gracious place whose agelong seclusion was only effectively broken with the toot of the coming of the motorcar an old catholic family had died out in it century by century and was now altogether dead portions of the fabric are thirteenth century and its last architectural revision was tudor within it is for the most part dark and chilly save for two or three favoured rooms and its tallwindowed oakgalleried hall its terrace is its noblest feature a very wide broad lawn it is bordered by a low stone battlement and there is a great cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out across the blue distances of the weald blue distances that are made extraordinarily italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that single tree it is a very high terrace southward one looks down upon the tops of wayfaring trees and spruces and westward on a steep slope of beechwood through which the road comes one turns back to the still old house and sees a grey and lichenous facade with a very finely arched entrance it was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with the colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus it seemed to me that the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was some bearded scholarly man in a black cassock gentlevoiced and whitehanded or some very softrobed grey gentlewoman and there was my uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove wiping the glass with a pockethandkerchief and asking my aunt if lady grove wasnt a bit of all right  my aunt made him no answer  the man who built this i speculated wore armour and carried a sword  theres some of it inside still said my uncle  we went inside an old woman with very white hair was in charge of the place and cringed rather obviously to the new master she evidently found him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed and was dreadfully afraid of him but if the surviving present bowed down to us the past did not we stood up to the dark long portraits of the extinguished raceone was a holbeinand looked them in their sidelong eyes they looked back at us we all i know felt the enigmatical quality in them even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed i think by that invincibly selfcomplacent expression it was just as though after all he had not bought them up and replaced them altogether as though that secretly they knew better and could smile at him  the spirit of the place was akin to bladesover but touched with something older and remoter that armour that stood about had once served in tiltyards if indeed it had not served in battle and this family had sent its blood and treasure time after time upon the most romantic quest in history to palestine dreams loyalties place and honour how utterly had it all evaporated leaving at last the final expression of its spirit these quaint painted smiles these smiles of triumphant completion it had evaporated indeed long before the ultimate durgan had died and in his old age he had cumbered the place with early victorian cushions and carpets and tapestry tablecloths and invalid appliances of a type even more extinct it seemed to us than the crusades yes it was different from bladesover  bit stuffy george said my uncle they hadnt much idea of ventilation when this was built  one of the panelled rooms was halffilled with presses and a fourposter bed might be the ghost room said my uncle but it did not seem to me that so retiring a family as the durgans so old and completely exhausted a family as the durgans was likely to haunt anybody what living thing now had any concern with their honour and judgments and good and evil deeds ghosts and witchcraft were a later innovationthat fashion came from scotland with the stuarts  afterwards prying for epitaphs we found a marble crusader with a broken nose under a battered canopy of fretted stone outside the restricted limits of the present duffield church and half buried in nettles ichabod said my uncle eh we shall be like that susan some day im going to clean him up a bit and put a railing to keep off the children  old saved at the eleventh hour said my aunt quoting one of the less successful advertisements of tonobungay  but i dont think my uncle heard her  it was by our captured crusader that the vicar found us he came round the corner at us briskly a little out of breath he had an air of having been running after us since the first toot of our horn had warned the village of our presence he was an oxford man cleanshaven with a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner a cultivated intonation and a general air of accommodation to the new order of things these oxford men are the greeks of our plutocratic empire he was a tory in spirit and what one may call an adapted tory by stress of circumstances that is to say he was no longer a legitimist he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old we were pill vendors he knew and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul but then it might have been some polygamous indian rajah a great strain on a good mans tact or some jew with an inherited expression of contempt anyhow we were english and neither dissenters nor socialists and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make gentlemen of both of us he might have preferred americans for some reasons they are not so obviously taken from one part of the social system and dumped down in another and they are more teachable but in this world we cannot always be choosers so he was very bright and pleasant with us showed us the church gossiped informingly about our neighbours on the countrysidetux the banker lord boom the magazine and newspaper proprietor lord carnaby that great sportsman and old lady osprey and finally he took us by way of a village lanethree children bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my unclethrough a meticulous garden to a big slovenly vicarage with faded victorian furniture and a faded victorian wife who gave us tea and introduced us to a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket chairs upon the edge of a wellused tennis lawn  these people interested me they were a common type no doubt but they were new to me there were two lank sons who had been playing singles at tennis redeared youths growing black moustaches and dressed in conscientiously untidy tweeds and unbuttoned and ungirt norfolk jackets there were a number of illnourishedlooking daughters sensible and economical in their costume the younger still with long brownstockinged legs and the eldest presentthere were we discovered one or two hidden awaydisplaying a large gold cross and other aggressive ecclesiastical symbols there were two or three foxterriers a retrieverish mongrel and an old bloodyeyed and very evilsmelling st bernard there was a jackdaw there was moreover an ambiguous silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very deaf paying guest two or three other people had concealed themselves at our coming and left unfinished teas behind them rugs and cushions lay among the chairs and two of the latter were i noted covered with union jacks  the vicar introduced us sketchily and the faded victorian wife regarded my aunt with a mixture of conventional scorn and abject respect and talked to her in a languid persistent voice about people in the neighbourhood whom my aunt could not possibly know  my aunt received these personalia cheerfully with her blue eyes flitting from point to point and coming back again and again to the pinched faces of the daughters and the cross upon the eldests breast encouraged by my aunts manner the vicars wife grew patronising and kindly and made it evident that she could do much to bridge the social gulf between ourselves and the people of family about us  i had just snatches of that conversation mrs merridew brought him quite a lot of money her father i believe had been in the spanish wine tradequite a lady though and after that he fell off his horse and cracked his brain pan and took to fishing and farming im sure youll like to know them hes most amusing the daughter had a disappointment and went to china as a missionary and got mixed up in a massacre  the most beautiful silks and things she brought back youd hardly believe  yes they gave them to propitiate her you see they didnt understand the difference and they thought that as theyd been massacring people theyd be massacred they didnt understand the difference christianity makes  seven bishops theyve had in the family  married a papist and was quite lost to them  he failed some dreadful examination and had to go into the militia  so she bit his leg as hard as ever she could and he let go  had four of his ribs amputated  caught meningitis and was carried off in a week  had to have a large piece of silver tube let into his throat and if he wants to talk he puts his finger on it it makes him so interesting i think you feel hes sincere somehow a most charming man in every way  preserved them both in spirits very luckily and there they are in his study though of course he doesnt show them to everybody  the silent lady unperturbed by these apparently exciting topics scrutinised my aunts costume with a singular intensity and was visibly moved when she unbuttoned her dust cloak and flung it wide meanwhile we men conversed one of the more spirited daughters listened brightly and the youths lay on the grass at our feet my uncle offered them cigars but they both declinedout of bashfulness it seemed to me whereas the vicar i think accepted out of tact when we were not looking at them directly these young men would kick each other furtively  under the influence of my uncles cigar the vicars mind had soared beyond the limits of the district this socialism he said seems making great headway  my uncle shook his head were too individualistic in this country for that sort of nonsense he said everybodys business is nobodys business thats where they go wrong  they have some intelligent people in their ranks i am told said the vicar writers and so forth quite a distinguished playwright my eldest daughter was telling mei forget his name  milly dear oh shes not here painters too they have this socialist it seems to me is part of the unrest of the age but as you say the spirit of the people is against it in the country at any rate the people down here are too sturdily independent in their small wayand too sensible altogether  its a great thing for duffield to have lady grove occupied again he was saying when my wandering attention came back from some attractive casualty in his wifes discourse people have always looked up to the house and considering all things old mr durgan really was extraordinarily goodextraordinarily good you intend to give us a good deal of your time here i hope  i mean to do my duty by the parish said my uncle  im sincerely glad to hear itsincerely weve missedthe house influence an english village isnt completepeople get out of hand life grows dull the young people drift away to london  he enjoyed his cigar gingerly for a moment  we shall look to you to liven things up he said poor man  my uncle cocked his cigar and removed it from his mouth  what you think the place wants he asked  he did not wait for an answer i been thinking while you been talkingthings one might do cricketa good english gamesports build the chaps a pavilion perhaps then every village ought to have a miniature rifle range  yeees said the vicar provided of course there isnt a constant popping  manage that all right said my uncle thingd be a sort of long shed paint it red british colour then theres a union jack for the church and the village school paint the school red too praps not enough colour about now too grey then a maypole  how far our people would take up that sort of thing began the vicar  im all for getting that good old english spirit back again said my uncle merrymakings lads and lasses dancing on the village green harvest home fairings yule logall the rest of it  how would old sally glue do for a may queen asked one of the sons in the slight pause that followed  or annie glassbound said the other with the huge virile guffaw of a young man whose voice has only recently broken  sally glue is eightyfive explained the vicar and annie glassbound is wella young lady of extremely generous proportions and not quite right you know not quite righthere he tapped his brow  generous proportions said the eldest son and the guffaws were renewed  you see said the vicar all the brisker girls go into service in or near london the life of excitement attracts them and no doubt the higher wages have something to do with it and the liberty to wear finery and generallyfreedom from restraint so that there might be a little difficulty perhaps to find a may queen here just at present who was really young and erpretty of course i couldnt think of any of my girlsor anything of that sort  we got to attract em back said my uncle thats what i feel about it we got to buckup the country the english country is a going concern still just as the established churchif youll excuse me saying it is a going concern just as oxford isor cambridge or any of those old fine old things only it wants fresh capital fresh idees and fresh methods light railways frinstancescientific use of drainage wire fencing machineryall that  the vicars face for one moment betrayed dismay perhaps he was thinking of his country walks amids the hawthorns and honeysuckle  theres great things said my uncle to be done on modun lines with village jam and picklesboiled in the country  it was the reverberation of this last sentence in my mind i think that sharpened my sentimental sympathy as we went through the straggling village street and across the trim green on our way back to london it seemed that afternoon the most tranquil and idyllic collection of creepersheltered homes you can imagine thatch still lingered on a whitewashed cottage or two pyracanthus wallflowers and daffodils abounded and an unsystematic orchard or so was white with blossom above and gay with bulbs below i noted a row of straw beehives beehiveshaped beehives of the type long since condemned as inefficient by all progressive minds and in the doctors acre of grass a flock of two whole sheep was grazingno doubt hed taken them on account two men and one old woman made gestures of abject vassalage and my uncle replied with a lordly gesture of his great motoring glove  englands full of bits like this said my uncle leaning over the front seat and looking back with great satisfaction the black glare of his goggles rested for a time on the receding turrets of lady grove just peeping over the trees  i shall have a flagstaff i think he considered then one could show when one is in residence the villagers will like to know  i reflected they will i said theyre used to liking to know  my aunt had been unusually silent suddenly she spoke he says snap she remarked he buys that place and a nice old job of housekeeping he gives me he sails through the village swelling like an old turkey and wholl have to scoot the butler me whos got to forget all she ever knew and start again me whos got to trek from chiselhurst and be a great lady me  you old bother just when i was settling down and beginning to feel at home  my uncle turned his goggles to her ah this time it is home susan we got there  vii  it seems to me now but a step from the buying of lady grove to the beginning of crest hill from the days when the former was a stupendous achievement to the days when it was too small and dark and inconvenient altogether for a great financiers use for me that was a period of increasing detachment from our business and the great world of london i saw it more and more in broken glimpses and sometimes i was working in my little pavilion above lady grove for a fortnight together even when i came up it was often solely for a meeting of the aeronautical society or for one of the learned societies or to consult literature or employ searchers or some such special business for my uncle it was a period of stupendous inflation each time i met him i found him more confident more comprehensive more consciously a factor in great affairs soon he was no longer an associate of merely business men he was big enough for the attentions of greater powers  i grew used to discovering some item of personal news about him in my evening paper or to the sight of a fullpage portrait of him in a sixpenny magazine usually the news was of some munificent act some romantic piece of buying or giving or some fresh rumour of reconstruction he saved you will remember the parbury reynolds for the country or at times it would be an interview or my uncles contribution to some symposium on the secret of success or suchlike topic or wonderful tales of his power of work of his wonderful organisation to get things done of his instant decisions and remarkable power of judging his fellowmen they repeated his great mot eight hour working dayi want eighty hours  he became modestly but resolutely public they cartooned him in vanity fair one year my aunt looking indeed a very gracious slender lady faced the portrait of the king in the great room at burlington house and the next year saw a medallion of my uncle by ewart looking out upon the world proud and imperial but on the whole a trifle too prominently convex from the walls of the new gallery  i shared only intermittently in his social experiences people knew of me it is true and many of them sought to make through me a sort of flank attack upon him and there was a legend owing very unreasonably partly to my growing scientific reputation and partly to an element of reserve in my manner that i played a much larger share in planning his operations than was actually the case this led to one or two very intimate private dinners to my inclusion in one or two house parties and various odd offers of introductions and services that i didnt for the most part accept among other people who sought me in this way was archie garvell now a smart impecunious soldier of no particular distinction who would i think have been quite prepared to develop any sporting instincts i possessed and who was beautifully unaware of our former contact he was always offering me winners no doubt in a spirit of anticipatory exchange for some really good thing in our more scientific and certain method of getting something for nothing  in spite of my preoccupation with my experiments work i did i find now that i come to ransack my impressions see a great deal of the great world during those eventful years i had a near view of the machinery by which an astounding empire is run rubbed shoulders and exchanged experiences with bishops and statesmen political women and women who were not political physicians and soldiers artists and authors the directors of great journals philanthropists and all sorts of eminent significant people i saw the statesmen without their orders and the bishops with but a little purple silk left over from their canonicals inhaling not incensen but cigar smoke i could look at them all the better because for the most part they were not looking at me but at my uncle and calculating consciously or unconsciously how they might use him and assimilate him to their system the most unpremeditated subtle successful and aimless plutocracy that ever encumbered the destinies of mankind not one of them so far as i could see until disaster overtook him resented his lies his almost naked dishonesty of method the disorderly disturbance of this trade and that caused by his spasmodic operations i can see them now about him see them polite watchful various his stiff compact little figure always a centre of attention his wiry hair his brief nose his underlip electric with selfconfidence wandering marginally through distinguished gatherings i would catch the whispers thats mr ponderevo  the little man  yes the little bounder with the glasses  they say hes made  or i would see him on some parterre of a platform beside my aunts hurraying hat amidst titles and costumes holding his end up as he would say subscribing heavily to obvious charities even at times making brief convulsive speeches in some good cause before the most exalted audiences mr chairman your royal highness my lords ladies and gentlemenhe would begin amidst subsiding applause and adjust those obstinate glasses and thrust back the wings of his frockcoat and rest his hands upon his hips and speak his fragment with ever and again an incidental zzzz his hands would fret about him as he spoke fiddle his glasses feel in his waistcoat pockets ever and again he would rise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound jerkily like a clockwork snake and drop back on his heels at the end they were the very gestures of our first encounter when he had stood before the empty fireplace in his minute draped parlour and talked of my future to my mother  in those measurelessly long hot afternoons in the little shop at wimblehurst he had talked and dreamt of the romance of modern commerce here surely was his romance come true  viii  people say that my uncle lost his head at the crest of his fortunes but if one may tell so much truth of a man one has in a manner loved he never had very much head to lose he was always imaginative erratic inconsistent recklessly inexact and his inundation of wealth merely gave him scope for these qualities it is true indeed that towards the climax he became intensely irritable at times and impatient of contradiction but that i think was rather the gnawing uneasiness of sanity than any mental disturbance but i find it hard either to judge him or convey the full development of him to the reader i saw too much of him my memory is choked with disarranged moods and aspects now he is distended with megalomania now he is deflated now he is quarrelsome now impenetrably selfsatisfied but always he is sudden jerky fragmentary energetic andin some subtle fundamental way that i find difficult to defineabsurd  there stands outbecause of the tranquil beauty of its setting perhapsa talk we had in the veranda of the little pavilion near my worksheds behind crest hill in which my aeroplanes and navigable balloons were housed it was one of many similar conversations and i do not know why it in particular should survive its fellows it happens so he had come up to me after his coffee to consult me about a certain chalice which in a moment of splendour and under the importunity of a countess he had determined to give to a deserving church in the eastend i in a moment of even rasher generosity had suggested ewart as a possible artist ewart had produced at once an admirable sketch for the sacred vessel surrounded by a sort of wreath of millies with open arms and wings and had drawn fifty pounds on the strength of it after that came a series of vexatious delays the chalice became less and less of a commercial mans chalice acquired more and more the elusive quality of the holy grail and at last even the drawing receded  my uncle grew restive you see george theyll begin to want the blasted thing  what blasted thing  that chalice damn it theyre beginning to ask questions it isnt business george  its art i protested and religion  thats all very well but its not a good ad for us george to make a promise and not deliver the goods ill have to write off your friend ewart as a bad debt thats what it comes to and go to a decent firm  we sat outside on deck chairs in the veranda of the pavilion smoked drank whisky and the chalice disposed of meditated his temporary annoyance passed it was an altogether splendid summer night following a blazing indolent day full moonlight brought out dimly the lines of the receding hills one wave beyond another far beyond were the pinpoint lights of leatherhead and in the foreground the little stage from which i used to start upon my gliders gleamed like wet steel the season must have been high june for down in the woods that hid the lights of the lady grove windows i remember the nightingales thrilled and gurgled  we got here george said my uncle ending a long pause didnt i say  saywhen i asked  in that hole in the tonem court road eh its been a straight square fight and here we are  i nodded  member me telling youtonobungay well id just that afternoon thought of it  ive fancied at times i admitted  its a great world george nowadays with a fair chance for every one who lays hold of things the career ouvert to the talonseh tonobungay think of it its a great world and a growing world and im glad were in itand getting a pull were getting big people george things come to us eh this palestine thing  he meditated for a time and zzzzed softly then he became still  his theme was taken up by a cricket in the grass until he himself was ready to resume it the cricket too seemed to fancy that in some scheme of its own it had got there chirrrrrrup it said chirrrrrrup  lord what a place that was at wimblehurst he broke out if ever i get a day off well motor there george and run over that dog that sleeps in the high street always was a dog asleep therealways always id like to see the old shop again i daresay old ruck still stands between the sheep at his door grinning with all his teeth and marbel silly beggar comes out with his white apron on and a pencil stuck behind his ear trying to look awake wonder if they know its me id like em somehow to know its me  theyll have had the international tea company and all sorts of people cutting them up i said and that dogs been on the pavement this six yearscant sleep even there poor dear because of the motorhorns and its shattered nerves  movin everywhere said my uncle i expect youre right its a big time were in george its a big progressive oncoming imperial time this palestine businessthe daring of it its its a process george and we got our hands on it here we sitwith our hands on it george entrusted  it seems quiet tonight but if we could see and hear he waved his cigar towards leatherhead and london  there they are millions george jes think of what theyve been up to todaythose ten millionseach one doing his own particular job you cant grasp it its like old whitman sayswhat is it he says well anyway its like old whitman fine chap whitman fine old chap queer you cant quote him  and these millions arent anything theres the millions over seas hundreds of millions chinese mrocco africa generally merica well here we are with power with leisure picked outbecause weve been energetic because weve seized opportunities because weve made things hum when other people have waited for them to hum see here we arewith our hands on it big people big growing people in a sort of wayforces  he paused its wonderful george he said  anglosaxon energy i said softly to the night  thats it georgeenergy its put things in our gripthreads wires stretching out and out george from that little office of ours out to west africa out to egypt out to inja out east west north and south running the world practically running it faster and faster creative theres that palestine canal affair marvellous idee suppose we take that up suppose we let ourselves in for it us and the others and run that water sluice from the mediterranean into the dead sea valleythink of the difference it will make all the desert blooming like a rose jericho lost for ever all the holy places under water very likely destroy christianity  he mused for a space cuttin canals murmured my uncle making tunnels new countries new centres zzzz finance not only palestine  i wonder where we shall get before we done george we got a lot of big things going we got the investing public sound and sure i dont see why in the end we shouldnt be very big theres difficulties but im equal to them were still a bit soft in our bones but theyll harden all right i suppose after all im worth something like a million george cleared up and settled if i got out of things now its a great time george a wonderful time  i glanced through the twilight at his convexity and i must confess it struck me that on the whole he wasnt particularly good value  we got our hands on things george us big people we got to hang together george run the show join up with the old order like that millwheel of kiplings finest thing he ever wrote george i jes been reading it again made me buy lady grove well we got to run the country george its ours make it a scientific organised business enterprise put idees into it lectrify it run the press run all sorts of developments all sorts of developments i been talking to lord boom i been talking to all sorts of people great things progress the world on business lines only jes beginning  he fell into a deep meditation  he zzzzed for a time and ceased  yes he said at last in the tone of a man who has at last emerged with ultimate solutions to the profoundest problems  what i said after a seemly pause  my uncle hung fire for a moment and it seemed to me the fate of nations trembled in the balance then he spoke as one who speaks from the very bottom of his heartand i think it was the very bottom of his heart  id jes like to drop into the eastry arms jes when all those beggars in the parlour are sittin down to whist ruck and marbel and all and give em ten minutes of my mind george straight from the shoulder jes exactly what i think of them its a little thing but id like to do it jes once before i die  he rested on that for some time zzzzing  then he broke out at a new place in a tone of detached criticism  theres boom he reflected  its a wonderful system this old british system george its staid and stable and yet it has a place for new men we come up and take our places its almost expected we take a hand thats where our democracy differs from america over there a man succeeds all he gets is money here theres a system open to every onepractically chaps like boomcome from nowhere  his voice ceased i reflected upon the spirit of his words suddenly i kicked my feet in the air rolled on my side and sat up suddenly on my deck chair with my legs down  you dont mean it i said  mean what george  subscription to the party funds reciprocal advantage have we got to that  whad you driving at george  you know theyd never do it man  do what he said feebly and why shouldnt they  theyd not even go to a baronetcy no and yet of course theres boom and collingshead and gorver theyve done beer theyve done snippets after all tonobungayits not like a turf commission agent or anything like that there have of course been some very gentlemanly commission agents it isnt like a fool of a scientific man who cant make money  my uncle grunted wed differed on that issue before  a malignant humour took possession of me what would they call you i speculated the vicar would like duffield too much like duffer difficult thing a title i ran my mind over various possibilities why not take a leaf from a socialist tract i came upon yesterday chap says were all getting delocalised beautiful worddelocalised why not be the first delocalised peer that gives youtonobungay there is a bungay you know lord tono of bungayin bottles everywhere eh  my uncle astonished me by losing his temper  damn it george you dont seem to see im serious youre always sneering at tonobungay as though it was some sort of swindle it was perfecly legitimate trade perfecly legitimate good value and a good article when i come up here and tell you plans and exchange ideesyou sneer at me you do you dont seeits a big thing its a big thing you got to get used to new circumstances you got to face what lies before us you got to drop that tone  ix  my uncle was not altogether swallowed up in business and ambition he kept in touch with modern thought for example he was i know greatly swayed by what he called this overman idee nietzscheall that stuff  he mingled those comforting suggestions of a potent and exceptional human being emancipated from the pettier limitations of integrity with the napoleonic legend it gave his imagination a considerable outlet that napoleonic legend the real mischief of napoleons immensely disastrous and accidental career began only when he was dead and the romantic type of mind was free to elaborate his character i do believe that my uncle would have made a far less egregious smash if there had been no napoleonic legend to misguide him he was in many ways better and infinitely kinder than his career but when in doubt between decent conduct and a base advantage that cult came in more and more influentially think of napoleon think what the inflexiblywilful napoleon would have done with such scruples as yours that was the rule and the end was invariably a new step in dishonour  my uncle was in an unsystematic way a collector of napoleonic relics the bigger the book about his hero the more readily he bought it he purchased letters and tinsel and weapons that bore however remotely upon the man of destiny and he even secured in geneva though he never brought home an old coach in which buonaparte might have ridden he crowded the quiet walls of lady grove with engravings and figures of him preferring my aunt remarked the more convex portraits with the white vest and those statuettes with the hands behind the back which threw forward the figure the durgans watched him through it all sardonically  and he would stand after breakfast at times in the light of the window at lady grove a little apart with two fingers of one hand stuck between his waistcoatbuttons and his chin sunken thinkingthe most preposterous little fat man in the world it made my aunt feel she said like an old field marshalknocks me into a cocked hat george  perhaps this napoleonic bias made him a little less frequent with his cigars than he would otherwise have been but of that i cannot be sure and it certainly caused my aunt a considerable amount of vexation after he had read napoleon and the fair sex because for a time that roused him to a sense of a side of life he had in his commercial preoccupations very largely forgotten suggestion plays so great a part in this field my uncle took the next opportunity and had an affair  it was not a very impassioned affair and the exact particulars never of course reached me it is quite by chance i know anything of it at all one evening i was surprised to come upon my uncle in a mixture of bohemia and smart people at an at home in the flat of robbert the ra who painted my aunt and he was standing a little apart in a recess talking or rather being talked to in undertones by a plump blond little woman in pale blue a helen scrymgeour who wrote novels and was organising a weekly magazine i elbowed a large lady who was saying something about them but i didnt need to hear the thing she said to perceive the relationship of the two it hit me like a placard on a hoarding i was amazed the whole gathering did not see it perhaps they did she was wearing a remarkably fine diamond necklace much too fine for journalism and regarding him with that quality of questionable proprietorship of leashed but straining intimacy that seems inseparable from this sort of affair it is so much more palpable than matrimony if anything was wanted to complete my conviction it was my uncless eyes when presently he became aware of mine a certain embarrassment and a certain pride and defiance and the next day he made an opportunity to praise the ladys intelligence to me concisely lest i should miss the point of it all  after that i heard some gossipfrom a friend of the ladys i was much too curious to do anything but listen i had never in all my life imagined my uncle in an amorous attitude it would appear that she called him her god in the carafter the hero in a novel of anthony hopes it was essential to the convention of their relations that he should go relentlessly whenever business called and it was generally arranged that it did call to him women were an incident it was understood between them ambition was the masterpassion a great world called him and the noble hunger for power i have never been able to discover just how honest mrs scrymgeour was in all this but it is quite possible the immense glamour of his financial largeness prevailed with her and that she did bring a really romantic feeling to their encounters there must have been some extraordinary moments  i was a good deal exercised and distressed about my aunt when i realised what was afoot i thought it would prove a terrible humiliation to her i suspected her of keeping up a brave front with the loss of my uncles affections fretting at her heart but there i simply underestimated her she didnt hear for some time and when she did hear she was extremely angry and energetic the sentimental situation didnt trouble her for a moment she decided that my uncle wanted smacking she accentuated herself with an unexpected new hat went and gave him an inconceivable talkingto at the hardingham and then came round to blowup me for not telling her what was going on before  i tried to bring her to a proper sense of the accepted values in this affair but my aunts originality of outlook was never so invincible men dont tell on one another in affairs of passion i protested and suchlike worldly excuses  women she said in high indignation and men it isnt women and menits him and me george why dont you talk sense  old passions all very well george in its way and im the last person to be jealous but this is old nonsense im not going to let him show off what a silly old lobster he is to other women ill mark every scrap of his underclothes with red letters ponderevoprivateevery scrap  going about making love indeedin abdominal beltsat his time of life  i cannot imagine what passed between her and my uncle but i have no doubt that for once her customary badinage was laid aside how they talked then i do not know for i who knew them so well had never heard that much of intimacy between them at any rate it was a concerned and preoccupied god in the car i had to deal with in the next few days unusually zzzzy and given to slight impatient gestures that had nothing to do with the current conversation and it was evident that in all directions he was finding things unusually difficult to explain  all the intimate moments in this affair were hidden from me but in the end my aunt triumphed he did not so much throw as jerk over mrs scrymgeour and she did not so much make a novel of it as upset a huge pailful of attenuated and adulterated female soul upon this occasion my aunt did not appear in that even remotely so that it is doubtful if the lady knew the real causes of her abandonment the napoleonic hero was practically unmarried and he threw over his lady as napoleon threw over josephine for a great alliance  it was a triumph for my aunt but it had its price for some time it was evident things were strained between them he gave up the lady but he resented having to do so deeply she had meant more to his imagination than one could have supposed he wouldnt for a long time come round he became touchy and impatient and secretive towards my aunt and she i noted after an amazing check or so stopped that stream of kindly abuse that had flowed for so long and had been so great a refreshment in their lives they were both the poorer for its cessation both less happy she devoted herself more and more to lady grove and the humours and complications of its management the servants took to heras they sayshe godmothered three susans during her rule the coachmans the gardeners and the up hill gamekeepers she got together a library of old household books that were in the vein of the place she revived the stillroom and became a great artist in jellies and elder and cowslip wine  x  and while i neglected the development of my uncles financesand my own in my scientific work and my absorbing conflict with the difficulties of flyinghis schemes grew more and more expansive and hazardous and his spending wilder and laxer i believe that a haunting sense of the intensifying unsoundness of his position accounts largely for his increasing irritability and his increasing secretiveness with my aunt and myself during these crowning years he dreaded i think having to explain he feared our jests might pierce unwittingly to the truth even in the privacy of his mind he would not face the truth he was accumulating unrealisable securities in his safes until they hung a potential avalanche over the economic world but his buying became a fever and his restless desire to keep it up with himself that he was making a triumphant progress to limitless wealth gnawed deeper and deeper a curious feature of this time with him was his buying over and over again of similar things his ideas seemed to run in series within a twelvemonth he bought five new motorcars each more swift and powerful than its predecessor and only the repeated prompt resignation of his chief chauffeur at each moment of danger prevented his driving them himself he used them more and more he developed a passion for locomotion for its own sake  then he began to chafe at lady grove fretted by a chance jest he had overheard at a dinner this house george he said its a misfit theres no elbowroom in it its choked with old memories and i cant stand all these damned durgans  that chap in the corner george no the other corner the man in a cherrycoloured coat he watched you hed look silly if i stuck a poker through his gizzard  hed look i reflected much as he does now as though he was amused  he replaced his glasses which had fallen at his emotion and glared at his antagonists what are they what are they all the lot of em dead as mutton they just stuck in the mud they didnt even rise to the reformation the old outofdate reformation move with the timesthey moved against the times  just a family of failurethey never even tried  theyre jes george exactly what im not exactly it isnt suitable all this living in the past  and i want a bigger place too george i want air and sunlight and room to move about and more service a house where you can get a move on things zzzz why its like a discordit jarseven to have the telephone theres nothing nothing except the terrace thats worth a rap its all dark and old and dried up and full of oldfashioned thingsmusty old ideesfitter for a silverfish than a modern man i dont know how i got here  he broke out into a new grievance that damned vicar he complained thinks i ought to think myself lucky to get this place every time i meet him i can see him think it one of these days george ill show him what a modun house is like  and he did  i remember the day when he declared as americans say for crest hill he had come up to see my new gas plant for i was then only just beginning to experiment with auxiliary collapsible balloons and all the time the shine of his glasses was wandering away to the open down beyond lets go back to lady grove over the hill he said something i want to show you something fine  it was an empty sunlit place that summer evening sky and earth warm with sundown and a pewit or so just accentuating the pleasant stillness that ends a long clear day a beautiful peace it was to wreck for ever and there was my uncle the modern man of power in his grey tophat and his grey suit and his blackribboned glasses short thinlegged largestomached pointing and gesticulating threatening this calm  he began with a wave of his arm thats the place george he said see  eh i criedfor i had been thinking of remote things  i got it  got what  for a housea twentieth century house thats the place for it  one of his characteristic phrases was begotten in him  foursquare to the winds of heaven george he said eh foursquare to the winds of heaven  youll get the winds up here i said  a mammoth house it ought to be georgeto suit these hills  quite i said  great galleries and thingsrunning out there and theresee i been thinking of it george looking out all this wayacross the weald with its back to lady grove  and the morning sun in its eye  like an eagle georgelike an eagle  so he broached to me what speedily became the leading occupation of his culminating years crest hill but all the world has heard of that extravagant place which grew and changed its plans as it grew and bubbled like a salted snail and burgeoned and bulged and evermore grew i know not what delirium of pinnacles and terraces and arcades and corridors glittered at last upon the uplands of his mind the place for all that its expansion was terminated abruptly by our collapse is wonderful enough as it standsthat empty instinctive building of a childless man his chief architect was a young man named westminster whose work he had picked out in the architecture room of the royal academy on account of a certain grandiose courage in it but with him he associated from time to time a number of fellow professionals stonemasons sanitary engineers painters sculptors scribes metal workers wood carvers furniture designers ceramic specialists landscape gardeners and the man who designs the arrangement and ventilation of the various new houses in the london zoological gardens in addition he had his own ideas the thing occupied his mind at all times but it held it completely from friday night to monday morning he would come down to lady grove on friday night in a crowded motorcar that almost dripped architects he didnt however confine himself to architects every one was liable to an invitation to weekend and view crest hill and many an eager promoter unaware of how napoleonically and completely my uncle had departmentalised his mind tried to creep up to him by way of tiles and ventilators and new electric fittings always on sunday mornings unless the weather was vile he would so soon as breakfast and his secretaries were disposed of visit the site with a considerable retinue and alter and develop plans making modifications zzzzing giving immense new orders verballyan unsatisfactory way as westminster and the contractors ultimately found  there he stands in my memory the symbol of this age for me the man of luck and advertisement the current master of the world there he stands upon the great outward sweep of the terrace before the huge main entrance a little figure ridiculously disproportionate to that fortyfoot arch with the granite ball behind himthe astronomical ball brass coopered that represented the world with a little adjustable tube of lenses on a gunmetal arm that focussed the sun upon just that point of the earth on which it chanced to be shining vertically there he stands napoleonically grouped with his retinue men in tweeds and golfingsuits a little solicitor whose name i forget in grey trousers and a black jacket and westminster in jaeger underclothing a floriferous tie and peculiar brown cloth of his own  the downland breeze flutters my uncles coattails disarranges his stiff hair and insists on the evidence of undisciplined appetites in face and form as he points out this or that feature in the prospect to his attentive collaborator  below are hundreds of feet of wheelingplanks ditches excavations heaps of earth piles of garden stone from the wealden ridges on either hand the walls of his irrelevant unmeaning palace rise at one time he had working in that placedisturbing the economic balance of the whole countryside by their presenceupwards of three thousand men  so he poses for my picture amidst the raw beginnings that were never to be completed he did the strangest things about that place things more and more detached from any conception of financial scale things more and more apart from sober humanity he seemed to think himself at last released from any such limitations he moved a quite considerable hill and nearly sixty mature trees were moved with it to open his prospect eastward moved it about two hundred feet to the south at another time he caught a suggestion from some city restaurant and made a billiardroom roofed with plate glass beneath the waters of his ornamental lake he furnished one wing while its roof still awaited completion he had a swimming bath thirty feet square next to his bedroom upstairs and to crown it all he commenced a great wall to hold all his dominions together free from the invasion of common men it was a tenfoot wall glass surmounted and had it been completed as he intended it it would have had a total length of nearly eleven miles some of it towards the last was so dishonestly built that it collapsed within a year upon its foundations but some miles of it still stand i never think of it now but what i think of the hundreds of eager little investors who followed his star whose hopes and lives whose wives security and childrens prospects are all mixed up beyond redemption with that flaking mortar  it is curious how many of these modern financiers of chance and bluff have ended their careers by building it was not merely my uncle sooner or later they all seem to bring their luck to the test of realisation try to make their fluid opulence coagulate out as bricks and mortar bring moonshine into relations with a weekly wagessheet then the whole fabric of confidence and imagination tottersand down they come  when i think of that despoiled hillside that colossal litter of bricks and mortar and crude roads and paths the scaffolding and sheds the general quality of unforeseeing outrage upon the peace of nature i am reminded of a chat i had with the vicar one bleak day after he had witnessed a glide he talked to me of aeronautics as i stood in jersey and shorts beside my machine fresh from alighting and his cadaverous face failed to conceal a peculiar desolation that possessed him  almost you convince me he said coming up to me against my will a marvellous invention but it will take you a long time sir before you can emulate that perfect mechanismthe wing of a bird  he looked at my sheds  youve changed the look of this valley too he said  temporary defilements i remarked guessing what was in his mind  of course things come and go things come and go buthm ive just been up over the hill to look at mr edward ponderevos new house thatthat is something more permanent a magnificent placein many ways imposing ive never somehow brought myself to go that way before things are greatly advanced we findthe great number of strangers introduced into the villages about here by these operations workingmen chiefly a little embarrassing it put us out they bring a new spirit into the place bettingideasall sorts of queer notions our publicans like it of course and they come and sleep in ones outhousesand make the place a little unsafe at nights the other morning i couldnt sleepa slight dyspepsiaand i looked out of the window i was amazed to see people going by on bicycles a silent procession i counted ninetysevenin the dawn all going up to the new road for crest hill remarkable i thought it and so ive been up to see what they were doing  they would have been more than remarkable thirty years ago i said  yes indeed things change we think nothing of it now at allcomparatively and that big house  he raised his eyebrows really stupendous stupendous  all the hillsidethe old turfcut to ribbons  his eye searched my face weve grown so accustomed to look up to lady grove he said and smiled in search of sympathy it shifts our centre of gravity  things will readjust themselves i lied  he snatched at the phrase of course he said  theyll readjust themselvessettle down again must in the old way its bound to come right againa comforting thought yes after all lady grove itself had to be built once upon a timewasto begin withartificial  his eye returned to my aeroplane he sought to dismiss his graver preoccupations i should think twice he remarked before i trusted myself to that concern but i suppose one grows accustomed to the motion  he bade me good morning and went his way bowed and thoughtful  he had kept the truth from his mind a long time but that morning it had forced its way to him with an aspect that brooked no denial that this time it was not just changes that were coming in his world but that all his world lay open and defenceless conquered and surrendered doomed so far as he could see root and branch scale and form alike to change   chapter the third  soaring  i  for nearly all the time that my uncle was incubating and hatching crest hill i was busy in a little transverse valley between that great beginning and lady grove with more and more costly and ambitious experiments in aerial navigation this work was indeed the main substance of my life through all the great time of the tonobungay symphony  i have told already how i came to devote myself to this system of inquiries how in a sort of disgust with the common adventure of life i took up the dropped ends of my college studies taking them up again with a mans resolution instead of a boys ambition from the first i did well at this work itwas i think largely a case of special aptitude of a peculiar irrelevant vein of faculty running through my mind it is one of those things men seem to have by chance that has little or nothing to do with their general merit and which it is ridiculous to be either conceited or modest about i did get through a very big mass of work in those years working for a time with a concentrated fierceness that left little of such energy or capacity as i possess unused i worked out a series of problems connected with the stability of bodies pitching in the air and the internal movements of the wind and i also revolutionised one leading part at last of the theory of explosive engines these things are to be found in the philosophical transactions the mathematical journal and less frequently in one or two other such publications and they neednt detain us here indeed i doubt if i could write about them here one acquires a sort of shorthand for ones notes and mind in relation to such special work i have never taught nor lectured that is to say i have never had to express my thoughts about mechanical things in ordinary everyday language and i doubt very much if i could do so now without extreme tedium  my work was to begin with very largely theoretical i was able to attack such early necessities of verification as arose with quite little models using a turntable to get the motion through the air and cane whalebone and silk as building material but a time came when incalculable factors crept in factors of human capacity and factors of insufficient experimental knowledge when one must needs guess and try then i had to enlarge the scale of my operations and soon i had enlarged them very greatly i set to work almost concurrently on the balance and stability of gliders and upon the steering of inflated bags the latter a particularly expensive branch of work i was no doubt moved by something of the same spirit of lavish expenditure that was running away with my uncle in these developments presently my establishment above lady grove had grown to a painted wood chalet big enough to accommodate six men and in which i would sometimes live for three weeks together to a gasometer to a motorhouse to three big corrugatedroofed sheds and lockup houses to a stage from which to start gliders to a workshop and so forth a rough road was made we brought up gas from cheaping and electricity from woking which place i found also afforded a friendly workshop for larger operations than i could manage i had the luck also to find a man who seemed my heavensent secondincommandcothope his name was he was a selfeducatedman he had formerly been a sapper and he was one of the best and handiest working engineers alive without him i do not think i could have achieved half what i have done at times he has been not so much my assistant as my collaborator and has followed my fortunes to this day other men came and went as i needed them  i do not know how far it is possible to convey to any one who has not experienced it the peculiar interest the peculiar satisfaction that lies in a sustained research when one is not hampered by want of money it is a different thing from any other sort of human effort you are free from the exasperating conflict with your fellowcreatures altogetherat least so far as the essential work goes that for me is its peculiar merit scientific truth is the remotest of mistresses she hides in strange places she is attained by tortuous and laborious roads but she is always there win to her and she will not fail you she is yours and mankinds for ever she is reality the one reality i have found in this strange disorder of existence she will not sulk with you nor misunderstand you nor cheat you of your reward upon some petty doubt you cannot change her by advertisement or clamour nor stifle her in vulgarities things grow under your hands when you serve her things that are permanent as nothing else is permanent in the whole life of man that i think is the peculiar satisfaction of science and its enduring reward  the taking up of experimental work produced a great change in my personal habits i have told how already once in my life at wimblehurst i had a period of discipline and continuous effort and how when i came to south kensington i became demoralised by the immense effect of london by its innumerable imperative demands upon my attention and curiosity and i parted with much of my personal pride when i gave up science for the development of tonobungay but my poverty kept me abstinent and my youthful romanticism kept me chaste until my married life was well under way then in all directions i relaxed i did a large amount of work but i never troubled to think whether it was my maximum nor whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times were avoidable things with the coming of plenty i ate abundantly and foolishly drank freely and followed my impulses more and more carelessly i felt no reason why i should do anything else never at any point did i use myself to the edge of my capacity the emotional crisis of my divorce did not produce any immediate change in these matters of personal discipline i found some difficulty at first in concentrating my mind upon scientific work it was so much more exacting than business but i got over that difficulty by smoking i became an inordinate cigar smoker it gave me moods of profound depression but i treated these usually by the homeopathic methodby lighting another cigar i didnt realise at all how loose my moral and nervous fibre had become until i reached the practical side of my investigations and was face to face with the necessity of finding out just how it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one  i got into this relaxed habit of living in spite of very real tendencies in my nature towards discipline ive never been in love with selfindulgence that philosophy of the loose lip and the lax paunch is one for which ive always had an instinctive distrust i like bare things stripped things plain austere and continent things fine lines and cold colours but in these plethoric times when there is too much coarse stuff for everybody and the struggle for life takes the form of competitive advertisement and the effort to fill your neighbours eye when there is no urgent demand either for personal courage sound nerves or stark beauty we find ourselves by accident always before these times the bulk of the people did not overeat themselves because they couldnt whether they wanted to do so or not and all but a very few were kept fit by unavoidable exercise and personal danger now if only he pitch his standard low enough and keep free from pride almost any one can achieve a sort of excess you can go through contemporary life fudging and evading indulging and slacking never really hungry nor frightened nor passionately stirred your highest moment a mere sentimental orgasm and your first real contact with primary and elemental necessities the sweat of your deathbed so i think it was with my uncle so very nearly it was with me  but the glider brought me up smartly i had to find out how these things went down the air and the only way to find out is to go down with one and for a time i wouldnt face it  there is something impersonal about a book i suppose at any rate i find myself able to write down here just the confession ive never been able to make to any one face to face the frightful trouble it was to me to bring myself to do what i suppose every other coloured boy in the west indies could do without turning a hair and that is to fling myself off for my first soar down the wind the first trial was bound to be the worst it was an experiment i made with life and the chance of death or injury was i supposed about equal to the chance of success i believed that with a dawnlike lucidity i had begun with a glider that i imagined was on the lines of the wright brothers aeroplane but i could not be sure it might turn over i might upset it it might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me the conditions of the flight necessitated alert attention it wasnt a thing to be done by jumping off and shutting ones eyes or getting angry or drunk to do it one had to use ones weight to balance and when at last i did it it was horriblefor ten seconds for ten seconds or so as i swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and with the wind in my eyes the rush of the ground beneath me filled me with sick and helpless terror i felt as though some violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone and i groaned aloud i set my teeth and groaned it was a groan wrung out of me in spite of myself my sensations of terror swooped to a climax and then you know they ended  suddenly my terror was over and done with i was soaring through the air right way up steadily and no mischance had happened i felt intensely alive and my nerves were strung like a bow i shifted a limb swerved and shouted between fear and triumph as i recovered from the swerve and heeled the other way and steadied myself  i thought i was going to hit a rook that was flying athwart meit was queer with what projectile silence that jumped upon me out of nothingness and i yelled helplessly get out of the way the bird doubled itself up like a partly inverted v flapped went up to the right abruptly and vanished from my circle of interest then i saw the shadow of my aeroplane keeping a fixed distance before me and very steady and the turf as it seemed streaming out behind it the turfit wasnt after all streaming so impossibly fast  when i came gliding down to the safe spread of level green i had chosen i was as cool and ready as a city clerk who drops off an omnibus in motion and i had learnt much more than soaring i tilted up her nose at the right moment levelled again and grounded like a snowflake on a windless day i lay flat for an instant and then knelt up and got on my feet atremble but very satisfied with myself cothope was running down the hill to me   but from that day i went into training and i kept myself in training for many months i had delayed my experiments for very nearly six weeks on various excuses because of my dread of this first flight because of the slackness of body and spirit that had come to me with the business life the shame of that cowardice spurred me none the less because it was probably altogether my own secret i felt that cothope at any rate might suspect wellhe shouldnt suspect again  it is curious that i remember that shame and self accusation and its consequences far more distinctly than i recall the weeks of vacillation before i soared for a time i went altogether without alcohol i stopped smoking altogether and ate very sparingly and every day i did something that called a little upon my nerves and muscles i soared as frequently as i could i substituted a motorbicycle for the london train and took my chances in the southward traffic and i even tried what thrills were to be got upon a horse but they put me on made horses and i conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes of equestrian exercise in comparison with the adventures of mechanism also i walked along the high wall at the back of lady grove garden and at last brought myself to stride the gap where the gate comes if i didnt altogether get rid of a certain giddy instinct by such exercises at least i trained my will until it didnt matter and soon i no longer dreaded flight but was eager to go higher into the air and i came to esteem soaring upon a glider that even over the deepest dip in the ground had barely forty feet of fall beneath it a mere mockery of what flight might be i began to dream of the keener freshness in the air high above the beechwoods and it was rather to satisfy that desire than as any legitimate development of my proper work that presently i turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my private income to the problem of the navigable balloon  ii  i had gone far beyond that initial stage i had had two smashes and a broken rib which my aunt nursed with great energy and was getting some reputation in the aeronautic world when suddenly as though she had never really left it the honourable beatrice normandy darkeyed and with the old disorderly wave of the hair from her brow came back into my life she came riding down a grass path in the thickets below lady grove perched up on a huge black horse and the old earl of carnaby and archie garvell her halfbrother were with her my uncle had been bothering me about the crest hill hotwater pipes and we were returning by a path transverse to theirs and came out upon them suddenly old carnaby was trespassing on our ground and so he hailed us in a friendly fashion and pulled up to talk to us  i didnt note beatrice at all at first i was interested in lord carnaby that remarkable vestige of his own brilliant youth i had heard of him but never seen him for a man of sixtyfive who had sinned all the sins so they said and laid waste the most magnificent political debut of any man of his generation he seemed to me to be looking remarkably fit and fresh he was a lean little man with greyblue eyes in his brown face and his cracked voice was the worst thing in his effect  hope you dont mind us coming this way ponderevo he cried and my uncle who was sometimes a little too general and generous with titles answered not at all my lord not at all glad you make use of it  youre building a great place over the hill said carnaby  thought id make a show for once said my uncle it looks big because its spread out for the sun  air and sunlight said the earl you cant have too much of them but before our time they used to build for shelter and water and the high road  then i discovered that the silent figure behind the earl was beatrice  id forgotten her sufficiently to think for a moment that she hadnt changed at all since she had watched me from behind the skirts of lady drew she was looking at me and her dainty brow under her broad brimmed hatshe was wearing a grey hat and loose unbuttoned coatwas knit with perplexity trying i suppose to remember where she had seen me before her shaded eyes met mine with that mute question  it seemed incredible to me she didnt remember  well said the earl and touched his horse  garvell was patting the neck of his horse which was inclined to fidget and disregarding me he nodded over his shoulder and followed his movement seemed to release a train of memories in her she glanced suddenly at him and then back at me with a flash of recognition that warmed instantly to a faint smile she hesitated as if to speak to me smiled broadly and understandingly and turned to follow the others all three broke into a canter and she did not look back i stood for a second or so at the crossing of the lanes watching her recede and then became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking over his shoulder in the belief that i was close behind i turned about and strode to overtake him my mind was full of beatrice and this surprise i remembered her simply as a normandy id clean forgotten that garvell was the son and she the stepdaughter of our neighbour lady osprey indeed id probably forgotten at that time that we had lady osprey as a neighbour there was no reason at all for remembering it it was amazing to find her in this surrey countryside when id never thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at bladesover park near forty miles and twenty years away she was so aliveso unchanged the same quick warm blood was in her cheeks it seemed only yesterday that we had kissed among the bracken stems  eh i said  i say hes good stuff said my uncle you can say what you like against the aristocracy george lord carnabys rattling good stuff theres a sort of savoir faire somethingits an oldfashioned phrase george but a good one theres a bongtong its like the oxford turf george you cant grow it in a year i wonder how they do it its living always on a scale george its being there from the beginning  she might i said to myself be a picture by romney come alive  they tell all these stories about him said my uncle but what do they all amount to  gods i said to myself but why have i forgotten for so long those queer little brows of hers the touch of mischief in her eyesthe way she breaks into a smile  i dont blame him said my uncle mostly its imagination that and leisure george when i was a young man i was kept pretty busy so were you even then  what puzzled me more particularly was the queer trick of my memory that had never recalled anything vital of beatrice whatever when i met garvell again that had indeed recalled nothing except a boyish antagonism and our fight now when my senses were full of her it seemed incredible that i could ever have forgotten  iii  oh crikey said my aunt reading a letter behind her coffeemachine heres a young woman george  we were breakfasting together in the big window bay at lady grove that looks upon the iris beds my uncle was in london  i sounded an interrogative note and decapitated an egg  whos beatrice normandy asked my aunt ive not heard of her before  she the young woman  yes says she knows you im no hand at old etiquette george but her line is a bit unusual practically she says shes going to make her mother  eh stepmother isnt it  you seem to know a lot about her she says motherlady osprey theyre to call on me anyhow next wednesday week at four and theres got to be you for tea  eh  youfor tea  hm she had ratherforce of character when i knew her before  i became aware of my aunts head sticking out obliquely from behind the coffeemachine and regarding me with wide blue curiosity i met her gaze for a moment flinched coloured and laughed  ive known her longer than ive known you i said and explained at length  my aunt kept her eye on me over and round the coffeemachine as i did so she was greatly interested and asked several elucidatory questions  why didnt you tell me the day you saw her youve had her on your mind for a week she said  it is odd i didnt tell you i admitted  you thought id get a down on her said my aunt conclusively thats what you thought and opened the rest of her letters  the two ladies came in a ponycarriage with conspicuous punctuality and i had the unusual experience of seeing my aunt entertaining callers we had tea upon the terrace under the cedar but old lady osprey being an embittered protestant had never before seen the inside of the house and we made a sort of tour of inspection that reminded me of my first visit to the place in spite of my preoccupation with beatrice i stored a queer little memory of the contrast between the two other women my aunt tall slender and awkward in a simple blue homekeeping dress an omnivorous reader and a very authentic wit and the lady of pedigree short and plump dressed with victorian fussiness living at the intellectual level of palmistry and genteel fiction pink in the face and generally flustered by a sense of my aunts social strangeness and disposed under the circumstances to behave rather like an imitation of the more queenly moments of her own cook the one seemed made of whalebone the other of dough my aunt was nervous partly through the intrinsic difficulty of handling the lady and partly because of her passionate desire to watch beatrice and me and her nervousness took a common form with her a wider clumsiness of gesture and an exacerbation of her habitual oddity of phrase which did much to deepen the pink perplexity of the lady of title for instance i heard my aunt admit that one of the stuart durgan ladies did look a bit balmy on the crumpet she described the knights of the age of chivalry as korvorting about on the offchance of a dragon she explained she was always old mucking about the garden and instead of offering me a garibaldi biscuit she asked me with that faint lisp of hers to have some squashed flies george i felt convinced lady osprey would describe her as a most eccentric person on the very first opportunitya most eccentric person one could see her as people say shaping for that  beatrice was dressed very quietly in brown with a simple but courageous broadbrimmed hat and an unexpected quality of being grownup and responsible she guided her stepmother through the first encounter scrutinised my aunt and got us all well in movement through the house and then she turned her attention to me with a quick and halfconfident smile  we havent met she said since  it was in the warren  of course she said the warren i remembered it all except just the name i was eight  her smiling eyes insisted on my memories being thorough i looked up and met them squarely a little at a loss for what i should say  i gave you away pretty completely she said meditating upon my face and afterwards i gave way archie  she turned her face away from the others and her voice fell ever so little  they gave him a licking for telling lies she said as though that was a pleasant memory and when it was all over i went to our wigwam you remember the wigwam  out in the west wood  yesand criedfor all the evil i had done you i suppose ive often thought of it since  lady osprey stopped for us to overtake her my dear she said to beatrice such a beautiful gallery then she stared very hard at me puzzled in the most naked fashion to understand who i might be  people say the oak staircase is rather good said my aunt and led the way  lady osprey with her skirts gathered for the ascent to the gallery and her hand on the newel turned and addressed a look full of meaning overflowing indeed with meaningsat her charge the chief meaning no doubt was caution about myself but much of it was just meaning at large i chanced to catch the response in a mirror and detected beatrice with her nose wrinkled into a swift and entirely diabolical grimace lady osprey became a deeper shade of pink and speechless with indignationit was evident she disavowed all further responsibility as she followed my aunt upstairs  its dark but theres a sort of dignity said beatrice very distinctly regarding the hall with serene tranquillity and allowing the unwilling feet on the stairs to widen their distance from us she stood a step up so that she looked down a little upon me and over me at the old hall  she turned upon me abruptly when she thought her stepmother was beyond earshot  but how did you get here she asked  here  all this she indicated space and leisure by a wave of the hand at hall and tall windows and sunlit terrace werent you the housekeepers son  ive adventured my uncle has becomea great financier he used to be a little chemist about twenty miles from bladesover were promoters now amalgamators big people on the new model  i understand she regarded me with interested eyes visibly thinking me out  and you recognised me i asked  after a second or so i saw you recognised me i couldnt place you but i knew i knew you then archie being there helped me to remember  im glad to meet again i ventured id never forgotten you  one doesnt forget those childish things  we regarded one another for a moment with a curiously easy and confident satisfaction in coming together again i cant explain our ready zest in one another the thing was so we pleased each other we had no doubt in our minds that we pleased each other from the first we were at our ease with one another so picturesque so very picturesque came a voice from above and then beeatrice  ive a hundred things i want to know about you she said with an easy intimacy as we went up the winding steps  as the four of us sat at tea together under the cedar on the terrace she asked questions about my aeronautics my aunt helped with a word or so about my broken ribs lady osprey evidently regarded flying as a most indesirable and improper topica blasphemous intrusion upon the angels it isnt flying i explained we dont fly yet  you never will she said compactly you never will  well i said we do what we can  the little lady lifted a small gloved hand and indicated a height of about four feet from the ground thus far she said thus farand no farther no  she became emphatically pink no she said again quite conclusively and coughed shortly thank you she said to her ninth or tenth cake beatrice burst into cheerful laughter with her eye on me i was lying on the turf and this perhaps caused a slight confusion about the primordial curse in lady ospreys mind  upon his belly shall he go she said with quiet distinctness all the days of his life  after which we talked no more of aeronautics  beatrice sat bunched together in a chair and regarded me with exactly the same scrutiny i thought the same adventurous aggression that i had faced long ago at the teatable in my mothers room she was amazingly like that little princess of my bladesover memories the wilful misbehaviours of her hair seemed the sameher voice things one would have expected to be changed altogether she formed her plans in the same quick way and acted with the same irresponsible decision  she stood up abruptly  what is there beyond the terrace she said and found me promptly beside her  i invented a view for her  at the further corner from the cedar she perched herself up upon the parapet and achieved an air of comfort among the lichenous stones now tell me she said all about yourself tell me about yourself i know such duffers of men they all do the same things how did you gethere all my men were here they couldnt have got here if they hadnt been here always they wouldnt have thought it right youve climbed  if its climbing i said  she went off at a tangent itsi dont know if youll understandinteresting to meet you again ive remembered you i dont know why but i have ive used you as a sort of lay figurewhen ive told myself stories but youve always been rather stiff and difficult in my storiesin readymade clothesa labour member or a bradlaugh or something like that youre not like that a bit and yet you are  she looked at me was it much of a fight they make out it is  i dont know why  i was shot up here by an accident i said there was no fight at all except to keep honest perhaps and i made no great figure in that i and my uncle mixed a medicine and it blew us up no merit in that but youve been here all the time tell me what you have done first  one thing we didnt do she meditated for a moment  what said i  produce a little halfbrother for bladesover so it went to the phillbrick gang and they let it and i and my stepmotherwe let too and live in a little house  she nodded her head vaguely over her shoulder and turned to me again well suppose it was an accident here you are now youre here what are you going to do youre young is it to be parliament heard some men the other day talking about you before i knew you were you they said that was what you ought to do  she put me through my intentions with a close and vital curiosity it was just as she had tried to imagine me a soldier and place me years ago she made me feel more planless and incidental than ever you want to make a flyingmachine she pursued and when you fly what then would it be for fighting  i told her something of my experimental work she had never heard of the soaring aeroplane and was excited by the thought and keen to hear about it she had thought all the work so far had been a mere projecting of impossible machines for her pilcher and lilienthal had died in vain she did not know such men had lived in the world  but thats dangerous she said with a note of discovery  ohits dangerous  beeatrice lady osprey called  beatrice dropped from the wall to her feet  where do you do this soaring  beyond the high barrows east of crest hill and the wood  do you mind people coming to see  whenever you please only let me know  ill take my chance some day some day soon she looked at me thoughtfully smiled and our talk was at an end  iv  all my later work in aeronautics is associated in my memory with the quality of beatrice with her incidental presence with things she said and did and things i thought of that had reference to her  in the spring of that year i had got to a flying machine that lacked nothing but longitudinal stability my model flew like a bird for fifty or a hundred yards or so and then either dived and broke its nose or what was commoner reared up slid back and smashed its propeller the rhythm of the pitching puzzled me i felt it must obey some laws not yet quite clearly stated i became therefore a student of theory and literature for a time i hit upon the string of considerations that led me to what is called ponderevos principle and my frs and i worked this out in three long papers meanwhile i made a lot of turntable and glider models and started in upon an idea of combining gasbags and gliders balloon work was new to me i had made one or two ascents in the balloons of the aero club before i started my gasometer and the balloon shed and gave cothope a couple of months with sir peter rumchase my uncle found part of the money for these developments he was growing interested and competitive in this business because of lord booms prize and the amount of reclame involved and it was at his request that i named my first navigable balloon lord roberts alpha  lord roberts a very nearly terminated all my investigations my idea both in this and its more successful and famous younger brother lord roberts b was to utilise the idea of a contractile balloon with a rigid flat base a balloon shaped rather like an inverted boat that should almost support the apparatus but not quite the gasbag was of the chambered sort used for these long forms and not with an internal balloonette the trouble was to make the thing contractile this i sought to do by fixing a long finemeshed silk net over it that was fastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rods practically i contracted my sausage gasbag by netting it down the ends were too complex for me to describe here but i thought them out elaborately and they were very carefully planned lord roberts a was furnished with a single big screw forward and there was a rudder aft the engine was the first one to be so to speak right in the plane of the gasbag i lay immediately under the balloon on a sort of glider framework far away from either engine or rudder controlling them by wirepulls constructed on the principle of the wellknown bowden brake of the cyclist  but lord roberts a has been pretty exhaustively figured and described in various aeronautical publications the unforeseen defect was the badness of the work in the silk netting it tore aft as soon as i began to contract the balloon and the last two segments immediately bulged through the hole exactly as an inner tube will bulge through the ruptured outer cover of a pneumatic tire and then the sharp edge of the torn net cut the oiledsilk of the distended last segment along a weak seam and burst it with a loud report  up to that point the whole thing had been going on extremely well as a navigable balloon and before i contracted it the lord roberts a was an unqualified success it had run out of the shed admirably at nine or ten miles an hour or more and although there was a gentle southwester blowing it had gone up and turned and faced it as well as any craft of the sort i have ever seen  i lay in my customary glider position horizontal and face downward and the invisibility of all the machinery gave an extraordinary effect of independent levitation only by looking up as it were and turning my head back could i see the flat aeroplane bottom of the balloon and the rapid successive passages swish swish swish of the vans of the propeller i made a wide circle over lady grove and duffield and out towards effingham and came back quite successfully to the startingpoint  down below in the october sunlight were my sheds and the little group that had been summoned to witness the start their faces craned upward and most of them scrutinising my expression through fieldglasses i could see carnaby and beatrice on horseback and two girls i did not know with them cothope and three or four workmen i employed my aunt and mrs levinstein who was staying with her on foot and dimmock the veterinary surgeon and one or two others my shadow moved a little to the north of them like the shadow of a fish at lady grove the servants were out on the lawn and the duffield school playground swarmed with children too indifferent to aeronautics to cease their playing but in the crest hill directionthe place looked extraordinarily squat and ugly from abovethere were knots and strings of staring workmen everywherenot one of them working but all agape but now i write it it occurs to me that perhaps it was their dinner hour it was certainly near twelve i hung for a moment or so enjoying the soar then turned about to face a clear stretch of open down let the engine out to full speed and set my rollers at work rolling in the net and so tightening the gasbags instantly the pace quickened with the diminished resistance  in that moment before the bang i think i must have been really flying before the net ripped just in the instant when my balloon was at its systole the whole apparatus was i am convinced heavier than air that however is a claim that has been disputed and in any case this sort of priority is a very trivial thing  then came a sudden retardation instantly followed by an inexpressibly disconcerting tilt downward of the machine that i still recall with horror i couldnt see what was happening at all and i couldnt imagine it was a mysterious inexplicable dive the thing it seemed without rhyme or reason was kicking up its heels in the air the bang followed immediately and i perceived i was falling rapidly  i was too much taken by surprise to think of the proper cause of the report i dont even know what i made of it i was obsessed i suppose by that perpetual dread of the modern aeronaut a flash between engine and balloon yet obviously i wasnt wrapped in flames i ought to have realised instantly it wasnt that i did at any rate whatever other impressions there were release the winding of the outer net and let the balloon expand again and that no doubt did something to break my fall i dont remember doing that indeed all i do remember is the giddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it down a flat spiral the hurried rush of fields and trees and cottages on my left shoulder and the overhung feeling as if the whole apparatus was pressing down the top of my head i didnt stop or attempt to stop the screw that was going on swish swish swish all the time  cothope really knows more about the fall than i do he describes the easterly start the tilt and the appearance and bursting of a sort of bladder aft then down i swooped very swiftly but not nearly so steeply as i imagined i was doing fifteen or twenty degrees said cothope to be exact from him it was that i learnt that i let the nets loose again and so arrested my fall he thinks i was more in control of myself than i remember  but i do not see why i should have forgotten so excellent a resolution his impression is that i was really steering and trying to drop into the farthing down beeches you hit the trees he said and the whole affair stood on its nose among them and then very slowly crumpled up i saw youd been jerked out as i thought and i didnt stay for more i rushed for my bicycle  as a matter of fact it was purely accidental that i came down in the woods i am reasonably certain that i had no more control then than a thing in a parcel i remember i felt a sort of wincing now it comes as the trees rushed up to me if i remember that i should remember steering then the propeller smashed everything stopped with a jerk and i was falling into a mass of yellowing leaves and lord roberts a so it seemed to me was going back into the sky  i felt twigs and things hit me in the face but i didnt feel injured at the time i clutched at things that broke tumbled through a froth of green and yellow into a shadowy world of great barkcovered arms and there snatching wildly got a grip on a fair round branch and hung  i became intensely alert and clearheaded i held by that branch for a moment and then looked about me and caught at another and then found myself holding to a practicable fork i swung forward to that and got a leg around it below its junction and so was able presently to clamber down climbing very coolly and deliberately i dropped ten feet or so from the lowest branch and fell on my feet thats all right i said and stared up through the tree to see what i could of the deflated and crumpled remains that had once been lord roberts a festooned on the branches it had broken gods i said what a tumble  i wiped something that trickled from my face and was shocked to see my hand covered with blood i looked at myself and saw what seemed to me an astonishing quantity of blood running down my arm and shoulder i perceived my mouth was full of blood its a queer moment when one realises one is hurt and perhaps badly hurt and has still to discover just how far one is hurt i explored my face carefully and found unfamiliar contours on the left side the broken end of a branch had driven right through my cheek damaging my cheek and teeth and gums and left a splinter of itself stuck like an explorers fartherestpoint flag in the upper maxillary that and a sprained wrist were all my damage but i bled as though i had been chopped to pieces and it seemed to me that my face had been driven in i cant describe just the horrible disgust i felt at that  this blood must be stopped anyhow i said thickheadedly  i wonder where theres a spiders weban odd twist for my mind to take but it was the only treatment that occurred to me  i must have conceived some idea of going home unaided because i was thirty yards from the tree before i dropped  then a kind of black disc appeared in the middle of the world and rushed out to the edge of things and blotted them out i dont remember falling down i fainted from excitement disgust at my injury and loss of blood and lay there until cothope found me  he was the first to find me scorching as he did over the downland turf and making a wide course to get the carnaby plantations at their narrowest then presently while he was trying to apply the methodical teachings of the st johns ambulance classes to a rather abnormal case beatrice came galloping through the trees fulltilt with lord carnaby hard behind her and she was hatless muddy from a fall and white as death and cool as a cucumber too said cothope turning it over in his mind as he told me  they never seem quite to have their heads and never seem quite to lose em said cothope generalising about the sex  also he witnessed she acted with remarkable decision the question was whether i should be taken to the house her stepmother occupied at bedley corner the carnaby dower house or down to carnabys place at easting beatrice had no doubt in the matter for she meant to nurse me carnaby didnt seem to want that to happen she would have it wasnt half so far said cothope she faced us out  i hate to be faced out of my opinion so ive taken a pedometer over it since its exactly fortythree yards further  lord carnaby looked at her pretty straight said cothope finishing the picture and then he give in  v  but my story has made a jump from june to october and during that time my relations with beatrice and the countryside that was her setting had developed in many directions she came and went moving in an orbit for which i had no data going to london and paris into wales and northampton while her stepmother on some independent system of her own also vanished and recurred intermittently at home they obeyed the rule of an inflexible old maid charlotte and beatrice exercised all the rights of proprietorship in carnabys extensive stables her interest in me was from the first undisguised she found her way to my worksheds and developed rapidly in spite of the sincere discouragement of cothope into a keen amateur of aeronautics she would come sometimes in the morning sometimes in the afternoon sometimes afoot with an irish terrier sometimes riding she would come for three or four days every day vanish for a fortnight or three weeks return  it was not long before i came to look for her from the first i found her immensely interesting to me she was a new feminine type altogetheri have made it plain i think how limited was my knowledge of women but she made me not simply interested in her but in myself she became for me something that greatly changes a mans world how shall i put it she became an audience since ive emerged from the emotional developments of the affair i have thought it out in a hundred aspects and it does seem to me that this way in which men and women make audiences for one another is a curiously influential force in their lives for some it seems an audience is a vital necessity they seek audiences as creatures seek food others again my uncle among them can play to an imaginary audience i i think have lived and can live without one in my adolescence i was my own audience and my own court of honour and to have an audience in ones mind is to play a part to become selfconscious and dramatic for many years i had been selfforgetful and scientific i had lived for work and impersonal interests until i found scrutiny applause and expectation in beatrices eyes then i began to live for the effect i imagined i made upon her to make that very soon the principal value in my life i played to her i did things for the look of them i began to dream more and more of beautiful situations and fine poses and groupings with her and for her  i put these things down because they puzzle me i think i was in love with beatrice as being in love is usually understood but it was quite a different state altogether from my passionate hunger for marion or my keen sensuous desire for and pleasure in effie these were selfish sincere things fundamental and instinctive as sincere as the leap of a tiger but until matters drew to a crisis with beatrice there was an immense imaginative insurgence of a quite different quality i am setting down here very gravely and perhaps absurdly what are no doubt elementary commonplaces for innumerable people this love that grew up between beatrice and myself was i thinki put it quite tentatively and rather curiouslyromantic love that unfortunate and truncated affair of my uncle and the scrymgeour lady was really of the same stuff if a little different in quality i have to admit that the factor of audience was of primary importance in either else  its effect upon me was to make me in many respects adolescent again it made me keener upon the point of honour and anxious and eager to do high and splendid things and in particular brave things so far it ennobled and upheld me but it did also push me towards vulgar and showy things at bottom it was disingenuous it gave my life the quality of stage scenery with one side to the audience another side that wasnt meant to show and an economy of substance it certainly robbed my work of high patience and quality i cut down the toil of research in my eagerness and her eagerness for fine flourishes in the air flights that would tell i shirked the longer road  and it robbed me too of any fine perception of absurdity  yet that was not everything in our relationship the elemental thing was there also it came in very suddenly  it was one day in the summer though i do not now recall without reference to my experimental memoranda whether it was in july or august i was working with a new and more birdlike aeroplane with wing curvatures studied from lilienthal pilcher and phillips that i thought would give a different rhythm for the pitching oscillations than anything id had before i was soaring my long course from the framework on the old barrow by my sheds down to tinkers corner it is a clear stretch of downland except for two or three thickets of box and thorn to the right of my course one transverse trough in which there is bush and a small rabbit warren comes in from the east i had started and was very intent on the peculiar long swoop with which any new arrangement flew then without any sort of notice right ahead of me appeared beatrice riding towards tinkers corner to waylay and talk to me she looked round over her shoulder saw me coming touched her horse to a gallop and then the brute bolted right into the path of my machine  there was a queer moment of doubt whether we shouldnt all smash together i had to make up my mind very quickly whether i would pitchup and drop backward at once and take my chance of falling undamageda poor chance it would have beenin order to avoid any risk to her or whether i would lift against the wind and soar right over her this latter i did she had already got her horse in hand when i came up to her her womans body lay along his neck and she glanced up as i with wings aspread and every nerve in a state of tension swept over her  then i had landed and was going back to where her horse stood still and trembling  we exchanged no greetings she slid from her saddle into my arms and for one instant i held her  those great wings she said and that was all  she lay in my arms and i thought for a moment she had fainted  very near a nasty accident said cothope coming up and regarding our grouping with disfavour he took her horse by the bridle very dangerous thing coming across us like that  beatrice disengaged herself from me stood for a moment trembling and then sat down on the turf ill just sit down for a moment she said  oh she said  she covered her face with her hands while cothope looked at her with an expression between suspicion and impatience  for some moments nobody moved then cothope remarked that perhaps hed better get her water  as for me i was filled with a new outrageous idea begotten i scarcely know how from this incident with its instant contacts and swift emotions and that was that i must make love to and possess beatrice i see no particular reason why that thought should have come to me in that moment but it did i do not believe that before then i had thought of our relations in such terms at all suddenly as i remember it the factor of passion came she crouched there and i stood over her and neither of us said a word but it was just as though something had been shouted from the sky  cothope had gone twenty paces perhaps when she uncovered her face i shant want any water she said call him back  vi  after that the spirit of our relations changed the old ease had gone she came to me less frequently and when she came she would have some one with her usually old carnaby and he would do the bulk of the talking all through september she was away when we were alone together there was a curious constraint we became clouds of inexpressible feeling towards one another we could think of nothing that was not too momentous for words  then came the smash of lord roberts a and i found myself with a bandaged face in a bedroom in the bedley corner dowerhouse with beatrice presiding over an inefficient nurse lady osprey very pink and shocked in the background and my aunt jealously intervening  my injuries were much more showy than serious and i could have been taken to lady grove next day but beatrice would not permit that and kept me at bedley corner three clear days in the afternoon of the second day she became extremely solicitous for the proper aeration of the nurse packed her off for an hour in a brisk rain and sat by me alone  i asked her to marry me  all the whole i must admit it was not a situation that lent itself to eloquence i lay on my back and talked through bandages and with some little difficulty for my tongue and mouth had swollen but i was feverish and in pain and the emotional suspense i had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience  comfortable she asked  yes  shall i read to you  no i want to talk  you cant id better talk to you  no i said i want to talk to you  she came and stood by my bedside and looked me in the eyes i donti dont want you to talk to me she said i thought you couldnt talk  i get few chancesof you  youd better not talk dont talk now let me chatter instead you ought not to talk  it isnt much i said  id rather you didnt  im not going to be disfigured i said only a scar  oh she said as if she had expected something quite different did you think youd become a sort of gargoyle  lhomme qui riti didnt know but thats all right jolly flowers those are  michaelmas daisies she said im glad your not disfigured and those are perennial sunflowers do you know no flowers at all when i saw you on the ground i certainly thought you were dead you ought to have been by all the rules of the game  she said some other things but i was thinking of my next move  are we social equals i said abruptly  she stared at me queer question she said  but are we  hm difficult to say but why do you ask is the daughter of a courtesy baron who diedof general disreputableness i believebefore his father i give it up does it matter  no my mind is confused i want to know if you will marry me  she whitened and said nothing i suddenly felt i must plead with her damn these bandages i said breaking into ineffectual febrile rage  she roused herself to her duties as nurse what are you doing why are you trying to sit up sit down dont touch your bandages i told you not to talk  she stood helpless for a moment then took me firmly by the shoulders and pushed me back upon the pillow she gripped the wrist of the hand i had raised to my face  i told you not to talk she whispered close to my face i asked you not to talk why couldnt you do as i asked you  youve been avoiding me for a month i said  i know you might have known put your hand backdown by your side  i obeyed she sat on the edge of the bed a flush had come to her cheeks and her eyes were very bright i asked you she repeated not to talk  my eyes questioned her mutely  she put her hand on my chest her eyes were tormented  how can i answer you now she said  how can i say anything now  what do you mean i asked  she made no answer  do you mean it must be no  she nodded  but i said and my whole soul was full of accusations  i know she said i cant explain i cant but it has to be no it cant be its utterly finally for ever impossible keep your hands still  but i said when we met again  i cant marry i cant and wont  she stood up why did you talk she cried couldnt you see  she seemed to have something it was impossible to say  she came to the table beside my bed and pulled the michaelmas daisies awry why did you talk like that she said in a tone of infinite bitterness to begin like that  but what is it i said is it some circumstancemy social position  oh damn your social position she cried  she went and stood at the further window staring out at the rain for a long time we were absolutely still the wind and rain came in little gusts upon the pane she turned to me abruptly  you didnt ask me if i loved you she said  oh if its that said i  its not that she said but if you want to know she paused  i do she said  we stared at one another  i dowith all my heart if you want to know  then why the devil i asked  she made no answer she walked across the room to the piano and began to play rather noisily and rapidly with odd gusts of emphasis the shepherds pipe music from the last act in tristan and isolde presently she missed a note failed again ran her finger heavily up the scale struck the piano passionately with her fist making a feeble jar in the treble jumped up and went out of the room  the nurse found me still wearing my helmet of bandages partially dressed and pottering round the room to find the rest of my clothes i was in a state of exasperated hunger for beatrice and i was too inflamed and weakened to conceal the state of my mind i was feebly angry because of the irritation of dressing and particularly of the struggle to put on my trousers without being able to see my legs i was staggering about and once i had fallen over a chair and i had upset the jar of michaelmas daisies  i must have been a detestable spectacle ill go back to bed said i if i may have a word with miss beatrice ive got something to say to her thats why im dressing  my point was conceded but there were long delays whether the household had my ultimatum or whether she told beatrice directly i do not know and what lady osprey can have made of it in the former case i dont imagine  at last beatrice came and stood by my bedside well she said  all i want to say i said with the querulous note of a misunderstood child is that i cant take this as final i want to see you and talk when im better and write i cant do anything now i cant argue  i was overtaken with selfpity and began to snivel i cant rest you see i cant do anything  she sat down beside me again and spoke softly i promise i will talk it all over with you again when you are well i promise i will meet you somewhere so that we can talk you cant talk now  i asked you not to talk now all you want to know you shall know will that do  id like to know  she looked round to see the door was closed stood up and went to it  then she crouched beside me and began whispering very softly and rapidly with her face close to me  dear she said i love you if it will make you happy to marry me i will marry you i was in a mood just nowa stupid inconsiderate mood of course i will marry you you are my prince my king women are such things of moodor i would have behaved differently we say no when we mean yesand fly into crises so now yesyesyes i will i cant even kiss you give me your hand to kiss that understand i am yours do you understand i am yours just as if we had been married fifty years your wifebeatrice is that enough nownow will you rest  yes i said but why  there are complications there are difficulties when you are better you will be able tounderstand them but now they dont matter only you know this must be secretfor a time absolutely secret between us will you promise that  yes i said i understand i wish i could kiss you  she laid her head down beside mine for a moment and then she kissed my hand  i dont care what difficulties there are i said and i shut my eyes  vii  but i was only beginning to gauge the unaccountable elements in beatrice for a week after my return to lady grove i had no sign of her and then she called with lady osprey and brought a huge bunch of perennial sunflowers and michaelmas daisies just the old flowers there were in your room said my aunt with a relentless eye on me i didnt get any talk alone with beatrice then and she took occasion to tell us she was going to london for some indefinite number of weeks i couldnt even pledge her to write to me and when she did it was a brief enigmatical friendly letter with not a word of the reality between us  i wrote back a love lettermy first love letterand she made no reply for eight days then came a scrawl i cant write letters wait till we can talk are you better  i think the reader would be amused if he could see the papers on my desk as i write all this the mangled and disfigured pages the experimental arrangements of notes the sheets of suggestions balanced in constellations the blottesque intellectual battlegrounds over which i have been fighting i find this account of my relations to beatrice quite the most difficult part of my story to write i happen to be a very objectiveminded person i forget my moods and this was so much an affair of moods and even such moods and emotions as i recall are very difficult to convey to me it is about as difficult as describing a taste or a scent  then the objective story is made up of little things that are difficult to set in a proper order and love in an hysterical passion now high now low now exalted and now intensely physical no one has ever yet dared to tell a love story completely its alternations its comings and goings its debased moments its hate the love stories we tell tell only the net consequence the ruling effect  how can i rescue from the past now the mystical quality of beatrice my intense longing for her the overwhelming irrational formless desire how can i explain how intimately that worship mingled with a high impatient resolve to make her mine to take her by strength and courage to do my loving in a violent heroic manner and then the doubts the puzzled arrest at the fact of her fluctuations at her refusal to marry me at the fact that even when at last she returned to bedley corner she seemed to evade me  that exasperated me and perplexed me beyond measure  i felt that it was treachery i thought of every conceivable explanation and the most exalted and romantic confidence in her did not simply alternate but mingled with the basest misgivings  and into the tangle of memories comes the figure of carnaby coming out slowly from the background to a position of significance as an influence as a predominant strand in the nets that kept us apart as a rival what were the forces that pulled her away from me when it was so clearly manifest she loved me did she think of marrying him had i invaded some longplanned scheme it was evident he did not like me that in some way i spoilt the world for him she returned to bedley corner and for some weeks she was flitting about me and never once could i have talk with her alone when she came to my sheds carnaby was always with her jealously observant why the devil couldnt she send him about his business the days slipped by and my anger gathered  all this mingles with the making of lord roberts b i had resolved upon that one night as i lay awake at bedley corner i got it planned out before the bandages were off my face i conceived this second navigable balloon in a grandiose manner it was to be a second lord roberts a only more so it was to be three times as big large enough to carry three men and it was to be an altogether triumphant vindication of my claims upon the air the framework was to be hollow like a birds bones airtight and the air pumped in or out and the weight of fuel i carried changed i talked much and boasted to cothopewhom i suspected of scepticisms about this new typeof what it would do and it progressedslowly it progressed slowly because i was restless and uncertain at times i would go away to london to snatch some chance of seeing beatrice there at times nothing but a day of gliding and hard and dangerous exercise would satisfy me and now in the newspapers in conversation in everything about me arose a new invader of my mental states something was happening to the great schemes of my uncles affairs people were beginning to doubt to question it was the first quiver of his tremendous insecurity the first wobble of that gigantic credit top he had kept spinning so long  there were comings and goings november and december slipped by i had two unsatisfactory meetings with beatrice meetings that had no privacyin which we said things of the sort that need atmosphere baldly and furtively i wrote to her several times and she wrote back notes that i would sometimes respond to altogether sometimes condemn as insincere evasions you dont understand i cant just now explain be patient with me leave things a little while to me she wrote  i would talk aloud to these notes and wrangle over them in my workroomwhile the plans of lord roberts b waited  you dont give me a chance i would say why dont you let me know the secret thats what im forto settle difficulties to tell difficulties to  and at last i could hold out no longer against these accumulating pressures  i took an arrogant outrageous line that left her no loopholes i behaved as though we were living in a melodrama  you must come and talk to me i wrote or i will come and take you i want youand the time runs away  we met in a ride in the upper plantations it must have been early in january for there was snow on the ground and on the branches of the trees we walked to and fro for an hour or more and from the first i pitched the key high in romance and made understandings impossible it was our worst time together i boasted like an actor and she i know not why was tired and spiritless  now i think over that talk in the light of all that has happened since i can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal i was too foolish to let her make i dont know i confess i have never completely understood beatrice i confess i am still perplexed at many things she said and did that afternoon anyhow i was impossible i posed and scolded i wasi said itfor taking the universe by the throat  if it was only that she said but though i heard i did not heed her  at last she gave way to me and talked no more instead she looked at meas a thing beyond her controlling but none the less interestingmuch as she had looked at me from behind the skirts of lady drew in the warren when we were children together  once even i thought she smiled faintly  what are the difficulties i cried theres no difficulty i will not overcome for you do your people think im no equal for you who says it my dear tell me to win a title ill do it in five years  here am i just grown a man at the sight of you i have wanted something to fight for let me fight for you  im rich without intending it let me mean it give me an honourable excuse for it and ill put all this rotten old warren of england at your feet  i said such things as that i write them down here in all their resounding base pride i said these empty and foolish things and they are part of me why should i still cling to pride and be ashamed i shouted her down  i passed from such megalomania to petty accusations  you think carnaby is a better man than i i said  no she cried stung to speech no  you think were unsubstantial youve listened to all these rumours boom has started because we talked of a newspaper of our own when you are with me you know im a man when you get away from me you think im a cheat and a cad theres not a word of truth in the things they say about us ive been slack ive left things but we have only to exert ourselves you do not know how wide and far we have spread our nets even now we have a coupan expeditionin hand it will put us on a footing  her eyes asked mutely and asked in vain that i would cease to boast of the very qualities she admired in me  in the night i could not sleep for thinking of that talk and the vulgar things i had said in it i could not understand the drift my mind had taken i was acutely disgusted and my unwonted doubts about myself spread from a merely personal discontent to our financial position it was all very well to talk as i had done of wealth and power and peerages but what did i know nowadays of my uncles position suppose in the midst of such boasting and confidence there came some turn i did not suspect some rottenness he had concealed from me i resolved i had been playing with aeronautics long enough that next morning i would go to him and have things clear between us  i caught an early train and went up to the hardingham  i went up to the hardingham through a dense london fog to see how things really stood before i had talked to my uncle for ten minutes i felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream   chapter the fourth  how i stole the heaps of quap from mordet island  i  we got to make a fight for it said my uncle we got to face the music  i remember that even at the sight of him i had a sense of impending calamity he sat under the electric light with the shadow of his hair making bars down his face he looked shrunken and as though his skin had suddenly got loose and yellow the decorations of the room seemed to have lost freshness and outside the blinds were upthere was not so much fog as a dun darkness one saw the dingy outlines of the chimneys opposite quite distinctly and then a sky of such brown as only london can display  i saw a placard i said more ponderevity  thats boom he said boom and his damned newspapers hes trying to fight me down ever since i offered to buy the daily decorator hes been at me and he thinks consolidating do ut cut down the ads he wants everything damn him hes got no sense of dealing id like to bash his face  well i said whats to be done  keep going said my uncle  ill smash boom yet he said with sudden savagery  nothing else i asked  we got to keep going theres a scare on did you notice the rooms half the people out there this morning are reporters and if i talk they touch it up they didnt used to touch things up now they put in character touchesinsulting you dont know what journalisms coming to its all booms doing  he cursed lord boom with considerable imaginative vigour  well said i what can he do  shove us up against time george make money tight for us we been handling a lot of moneyand he tightens us up  were sound  oh were sound george trust me for that but all the sametheres such a lot of imagination in these things were sound enough thats not it  he blew damn boom he said and his eyes over his glasses met mine defiantly  we cant i suppose run close hauled for a bitstop expenditure  where  wellcrest hill  what he shouted me stop crest hill for boom he waved a fist as if to hit his inkpot and controlled himself with difficulty he spoke at last in a reasonable voice if i did he said hed kick up a fuss its no good even if i wanted to everybodys watching the place if i was to stop building wed be down in a week  he had an idea i wish i could do something to start a strike or something no such luck treat those workmen a sight too well no sink or swim crest hill goes on until were under water  i began to ask questions and irritated him instantly  oh dash these explanations george he cried you only make things look rottener than they are its your way it isnt a case of figures were all righttheres only one thing we got to do  yes  show value george thats where this quap comes in thats why i fell in so readily with what you brought to me week before last here we are we got our option on the perfect filament and all we wants canadium nobody knows theres more canadium in the world than will go on the edge of a sixpence except me and you nobody has an idee the perfect filaments more than just a bit of theorising fifty tons of quap and wed turn that bit of theorising into something wed make the lamp trade sit on its tail and howl wed put ediswan and all of em into a parcel without last years trousers and a hat and swap em off for a pot of geraniums see wed do it through business organisations and there you are see caperns patent filament  the ideal and the real george well do it well bring it off and then well give such a facer to boom hell think for fifty years hes laying up for our london and african meeting let him he can turn the whole paper on to us he says the business organisations shares arent worth fiftytwo and we quote em at eightyfour well here we are gettin ready for himloading our gun  his pose was triumphant  yes i said thats all right but i cant help thinking where should we be if we hadnt just by accident got caperns perfect filament because you know it was an accidentmy buying up that  he crumpled up his nose into an expression of impatient distaste at my unreasonableness  and after all the meetings in june and you havent begun to get the quap after all weve still got to load our gun  they start on toosday  have they got the brig  theyve got a brig  gordonnasmyth i doubted  safe as a bank he said more i see of that man the more i like him all i wish is wed got a steamer instead of a sailing ship  and i went on you seem to overlook what used to weigh with us a bit this canadium side of the business and the capern chance has rushed you off your legs after allits stealing and in its way an international outrage theyve got two gunboats on the coast  i jumped up and went and stared out at the fog  and by jove its about our only chance i didnt dream  i turned on him ive been up in the air i said  heaven knows where i havent been and heres our only chanceand you give it to that adventurous lunatic to play in his own wayin a brig  well you had a voice  i wish id been in this before we ought to have run out a steamer to lagos or one of those west coast places and done it from there fancy a brig in the channel at this time of year if it blows southwest  i dessay youd have shoved it george still you know george i believe in him  yes i said yes i believe in him too in a way still  we took up a telegram that was lying on his desk and opened it his face became a livid yellow he put the flimsy paper down with a slow reluctant movement and took off his glasses  george he said the lucks against us  what  he grimaced with his mouthin the queerest way at the telegram  that  i took it up and read  motor smash compound fracture of the leg gordon nasmyth what price mordet now  for a moment neither of us spoke  thats all right i said at last  eh said my uncle  im going ill get that quap or bust  ii  i had a ridiculous persuasion that i was saving the situation  im going i said quite consciously and dramatically i saw the whole affairhow shall i put itin american colours  i sat down beside him give me all the data youve got i said and ill pull this thing off  but nobody knows exactly where  nasmyth does and hell tell me  hes been very close said my uncle and regarded me  hell tell me all right now hes smashed  he thought i believe he will  george he said if you pull this thing offonce or twice before youve stepped inwith that sort of woosh of yours  he left the sentence unfinished  give me that notebook i said and tell me all you know wheres the ship wheres pollack and wheres that telegram from if that quaps to be got ill get it or bust if youll hold on here until i get back with it  and so it was i jumped into the wildest adventure of my life  i requisitioned my uncles best car forthwith i went down that night to the place of despatch named on nasmyths telegram bampton so oxon routed him out with a little trouble from that centre made things right with him and got his explicit directions and i was inspecting the maud mary with young pollack his cousin and aide the following afternoon she was rather a shock to me and not at all in my style a beast of a brig inured to the potato trade and she reeked from end to end with the faint subtle smell of raw potatoes so that it prevailed even over the temporary smell of new paint she was a beast of a brig all hold and dirty framework and they had ballasted her with old iron and old rails and iron sleepers and got a miscellaneous lot of spades and iron wheelbarrows against the loading of the quap i thought her over with pollack one of those tall blond young men who smoke pipes and dont help much and then by myself and as a result i did my best to sweep gravesend clean of wheeling planks and got in as much cord and small rope as i could for lashing i had an idea we might need to run up a jetty in addition to much ballast she held remotely hidden in a sort of inadvertent way a certain number of ambiguous cases which i didnt examine but which i gathered were a provision against the need of a trade  the captain was a most extraordinary creature under the impression we were after copper ore he was a roumanian jew with twitching excitable features who had made his way to a certificate after some preliminary naval experiences in the black sea the mate was an essex man of impenetrable reserve the crew were astoundingly illclad and destitute and dirty most of them youths unwashed out of colliers one the cook was a mulatto and one the bestbuilt fellow of them all was a breton there was some subterfuge about our position on boardi forget the particulars nowi was called the supercargo and pollack was the steward this added to the piratical flavour that insufficient funds and gordonnasmyths original genius had already given the enterprise  those two days of bustle at gravesend under dingy skies in narrow dirty streets were a new experience for me it is like nothing else in my life i realised that i was a modern and a civilised man i found the food filthy and the coffee horrible the whole town stank in my nostrils the landlord of the good intent on the quay had a standup quarrel with us before i could get even a hot bath and the bedroom i slept in was infested by a quantity of exotic but voracious flat parasites called locally bugs in the walls in the woodwork everywhere i fought them with insect powder and found them comatose in the morning i was dipping down into the dingy underworld of the contemporary state and i liked it no better than i did my first dip into it when i stayed with my uncle nicodemus frapp at the bakery at chathamwhere bytheby we had to deal with cockroaches of a smaller darker variety and also with bugs of sorts  let me confess that through all this time before we started i was immensely selfconscious and that beatrice played the part of audience in my imagination throughout i was as i say saving the situation and i was acutely aware of that the evening before we sailed instead of revising our medicinechest as i had intended i took the car and ran across country to lady grove to tell my aunt of the journey i was making dress and astonish lady osprey by an after dinner call  the two ladies were at home and alone beside a big fire that seemed wonderfully cheerful after the winter night i remember the effect of the little parlour in which they sat as very bright and domestic lady osprey in a costume of mauve and lace sat on a chintz sofa and played an elaborately spreadout patience by the light of a tall shaded lamp beatrice in a whiteness that showed her throat smoked a cigarette in an armchair and read with a lamp at her elbow the room was whitepanelled and chintzcurtained about those two bright centres of light were warm dark shadow in which a circular mirror shone like a pool of brown water i carried off my raid by behaving like a slave of etiquette there were moments when i think i really made lady osprey believe that my call was an unavoidable necessity that it would have been negligent of me not to call just how and when i did but at the best those were transitory moments  they received me with disciplined amazement lady osprey was interested in my face and scrutinised the scar beatrice stood behind her solicitude our eyes met and in hers i could see startled interrogations  im going i said to the west coast of africa  they asked questions but it suited my mood to be vague  weve interests there it is urgent i should go i dont know when i may return  after that i perceived beatrice surveyed me steadily  the conversation was rather difficult i embarked upon lengthy thanks for their kindness to me after my accident i tried to understand lady ospreys game of patience but it didnt appear that lady osprey was anxious for me to understand her patience i came to the verge of taking my leave  you neednt go yet said beatrice abruptly  she walked across to the piano took a pile of music from the cabinet near surveyed lady ospreys back and with a gesture to me dropped it all deliberately on to the floor  must talk she said kneeling close to me as i helped her to pick it up turn my pages at the piano  i cant read music  turn my pages  presently we were at the piano and beatrice was playing with noisy inaccuracy she glanced over her shoulder and lady osprey had resumed her patience the old lady was very pink and appeared to be absorbed in some attempt to cheat herself without our observing it  isnt west africa a vile climate are you going to live there why are you going  beatrice asked these questions in a low voice and gave me no chance to answer then taking a rhythm from the music before her she said  at the back of the house is a gardena door in the wallon the lane understand  i turned over the pages without any effect on her playing  when i asked  she dealt in chords i wish i could play this she said midnight  she gave her attention to the music for a time  you may have to wait  ill wait  she brought her playing to an end byas school boys saystashing it up  i cant play tonight she said standing up and meeting my eyes i wanted to give you a parting voluntary  was that wagner beatrice asked lady osprey looking up from her cards it sounded very confused  i took my leave i had a curious twinge of conscience as i parted from lady osprey either a first intimation of middleage or my inexperience in romantic affairs was to blame but i felt a very distinct objection to the prospect of invading this good ladys premises from the garden door i motored up to the pavilion found cothope reading in bed told him for the first time of west africa spent an hour with him in settling all the outstanding details of lord roberts b and left that in his hands to finish against my return i sent the motor back to lady grove and still wearing my fur coatfor the january night was damp and bitterly coldwalked to bedley corner i found the lane to the back of the dower house without any difficulty and was at the door in the wall with ten minutes to spare i lit a cigar and fell to walking up and down this queer flavour of intrigue this nocturnal gardendoor business had taken me by surprise and changed my mental altitudes i was startled out of my egotistical pose and thinking intently of beatrice of that elfin quality in her that always pleased me that always took me by surprise that had made her for example so instantly conceive this meeting  she came within a minute of midnight the door opened softly and she appeared a short grey figure in a motorcoat of sheepskin bareheaded to the cold drizzle she flitted up to me and her eyes were shadows in her dusky face  why are you going to west africa she asked at once  business crisis i have to go  youre not going youre coming back  three or four months i said at most  then its nothing to do with me  nothing i said why should it have  oh thats all right one never knows what people think or what people fancy she took me by the arm lets go for a walk she said  i looked about me at darkness and rain  thats all right she laughed we can go along the lane and into the old woking road do you mind of course you dont my head it doesnt matter one never meets anybody  how do you know  ive wandered like this before of course did you thinkshe nodded her head back at her homethats all  no by jove i cried its manifest it isnt  she took my arm and turned me down the lane nights my time she said by my side theres a touch of the werewolf in my blood one never knows in these old families ive wondered often here we are anyhow alone in the world just darkness and cold and a sky of clouds and wet and wetogether  i like the wet on my face and hair dont you when do you sail  i told her tomorrow  oh well theres no tomorrow now you and i she stopped and confronted me  you dont say a word except to answer  no i said  last time you did all the talking  like a fool now  we looked at each others two dim faces youre glad to be here  im gladim beginning to beits more than glad  she put her hands on my shoulders and drew me down to kiss her  ah she said and for a moment or so we just clung to one another  thats all she said releasing herself what bundles of clothes we are tonight i felt we should kiss some day again always the last time was ages ago  among the fern stalks  among the bracken you remember and your lips were cold were mine the same lipsafter so longafter so much and now lets trudge through this blottedout world together for a time yes let me take your arm just trudge see hold tight to me because i know the wayand dont talkdont talk unless you want to talk let me tell you things you see dear the whole world is blotted outits dead and gone and were in this place this dark wild place were dead or all the world is dead no were dead no one can see us were shadows weve got out of our positions out of our bodiesand together thats the good thing of ittogether but thats why the world cant see us and why we hardly see the world sssh is it all right  its all right i said  we stumbled along for a time in a close silence we passed a dimlit rainveiled window  the silly world she said the silly world it eats and sleeps if the wet didnt patter so from the trees wed hear it snoring its dreaming such stupid thingsstupid judgments it doesnt know we are passing we twofree of itclear of it you and i  we pressed against each other reassuringly  im glad were dead she whispered im glad were dead i was tired of it dear i was so tired of it dear and so entangled  she stopped abruptly  we splashed through a string of puddles i began to remember things i had meant to say  look here i cried i want to help you beyond measure you are entangled what is the trouble i asked you to marry me you said you would but theres something  my thoughts sounded clumsy as i said them  is it something about my position or is it somethingperhapsabout some other man  there was an immense assenting silence  youve puzzled me so at firsti mean quite earlyi thought you meant to make me marry you  i did  and then  tonight she said after a long pause i cant explain no i cant explain i love you butexplanations tonight my dear here we are in the world aloneand the world doesnt matter nothing matters here i am in the cold with you and my bed away there deserted id tell youi will tell you when things enable me to tell you and soon enough they will but tonighti wonti wont  she left my side and went in front of me  she turned upon me look here she said i insist upon your being dead do you understand im not joking tonight you and i are out of life its our time together there may be other times but this we wont spoil werein hades if you like where theres nothing to hide and nothing to tell no bodies even no bothers we loved each otherdown thereand were kept apart but now it doesnt matter its over if you wont agree to thati will go home  i wanted i began  i know oh my dear if youd only understand i understand if youd only not careand love me tonight  i do love you i said  then love me she answered and leave all the things that bother you love me here i am  but  no she said  well have your way  so she carried her point and we wandered into the night together and beatrice talked to me of love  id never heard a woman before in all my life who could talk of love who could lay bare and develop and touch with imagination all that mass of fine emotion every woman it may be hides she had read of love she had thought of love a thousand sweet lyrics had sounded through her brain and left fine fragments in her memory she poured it out all of it shamelessly skilfully for me i cannot give any sense of that talk i cannot even tell how much of the delight of it was the magic of her voice the glow of her near presence and always we walked swathed warmly through a chilly air along dim interminable greasy roadswith never a soul abroad it seemed to us never a beast in the fields  why do people love each other i said  why not  but why do i love you why is your voice better than any voice your face sweeter than any face  and why do i love you she asked not only what is fine in you but what isnt why do i love your dullness your arrogance for i do tonight i love the very raindrops on the fur of your coat  so we talked and at last very wet still glowing but a little tired we parted at the garden door we had been wandering for two hours in our strange irrational community of happiness and all the world about us and particularly lady osprey and her household had been asleepand dreaming of anything rather than beatrice in the night and rain  she stood in the doorway a muffled figure with eyes that glowed  come back she whispered i shall wait for you  she hesitated  she touched the lapel of my coat i love you now she said and lifted her face to mine  i held her to me and was atremble from top to toe o god i cried and i must go  she slipped from my arms and paused regarding me for an instant the world seemed full of fantastic possibilities  yes go she said and vanished and slammed the door upon me leaving me alone like a man new fallen from fairyland in the black darkness of the night  iii  that expedition to mordet island stands apart from all the rest of my life detached a piece by itself with an atmosphere of its own it would i suppose make a book by itselfit has made a fairly voluminous official reportbut so far as this novel of mine goes it is merely an episode a contributory experience and i mean to keep it at that  vile weather an impatient fretting against unbearable slowness and delay seasickness general discomfort and humiliating selfrevelation are the master values of these memories  i was sick all through the journey out i dont know why it was the only time i was ever seasick and i have seen some pretty bad weather since i became a boatbuilder but that phantom smell of potatoes was peculiarly vile to me coming back on the brig we were all ill every one of us so soon as we got to sea poisoned i firmly believe by quap on the way out most of the others recovered in a few days but the stuffiness below the coarse food the cramped dirty accommodation kept me if not actually seasick in a state of acute physical wretchedness the whole time the ship abounded in cockroaches and more intimate vermin i was cold all the time until after we passed cape verde then i became steamily hot i had been too preoccupied with beatrice and my keen desire to get the maud mary under way at once to consider a proper wardrobe for myself and in particular i lacked a coat heavens how i lacked that coat and moreover i was cooped up with two of the worst bores in christendom pollack and the captain pollack after conducting his illness in a style better adapted to the capacity of an opera house than a small compartment suddenly got insupportably well and breezy and produced a manly pipe in which he smoked a tobacco as blond as himself and divided his time almost equally between smoking it and trying to clean it theres only three things you can clean a pipe with he used to remark with a twist of paper in hand the bests a feather the seconds a straw and the thirds a girls hairpin i never see such a ship you cant find any of em last time i came this way i did find hairpins anyway and found em on the floor of the captains cabin regular deposit eh feelin better  at which i usually swore  oh youll be all right soon dont mind my puffin a bit eh  he never tired of asking me to have a hand at nap good game makes you forget it and thats half the battle  he would sit swaying with the rolling of the ship and suck at his pipe of blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but somnolent blue eye at the captain by the hour together captains a card he would say over and over again as the outcome of these meditations hed like to know what were up to hed like to knowno end  that did seem to be the captains ruling idea but he also wanted to impress me with the notion that he was a gentleman of good family and to air a number of views adverse to the english to english literature to the english constitution and the like  he had learnt the sea in the roumanian navy and english out of a book he would still at times pronounce the es at the end of there and here he was a naturalised englishman and he drove me into a reluctant and uncongenial patriotism by his everlasting carping at things english pollack would set himself to draw him out heaven alone can tell how near i came to murder  fiftythree days i had outward cooped up with these two and a shy and profoundly depressed mate who read the bible on sundays and spent the rest of his leisure in lethargy three and fifty days of life cooped up in a perpetual smell in a persistent sick hunger that turned from the sight of food in darkness cold and wet in a lightly ballasted ship that rolled and pitched and swayed and all the time the sands in the hourglass of my uncles fortunes were streaming out misery amidst it all i remember only one thing brightly one morning of sunshine in the bay of biscay and a vision of frothing waves sapphire green a bird following our wake and our masts rolling about the sky then wind and rain close in on us again  you must not imagine they were ordinary days days i mean of an average length they were not so much days as long damp slabs of time that stretched each one to the horizon and much of that length was night one paraded the staggering deck in a borrowed souwester hour after hour in the chilly windy splashing and spitting darkness or sat in the cabin bored and ill and looked at the faces of those inseparable companions by the help of a lamp that gave smell rather than light then one would see going up up up and then sinking down down down pollack extinct pipe in mouth humorously observant bringing his mind slowly to the seventyseventh decision that the captain was a card while the words flowed from the latter in a nimble incessant good dis england eet is not a country aristocratic no eet is a glorified bourgeoisie eet is plutocratic in england dere is no aristocracy since de wars of roses in the rest of europe east of the latins yes in england no  eet is all middleclass youra england everything you look at middleclass respectable everything goodeet is you say shocking madame grundy eet is all limited and computing and selfseeking dat is why your art is so limited youra fiction your philosophin why you are all so inartistic you want nothing but profit what will pay what would you  he had all those violent adjuncts to speech we western europeans have abandoned shruggings of the shoulders waving of the arms thrusting out of the face wonderful grimaces and twiddlings of the hands under your nose until you wanted to hit them away day after day it went on and i had to keep any anger to myself to reserve myself for the time ahead when it would be necessary to see the quap was got aboard and stowedknee deep in this mans astonishment i knew he would make a thousand objections to all we had before us he talked like a drugged man it ran glibly over his tongue and all the time one could see his seamanship fretting him he was gnawed by responsibility perpetually uneasy about the ships position perpetually imagining dangers if a sea hit us exceptionally hard hed be out of the cabin in an instant making an outcry of inquiries and he was pursued by a dread of the hold of ballast shifting of insidious wicked leaks as we drew near the african coast his fear of rocks and shoals became infectious  i do not know dis coast he used to say i cama hera because gordonnasmyth was coming too den he does not come  fortunes of war i said and tried to think in vain if any motive but sheer haphazard could have guided gordonnasmyth in the choice of these two men i think perhaps gordonnasmyth had the artistic temperament and wanted contrasts and also that the captain helped him to express his own malignant antibritishism  he was indeed an exceptionally inefficient captain on the whole i was glad i had come even at the eleventh hour to see to things  the captain bytheby did at last out of sheer nervousness get aground at the end of mordets island but we got off in an hour or so with a swell and a little hard work in the boat  i suspected the mate of his opinion of the captain long before he expressed it he was i say a taciturn man but one day speech broke through him he had been sitting at the table with his arms folded on it musing drearily pipe in mouth and the voice of the captain drifted down from above  the mate lifted his heavy eyes to me and regarded me for a moment then he began to heave with the beginnings of speech he disembarrassed himself of his pipe i cowered with expectation speech was coming at last before he spoke he nodded reassuringly once or twice  e  he moved his head strangely and mysteriously but a child might have known he spoke of the captain  es a foreigner  he regarded me doubtfully for a time and at last decided for the sake of lucidity to clench the matter  thats what e isa dago  he nodded like a man who gives a last tap to a nail and i could see he considered his remark well and truly laid his face though still resolute became as tranquil and uneventful as a huge hall after a public meeting has dispersed out of it and finally he closed and locked it with his pipe  roumanian jew isnt he i said  he nodded darkly and almost forbiddingly  more would have been too much the thing was said but from that time forth i knew i could depend upon him and that he and i were friends it happens i never did have to depend upon him but that does not affect our relationship  forward the crew lived lives very much after the fashion of ours more crowded more cramped and dirty wetter steamier more verminous the coarse food they had was still not so coarse but that they did not think they were living like fighting cocks so far as i could make out they were all nearly destitute men hardly any of them had a proper sea outfit and what small possessions they had were a source of mutual distrust and as we pitched and floundered southward they gambled and fought were brutal to one another argued and wrangled loudly until we protested at the uproar  theres no romance about the sea in a small sailing ship as i saw it the romance is in the mind of the landsman dreamer these brigs and schooners and brigantines that still stand out from every little port are relics from an age of petty trade as rotten and obsolescent as a georgian house that has sunken into a slum they are indeed just floating fragments of slum much as icebergs are floating fragments of glacier the civilised man who has learnt to wash who has developed a sense of physical honour of cleanly temperate feeding of time can endure them no more they pass and the clanking coalwasting steamers will follow them giving place to cleaner finer things  but so it was i made my voyage to africa and came at last into a world of steamy fogs and a hot smell of vegetable decay and into sound and sight of surf and distant intermittent glimpses of the coast i lived a strange concentrated life through all that time such a life as a creature must do that has fallen in a well all my former ways ceased all my old vistas became memories  the situation i was saving was very small and distant now i felt its urgency no more beatrice and lady grove my uncle and the hardingham my soaring in the air and my habitual wide vision of swift effectual things became as remote as if they were in some world i had left for ever  iv  all these african memories stand by themselves it was for me an expedition into the realms of undisciplined nature out of the world that is ruled by men my first bout with that hot side of our mother that gives you the junglethat cold side that gives you the aireddy i was beginning to know passing well they are memories woven upon a fabric of sunshine and heat and a constant warm smell of decay they end in rainsuch rain as i had never seen before a vehement a frantic downpouring of water but our first slow passage through the channels behind mordets island was in incandescent sunshine  there we go in my memory still a blistered dirty ship with patched sails and a battered mermaid to present maud mary sounding and taking thought between high ranks of forest whose trees come out kneedeep at last in the water there we go with a little breeze on our quarter mordet island rounded and the quap it might be within a day of us  here and there strange blossoms woke the dank intensities of green with a trumpet call of colour things crept among the jungle and peeped and dashed back rustling into stillness always in the sluggishly drifting opaque water were eddyings and stirrings little rushes of bubbles came chuckling up lightheartedly from this or that submerged conflict and tragedy now and again were crocodiles like a stranded fleet of logs basking in the sun still it was by day a dreary stillness broken only by insect sounds and the creaking and flapping of our progress by the calling of the soundings and the captains confused shouts but in the night as we lay moored to a clump of trees the darkness brought a thousand swampy things to life and out of the forest came screaming and howlings screaming and yells that made us glad to be afloat and once we saw between the tree stems long blazing fires we passed two or three villages landward and brownblack women and children came and stared at us and gesticulated and once a man came out in a boat from a creek and hailed us in an unknown tongue and so at last we came to a great open place a broad lake rimmed with a desolation of mud and bleached refuse and dead trees free from crocodiles or water birds or sight or sound of any living thing and saw far off even as nasmyth had described the ruins of the deserted station and hard by two little heaps of buffhued rubbish under a great rib of rock the quap the forest receded the land to the right of us fell away and became barren and far on across notch in its backbone was surf and the sea  we took the ship in towards those heaps and the ruined jetty slowly and carefully the captain came and talked  this is eet he said  yes said i  is eet for trade we have come  this was ironical  no said i  gordonnasmyth would haf told me long ago what it ees for we haf come  ill tell you now i said we are going to lay in as close as we can to those two heaps of stuffyou see themunder the rock then we are going to chuck all our ballast overboard and take those in then were going home  may i presume to askis eet gold  no i said incivilly it isnt  then what is it  its stuffof some commercial value  we cant do eet he said  we can i answered reassuringly  we cant he said as confidently i dont mean what you mean you know so liddlebutdis is forbidden country  i turned on him suddenly angry and met bright excited eyes for a minute we scrutinised one another then i said thats our risk trade is forbidden but this isnt trade this things got to be done  his eyes glittered and he shook his head  the brig stood in slowly through the twilight toward this strange scorched and blistered stretch of beach and the man at the wheel strained his ears to listening the lowvoiced angry argument that began between myself and the captain that was presently joined by pollack we moored at last within a hundred yards of our goal and all through our dinner and far into the night we argued intermittently and fiercely with the captain about our right to load just what we pleased i will haf nothing to do with eet he persisted i wash my hands it seemed that night as though we argued in vain if it is not trade he said it is prospecting and mining that is worse any one who knows anythingoutside englandknows that is worse  we argued and i lost my temper and swore at him pollack kept cooler and chewed his pipe watchfully with that blue eye of his upon the captains gestures finally i went on deck to cool the sky was overcast i discovered all the men were in a knot forward staring at the faint quivering luminosity that had spread over the heaps of quap a phosphorescence such as one sees at times on rotting wood and about the beach east and west there were patches and streaks of something like diluted moonshine  in the small hours i was still awake and turning over scheme after scheme in my mind whereby i might circumvent the captains opposition i meant to get that quap aboard if i had to kill some one to do it never in my life had i been so thwarted after this intolerable voyage there came a rap at my cabin door and then it opened and i made out a bearded face come in i said and a black voluble figure i could just see obscurely came in to talk in my private ear and fill my cabin with its whisperings and gestures it was the captain he too had been awake and thinking things over he had come to explainenormously i lay there hating him and wondering if i and pollack could lock him in his cabin and run the ship without him i do not want to spoil dis expedition emerged from a cloud of protestations and then i was able to disentangle a commissionshush a small commissionfor special risks special risks became frequent i let him explain himself out it appeared he was also demanding an apology for something i had said no doubt i had insulted him generously at last came definite offers i broke my silence and bargained  pollack i cried and hammered the partition  whats up asked pollack  i stated the case concisely  there came a silence  hes a card said pollack lets give him his commission i dont mind  eh i cried  i said he was a card thats all said pollack im coming  he appeared in my doorway a faint white figure joined our vehement whisperings  we had to buy the captain off we had to promise him ten per cent of our problematical profits we were to give him ten per cent on what we sold the cargo for over and above his legitimate pay and i found in my outbargained and disordered state small consolation in the thought that i as the gordonnasmyth expedition was to sell the stuff to myself as business organisations and he further exasperated me by insisting on having our bargain in writing in the form of a letter he insisted  all right i acquiesced in the form of a letter here goes get a light  and the apology he said folding up the letter  all right i said apology  my hand shook with anger as i wrote and afterwards i could not sleep for hate of him at last i got up i suffered i found from an unusual clumsiness i struck my toe against my cabin door and cut myself as i shaved i found myself at last pacing the deck under the dawn in a mood of extreme exasperation the sun rose abruptly and splashed light blindingly into my eyes and i swore at the sun i found myself imagining fresh obstacles with the men and talking aloud in anticipatory rehearsal of the consequent row  the malaria of the quap was already in my blood  v  sooner or later the ridiculous embargo that now lies upon all the coast eastward of mordet island will be lifted and the reality of the deposits of quap ascertained i am sure that we were merely taking the outcrop of a stratum of nodulated deposits that dip steeply seaward those heaps were merely the crumbled out contents of two irregular cavities in the rock they are as natural as any talus or heap of that kind and the mud along the edge of the water for miles is mixed with quap and is radioactive and lifeless and faintly phosphorescent at night but the reader will find the full particulars of my impression of all this in the geological magazine for october 1905 and to that i must refer him there too he will find my unconfirmed theories of its nature if i am right it is something far more significant from the scientific point of view than those incidental constituents of various rare metals pitchblende rutile and the like upon which the revolutionary discoveries of the last decade are based those are just little molecular centres of disintegration of that mysterious decay and rotting of those elements elements once regarded as the most stable things in nature but there is somethingthe only word that comes near it is cancerousand that is not very near about the whole of quap something that creeps and lives as a disease lives by destroying an elemental stirring and disarrangement incalculably maleficent and strange  this is no imaginative comparison of mine to my mind radioactivity is a real disease of matter moreover it is a contagious disease it spreads you bring those debased and crumbling atoms near others and those too presently catch the trick of swinging themselves out of coherent existence it is in matter exactly what the decay of our old culture is in society a loss of traditions and distinctions and assured reactions when i think of these inexplicable dissolvent centres that have come into being in our globethese quap heaps are surely by far the largest that have yet been found in the world the rest as yet mere specks in grains and crystalsi am haunted by a grotesque fancy of the ultimate eating away and dryrotting and dispersal of all our world so that while man still struggles and dreams his very substance will change and crumble from beneath him i mention this here as a queer persistent fancy suppose indeed that is to be the end of our planet no splendid climax and finale no towering accumulation of achievements but justatomic decay i add that to the ideas of the suffocating comet the dark body out of space the burning out of the sun the distorted orbit as a new and far more possible endas science can see endsto this strange byplay of matter that we call human life i do not believe this can be the end no human soul can believe in such an end and go on living but to it science points as a possible thing science and reason alike if single human beingsif one single ricketty infantcan be born as it were by accident and die futile why not the whole race these are questions i have never answered that now i never attempt to answer but the thought of quap and its mysteries brings them back to me  i can witness that the beach and mud for two miles or more either way was a lifeless beachlifeless as i could have imagined no tropical mud could ever be and all the dead branches and leaves and rotting dead fish and so forth that drifted ashore became presently shrivelled and white sometimes crocodiles would come up out of the water and bask and now and then water birds would explore the mud and rocky ribs that rose out of it in a mood of transitory speculation that was its utmost admiration and the air felt at once hot and austere dry and blistering and altogether different the warm moist embrace that had met us at our first african landfall and to which we had grown accustomed  i believe that the primary influence of the quap upon us was to increase the conductivity of our nerves but that is a mere unjustifiable speculation on my part at any rate it gave a sort of east wind effect to life we all became irritable clumsy languid and disposed to be impatient with our languor we moored the brig to the rocks with difficulty and got aground on mud and decided to stick there and tow off when we had donethe bottom was as greasy as butter our efforts to fix up planks and sleepers in order to wheel the quap aboard were as illconceived as that sort of work can beand that sort of work can at times be very illconceived the captain had a superstitious fear of his hold he became wildly gesticulatory and expository and incompetent at the bare thought of it his shouts still echo in my memory becoming as each crisis approached less and less like any known tongue  but i cannot now write the history of those days of blundering and toil of how milton one of the boys fell from a plank to the beach thirty feet perhaps with his barrow and broke his arm and i believe a rib of how i and pollack set the limb and nursed him through the fever that followed of how one man after another succumbed to a feverish malaria and how iby virtue of my scientific reputationwas obliged to play the part of doctor and dose them with quinine and then finding that worse than nothing with rum and small doses of eastons syrup of which there chanced to be a case of bottles aboardheaven and gordonnasmyth know why for three long days we lay in misery and never shipped a barrowload then when they resumed the mens hands broke out into sores there were no gloves available and i tried to get them while they shovelled and wheeled to cover their hands with stockings or greased rags they would not do this on account of the heat and discomfort this attempt of mine did however direct their attention to the quap as the source of their illness and precipitated what in the end finished our lading an informal strike weve had enough of this they said and they meant it they came aft to say as much they cowed the captain  through all these days the weather was variously vile first a furnace heat under a sky of a scowling intensity of blue then a hot fog that stuck in ones throat like wool and turned the men on the planks into colourless figures of giants then a wild burst of thunderstorms mad elemental uproar and rain through it all against illness heat confusion of mind one master impetus prevailed with me to keep the shipping going to maintain one motif at least whatever else arose or ceased the chuff of the spades the squeaking and shriek of the barrows the pluppa pluppa pluppa as the men came trotting along the swinging high planks and then at last the dollop dollop as the stuff shot into the hold another barrowload thank god another fifteen hundred or it may be two thousand pounds for the saving of ponderevo  i found out many things about myself and humanity in those weeks of effort behind mordet island i understand now the heart of the sweater of the harsh employer of the niggerdriver i had brought these men into a danger they didnt understand i was fiercely resolved to overcome their opposition and bend and use them for my purpose and i hated the men but i hated all humanity during the time that the quap was near me  and my mind was pervaded too by a sense of urgency and by the fear that we should be discovered and our proceedings stopped i wanted to get out to sea againto be beating up northward with our plunder i was afraid our masts showed to seaward and might betray us to some curious passer on the high sea and one evening near the end i saw a canoe with three natives far off down the lake i got fieldglasses from the captain and scrutinised them and i could see them staring at us one man might have been a halfbreed and was dressed in white they watched us for some time very quietly and then paddled off into some channel in the forest shadows  and for three nights running so that it took a painful grip upon my inflamed imagination i dreamt of my uncles face only that it was ghastly white like a clowns and the throat was cut from ear to eara long ochreous cut too late he said too late  vi  a day or so after we had got to work upon the quap i found myself so sleepless and miserable that the ship became unendurable just before the rush of sunrise i borrowed pollacks gun walked down the planks clambered over the quap heaps and prowled along the beach i went perhaps a mile and a half that day and some distance beyond the ruins of the old station i became interested in the desolation about me and found when i returned that i was able to sleep for nearly an hour it was delightful to have been alone for so longno captain no pollack no one accordingly i repeated this expedition the next morning and the next until it became a custom with me there was little for me to do once the digging and wheeling was organised and so these prowlings of mine grew longer and longer and presently i began to take food with me  i pushed these walks far beyond the area desolated by the quap on the edges of that was first a zone of stunted vegetation then a sort of swampy jungle that was difficult to penetrate and then the beginnings of the forest a scene of huge tree stems and tangled creeper ropes and roots mingled with oozy mud here i used to loaf in a state between botanising and reveriealways very anxious to know what was up above in the sunlightand here it was i murdered a man  it was the most unmeaning and purposeless murder imaginable even as i write down its wellremembered particulars there comes again the sense of its strangeness its pointlessness its incompatibility with any of the neat and definite theories people hold about life and the meaning of the world i did this thing and i want to tell of my doing it but why i did it and particularly why i should be held responsible for it i cannot explain  that morning i had come upon a track in the forest and it had occurred to me as a disagreeable idea that this was a human pathway i didnt want to come upon any human beings the less our expedition saw of the african population the better for its prospects thus far we had been singularly free from native pestering so i turned back and was making my way over mud and roots and dead fronds and petals scattered from the green world above when abruptly i saw my victim  i became aware of him perhaps forty feet off standing quite still and regarding me  he wasnt by any means a pretty figure he was very black and naked except for a dirty loincloth his legs were illshaped and his toes spread wide and the upper edge of his cloth and a girdle of string cut his clumsy abdomen into folds his forehead was low his nose very flat and his lower lip swollen and purplishred his hair was short and fuzzy and about his neck was a string and a little purse of skin he carried a musket and a powderflask was stuck in his girdle it was a curious confrontation there opposed to him stood i a little soiled perhaps but still a rather elaborately civilised human being born bred and trained in a vague tradition in my hand was an unaccustomed gun and each of us was essentially a teeming vivid brain tensely excited by the encounter quite unaware of the others mental content or what to do with him  he stepped back a pace or so stumbled and turned to run  stop i cried stop you fool and started to run after him shouting such things in english but i was no match for him over the roots and mud  i had a preposterous idea he mustnt get away and tell them  and with that instantly i brought both feet together raised my gun aimed quite coolly drew the trigger carefully and shot him neatly in the back  i saw and saw with a leap of pure exaltation the smash of my bullet between his shoulder blades got him said i dropping my gun and down he flopped and died without a groan by jove i cried with note of surprise ive killed him i looked about me and then went forward cautiously in a mood between curiosity and astonishment to look at this man whose soul i had flung so unceremoniously out of our common world i went to him not as one goes to something one has made or done but as one approaches something found  he was frightfully smashed out in front he must have died in the instant i stooped and raised him by his shoulder and realised that i dropped him and stood about and peered about me through the trees my word i said he was the second dead human beingapart i mean from surgical properties and mummies and common shows of that sortthat i have ever seen i stood over him wondering wondering beyond measure  a practical idea came into that confusion had any one heard the gun  i reloaded  after a time i felt securer and gave my mind again to the dead i had killed what must i do  it occurred to me that perhaps i ought to bury him at any rate i ought to hide him i reflected coolly and then put my gun within easy reach and dragged him by the arm towards a place where the mud seemed soft and thrust him in his powderflask slipped from his loincloth and i went back to get it then i pressed him down with the butt of my rifle  afterwards this all seemed to me most horrible but at the time it was entirely a matteroffact transaction i looked round for any other visible evidence of his fate looked round as one does when one packs ones portmanteau in an hotel bedroom  when i got my bearings and carefully returned towards the ship i had the mood of grave concentration of a boy who has lapsed into poaching and the business only began to assume proper proportions for me as i got near the ship to seem any other kind of thing than the killing of a bird or rabbit  in the night however it took on enormous and portentous forms by god i cried suddenly starting wide awake but it was murder  i lay after that wide awake staring at my memories in some odd way these visions mixed up with my dream of in my uncle in his despair the black body which saw now damaged and partly buried but which nevertheless i no longer felt was dead but acutely alive and perceiving i mixed up with the ochreous slash under my uncles face i tried to dismiss this horrible obsession from my mind but it prevailed over all my efforts  the next day was utterly black with my sense of that ugly creatures body i am the least superstitious of men but it drew me it drew me back into those thickets to the very place where i had hidden him  some evil and detestable beast had been at him and he lay disinterred  methodically i buried his swollen and mangled carcass again and returned to the ship for another night of dreams next day for all the morning i resisted the impulse to go to him and played nap with pollack with my secret gnawing at me and in the evening started to go and was near benighted i never told a soul of them of this thing i had done  next day i went early and he had gone and there were human footmarks and ugly stains round the muddy hole from which he had been dragged  i returned to the ship disconcerted and perplexed that day it was the men came aft with blistered hands and faces and sullen eyes when they proclaimed through edwards their spokesman weve had enough of this and we mean it i answered very readily so have i lets go  vii  we were none too soon people had been reconnoitring us the telegraph had been at work and we were not four hours at sea before we ran against the gunboat that had been sent down the coast to look for us and that would have caught us behind the island like a beast in a trap it was a night of driving cloud that gave intermittent gleams of moonlight the wind and sea were strong and we were rolling along through a drift of rails and mist suddenly the world was white with moonshine the gunboat came out as a long dark shape wallowing on the water to the east  she sighted the maud mary at once and fired some sort of popgun to arrest us  the mate turned to me  shall i tell the captain  the captain be damned said i and we let him sleep through two hours of chase till a rainstorm swallowed us up then we changed our course and sailed right across them and by morning only her smoke was showing  we were clear of africaand with the booty aboard i did not see what stood between us and home  for the first time since i had fallen sick in the thames my spirits rose i was seasick and physically disgusted of course but i felt kindly in spite of my qualms so far as i could calculate then the situation was saved i saw myself returning triumphantly into the thames and nothing on earth to prevent old caperns perfect filament going on the market in fortnight i had the monopoly of electric lamps beneath my feet  i was released from the spell of that bloodstained black body all mixed up with greyblack mud i was going back to baths and decent food and aeronautics and beatrice i was going back to beatrice and my real life againout of this well into which i had fallen it would have needed something more than seasickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising  i told the captain that i agreed with him that the british were the scum of europe the westward drift of all the people a disgusting rabble and i lost three pounds by attenuated retail to pollack at hapenny nap and euchre  and then you know as we got out into the atlantic this side of cape verde the ship began to go to pieces i dont pretend for one moment to understand what happened but i think greiffenhagens recent work on the effects of radium upon ligneous tissue does rather carry out my idea that emanations from quap have rapid rotting effect upon woody fibre  from the first there had been a different feel about the ship and as the big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced leaking soon she was leakingnot at any particular point but everywhere she did not spring a leak i mean but water came in first of all near the decaying edges of her planks and then through them  i firmly believe the water came through the wood first it began to ooze then to trickle it was like trying to carry moist sugar in a thin paper bag soon we were taking in water as though we had opened a door in her bottom  once it began the thing went ahead beyond all fighting for a day or so we did our best and i can still remember in my limbs and back the pumpingthe fatigue in my arms and the memory of a clear little dribble of water that jerked as one pumped and of knocking off and the being awakened to go on again and of fatigue piling up upon fatigue at last we ceased to think of anything but pumping one became a thing of torment enchanted doomed to pump for ever i still remember it as pure relief when at last pollack came to me pipe in mouth  the captain says the damned things going down right now he remarked chewing his mouthpiece eh  good idea i said one cant go on pumping for ever  and without hurry or alacrity sullenly and wearily we got into the boats and pulled away from the maud mary until we were clear of her and then we stayed resting on our oars motionless upon a glassy sea waiting for her to sink we were all silent even the captain was silent until she went down and then he spoke quite mildly in an undertone  dat is the first ship i haf ever lost and it was not a fair game it wass not a cargo any man should take no  i stared at the slow eddies that circled above the departed maud mary and the last chance of business organisations i felt weary beyond emotion i thought of my heroics to beatrice and my uncle of my prompt ill go and of all the ineffectual months i had spent after this headlong decision i was moved to laughter at myself and fate  but the captain and the men did not laugh the men scowled at me and rubbed their sore and blistered hands and set themselves to row  as all the world knows we were picked up by the union castle liner portland castle  the hairdresser aboard was a wonderful man and he even improvised me a dress suit and produced a clean shirt and warm underclothing i had a hot bath and dressed and dined and drank a bottle of burgundy  now i said are there any newspapers i want to know whats been happening in the world  my steward gave me what he had but i landed at plymouth still largely ignorant of the course of events i shook off pollack and left the captain and mate in an hotel and the men in a sailors home until i could send to pay them off and i made my way to the station  the newspapers i bought the placards i saw all england indeed resounded to my uncles bankruptcy      book the fourth  the aftermath of tonobungay    chapter the first  the stick of the rocket  i  that evening i talked with my uncle in the hardingham for the last time the atmosphere of the place had altered quite shockingly instead of the crowd of importunate courtiers there were just half a dozen uninviting men journalists waiting for an interview ropper the big commissionaire was still there but now indeed he was defending my uncle from something more than timewasting intrusions i found the little man alone in the inner office pretending to work but really brooding he was looking yellow and deflated  lord he said at the sight of me youre lean george it makes that scar of yours show up  we regarded each other gravely for a time  quap i said is at the bottom of the atlantic theres some billsweve got to pay the men  seen the papers  read em all in the train  at bay he said i been at bay for a week yelping round me and me facing the music im feelin a bit tired  he blew and wiped his glasses  my stomack isnt what it was he explained one finds itthese times how did it all happen george your marconigramit took me in the wind a bit  i told him concisely he nodded to the paragraphs of my narrative and at the end he poured something from a medicine bottle into a sticky little wineglass and drank it i became aware of the presence of drugs of three or four small bottles before him among his disorder of papers of a faint elusively familiar odour in the room  yes he said wiping his lips and recorking the bottle youve done your best george the lucks been against us  he reflected bottle in hand sometimes the luck goes with you and sometimes it doesnt sometimes it doesnt and then where are you grass in the oven fight or no fight  he asked a few questions and then his thoughts came back to his own urgent affairs i tried to get some comprehensive account of the situation from him but he would not give it  oh i wish id had you i wish id had you george ive had a lot on my hands youre clear headed at times  what has happened  oh boominfernal things  yes buthow im just off the sea remember  itd worry me too much to tell you now its tied up in a skein  he muttered something to himself and mused darkly and roused himself to say  besidesyoud better keep out of it its getting tight get em talking go down to crest hill and fly thats your affair  for a time his manner set free queer anxieties in my brain again  i will confess that that mordet island nightmare of mine returned and as i looked at him his hand went out for the drug again stomach george he said  i been fightin on that every man fights on some thinggives way somewhereshead heart liversomething zzzz gives way somewhere napoleon did at last all through the waterloo campaign his stomachit wasnt a stomach worse than mine no end  the mood of depression passed as the drug worked within him his eyes brightened he began to talk big he began to dress up the situation for my eyes to recover what he had admitted to me he put it as a retreat from russia there were still the chances of leipzig  its a battle georgea big fight were fighting for millions ive still chances theres still a card or so i cant tell all my planslike speaking on the stroke  you might i began  i cant george its like asking to look at some embryo you got to wait i know in a sort of way i know but to tell itno you been away so long and everythings got complicated  my perception of disastrous entanglements deepened with the rise of his spirits it was evident that i could only help to tie him up in whatever net was weaving round his mind by forcing questions and explanations upon him my thoughts flew off at another angle hows aunt susan said i  i had to repeat the question his busy whispering lips stopped for a moment and he answered in the note of one who repeats a formula  shed like to be in the battle with me shed like to be here in london but theres corners i got to turn alone his eye rested for a moment on the little bottle beside him and things have happened  you might go down now and talk to her he said in a directer voice i shall be down tomorrow night i think  he looked up as though he hoped that would end our talk  for the weekend i asked  for the weekend thank god for weekends george  ii  my return home to lady grove was a very different thing from what i had anticipated when i had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied the perfectfilament was safe within my grasp as i walked through the evening light along the downs the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead there were no lurking workmen any more no cyclists on the high road  cessation was manifest everywhere there had been i learnt from my aunt a touching and quite voluntary demonstration when the crest hill work had come to an end and the men had drawn their last pay they had cheered my uncle and hooted the contractors and lord boom  i cannot now recall the manner in which my aunt and i greeted one another i must have been very tired there but whatever impression was made has gone out of my memory but i recall very clearly how we sat at the little round table near the big window that gave on the terrace and dined and talked i remember her talking of my uncle  she asked after him and whether he seemed well i wish i could help she said but ive never helped him much never his way of doing things was never mine and sincesince since he began to get so rich hes kept things from me in the old daysit was different  there he isi dont know what hes doing he wont have me near him  mores kept from me than anyone the very servants wont let me know they try and stop the worst of the papersbooms thingsfrom coming upstairs i suppose theyve got him in a corner george poor old teddy poor old adam and eve we are ficial receivers with flaming swords to drive us out of our garden id hoped wed never have another trek wellanyway it wont be crest hill but its hard on teddy he must be in such a mess up there poor old chap i suppose we cant help him i suppose wed only worry him have some more soup georgewhile there is some  the next day was one of those days of strong perception that stand out clear in ones memory when the common course of days is blurred i can recall now the awakening in the large familiar room that was always kept for me and how i lay staring at its chintzcovered chairs its spaced fine furniture its glimpse of the cedars without and thought that all this had to end  i have never been greedy for money i have never wanted to be rich but i felt now an immense sense of impending deprivation i read the newspapers after breakfasti and my aunt togetherand then i walked up to see what cothope had done in the matter of lord roberts b never before had i appreciated so acutely the ample brightness of the lady grove gardens the dignity and wide peace of all about me it was one of those warm mornings in late may that have won all the glory of summer without losing the gay delicacy of spring the shrubbery was bright with laburnum and lilac the beds swarmed with daffodils and narcissi and with lilies of the valley in the shade  i went along the wellkept paths among the rhododendra and through the private gate into the woods where the bluebells and common orchid were in profusion never before had i tasted so completely the fine sense of privilege and ownership and all this has to end i told myself all this has to end  neither my uncle nor i had made any provision for disaster all we had was in the game and i had little doubt now of the completeness of our ruin for the first time in my life since he had sent me that wonderful telegram of his i had to consider that common anxiety of mankindemployment i had to come off my magic carpet and walk once more in the world  and suddenly i found myself at the cross drives where i had seen beatrice for the first time after so many years it is strange but so far as i can recollect i had not thought of her once since i had landed at plymouth no doubt she had filled the background of my mind but i do not remember one definite clear thought i had been intent on my uncle and the financial collapse  it came like a blow in the face now all that too had to end  suddenly i was filled with the thought of her and a great longing for her what would she do when she realised our immense disaster what would she do how would she take it it filled me with astonishment to realise how little i could tell  should i perhaps presently happen upon her  i went on through the plantations and out upon the downs and thence i saw cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring down wind to my old familiar grounding place to judge by its long rhythm it was a very good glider like cothopes cheek thought i to go on with the research i wonder if hes keeping notes but all this will have to stop  he was sincerely glad to see me its been a rum go he said  he had been there without wages for a month a man forgotten in the rush of events  i just stuck on and did what i could with the stuff i got a bit of money of my ownand i said to myself well here you are with the gear and no one to look after you you wont get such a chance again my boy not in all your born days why not make what you can with it   hows lord roberts b  cothope lifted his eyebrows ive had to refrain he said but hes looking very handsome  gods i said id like to get him up just once before we smash you read the papers you know were going to smash  oh i read the papers its scandalous sir such work as ours should depend on things like that you and i ought to be under the state sir if youll excuse me  nothing to excuse i said ive always been a socialistof a sortin theory lets go and have a look at him how is he deflated  just about quarter full that last oil glaze of yours holds the gas something beautiful hes not lost a cubic metre a week  cothope returned to socialism as we went toward the sheds  glad to think youre a socialist sir he said its the only civilised state i been a socialist some yearsoff the clarion its a rotten scramble this world it takes the things we make and invent and it plays the silly fool with em we scientific people well have to take things over and stop all this financing and advertisement and that its too silly its a noosance look at us  lord roberts b even in his partially deflated condition in his shed was a fine thing to stare up at i stood side by side with cothope regarding him and it was borne in upon me more acutely than ever that all this had to end i had a feeling just like the feeling of a boy who wants to do wrong that i would use up the stuff while i had it before the creditors descended i had a queer fancy too i remember that if i could get into the air it would advertise my return to beatrice  well fill her i said concisely  its all ready said cothope and added as an afterthought unless they cut off the gas  i worked and interested myself with cothope all the morning and for a time forgot my other troubles but the thought of beatrice flooded me slowly and steadily it became an unintelligent sick longing to see her i felt that i could not wait for the filling of lord roberts b that i must hunt her up and see her soon i got everything forward and lunched with cothope and then with the feeblest excuses left him in order to prowl down through the woods towards bedley corner i became a prey to wretched hesitations and diffidence ought i to go near her now i asked myself reviewing all the social abasements of my early years at last about five i called at the dower house i was greeted by their charlottewith a forbidding eye and a cold astonishment  both beatrice and lady osprey were out  there came into my head some prowling dream of meeting her i went along the lane towards woking the lane down which we had walked five months ago in the wind and rain  i mooned for a time in our former footsteps then swore and turned back across the fields and then conceived a distaste for cothope and went downward at last i found myself looking down on the huge abandoned masses of the crest hill house  that gave my mind a twist into a new channel my uncle came uppermost again what a strange melancholy emptiness of intention that stricken enterprise seemed in the even evening sunlight what vulgar magnificence and crudity and utter absurdity it was as idiotic as the pyramids i sat down on the stile staring at it as though i had never seen that forest of scaffold poles that waste of walls and bricks and plaster and shaped stones that wilderness of broken soil and wheeling tracks and dumps before it struck me suddenly as the compactest image and sample of all that passes for progress of all the advertisementinflated spending the aimless building up and pulling down the enterprise and promise of my age this was our fruit this was what he had done i and my uncle in the fashion of our time we were its leaders and exponents we were the thing it most flourishingly produced for this futility in its end for an epoch of such futility the solemn scroll of history had unfolded  great god i cried but is this life  for this the armies drilled for this the law was administered and the prisons did their duty for this the millions toiled and perished in suffering in order that a few of us should build palaces we never finished make billiardrooms under ponds run imbecile walls round irrational estates scorch about the world in motorcars devise flyingmachines play golf and a dozen such foolish games of ball crowd into chattering dinner parties gamble and make our lives one vast dismal spectacle of witless waste so it struck me then and for a time i could think of no other interpretation this was life it came to me like a revelation a revelation at once incredible and indisputable of the abysmal folly of our being  iii  i was roused from such thoughts by the sound of footsteps behind me  i turned half hopefulso foolish is a lovers imagination and stopped amazed it was my uncle his face was whitewhite as i had seen it in my dream  hullo i said and stared why arent you in london  its all up he said  adjudicated  no  i stared at him for a moment and then got off the stile  we stood swaying and then came forward with a weak motion of his arms like a man who cannot see distinctly and caught at and leant upon the stile for a moment we were absolutely still he made a clumsy gesture towards the great futility below and choked i discovered that his face was wet with tears that his wet glasses blinded him he put up his little fat hand and clawed them off clumsily felt inefficiently for his pockethandkerchief and then to my horror as he clung to me he began to weep aloud this little old worldworn swindler it wasnt just sobbing or shedding tears it was crying as a child cries it was oh terrible  its cruel he blubbered at last they asked me questions they kep asking me questions george  he sought for utterance and spluttered  the bloody bullies he shouted the bloody bullies  he ceased to weep he became suddenly rapid and explanatory  its not a fair game george they tire you out and im not well my stomachs all wrong and i been and got a cold i always been lible to cold and this ones on my chest and then they tell you to speak up they bait youand bait you and bait you its torture the strain of it you cant remember what you said youre bound to contradict yourself its like russia george it isnt fair play prominent man ive been next at dinners with that chap neal ive told him storiesand hes bitter sets out to ruin me dont ask a civil questionbellows he broke down again ive been bellowed at i been bullied i been treated like a dog dirty cads they are dirty cads id rather be a threecard sharper than a barrister id rather sell catsmeat in the streets  they sprung things on me this morning things i didnt expect they rushed me id got it all in my hands and then i was jumped by neal neal ive given city tips to neal ive helped neal  i couldnt swallow a mouthfulnot in the lunch hour i couldnt face it its true georgei couldnt face it i said id get a bit of air and slipped out and down to the embankment and there i took a boat to richmond some idee i took a rowing boat when i got there and i rowed about on the river for a bit a lot of chaps and girls there was on the bank laughed at my shirtsleeves and top hat dessay they thought it was a pleasure trip fat lot of pleasure i rowed round for a bit and came in then i came on here windsor way and there they are in london doing what they like with me i dont care  but i said looking down at him perplexed  its abscondin theyll have a warrant  i dont understand i said  its all up georgeall up and over  and i thought id live in that place george and die a lord its a great place reely an imperialif anyone has the sense to buy it and finish it that terrace  i stood thinking him over  look here i said whats that abouta warrant are you sure theyll get a warrant im sorry uncle but what have you done  havent i told you  yes but they wont do very much to you for that theyll only bring you up for the rest of your examination  he remained silent for a time at last he spokespeaking with difficulty  its worse than that ive done something theyre bound to get it out practically they have got it out  what  writin things downi done something  for the first time in his life i believe he felt and looked ashamed it filled me with remorse to see him suffer so  weve all done things i said its part of the game the world makes us play if they want to arrest youand youve got no cards in your hand they mustnt arrest you  no thats partly why i went to richmond but i never thought  his little bloodshot eyes stared at crest hill  that chap wittaker wright he said he had his stuff ready i havent now you got it george thats the sort of hole im in  iv  that memory of my uncle at the gate is very clear and full i am able to recall even the undertow of my thoughts while he was speaking i remember my pity and affection for him in his misery growing and stirring within me my realisation that at any risk i must help him but then comes indistinctness again i was beginning to act i know i persuaded him to put himself in my hands and began at once to plan and do i think that when we act most we remember least that just in the measure that the impulse of our impressions translates itself into schemes and movements it ceases to record itself in memories i know i resolved to get him away at once and to use the lord roberts b in effecting that it was clear he was soon to be a hunted man and it seemed to me already unsafe for him to try the ordinary continental routes in his flight i had to evolve some scheme and evolve it rapidly how we might drop most inconspicuously into the world across the water my resolve to have one flight at least in my airship fitted with this like hand to glove it seemed to me we might be able to cross over the water in the night set our airship adrift and turn up as pedestrian tourists in normandy or brittany and so get away that at any rate was my ruling idea  i sent off cothope with a dummy note to woking because i did not want to implicate him and took my uncle to the pavilion i went down to my aunt and made a clean breast of the situation she became admirably competent we went into his dressingroom and ruthlessly broke his locks i got a pair of brown boots a tweed suit and a cap of his and indeed a plausible walking outfit and a little game bag for his pedestrian gear and in addition a big motoring overcoat and a supply of rugs to add to those i had at the pavilion i also got a flask of brandy and she made sandwiches i dont remember any servants appearing and i forget where she got those sandwiches meanwhile we talked afterwards i thought with what a sure confidence we talked to each other  whats he done she said  dyou mind knowing  no conscience left thank god  i thinkforgery  there was just a little pause can you carry this bundle she asked  i lifted it  no woman ever has respected the lawever she said its too silly the things it lets you do and then pulls you uplike a mad nurse minding a child  she carried some rugs for me through the shrubbery in the darkling  theyll think were going mooning she said jerking her head at the household i wonder what they make of uscriminals  an immense droning note came as if in answer to that it startled us both for a moment the dears she said its the gong for dinner but i wish i could help little teddy george its awful to think of him there with hot eyes red and dry and i knowthe sight of me makes him feel sore things i said george if i could have seen id have let him have an omnibusful of scrymgeours i cut him up hed never thought i meant it before ill help all i can anyhow  i turned at something in her voice and got a moon light gleam of tears upon her face  could she have helped she asked abruptly  she  that woman  my god i cried helped thosethings dont help  tell me again what i ought to do she said after a silence  i went over the plans i had made for communicating and the things i thought she might do i had given her the address of a solicitor she might put some trust in  but you must act for yourself i insisted  roughly i said its a scramble you must get what you can for us and follow as you can  she nodded  she came right up to the pavilion and hovered for a time shyly and then went away  i found my uncle in my sittingroom in an armchair with his feet upon the fender of the gas stove which he had lit and now he was feebly drunken with my whisky and very weary in body and spirit and inclined to be cowardly  i lef my drops he said  he changed his clothes slowly and unwillingly i had to bully him i had almost to shove him to the airship and tuck him up upon its wicker flat singlehanded i made but a clumsy start we scraped along the roof of the shed and bent a van of the propeller and for a time i hung underneath without his offering a hand to help me to clamber up if it hadnt been for a sort of anchoring trolley device of cothopes a sort of slip anchor running on a rail we should never have got clear at all  v  the incidents of our flight in lord roberts b do not arrange themselves in any consecutive order to think of that adventure is like dipping haphazard into an album of views one is reminded first of this and then of that we were both lying down on a horizontal plate of basketwork for lord roberts b had none of the elegant accommodation of a balloon i lay forward and my uncle behind me in such a position that he could see hardly anything of our flight we were protected from rolling over simply by netting between the steel stays it was impossible for us to stand up at all we had either to lie or crawl on all fours over the basket work amidships were lockers made of watsons aulite materialand between these it was that i had put my uncle wrapped in rugs i wore sealskin motoring boots and gloves and a motoring fur coat over my tweeds and i controlled the engine by bowden wires and levers forward  the early part of that nights experience was made up of warmth of moonlit surrey and sussex landscape and of a rapid and successful flight ascending and swooping and then ascending again southward i could not watch the clouds because the airship overhung me i could not see the stars nor gauge the meteorological happening but it was fairly clear to me that a wind shifting between north and northeast was gathering strength and after i had satisfied myself by a series of entirely successful expansions and contractions of the real airworthiness of lord roberts b i stopped the engine to save my petrol and let the monster drift checking its progress by the dim landscape below my uncle lay quite still behind me saying little and staring in front of him and i was left to my own thoughts and sensations  my thoughts whatever they were have long since faded out of memory and my sensations have merged into one continuous memory of an countryside lying as it seemed under snow with square patches of dimness white phantoms of roads rents and pools of velvety blackness and lampjewelled houses i remember a train boring its way like a hastening caterpillar of fire across the landscape and how distinctly i heard its clatter every town and street was buttoned with street lamps i came quite close to the south downs near lewes and all the lights were out in the houses and the people gone to bed we left the land a little to the east of brighton and by that time brighton was well abed and the brightly lit seafront deserted then i let out the gas chamber to its fullest extent and rose i like to be high above water  i do not clearly know what happened in the night i think i must have dozed and probably my uncle slept i remember that once or twice i heard him talking in an eager muffled voice to himself or to an imaginary court but there can be no doubt the wind changed right round into the east and that we were carried far down the channel without any suspicion of the immense leeway we were making i remember the kind of stupid perplexity with which i saw the dawn breaking over a grey waste of water below and realised that something was wrong i was so stupid that it was only after the sunrise i really noticed the trend of the foam caps below and perceived we were in a severe easterly gale even then instead of heading southeasterly i set the engine going headed south and so continued a course that must needs have either just hit ushant or carry us over the bay of biscay i thought i was east of cherbourg when i was far to the west and stopped my engine in that belief and then set it going again i did actually sight the coast of brittany to the southeast in the late afternoon and that it was woke me up to the gravity of our position i discovered it by accident in the southeast when i was looking for it in the southwest i turned about east and faced the wind for some time and finding i had no chance in its teeth went high where it seemed less violent and tried to make a course southeast it was only then that i realised what a gale i was in i had been going westward and perhaps even in gusts north of west at a pace of fifty or sixty miles an hour  then i began what i suppose would be called a fight against the east wind one calls it a fight but it was really almost as unlike a fight as plain sewing the wind tried to drive me westwardly and i tried to get as much as i could eastwardly with the wind beating and rocking us irregularly but by no means unbearably for about twelve hours my hope lay in the wind abating and our keeping in the air and eastward of finisterre until it did and the chief danger was the exhaustion of our petrol it was a long and anxious and almost meditative time we were fairly warm and only slowly getting hungry and except that my uncle grumbled a little and produced some philosophical reflections and began to fuss about having a temperature we talked very little i was tired and sulky and chiefly worried about the engine i had to resist a tendency to crawl back and look at it i did not care to risk contracting our gas chamber for fear of losing gas nothing was less like a fight i know that in popular magazines and so forth all such occasions as this are depicted in terms of hysteria captains save their ships engineers complete their bridges generals conduct their battles in a state of dancing excitement foaming recondite technicalities at the lips i suppose that sort of thing works up the reader but so far as it professes to represent reality i am convinced it is all childish nonsense schoolboys of fifteen girls of eighteen and literary men all their lives may have these squealing fits but my own experience is that most exciting scenes are not exciting and most of the urgent moments in life are met by steadyheaded men  neither i nor my uncle spent the night in ejaculations nor in humorous allusions nor any of these things we remained lumpish  my uncle stuck in his place and grumbled about his stomach and occasionally rambled off into expositions of his financial position and denunciations of nealhe certainly struck out one or two good phrases for nealand i crawled about at rare intervals in a vague sort of way and grunted and our basketwork creaked continually and the wind on our quarter made a sort of ruffled flapping in the wall of the gas chamber for all our wraps we got frightfully cold as the night wore on  i must have dozed and it was still dark when i realised with a start that we were nearly due south of and a long way from a regularlyflashing lighthouse standing out before the glow of some great town and then that the thing that had awakened me was the cessation of our engine and that we were driving back to the west  then indeed for a time i felt the grim thrill of life i crawled forward to the cords of the release valves made my uncle crawl forward too and let out the gas until we were falling down through the air like a clumsy glider towards the vague greyness that was land  something must have intervened here that i have forgotten  i saw the lights of bordeaux when it was quite dark a nebulous haze against black of that i am reasonably sure but certainly our fall took place in the cold uncertain light of early dawn i am at least equally sure of that and mimizan near where we dropped is fifty miles from bordeaux whose harbour lights i must have seen  i remember coming down at last with a curious indifference and actually rousing myself to steer but the actual coming to earth was exciting enough i remember our prolonged dragging landfall and the difficulty i had to get clear and how a gust of wind caught lord roberts b as my uncle stumbled away from the ropes and litter and dropped me heavily and threw me on to my knees then came the realisation that the monster was almost consciously disentangling itself for escape and then the light leap of its rebound the rope slipped out of reach of my hand i remember running kneedeep in a salt pool in hopeless pursuit of the airship  as it dragged and rose seaward and how only after it had escaped my uttermost effort to recapture it did i realise that this was quite the best thing that could have happened it drove swiftly over the sandy dunes lifting and falling and was hidden by a clump of windbitten trees then it reappeared much further off and still receding it soared for a time and sank slowly and after that i saw it no more i suppose it fell into the sea and got wetted with salt water and heavy and so became deflated and sank  it was never found and there was never a report of anyone seeing it after it escaped from me  vi  but if i find it hard to tell the story of our long flight through the air overseas at least that dawn in france stands cold and clear and full i see again almost as if i saw once more with my bodily eyes the ridges of sand rising behind ridges of sand grey and cold and blackbrowed with an insufficient grass i feel again the clear cold chill of dawn and hear the distant barking of a dog i find myself asking again what shall we do now and trying to scheme with brain tired beyond measure  at first my uncle occupied my attention he was shivering a good deal and it was all i could do to resist my desire to get him into a comfortable bed at once but i wanted to appear plausibly in this part of the world i felt it would not do to turn up anywhere at dawn and rest it would be altogether too conspicuous we must rest until the day was well advanced and then appear as roadstained pedestrians seeking a meal i gave him most of what was left of the biscuits emptied our flasks and advised him to sleep but at first it was too cold albeit i wrapped the big fur rug around him  i was struck now by the flushed weariness of his face and the look of age the grey stubble on his unshaved chin gave him he sat crumpled up shivering and coughing munching reluctantly but drinking eagerly and whimpering a little a dreadfully pitiful figure to me but we had to go through with it there was no way out for us  presently the sun rose over the pines and the sand grew rapidly warm my uncle had done eating and sat with his wrists resting on his knees the most hopeless looking of lost souls  im ill he said im damnably ill i can feel it in my skin  thenit was horrible to mehe cried i ought to be in bed i ought to be in bed instead of flying about and suddenly he burst into tears  i stood up go to sleep man i said and took the rug from him and spread it out and rolled him up in it  its all very well he protested im not young enough  lift up your head i interrupted and put his knapsack under it  theyll catch us here just as much as in an inn he grumbled and then lay still  presently after a long time i perceived he was asleep his breath came with peculiar wheezings and every now and again he would cough i was very stiff and tired myself and perhaps i dozed i dont remember i remember only sitting as it seemed nigh interminably beside him too weary even to think in that sandy desolation  no one came near us no creature not even a dog i roused myself at last feeling that it was vain to seek to seem other than abnormal and with an effort that was like lifting a sky of lead we made our way through the wearisome sand to a farmhouse there i feigned even a more insufficient french than i possess naturally and let it appear that we were pedestrians from biarritz who had lost our way along the shore and got benighted  this explained us pretty well i thought and we got most heartening coffee and a cart to a little roadside station my uncle grew more and more manifestly ill with every stage of our journey i got him to bayonne where he refused at first to eat and was afterwards very sick and then took him shivering and collapsed up a little branch line to a frontier place called luzon gare  we found one homely inn with two small bedrooms kept by a kindly basque woman i got him to bed and that night shared his room and after an hour or so of sleep he woke up in a raging fever and with a wandering mind cursing neal and repeating long inaccurate lists of figures he was manifestly a case for a doctor and in the morning we got one in he was a young man from montpelier just beginning to practise and very mysterious and technical and modern and unhelpful he spoke of cold and exposure and la grippe and pneumonia he gave many explicit and difficult directions i perceived it devolved upon me to organise nursing and a sickroom i installed a religieuse in the second bedroom of the inn and took a room for myself in the inn of port de luzon a quarter of a mile away  vii  and now my story converges on what in that queer corner of refuge out of the world was destined to be my uncles deathbed there is a background of the pyrenees of blue hills and sunlit houses of the old castle of luzon and a noisy cascading river and for a foreground the dim stuffy room whose windows both the religieuse and hostess conspired to shut with its waxed floor its fourposter bed its characteristically french chairs and fireplace its champagne bottles and dirty basins and used towels and packets of somatose on the table and in the sickly air of the confined space in behind the curtains of the bed lay my little uncle with an effect of being enthroned and secluded or sat up or writhed and tossed in his last dealings of life one went and drew back the edge of the curtains if one wanted to speak to him or look at him  usually he was propped up against pillows because so he breathed more easily he slept hardly at all  i have a confused memory of vigils and mornings and afternoons spent by that bedside and how the religieuse hovered about me and how meek and good and inefficient she was and how horribly black were her nails other figures come and go and particularly the doctor a young man plumply rococo in bicycling dress with fine waxen features a little pointed beard and the long black frizzy hair and huge tie of a minor poet bright and clearcut and irrelevant are memories of the basque hostess of my uncles inn and of the family of spanish people who entertained me and prepared the most amazingly elaborate meals for me with soup and salad and chicken and remarkable sweets they were all very kind and sympathetic people systematically so and constantly without attracting attention i was trying to get newspapers from home  my uncle is central to all these impressions  i have tried to make you picture him time after time as the young man of the wimblehurst chemists shop as the shabby assistant in tottenham court road as the adventurer of the early days of tonobungay as the confident preposterous plutocrat and now i have to tell of him strangely changed under the shadow of oncoming death with his skin lax and yellow and glistening with sweat his eyes large and glassy his countenance unfamiliar through the growth of a beard his nose pinched and thin never had he looked so small as now and he talked to me in a whispering strained voice of great issues of why his life had been and whither he was going poor little man that last phase is as it were disconnected from all the other phases it was as if he crawled out from the ruins of his career and looked about him before he died for he had quite clearminded states in the intervals of his delirium  he knew he was almost certainly dying in a way that took the burthen of his cares off his mind there was no more neal to face no more flights or evasions no punishments  it has been a great career george he said but i shall be glad to rest glad to rest glad to rest  his mind ran rather upon his career and usually i am glad to recall with a note of satisfaction and approval in his delirious phases he would most often exaggerate this selfsatisfaction and talk of his splendours he would pluck at the sheet and stare before him and whisper halfaudible fragments of sentences  what is this great place these cloudcapped towers these any pinnacles ilion skypointing ilion house the residence of one of our great merchant princes terrace above terrace reaching to the heavens kingdoms caesar never knew a great poet george zzzz kingdoms caesar never knew under entirely new management  greatnessmillions universities he stands on the terraceon the upper terracedirectingdirectingby the globedirectingthe trade  it was hard at times to tell when his sane talk ceased and his delirium began the secret springs of his life the vain imaginations were revealed i sometimes think that all the life of man sprawls abed careless and unkempt until it must needs clothe and wash itself and come forth seemly in act and speech for the encounter with ones fellowmen i suspect that all things unspoken in our souls partake somewhat of the laxity of delirium and dementia certainly from those slimy tormented lips above the bristling grey beard came nothing but dreams and disconnected fancies  sometimes he raved about neal threatened neal what has he got invested he said does he think he can escape me if i followed him up ruin ruin one would think i had taken his money  and sometimes he reverted to our airship flight its too long george too long and too cold im too old a mantoo oldfor this sort of thing you know youre not savingyoure killing me  towards the end it became evident our identity was discovered i found the press and especially booms section of it had made a sort of hue and cry for us sent special commissioners to hunt for us and though none of these emissaries reached us until my uncle was dead one felt the forewash of that storm of energy the thing got into the popular french press people became curious in their manner towards us and a number of fresh faces appeared about the weak little struggle that went on in the closeness behind the curtains of the bed the young doctor insisted on consultations and a motorcar came up from biarritz and suddenly odd people with questioning eyes began to poke in with inquiries and help though nothing was said i could feel that we were no longer regarded as simple middleclass tourists about me as i went i perceived almost as though it trailed visibly the prestige of finance and a criminal notoriety local personages of a plump and prosperous quality appeared in the inn making inquiries the luzon priest became helpful people watched our window and stared at me as i went to and fro and then we had a raid from a little english clergyman and his amiable capable wife in severely anglican blacks who swooped down upon us like virtuous but resolute vultures from the adjacent village of saint jean de pollack  the clergyman was one of those odd types that oscillate between remote country towns in england and the conduct of english church services on mutual terms in enterprising hotels abroad a tremulous obstinate little being with sporadic hairs upon his face spectacles a red button nose and aged black raiment he was evidently enormously impressed by my uncles monetary greatness and by his own inkling of our identity and he shone and brimmed over with tact and fussy helpfulness he was eager to share the watching of the bedside with me he proffered services with both hands and as i was now getting into touch with affairs in london again and trying to disentangle the gigantic details of the smash from the papers i had succeeded in getting from biarritz i accepted his offers pretty generously and began the studies in modern finance that lay before me i had got so out of touch with the old traditions of religion that i overlooked the manifest possibility of his attacking my poor sinking vestiges of an uncle with theological solicitudes my attention was called to that however very speedily by a polite but urgent quarrel between himself and the basque landlady as to the necessity of her hanging a cheap crucifix in the shadow over the bed where it might catch my uncles eye where indeed i found it had caught his eye  good lord i cried is that still going on  that night the little clergyman watched and in the small hours he raised a false alarm that my uncle was dying and made an extraordinary fuss he raised the house i shall never forget that scene i think which began with a tapping at my bedroom door just after i had fallen asleep and his voice  if you want to see your uncle before he goes you must come now  the stuffy little room was crowded when i reached it and lit by three flickering candles i felt i was back in the eighteenth century there lay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes weary of life beyond measure weary and rambling and the little clergyman trying to hold his hand and his attention and repeating over and over again  mr ponderevo mr ponderevo it is all right it is all right  only believe believe on me and ye shall be saved  close at hand was the doctor with one of those cruel and idiotic injection needles modern science puts in the hands of these halfeducated young men keeping my uncle flickeringly alive for no reason whatever the religieuse hovered sleepily in the background with an overdue and neglected dose in addition the landlady had not only got up herself but roused an aged crone of a mother and a partially imbecile husband and there was also a fattish stolid man in grey alpaca with an air of importancewho he was and how he got there i dont know i rather fancy the doctor explained him to me in french i did not understand and they were all there wearily nocturnal hastily and carelessly dressed intent upon the life that flickered and sank making a public and curious show of its going queer shapes of human beings lit by three uncertain candles and every soul of them keenly and avidly resolved to be in at the death the doctor stood the others were all sitting on chairs the landlady had brought in and arranged for them  and my uncle spoilt the climax and did not die  i replaced the little clergyman on the chair by the bedside and he hovered about the room  i think he whispered to me mysteriously as he gave place to me i believeit is well with him  i heard him trying to render the stock phrases of low church piety into french for the benefit of the stolid man in grey alpaca then he knocked a glass off the table and scrabbled for the fragments from the first i doubted the theory of an immediate death i consulted the doctor in urgent whispers i turned round to get champagne and nearly fell over the clergymans legs he was on his knees at the additional chair the basque landlady had got on my arrival and he was praying aloud oh heavenly father have mercy on this thy child i hustled him up and out of the way and in another minute he was down at another chair praying again and barring the path of the religieuse who had found me the corkscrew something put into my head that tremendous blasphemy of carlyles about the last mew of a drowning kitten he found a third chair vacant presently it was as if he was playing a game  good heavens i said we must clear these people out and with a certain urgency i did  i had a temporary lapse of memory and forgot all my french i drove them out mainly by gesture and opened the window to the universal horror i intimated the death scene was postponed and as a matter of fact my uncle did not die until the next night  i did not let the little clergyman come near him again and i was watchful for any sign that his mind had been troubled but he made none he talked once about that parson chap  didnt bother you i asked  wanted something he said  i kept silence listening keenly to his mutterings i understood him to say they wanted too much his face puckered like a childs going to cry you cant get a safe six per cent he said i had for a moment a wild suspicion that those urgent talks had not been altogether spiritual but that i think was a quite unworthy and unjust suspicion the little clergyman was as simple and honest as the day my uncle was simply generalising about his class  but it may have been these talks that set loose some long dormant string of ideas in my uncles brain ideas the things of this world had long suppressed and hidden altogether near the end he suddenly became clearminded and lucid albeit very weak and his voice was little but clear  george he said  im here i said close beside you  george you have always been responsible for the science george you know better than i do isis it proved  what proved  either way  i dont understand  death ends all after so muchsuch splendid beginnins somewhere something  i stared at him amazed his sunken eyes were very grave  what do you expect i said in wonder  he would not answer aspirations he whispered he fell into a broken monologue regardless of me trailing clouds of glory he said and firstrate poet firstrategeorge was always hard always  for a long time there was silence  then he made a gesture that he wished to speak  seems to me george  i bent my head down and he tried to lift his hand to my shoulder i raised him a little on his pillows and listened  it seems to me george alwaysthere must be something in methat wont die  he looked at me as though the decision rested with me  i think he said something  then for a moment his mind wandered just a little link he whispered almost pleadingly and lay quite still but presently he was uneasy again  some other world  perhaps i said who knows  some other world  not the same scope for enterprise i said  no  he became silent i sat leaning down to him and following out my own thoughts and presently the religieuse resumed her periodic conflict with the window fastening for a time he struggled for breath it seemed such nonsense that he should have to suffer sopoor silly little man  george he whispered and his weak little hand came out perhaps  he said no more but i perceived from the expression of his eyes that he thought the question had been put  yes i think so i said stoutly  arent you sure  ohpractically sure said i and i think he tried to squeeze my hand and there i sat holding his hand tight and trying to think what seeds of immortality could be found in all his being what sort of ghost there was in him to wander out into the bleak immensities queer fancies came to me he lay still for a long time save for a brief struggle or so for breath and ever and again i wiped his mouth and lips  i fell into a pit of thought i did not remark at first the change that was creeping over his face he lay back on his pillow made a faint zzzing sound that ceased and presently and quite quietly he diedgreatly comforted by my assurance i do not know when he died his hand relaxed insensibly suddenly with a start with a shock i found that his mouth had fallen open and that he was dead  viii  it was dark night when i left his deathbed and went back to my own inn down the straggling street of luzon  that return to my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart as an experience apart within was a subdued bustle of women a flitting of lights and the doing of petty offices to that queer exhausted thing that had once been my active and urgent little uncle for me those offices were irksome and impertinent i slammed the door and went out into the warm foggy drizzle of the village street lit by blurred specks of light in great voids of darkness and never a soul abroad that warm veil of fog produced an effect of vast seclusion the very houses by the roadside peered through it as if from another world the stillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying of dogs all these people kept dogs because of the near neighbourhood of the frontier  death  it was one of those rare seasons of relief when for a little time one walks a little outside of and beside life i felt as i sometimes feel after the end of a play i saw the whole business of my uncles life as something familiar and completed it was done like a play one leaves like a book one closes i thought of the push and the promotions the noise of london the crowded various company of people through which our lives had gone the public meetings the excitements the dinners and disputations and suddenly it appeared to me that none of these things existed  it came to me like a discovery that none of these things existed  before and after i have thought and called life a phantasmagoria but never have i felt its truth as i did that night we had parted we two who had kept company so long had parted but there was i knew no end to him or me he had died a dream death and ended a dream his pain dream was over it seemed to me almost as though i had died too what did it matter since it was unreality all of it the pain and desire the beginning and the end there was no reality except this solitary road this quite solitary road along which one went rather puzzled rather tired  part of the fog became a big mastiff that came towards me and stopped and slunk round me growling barked gruffly and shortly and presently became fog again  my mind swayed back to the ancient beliefs and fears of our race  my doubts and disbeliefs slipped from me like a loosely fitting garment i wondered quite simply what dogs bayed about the path of that other walker in the darkness what shapes what lights it might be loomed about him as he went his way from our last encounter on earthalong the paths that are real and the way that endures for ever  ix  last belated figure in that grouping round my uncles deathbed is my aunt when it was beyond all hope that my uncle could live i threw aside whatever concealment remained to us and telegraphed directly to her but she came too late to see him living she saw him calm and still strangely unlike his habitual garrulous animation an unfamiliar inflexibility  it isnt like him she whispered awed by this alien dignity  i remember her chiefly as she talked and wept upon the bridge below the old castle we had got rid of some amateurish reporters from biarritz and had walked together in the hot morning sunshine down through port luzon there for a time we stood leaning on the parapet of the bridge and surveying the distant peeks the rich blue masses of the pyrenees for a long time we said nothing and then she began talking  lifes a rum go george she began who would have thought when i used to darn your stockings at old wimblehurst that this would be the end of the story it seems far away nowthat little shop his and my first home the glow of the bottles the big coloured bottles do you remember how the light shone on the mahogany drawers the little gilt letters ol amjig and snap i can remember it allbright and shininglike a dutch picture real and yesterday and here we are in a dream you a manand me an old woman george and poor little teddy who used to rush about and talkmaking that noise he didoh  she choked and the tears flowed unrestrained she wept and i was glad to see her weeping  she stood leaning over the bridge her tearwet handkerchief gripped in her clenched hand  just an hour in the old shop againand him talking before things got done before they got hold of him and fooled him  men oughtnt to be so tempted with business and things  they didnt hurt him george she asked suddenly  for a moment i was puzzled  here i mean she said  no i lied stoutly suppressing the memory of that foolish injection needle i had caught the young doctor using  i wonder george if theyll let him talk in heaven  she faced me oh george dear my heart aches and i dont know what i say and do give me your arm to lean onits good to have you dear and lean upon you yes i know you care for me thats why im talking weve always loved one another and never said anything about it and you understand and i understand but my hearts torn to pieces by this torn to rags and things drop out ive kept in it its true he wasnt a husband much for me at the last but he was my child george he was my child and all my children my silly child and life has knocked him about for me and ive never had a say in the matter never a say its puffed him up and smashed himlike an old bagunder my eyes i was clever enough to see it and not clever enough to prevent it and all i could do was to jeer ive had to make what i could of it like most people like most of us but it wasnt fair george it wasnt fair life and deathgreat serious thingswhy couldnt they leave him alone and his lies and ways if we could see the lightness of it  why couldnt they leave him alone she repeated in a whisper as we went towards the inn   chapter the second  love among the wreckage  i  when i came back i found that my share in the escape and death of my uncle had made me for a time a notorious and even popular character for two weeks i was kept in london facing the music as he would have said and making things easy for my aunt and i still marvel at the consideration with which the world treated me for now it was open and manifest that i and my uncle were no more than specimens of a modern species of brigand wasting the savings of the public out of the sheer wantonness of enterprise i think that in a way his death produced a reaction in my favour and my flight of which some particulars now appeared stuck in the popular imagination it seemed a more daring and difficult feat than it was and i couldnt very well write to the papers to sustain my private estimate there can be little doubt that men infinitely prefer the appearance of dash and enterprise to simple honesty no one believed i was not an arch plotter in his financing yet they favoured me i even got permission from the trustee to occupy my chalet for a fortnight while i cleared up the mass of papers calculations notes of work drawings and the like that i left in disorder when i started on that impulsive raid upon the mordet quap heaps  i was there alone i got work for cothope with the ilchesters for whom i now build these destroyers they wanted him at once and he was short of money so i let him go and managed very philosophically by myself  but i found it hard to fix my attention on aeronautics i had been away from the work for a full halfyear and more a halfyear crowded with intense disconcerting things for a time my brain refused these fine problems of balance and adjustment altogether it wanted to think about my uncles dropping jaw my aunts reluctant tears about dead negroes and pestilential swamps about the evident realities of cruelty and pain about life and death moreover it was weary with the frightful pile of figures and documents at the hardingham a task to which this raid to lady grove was simply an interlude and there was beatrice  on the second morning as i sat out upon the veranda recalling memories and striving in vain to attend to some too succinct pencil notes of cothopes beatrice rode up suddenly from behind the pavilion and pulled rein and became still beatrice a little flushed from riding and sitting on a big black horse  i did not instantly rise i stared at her you i said  she looked at me steadily me she said  i did not trouble about any civilities i stood up and asked point blank a question that came into my head  whose horse is that i said  she looked me in the eyes carnabys she answered  how did you get herethis way  the walls down  down already  a great bit of it between the plantations  and you rode through and got here by chance  i saw you yesterday and i rode over to see you i had now come close to her and stood looking up into her face  im a mere vestige i said  she made no answer but remained regarding me steadfastly with a curious air of proprietorship  you know im the living survivor now of the great smash im rolling and dropping down through all the scaffolding of the social system its all a chance whether i roll out free at the bottom or go down a crack into the darkness out of sight for a year or two  the sun she remarked irrelevantly has burnt you im getting down  she swung herself down into my arms and stood beside me face to face  wheres cothope she asked  gone  her eyes flitted to the pavilion and back to me we stood close together extraordinarily intimate and extraordinarily apart  ive never seen this cottage of yours she said and i want to  she flung the bridle of her horse round the veranda post and i helped her tie it  did you get what you went for to africa she asked  no i said i lost my ship  and that lost everything  everything  she walked before me into the livingroom of the chalet and i saw that she gripped her ridingwhip very tightly in her hand she looked about her for a momentand then at me  its comfortable she remarked  our eyes met in a conversation very different from the one upon our lips a sombre glow surrounded us drew us together an unwonted shyness kept us apart she roused herself after an instants pause to examine my furniture  you have chintz curtains i thought men were too feckless to have curtains without a woman but of course your aunt did that and a couch and a brass fender andis that a pianola that is your desk i thought mens desks were always untidy and covered with dust and tobacco ash  she flitted to my colour prints and my little case of books then she went to the pianola i watched her intently  does this thing play she said  what i asked  does this thing play  i roused myself from my preoccupation  like a musical gorilla with fingers all of one length and a sort of soul its all the world of music to me  what do you play  beethoven when i want to clear up my head while im working he ishow one would always like to work sometimes chopin and those others but beethoven beethoven mainly yes  silence again between us she spoke with an effort  play me something she turned from me and explored the rack of music rolls became interested and took a piece the first part of the kreutzer sonata hesitated no she said that  she gave me brahms second concerto op 58 and curled up on the sofa watching me as i set myself slowly to play  i say he said when i had done thats fine i didnt know those things could play like that im all astir  she came and stood over me looking at me im going to have a concert she said abruptly and laughed uneasily and hovered at the pigeonholes nownow what shall i have she chose more of brahms then we came to the kreutzer sonata it is queer how tolstoy has loaded that with suggestions debauched it made it a scandalous and intimate symbol when i had played the first part of that she came up to the pianola and hesitated over me i sat stifflywaiting  suddenly she seized my downcast head and kissed my hair she caught at my face between her hands and kissed my lips i put my arms about her and we kissed together i sprang to my feet and clasped her  beatrice i said beatrice  my dear she whispered nearly breathless with her arms about me oh my dear  ii  love like everything else in this immense process of social disorganisation in which we live is a thing adrift a fruitless thing broken away from its connexions i tell of this love affair here because of its irrelevance because it is so remarkable that it should mean nothing and be nothing except itself it glows in my memory like some bright casual flower starting up amidst the debris of a catastrophe for nearly a fortnight we two met and made love together once more this mighty passion that our aimless civilisation has fettered and maimed and sterilised and debased gripped me and filled me with passionate delights and solemn joysthat were all you know futile and purposeless once more i had the persuasion this matters nothing else matters so much as this we were both infinitely grave in such happiness as we had i do not remember any laughter at all between us  twelve days it lasted from that encounter in my chalet until our parting  except at the end they were days of supreme summer and there was a waxing moon we met recklessly day by day we were so intent upon each other at first so intent upon expressing ourselves to each other and getting at each other that we troubled very little about the appearance of our relationship we met almost openly we talked of ten thousand things and of ourselves we loved we made love there is no prose of mine that can tell of hours transfigured the facts are nothing everything we touched the meanest things became glorious how can i render bare tenderness and delight and mutual possession i sit here at my desk thinking of untellable things  i have come to know so much of love that i know now what love might be we loved scarred and stained we partedbasely and inevitably but at least i met love  i remember as we sat in a canadian canoe in a reedy bushmasked shallow we had discovered operating out of that pineshaded woking canal how she fell talking of the things that happened to her before she met me again  she told me things and they so joined and welded together other things that lay disconnected in my memory that it seemed to me i had always known what she told me and yet indeed i had not known nor suspected it save perhaps for a luminous transitory suspicion ever and again  she made me see how life had shaped her she told me of her girlhood after i had known her we were poor and pretending and managing we hacked about on visits and things i ought to have married the chances i had werent particularly good chances i didnt like em  she paused then carnaby came along  i remained quite still she spoke now with downcast eyes and one finger just touching the water  one gets bored bored beyond redemption one does about to these huge expensive houses i supposethe scales immense one makes ones self useful to the other women and agreeable to the men one has to dress one has food and exercise and leisure its the leisure and the space and the blank opportunity it seems a sin not to fill carnaby isnt like the other men hes bigger they go about making love everybodys making love i did and i dont do things by halves  she stopped  you knewshe asked looking up quite steadily i nodded  since when  those last days it hasnt seemed to matter really i was a little surprised  she looked at me quietly cothope knew she said by instinct i could feel it  i suppose i began once this would have mattered immensely now  nothing matters she said completing me i felt i had to tell you i wanted you to understand why i didnt marry youwith both hands i have loved youshe pausedhave loved you ever since the day i kissed you in the bracken onlyi forgot  and suddenly she dropped her face upon her hands and sobbed passionately  i forgoti forgot she cried and became still  i dabbled my paddle in the water look here i said forget again here am ia ruined man marry me  she shook her head without looking up  we were still for a long time marry me i whispered  she looked up twined back a whisp of hair and answered dispassionately  i wish i could anyhow we have had this time it has been a fine timehas it beenfor you also i havent nudged you all i had to give its a poor giftexcept for what it means and might have been but we are near the end of it now  why i asked marry me why should we two  you think she said i could take courage and come to you and be your everyday wifewhile you work and are poor  why not said i  she looked at me gravely with extended finger do you really think thatof me havent you seen meall  i hesitated  never once have i really meant marrying you she insisted never once i fell in love with you from the first but when you seemed a successful man i told myself i wouldnt i was lovesick for you and you were so stupid i came near it then but i knew i wasnt good enough what could i have been to you a woman with bad habits and bad associations a woman smirched and what could i do for you or be to you if i wasnt good enough to be a rich mans wife im certainly not good enough to be a poor ones forgive me for talking sense to you now but i wanted to tell you this somehow  she stopped at my gesture i sat up and the canoe rocked with my movement  i dont care i said i want to marry you and make you my wife  no she said dont spoil things that is impossible  impossible  think i cant do my own hair do you mean you will get me a maid  good god i cried disconcerted beyond measure wont you learn to do your own hair for me do you mean to say you can love a man  she flung out her hands at me dont spoil it she cried i have given you all i have i have given you all i can if i could do it if i was good enough to do it i would but i am a woman spoilt and ruined dear and you are a ruined man when we are making love were loversbut think of the gulf between us in habits and ways of thought in will and training when we are not making love think of itand dont think of it dont think of it yet we have snatched some hours we still may have some hours  she suddenly knelt forward toward me with a glowing darkness in her eyes who cares if it upsets she cried if you say another word i will kiss you and go to the bottom clutching you  im not afraid of that im not a bit afraid of that ill die with you choose a death and ill die with youreadily do listen to me i love you i shall always love you its because i love you that i wont go down to become a dirty familiar thing with you amidst the grime ive given all i can ive had all i can tell me and she crept nearer have i been like the dusk to you like the warm dusk is there magic still listen to the ripple of water from your paddle look at the warm evening light in the sky who cares if the canoe upsets come nearer to me oh my love come near so  she drew me to her and our lips met  iii  i asked her to marry me once again  it was our last morning together and we had met very early about sunrise knowing that we were to part no sun shone that day the sky was overcast the morning chilly and lit by a clear cold spiritless light a heavy dampness in the air verged close on rain when i think of that morning it has always the quality of greying ashes wet with rain  beatrice too had changed the spring had gone out of her movement it came to me for the first time that some day she might grow old she had become one flesh with the rest of common humanity the softness had gone from her voice and manner the dusky magic of her presence had gone i saw these things with perfect clearness and they made me sorry for them and for her but they altered my love not a whit abated it nothing and when we had talked awkwardly for half a dozen sentences i came dully to my point  and now i cried will you marry me  no she said i shall keep to my life here  i asked her to marry me in a years time she shook her head  this world is a soft world i said in spite of my present disasters i know now how to do things if i had you to work forin a year i could be a prosperous man  no she said i will put it brutally i shall go back to carnaby  but i did not feel angry i had no sort of jealousy no wounded pride no sense of injury i had only a sense of grey desolation of hopeless crosspurposes  look here she said i have been awake all night and every night i have been thinking of thisevery moment when we have not been together im not answering you on an impulse i love you i love you ill say that over ten thousand times but here we are  the rest of life together i said  it wouldnt be together now we are together now we have been together we are full of memories i do not feel i can ever forget a single one  nor i  and i want to close it and leave it at that you see dear what else is there to do  she turned her white face to me all i know of love all i have ever dreamt or learnt of love i have packed into these days for you you think we might live together and go on loving no for you i will have no vain repetitions you have had the best and all of me would you have us after this meet again in london or paris or somewhere scuffle to some wretched dressmakers meet in a cabinet particulier  no i said i want you to marry me i want you to play the game of life with me as an honest woman should come and live with me be my wife and squaw bear me children  i looked at her white drawn face and it seemed to me i might carry her yet i spluttered for words  my god beatrice i cried but this is cowardice and folly are you afraid of life you of all people what does it matter what has been or what we were here we are with the world before us start clean and new with me well fight it through im not such a simple lover that ill not tell you plainly when you go wrong and fight our difference out with you its the one thing i want the one thing i needto have you and more of you and more this lovemakingits lovemaking its just a part of us an incident  she shook her head and stopped me abruptly its all she said  all i protested  im wiser than you wiser beyond words she turned her eyes to me and they shone with tears  i wouldnt have you say anythingbut what youre saying she said but its nonsense dear you know its nonsense as you say it  i tried to keep up the heroic note but she would not listen to it  its no good she cried almost petulantly this little world has made us what we are dont you seedont you see what i am i can make love i can make love and be loved prettily dear dont blame me i have given you all i have if i had anything morei have gone through it all over and over againthought it out this morning my head aches my eyes ache  the light has gone out of me and i am a sick and tired woman but im talking wisdombitter wisdom i couldnt be any sort of helper to you any sort of wife any sort of mother im spoilt  im spoilt by this rich idle way of living until every habit is wrong every taste wrong the world is wrong people can be ruined by wealth just as much as by poverty do you think i wouldnt face life with you if i could if i wasnt absolutely certain i should be down and dragging in the first halfmile of the journey here i amdamned damned but i wont damn you you know what i am you know you are too clear and simple not to know the truth you try to romance and hector but you know the truth i am a little cadsold and done im my dear you think ive been misbehaving but all these days ive been on my best behaviour you dont understand because youre a man  a woman when shes spoilt is spoilt shes dirty in grain shes done  she walked on weeping  youre a fool to want me she said youre a fool to want mefor my sake just as much as yours weve done all we can its just romancing  she dashed the tears from her eyes and turned upon me dont you understand she challenged dont you know  we faced one another in silence for a moment  yes i said i know  for a long time we spoke never a word but walked on together slowly and sorrowfully reluctant to turn about towards our parting when at last we did she broke silence again  ive had you she said  heaven and hell i said cant alter that  ive wanted she went on ive talked to you in the nights and made up speeches now when i want to make them im tonguetied but to me its just as if the moments we have had lasted for ever moods and states come and go today my light is out  to this day i cannot determine whether she said or whether i imagined she said chloral perhaps a halfconscious diagnosis flashed it on my brain perhaps i am the victim of some perverse imaginative freak of memory some hinted possibility that scratched and seared there the word stands in my memory as if it were written in fire  we came to the door of lady ospreys garden at last and it was beginning to drizzle  she held out her hands and i took them  yours she said in a weary unimpassioned voice all that i hadsuch as it was will you forget  never i answered  never a touch or a word of it  no  you will she said  we looked at one another in silence and her face full of fatigue and misery  what could i do what was there to do  i wish i said and stopped  goodbye  iv  that should have been the last i saw of her but indeed i was destined to see her once again two days after i was at lady grove i forget altogether upon what errand and as i walked back to the station believing her to be gone away she came upon me and she was riding with carnaby just as i had seen them first the encounter jumped upon us unprepared she rode by her eyes dark in her white face and scarcely noticed me she winced and grew stiff at the sight of me and bowed her head but carnaby because he thought i was a broken and discomfited man saluted me with an easy friendliness and shouted some genial commonplace to me  they passed out of sight and left me by the roadside  and then indeed i tasted the ultimate bitterness of life for the first time i felt utter futility and was wrung by emotion that begot no action by shame and pity beyond words i had parted from her dully and i had seen my uncle break and die with dry eyes and a steady mind but this chance sight of my lost beatrice brought me to tears my face was wrung and tears came pouring down my cheeks all the magic she had for me had changed to wild sorrow oh god i cried this is too much and turned my face after her and made appealing gestures to the beech trees and cursed at fate i wanted to do preposterous things to pursue her to save her to turn life back so that she might begin again i wonder what would have happened had i overtaken them in pursuit breathless with running uttering incoherent words weeping expostulatory i came near to doing that  there was nothing in earth or heaven to respect my curses or weeping in the midst of it a man who had been trimming the opposite hedge appeared and stared at me  abruptly ridiculously i dissembled before him and went on and caught my train  but the pain i felt then i have felt a hundred times it is with me as i write it haunts this book i see that is what haunts this book from end to end   chapter the third  night and the open sea  i  i have tried throughout all this story to tell things as they happened to me in the beginningthe sheets are still here on the table grimy and dogseared and oldlookingi said i wanted to tell myself and the world in which i found myself and i have done my best but whether i have succeeded i cannot imagine all this writing is grey now and dead and trite and unmeaning to me some of it i know by heart i am the last person to judge it  as i turn over the big pile of manuscript before me certain things become clearer to me and particularly the immense inconsequences of my experiences it is i see now that i have it all before me a story of activity and urgency and sterility i have called it tonobungay but i had far better have called it waste i have told of childless marion of my childless aunt of beatrice wasted and wasteful and futile what hope is there for a people whose women become fruitless i think of all the energy i have given to vain things i think of my industrious scheming with my uncle of crest hills vast cessation of his resonant strenuous career ten thousand men have envied him and wished to live as he lived it is all one spectacle of forces running to waste of people who use and do not replace the story of a country hectic with a wasting aimless fever of trade and moneymaking and pleasureseeking and now i build destroyers  other people may see this country in other terms this is how i have seen it in some early chapter in this heap i compared all our present colour and abundance to october foliage before the frosts nip down the leaves that i still feel was a good image perhaps i see wrongly it may be i see decay all about me because i am in a sense decay to others it may be a scene of achievement and construction radiant with hope i too have a sort of hope but it is a remote hope a hope that finds no promise in this empire or in any of the great things of our time  how they will look in history i do not know how time and chance will prove them i cannot guess that is how they have mirrored themselves on one contemporary mind  ii  concurrently with writing the last chapter of this book i have been much engaged by the affairs of a new destroyer we have completed it has been an oddly complementary alternation of occupations three weeks or so ago this novel had to be put aside in order that i might give all my time day and night to the fitting and finishing of the engines last thursday x 2 for so we call her was done and i took her down the thames and went out nearly to texel for a trial of speed  it is curious how at times ones impressions will all fuse and run together into a sort of unity and become continuous with things that have hitherto been utterly alien and remote that rush down the river became mysteriously connected with this book  as i passed down the thames i seemed in a new and parallel manner to be passing all england in review i saw it then as i had wanted my readers to see it the thought came to me slowly as i picked my way through the pool it stood out clear as i went dreaming into the night out upon the wide north sea  it wasnt so much thinking at the time as a sort of photographic thought that came and grew clear x2 went ripping through the dirty oily water as scissors rip through canvas and the front of my mind was all intent with getting her through under the bridges and in and out among the steamboats and barges and rowingboats and piers i lived with my hands and eyes hard ahead i thought nothing then of any appearances but obstacles but for all that the back of my mind took the photographic memory of it complete and vivid  this it came to me is england that is what i wanted to give in my book this  we started in the late afternoon we throbbed out of our yard above hammersmith bridge fussed about for a moment and headed down stream we came at an easy rush down craven reach past fulham and hurlingham past the long stretches of muddy meadow and muddy suburb to battersea and chelsea round the cape of tidy frontage that is grosvenor road and under vauxhall bridge and westminster opened before us we cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the october sunshine stood the parliament houses and the flag was flying and parliament was sitting  i saw it at the time unseeingly afterwards it came into my mind as the centre of the whole broad panoramic effect of that afternoon the stiff square lace of victorian gothic with its dutch clock of a tower came upon me suddenly and stared and whirled past in a slow half pirouette and became still i know behind me as if watching me recede arent you going to respect me then it seemed to say  not i there in that great pile of victorian architecture the landlords and the lawyers the bishops the railway men and the magnates of commerce go to and froin their incurable tradition of commercialised bladesovery of meretricious gentry and nobility sold for riches i have been near enough to know the irish and the labourmen run about among their feet making a fuss effecting little theyve got no better plans that i can see respect it indeed theres a certain paraphernalia of dignity but whom does it deceive the king comes down in a gilt coach to open the show and wears long robes and a crown and theres a display of stout and slender legs in white stockings and stout and slender legs in black stockings and artful old gentlemen in ermine i was reminded of one congested afternoon i had spent with my aunt amidst a cluster of agitated womens hats in the royal gallery of the house of lords and how i saw the king going to open parliament and the duke of devonshire looking like a gorgeous pedlar and terribly bored with the cap of maintenance on a tray before him hung by slings from his shoulder a wonderful spectacle  it is quaint no doubt this englandit is even dignified in placesand full of mellow associations that does not alter the quality of the realities these robes conceal the realities are greedy trade base profitseeking bold advertisement and kingship and chivalry spite of this wearing of treasured robes are as dead among it all as that crusader my uncle championed against the nettles outside the duffield church  i have thought much of that bright afternoons panorama  to run down the thames so is to run ones hand over the pages in the book of england from end to end one begins in craven reach and it is as if one were in the heart of old england behind us are kew and hampton court with their memories of kings and cardinals and one runs at first between fulhams episcopal garden parties and hurlinghams playground for the sporting instinct of our race the whole effect is english there is space there are old trees and all the best qualities of the homeland in that upper reach putney too looks anglican on a dwindling scale and then for a stretch the newer developments slop over one misses bladesover and there come first squalid stretches of mean homes right and left and then the dingy industrialism of the south side and on the north bank the polite long front of nice houses artistic literary administrative peoples residences that stretches from cheyne walk nearly to westminster and hides a wilderness of slums what a long slow crescendo that is mile after mile with the houses crowding closelier the multiplying succession of church towers the architectural moments the successive bridges until you come out into the second movement of the piece with lambeths old palace under your quarter and the houses of parliament on your bow westminster bridge is ahead of you then and through it you flash and in a moment the roundfaced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and new scotland yard squares at you a fat beefeater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a bastille  for a stretch you have the essential london you have charing cross railway station heart of the world and the embankment on the north side with its new hotels overshadowing its georgian and victorian architecture and mud and great warehouses and factories chimneys shot towers advertisements on the south the northward skyline grows more intricate and pleasing and more and more does one thank god for wren somerset house is as picturesque as the civil war one is reminded again of the original england one feels in the fretted sky the quality of restoration lace  and then comes astors strong box and the lawyers inns  i had a passing memory of myself there how once i had trudged along the embankment westward weighing my uncles offer of three hundred pounds a year  through that central essential london reach i drove and x2 bored her nose under the foam regardless of it all like a black hound going through reedson what trail even i who made her cannot tell  and in this reach too one first meets the seagulls and is reminded of the sea blackfriars one takesjust under these two bridges and just between them is the finest bridge moment in the worldand behold soaring up hanging in the sky over a rude tumult of warehouses over a jostling competition of traders irrelevantly beautiful and altogether remote saint pauls of course one says saint pauls it is the very figure of whatever fineness the old anglican culture achieved detached a more dignified and chastened saint peters colder greyer but still ornate it has never been over thrown never disavowed only the tall warehouses and all the roar of traffic have forgotten it every one has forgotten it the steamships the barges go heedlessly by regardless of it intricacies of telephone wires and poles cut blackly into its thin mysteries and presently when in a moment the traffic permits you and you look round for it it has dissolved like a cloud into the grey blues of the london sky  and then the traditional and ostensible england falls from you altogether the third movement begins the last great movement in the london symphony in which the trim scheme of the old order is altogether dwarfed and swallowed up comes london bridge and the great warehouses tower up about you waving stupendous cranes the gulls circle and scream in your ears large ships lie among their lighters and one is in the port of the world again and again in this book i have written of england as a feudal scheme overtaken by fatty degeneration and stupendous accidents of hypertrophy  for the last time i must strike that note as the memory of the dear neat little sunlit ancient tower of london lying away in a gap among the warehouses comes back to me that little accumulation of buildings so provincially pleasant and dignified overshadowed by the vulgarest most typical exploit of modern england the sham gothic casings to the ironwork of the tower bridge that tower bridge is the very balance and confirmation of westminsters dull pinnacles and tower that sham gothic bridge in the very gates of our mother of change the sea  but after that one is in a world of accident and nature for the third part of the panorama of london is beyond all law order and precedence it is the seaport and the sea one goes down the widening reaches through a monstrous variety of shipping great steamers great sailingships trailing the flags of all the world a monstrous confusion of lighters witches conferences of brownsailed barges wallowing tugs a tumultuous crowding and jostling of cranes and spars and wharves and stores and assertive inscriptions huge vistas of dock open right and left of one and here and there beyond and amidst it all are church towers little patches of indescribably oldfashioned and wornout houses riverside pubs and the like vestiges of townships that were long since torn to fragments and submerged in these new growths and amidst it all no plan appears no intention no comprehensive desire that is the very key of it all each day one feels that the pressure of commerce and traffic grew grew insensibly monstrous and first this man made a wharf and that erected a crane and then this company set to work and then that and so they jostled together to make this unassimilable enormity of traffic through it we dodged and drove eager for the high seas  i remember how i laughed aloud at the glimpse of the name of a london county council steamboat that ran across me caxton it was called and another was pepys and another was shakespeare they seemed so wildly out of place splashing about in that confusion one wanted to take them out and wipe them and put them back in some english gentlemans library everything was alive about them flash ing splashing and passing ships moving tugs panting hawsers taut barges going down with men toiling at the sweeps the water all aswirl with the wash of shipping scaling into millions of little wavelets curling and frothing under the whip of the unceasing wind past it all we drove and at greenwich to the south you know there stands a fine stone frontage where all the victories are recorded in a painted hall and beside it is the ship where once upon a time those gentlemen of westminster used to have an annual dinnerbefore the port of london got too much for them altogether the old facade of the hospital was just warming to the sunset as we went by and after that right and left the river opened the sense of the sea increased and prevailed reach after reach from northfleet to the nore  and out you come at last with the sun behind you into the eastern sea you speed up and tear the oily water louder and faster siroo sirooswishsiroo and the hills of kentover which i once fled from the christian teachings of nicodemus frappfall away on the right hand and essex on the left they fall away and vanish into blue haze and the tall slow ships behind the tugs scarce moving ships and wallowing sturdy tugs are all wrought of wet gold as one goes frothing by they stand out bound on strange missions of life and death to the killing of men in unfamiliar lands and now behind us is blue mystery and the phantom flash of unseen lights and presently even these are gone and i and my destroyer tear out to the unknown across a great grey space we tear into the great spaces of the future and the turbines fall to talking in unfamiliar tongues out to the open we go to windy freedom and trackless ways light after light goes down england and the kingdom britain and the empire the old prides and the old devotions glide abeam astern sink down upon the horizon passpass the river passeslondon passes england passes  iii  this is the note i have tried to emphasise the note that sounds clear in my mind when i think of anything beyond the purely personal aspects of my story  it is a note of crumbling and confusion of change and seemingly aimless swelling of a bubbling up and medley of futile loves and sorrows but through the confusion sounds another note through the confusion something drives something that is at once human achievement and the most inhuman of all existing things something comes out of it how can i express the values of a thing at once so essential and so immaterial it is something that calls upon such men as i with an irresistible appeal  i have figured it in my last section by the symbol of my destroyer stark and swift irrelevant to most human interests sometimes i call this reality science sometimes i call it truth but it is something we draw by pain and effort ont of the heart of life that we disentangle and make clear other men serve it i know in art in literature in social invention and see it in a thousand different figures under a hundred names i see it always as austerity as beauty this thing we make clear is the heart of life it is the one enduring thing men and nations epochs and civilisation pass each making its contribution i do not know what it is this something except that it is supreme it is a something a quality an element one may find now in colours now in norms now in sounds now in thoughts it emerges from life with each year one lives and feels and generation by generation and age by age but the how and why of it are all beyond the compass of my mind  yet the full sense of it was with me all that night as i drove lonely above the rush and murmur of my engines out upon the weltering circle of the sea  far out to the northeast there came the flicker of a squadron of warships waving white swords of light about the sky i kept them hulldown and presently they were mere summer lightning over the watery edge of the globe i fell into thought that was nearly formless into doubts and dreams that have no words and it seemed good to me to drive ahead and on and or through the windy starlight over the long black waves  iv  it was morning and day before i returned with the four sick and starving journalists who had got permission to come with me up the shining river and past the old grey tower  i recall the back views of those journalists very distinctly going with a certain damp weariness of movement along a side street away from the river they were good men and bore me no malice and they served me up to the public in turgid degenerate kiplingese as a modest button on the complacent stomach of the empire though as a matter of fact x2 isnt intended for the empire or indeed for the hands of any european power we offered it to our own people first but they would have nothing to do with me and i have long since ceased to trouble much about such questions i have come to see myself from the outside my country from the outsidewithout illusions we make and pass  we are all things that make and pass striving upon a hidden mission out to the open sea
