became a socialist     preface   when i was a youngster i was looked upon as a weird sort of creature because forsooth i was a socialist  reporters from local papers interviewed me and the interviews when published were pathological studies of a strange and abnormal specimen of man  at that time nine or ten years ago because i made a stand in my native town for municipal ownership of public utilities i was branded a redshirt a dynamiter and an anarchist and really decent fellows who liked me very well drew the line at my appearing in public with their sisters  but the times changed  there came a day when i heard in my native town a republican mayor publicly proclaim that municipal ownership was a fixed american policy  and in that day i found myself picking up in the world  no longer did the pathologist study me while the really decent fellows did not mind in the least the propinquity of myself and their sisters in the public eye  my political and sociological ideas were ascribed to the vagaries of youth and goodnatured elderly men patronized me and told me that i would grow up some day and become an unusually intelligent member of the community  also they told me that my views were biassed by my empty pockets and that some day when i had gathered to me a few dollars my views would be wholly differentin short that my views would be their views  and then came the day when my socialism grew respectablestill a vagary of youth it was held but romantically respectable  romance to the bourgeois mind was respectable because it was not dangerous  as a redshirt with bombs in all his pockets i was dangerous  as a youth with nothing more menacing than a few philosophical ideas germanic in their origin i was an interesting and pleasing personality  through all this experience i noted one thing  it was not i that changed but the community  in fact my socialistic views grew solider and more pronounced  i repeat it was the community that changed and to my chagrin i discovered that the community changed to such purpose that it was not above stealing my thunder  the community branded me a redshirt because i stood for municipal ownership a little later it applauded its mayor when he proclaimed municipal ownership to be a fixed american policy  he stole my thunder and the community applauded the theft  and today the community is able to come around and give me points on municipal ownership  what happened to me has been in no wise different from what has happened to the socialist movement as a whole in the united states  in the bourgeois mind socialism has changed from a terrible disease to a youthful vagary and later on had its thunder stolen by the two old partiessocialism like a meek and thrifty workingman being exploited became respectable  only dangerous things are abhorrent  the thing that is not dangerous is always respectable  and so with socialism in the united states  for several years it has been very respectablea sweet and beautiful utopian dream in the bourgeois mind yet a dream only a dream  during this period which has just ended socialism was tolerated because it was impossible and nonmenacing  much of its thunder had been stolen and the workingmen had been made happy with full dinnerpails  there was nothing to fear  the kind old world spun on coupons were clipped and larger profits than ever were extracted from the toilers couponclipping and profitextracting would continue to the end of time these were functions divine in origin and held by divine right  the newspapers the preachers and the college presidents said so and what they say of course is soto the bourgeois mind  then came the presidential election of 1904  like a bolt out of a clear sky was the socialist vote of 435000an increase of nearly 400 per cent in four years the largest thirdparty vote with one exception since the civil war  socialism had shown that it was a very live and growing revolutionary force and all its old menace revived  i am afraid that neither it nor i are any longer respectable  the capitalist press of the country confirms me in my opinion and herewith i give a few postelection utterances of the capitalist press      the democratic party of the constitution is dead  the     socialdemocratic party of continental europe preaching discontent     and class hatred assailing law property and personal rights and     insinuating confiscation and plunder is herechicago chronicle      that over forty thousand votes should have been cast in this city to     make such a person as eugene v debs the president of the united     states is about the worst kind of advertising that chicago could     receivechicago interocean      we cannot blink the fact that socialism is making rapid growth in

world responsible for our system of government being     changed into a social republic  the arbitrary cutting down of wages     must cease or socialism will seize another lever to lift itself into     powerthe chicago new world      scarcely any phase of the election is more sinisterly interesting     than the increase in the socialist vote  before election we said     that we could not afford to give aid and comfort to the socialists in     any manner   it socialism must be fought in all its phases in     its every manifestationsan francisco argonaut  and far be it from me to deny that socialism is a menace  it is its purpose to wipe out root and branch all capitalistic institutions of presentday society  it is distinctly revolutionary and in scope and depth is vastly more tremendous than any revolution that has ever occurred in the history of the world  it presents a new spectacle to the astonished worldthat of an organized international revolutionary movement  in the bourgeois mind a class struggle is a terrible and hateful thing and yet that is precisely what socialism isa worldwide class struggle between the propertyless workers and the propertied masters of workers  it is the prime preachment of socialism that the struggle is a class struggle  the working class in the process of social evolution in the very nature of things is bound to revolt from the sway of the capitalist class and to overthrow the capitalist class  this is the menace of socialism and in affirming it and in tallying myself an adherent of it i accept my own consequent unrespectability  as yet to the average bourgeois mind socialism is merely a menace vague and formless  the average member of the capitalist class when he discusses socialism is condemned an ignoramus out of his own mouth  he does not know the literature of socialism its philosophy nor its politics  he wags his head sagely and rattles the dry bones of dead and buried ideas  his lips mumble mouldy phrases such as men are not born equal and never can be it is utopian and impossible abstinence should be rewarded man will first have to be born again cooperative colonies have always failed and what if we do divide up in ten years there would be rich and poor men such as there are today  it surely is time that the capitalists knew something about this socialism that they feel menaces them  and it is the hope of the writer that the socialistic studies in this volume may in some slight degree enlighten a few capitalistic minds  the capitalist must learn first and for always that socialism is based not upon the equality but upon the inequality of men  next he must learn that no new birth into spiritual purity is necessary before socialism becomes possible  he must learn that socialism deals with what is not with what ought to be and that the material with which it deals is the clay of the common road the warm human fallible and frail sordid and petty absurd and contradictory even grotesque and yet withal shot through with flashes and glimmerings of something finer and godlike with here and there sweetnesses of service and unselfishness desires for goodness for renunciation and sacrifice and with conscience stern and awful at times blazingly imperious demanding the rightthe right nothing more nor less than the right                                                                jack london  oakland california january 12 1905     the class struggle   unfortunately or otherwise people are prone to believe in the reality of the things they think ought to be so  this comes of the cheery optimism which is innate with life itself and while it may sometimes be deplored it must never be censured for as a rule it is productive of more good than harm and of about all the achievement there is in the world  there are cases where this optimism has been disastrous as with the people who lived in pompeii during its last quivering days or with the aristocrats of the time of louis xvi who confidently expected the deluge to overwhelm their children or their childrens children but never themselves  but there is small likelihood that the case of perverse optimism here to be considered will end in such disaster while there is every reason to believe that the great change now manifesting itself in society will be as peaceful and orderly in its culmination as it is in its present development  out of their constitutional optimism and because a class struggle is an abhorred and dangerous thing the great american people are unanimous in asserting that there is no class struggle  and by american people is meant the recognized and authoritative mouthpieces of the american people which are the press the pulpit and the university  the journalists the preachers and the professors are practically of one voice in declaring that there is no such thing as a class struggle now going on much less that a class struggle will ever go on in the united states  and this declaration they continually make in the face of a multitude of facts which impeach not so much their sincerity as affirm rather their optimism  there are two ways of approaching the subject of the class struggle  the existence of this struggle can be shown theoretically and it can be shown actually  for a class struggle to exist in society there must be first a class inequality a superior class and an inferior class as measured by power and second the outlets must be closed whereby the strength and ferment of the inferior class have been permitted to escape  that there are even classes in the united states is vigorously denied by many but it is incontrovertible when a group of individuals is formed wherein the members are bound together by common interests which are peculiarly their interests and not the interests of individuals outside the group that such a group is a class  the owners of capital with their dependents form a class of this nature in the united states the working people form a similar class  the interest of the capitalist class say in the matter of income tax is quite contrary to the interest of the laboring class and vice versa in the matter of polltax  if between these two classes there be a clear and vital conflict of interest all the factors are present which make a class struggle but this struggle will lie dormant if the strong and capable members of the inferior class be permitted to leave that class and join the ranks of the superior class  the capitalist class and the working class have existed side by side and for a long time in the united states but hitherto all the strong energetic members of the working class have been able to rise out of their class and become owners of capital  they were enabled to do this because an undeveloped country with an expanding frontier gave equality of opportunity to all  in the almost lotterylike scramble for the ownership of vast unowned natural resources and in the exploitation of which there was little or no competition of capital the capital itself rising out of the exploitation the capable intelligent member of the working class found a field in which to use his brains to his own advancement  instead of being discontented in direct ratio with his intelligence and ambitions and of radiating amongst his fellows a spirit of revolt as capable as he was capable he left them to their fate and carved his own way to a place in the superior class  but the day of an expanding frontier of a lotterylike scramble for the ownership of natural resources and of the upbuilding of new industries is past  farthest west has been reached and an immense volume of surplus capital roams for investment and nips in the bud the patient efforts of the embryo capitalist to rise through slow increment from small beginnings  the gateway of opportunity after opportunity has been closed and closed for all time  rockefeller has shut the door on oil the american tobacco company on tobacco and carnegie on steel  after carnegie came morgan who triplelocked the door  these doors will not open again and before them pause thousands of ambitious young men to read the placard no thoroughfare  and day by day more doors are shut while the ambitious young men continue to be born  it is they denied the opportunity to rise from the working class who preach revolt to the working class  had he been born fifty years later andrew carnegie the poor scotch boy might have risen to be president of his union or of a federation of unions but that he would never have become the builder of homestead and the founder of multitudinous libraries is as certain as it is certain that some other man would have developed the steel industry had andrew carnegie never been born  theoretically then there exist in the united states all the factors which go to make a class struggle  there are the capitalists and working classes the interests of which conflict while the working class is no longer being emasculated to the extent it was in the past by having drawn off from it its best blood and brains  its more capable members are no longer able to rise out of it and leave the great mass leaderless and helpless  they remain to be its leaders  but the optimistic mouthpieces of the great american people who are themselves deft theoreticians are not to be convinced by mere theoretics  so it remains to demonstrate the existence of the class struggle by a marshalling of the facts  when nearly two millions of men finding themselves knit together by certain interests peculiarly their own band together in a strong organization for the aggressive pursuit of those interests it is evident that society has within it a hostile and warring class  but when the interests which this class aggressively pursues conflict sharply and vitally with the interests of another class class antagonism arises and a class struggle is the inevitable result  one great organization of labor alone has a membership of 1700000 in the united states  this is the american federation of labor and outside of it are many other large organizations  all these men are banded together for the frank purpose of bettering their condition regardless of the harm worked thereby upon all other classes  they are in open antagonism with the capitalist class while the manifestos of their leaders state that the struggle is one which can never end until the capitalist class is exterminated  their leaders will largely deny this last statement but an examination of their utterances their actions and the situation will forestall such denial  in the first place the conflict between labor and capital is over the division of the join product  capital and labor apply themselves to raw material and make it into a finished product  the difference between the value of the raw material and the value of the finished product is the value they have added to it by their joint effort  this added value is therefore their joint product and it is over the division of this joint product that the struggle between labor and capital takes place  labor takes its share in wages capital takes its share in profits  it is patent if capital took in profits the whole joint product that labor would perish  and it is equally patent if labor took in wages the whole joint product that capital would perish yet this last is the very thing labor aspires to do and that it will never be content with anything less than the whole joint product is evidenced by the words of its leaders  mr samuel gompers president of the american federation of labor has said the workers want more wages more of the comforts of life more leisure more chance for selfimprovement as men as tradeunionists as citizens  these were the wants of yesterday they are the wants of today they will be the wants of tomorrow and of tomorrows morrow the struggle may assume new forms but the issue is the immemorial onean effort of the producers to obtain an increasing measure of the wealth that flows from their production  mr henry white secretary of the united garment workers of america and a member of the industrial committee of the national civic federation speaking of the national civic federation soon after its inception said to fall into one anothers arms to avow friendship to express regret at the injury which has been done would not alter the facts of the situation  workingmen will continue to demand more pay and the employer will naturally oppose them  the readiness and ability of the workmen to fight will as usual largely determine the amount of their wages or their share in the product   but when it comes to dividing the proceeds there is the rub  we can also agree that the larger the product through the employment of laborsaving methods the better as there will be more to be divided but again the question of the division    a conciliation committee having the confidence of the community and composed of men possessing practical knowledge of industrial affairs can therefore aid in mitigating this antagonism in preventing avoidable conflicts in bringing about a truce i use the word truce because understandings can only be temporary  here is a man who might have owned cattle on a thousand hills been a lumber baron or a railroad king had he been born a few years sooner  as it is he remains in his class is secretary of the united garment workers of america and is so thoroughly saturated with the class struggle that he speaks of the dispute between capital and labor in terms of warworkmen fight with employers it is possible to avoid some conflicts in certain cases truces may be for the time being effected  man being man and a great deal short of the angels the quarrel over the division of the joint product is irreconcilable  for the last twenty years in the united states there has been an average of over a thousand strikes per year and year by year these strikes increase in magnitude and the front of the labor army grows more imposing  and it is a class struggle pure and simple  labor as a class is fighting with capital as a class  workingmen will continue to demand more pay and employers will continue to oppose them  this is the keynote to laissez faireeverybody for himself and devil take the hindmost  it is upon this that the rampant individualist bases his individualism  it is the letalone policy the struggle for existence which strengthens the strong destroys the weak and makes a finer and more capable breed of men  but the individual has passed away and the group has come for better or worse and the struggle has become not a struggle between individuals but a struggle between groups  so the query rises has the individualist never speculated upon the labor group becoming strong enough to destroy the capitalist group and take to itself and run for itself the machinery of industry  and further has the individualist never speculated upon this being still a triumphant expression of individualismof group individualismif the confusion of terms may be permitted  but the facts of the class struggle are deeper and more significant than have so far been presented  a million or so of workmen may organize for the pursuit of interests which engender class antagonism and strife and at the same time be unconscious of what is engendered  but when a million or so of workmen show unmistakable signs of being conscious of their classof being in short class consciousthen the situation grows serious  the uncompromising and terrible hatred of the tradeunionist for a scab is the hatred of a class for a traitor to that classwhile the hatred of a tradeunionist for the militia is the hatred of a class for a weapon wielded by the class with which it is fighting  no workman can be true to his class and at the same time be a member of the militia this is the dictum of the labor leaders  in the town of the writer the good citizens when they get up a fourth of july parade and invite the labor unions to participate are informed by the unions that they will not march in the parade if the militia marches  article 8 of the constitution of the painters and decorators union of schenectady provides that a member must not be a militiaman special police officer or deputy marshal in the employ of corporations or individuals during strikes lockouts or other labor difficulties and any member occupying any of the above positions will be debarred from membership  mr william potter was a member of this union and a member of the national guard  as a result because he obeyed the order of the governor when his company was ordered out to suppress rioting he was expelled from his union  also his union demanded his employers shafer  barry to discharge him from their service  this they complied with rather than face the threatened strike  mr robert l walker first lieutenant of the light guards a new haven militia company recently resigned  his reason was that he was a member of the car builders union and that the two organizations were antagonistic to each other  during a new orleans streetcar strike not long ago a whole company of militia called out to protect nonunion men resigned in a body  mr john mulholland president of the international association of allied metal mechanics has stated that he does not want the members to join the militia  the local trades assembly of syracuse new york has passed a resolution by unanimous vote requiring union men who are members of the national guard to resign under pain of expulsion from the unions  the amalgamated sheet metal workers association has incorporated in its constitution an amendment excluding from membership in its organization any person a member of the regular army or of the state militia or naval reserve the illinois state federation of labor at a recent convention passed without a dissenting vote a resolution declaring that membership in military organizations is a violation of labor union obligations and requesting all union men to withdraw from the militia  the president of the federation mr albert young declared that the militia was a menace not only to unions but to all workers throughout the country  these instances may be multiplied a thousand fold  the union workmen are becoming conscious of their class and of the struggle their class is waging with the capitalist class  to be a member of the militia is to be a traitor to the union for the militia is a weapon wielded by the employers to crush the workers in the struggle between the warring groups  another interesting and even more pregnant phase of the class struggle is the political aspect of it as displayed by the socialists  five men standing together may perform prodigies 500 men marching as marched the historic five hundred of marseilles may sack a palace and destroy a king while 500000 men passionately preaching the propaganda of a class struggle waging a class struggle along political lines and backed by the moral and intellectual support of 10000000 more men of like convictions throughout the world may come pretty close to realizing a class struggle in these united states of ours  in 1900 these men cast 150000 votes two years later in 1902 they cast 300000 votes and in 1904 they cast 450000  they have behind them a most imposing philosophic and scientific literature they own illustrated magazines and reviews high in quality dignity and restraint they possess countless daily and weekly papers which circulate throughout the land and single papers which have subscribers by the hundreds of thousands and they literally swamp the working classes in a vast sea of tracts and pamphlets  no political party in the united states no church organization nor mission effort has as indefatigable workers as has the socialist party  they multiply themselves know of no effort nor sacrifice too great to make for the cause and cause with them is spelled out in capitals  they work for it with a religious zeal and would die for it with a willingness similar to that of the christian martyrs  these men are preaching an uncompromising and deadly class struggle  in fact they are organized upon the basis of a class struggle  the history of society they say is a history of class struggles patrician struggled with plebeian in early rome the king and the burghers with the nobles in the middle ages later on the king and the nobles with the bourgeoisie and today the struggle is on between the triumphant bourgeoisie and the rising proletariat  by proletariat is meant the class of people without capital which sells its labor for a living  that the proletariat shall conquer mark the note of fatalism is as certain as the rising sun  just as the bourgeoisie of the eighteenth century wanted democracy applied to politics so the proletariat of the twentieth century wants democracy applied to industry  as the bourgeoisie complained against the government being run by and for the nobles so the proletariat complains against the government and industry being run by and for the bourgeoisie and so following in the footsteps of its predecessor the proletariat will possess itself of the government apply democracy to industry abolish wages which are merely legalized robbery and run the business of the country in its own interest  their aim they say is to organize the working class and those in sympathy with it into a political party with the object of conquering the powers of government and of using them for the purpose of transforming the present system of private ownership of the means of production and distribution into collective ownership by the entire people  briefly stated this is the battle plan of these 450000 men who call themselves socialists  and in the face of the existence of such an aggressive group of men a class struggle cannot very well be denied by the optimistic americans who say a class struggle is monstrous  sir there is no class struggle  the class struggle is here and the optimistic american had better gird himself for the fray and put a stop to it rather than sit idly declaiming that what ought not to be is not and never will be  but the socialists fanatics and dreamers though they may well be betray a foresight and insight and a genius for organization which put to shame the class with which they are openly at war  failing of rapid success in waging a sheer political propaganda and finding that they were alienating the most intelligent and most easily organized portion of the voters the socialists lessoned from the experience and turned their energies upon the tradeunion movement  to win the trade unions was wellnigh to win the war and recent events show that they have done far more winning in this direction than have the capitalists  instead of antagonizing the unions which had been their previous policy the socialists proceeded to conciliate the unions  let every good socialist join the union of his trade the edict went forth  bore from within and capture the tradeunion movement  and this policy only several years old has reaped fruits far beyond their fondest expectations  today the great labor unions are honeycombed with socialists boring from within as they picturesquely term their undermining labor  at work and at play at business meeting and council their insidious propaganda goes on  at the shoulder of the tradeunionist is the socialist sympathizing with him aiding him with head and hand suggestingperpetually suggestingthe necessity for political action  as the journal of lansing michigan a republican paper has remarked the socialists in the labor unions are tireless workers  they are sincere energetic and selfsacrificing    they stick to the union and work all the while thus making a showing which reckoned by ordinary standards is out of all proportion to their numbers  their cause is growing among union laborers and their long fight intended to turn the federation into a political organization is likely to win  they miss no opportunity of driving home the necessity for political action the necessity for capturing the political machinery of society whereby they may master society  as an instance of this is the avidity with which the american socialists seized upon the famous taftvale decision in england which was to the effect that an unincorporated union could be sued and its treasury rifled by process of law  throughout the united states the socialists pointed the moral in similar fashion to the way it was pointed by the socialdemocratic herald which advised the tradeunionists in view of the decision to stop trying to fight capital with money which they lacked and to begin fighting with the ballot which was their strongest weapon  night and day tireless and unrelenting they labor at their selfimposed task of undermining society  mr m g cunniff who lately made an intimate study of tradeunionism says all through the unions socialism filters  almost every other man is a socialist preaching that unionism is but a makeshift  malthus be damned they told him for the good time was coming when every man should be able to rear his family in comfort  in one union with two thousand members mr cunniff found every man a socialist and from his experiences mr cunniff was forced to confess i lived in a world that showed our industrial life atremble from beneath with a neverceasing ferment  the socialists have already captured the western federation of miners the western hotel and restaurant employees union and the patternmakers national association  the western federation of miners at a recent convention declared the strike has failed to secure to the working classes their liberty we therefore call upon the workers to strike as one man for their liberties at the ballot box    we put ourselves on record as committed to the programme of independent political action    we indorse the platform of the socialist party and accept it as the declaration of principles of our organization  we call upon our members as individuals to commence immediately the organization of the socialist movement in their respective towns and states and to cooperate in every way for the furtherance of the principles of socialism and of the socialist party  in states where the socialist party has not perfected its organization we advise that every assistance be given by our members to that end    we therefore call for organizers capable and wellversed in the whole programme of the labor movement to be sent into each state to preach the necessity of organization on the political as well as on the economic field  the capitalist class has a glimmering consciousness of the class struggle which is shaping itself in the midst of society but the capitalists as a class seem to lack the ability for organizing for coming together such as is possessed by the working class  no american capitalist ever aids an english capitalist in the common fight while workmen have formed international unions the socialists a worldwide international organization and on all sides space and race are bridged in the effort to achieve solidarity  resolutions of sympathy and fully as important donations of money pass back and forth across the sea to wherever labor is fighting its pitched battles  for divers reasons the capitalist class lacks this cohesion or solidarity chief among which is the optimism bred of past success  and again the capitalist class is divided it has within itself a class struggle of no mean proportions which tends to irritate and harass it and to confuse the situation  the small capitalist and the large capitalist are grappled with each other struggling over what achille loria calls the bipartition of the revenues  such a struggle though not precisely analogous was waged between the landlords and manufacturers of england when the one brought about the passage of the factory acts and the other the abolition of the corn laws  here and there however certain members of the capitalist class see clearly the cleavage in society along which the struggle is beginning to show itself while the press and magazines are beginning to raise an occasional and troubled voice  two leagues of classconscious capitalists have been formed for the purpose of carrying on their side of the struggle  like the socialists they do not mince matters but state boldly and plainly that they are fighting to subjugate the opposing class  it is the barons against the commons  one of these leagues the national association of manufacturers is stopping short of nothing in what it conceives to be a lifeanddeath struggle  mr d m parry who is the president of the league as well as president of the national metal trades association is leaving no stone unturned in what he feels to be a desperate effort to organize his class  he has issued the call to arms in terms everything but ambiguous there is still time in the united states to head off the socialistic programme which unrestrained is sure to wreck our country  as he says the work is for federating employers in order that we may meet with a united front all issues that affect us  we must come to this sooner or later    the work immediately before the national association of manufacturers is first keep the vicious eighthour bill off the books second to destroy the antiinjunction bill which wrests your business from you and places it in the hands of your employees third to secure the passage of the department of commerce and industry bill the latter would go through with a rush were it not for the hectoring opposition of organized labor  by this department he further says business interests would have direct and sympathetic representation at washington  in a later letter issued broadcast to the capitalists outside the league president parry points out the success which is already beginning to attend the efforts of the league at washington  we have contributed more than any other influence to the quick passage of the new department of commerce bill  it is said that the activities of this office are numerous and satisfactory but of that i must not say too muchor anything    at washington the association is not represented too much either directly or indirectly  sometimes it is known in a most powerful way that it is represented vigorously and unitedly  sometimes it is not known that it is represented at all  the second classconscious capitalist organization is called the national economic league  it likewise manifests the frankness of men who do not dillydally with terms but who say what they mean and who mean to settle down to a long hard fight  their letter of invitation to prospective members opens boldly  we beg to inform you that the national economic league will render its services in an impartial educational movement to oppose socialism and class hatred  among its classconscious members men who recognize that the opening guns of the class struggle have been fired may be instanced the following names hon lyman j gage exsecretary u s treasury hon thomas jefferson coolidge

the atchison topeka  santa fe railway company  instances of the troubled editorial voice have not been rare during the last several years  there were many cries from the press during the last days of the anthracite coal strike that the mine owners by their stubbornness were sowing the regrettable seeds of socialism  the worlds work for december 1902 said the next significant fact is the recommendation by the illinois state federation of labor that all members of labor unions who are also members of the state militia shall resign from the militia  this proposition has been favorably regarded by some other labor organizations  it has done more than any other single recent declaration or action to cause a public distrust of such unions as favor it  it hints of a class separation that in turn hints of anarchy  the outlook february 14 1903 in reference to the rioting at waterbury remarks that all this disorder should have occurred in a city of the character and intelligence of waterbury indicates that the industrial war spirit is by no means confined to the immigrant or ignorant working classes  that president roosevelt has smelt the smoke from the firing line of the class struggle is evidenced by his words above all we need to remember that any kind of class animosity in the political world is if possible even more destructive to national welfare than sectional race or religious animosity  the chief thing to be noted here is president roosevelts tacit recognition of class animosity in the industrial world and his fear which language cannot portray stronger that this class animosity may spread to the political world  yet this is the very policy which the socialists have announced in their declaration of war against presentday societyto capture the political machinery of society and by that machinery destroy presentday society  the new york independent for february 12 1903 recognized without qualification the class struggle  it is impossible fairly to pass upon the methods of labor unions or to devise plans for remedying their abuses until it is recognized to begin with that unions are based upon class antagonism and that their policies are dictated by the necessities of social warfare  a strike is a rebellion against the owners of property  the rights of property are protected by government  and a strike under certain provocation may extend as far as did the general strike in belgium a few years since when practically the entire wageearning population stopped work in order to force political concessions from the propertyowning classes  this is an extreme case but it brings out vividly the real nature of labor organization as a species of warfare whose object is the coercion of one class by another class  it has been shown theoretically and actually that there is a class struggle in the united states  the quarrel over the division of the joint product is irreconcilable  the working class is no longer losing its strongest and most capable members  these men denied room for their ambition in the capitalist ranks remain to be the leaders of the workers to spur them to discontent to make them conscious of their class to lead them to revolt  this revolt appearing spontaneously all over the industrial field in the form of demands for an increased share of the joint product is being carefully and shrewdly shaped for a political assault upon society  the leaders with the carelessness of fatalists do not hesitate for an instant to publish their intentions to the world  they intend to direct the labor revolt to the capture of the political machinery of society with the political machinery once in their hands which will also give them the control of the police the army the navy and the courts they will confiscate with or without remuneration all the possessions of the capitalist class which are used in the production and distribution of the necessaries and luxuries of life  by this they mean to apply the law of eminent domain to the land and to extend the law of eminent domain till it embraces the mines the factories the railroads and the ocean carriers  in short they intend to destroy presentday society which they contend is run in the interest of another class and from the materials to construct a new society which will be run in their interest  on the other hand the capitalist class is beginning to grow conscious of itself and of the struggle which is being waged  it is already forming offensive and defensive leagues while some of the most prominent figures in the nation are preparing to lead it in the attack upon socialism  the question to be solved is not one of malthusianism projected efficiency nor ethics  it is a question of might  whichever class is to win will win by virtue of superior strength for the workers are beginning to say as they said to mr cunniff malthus be damned  in their own minds they find no sanction for continuing the individual struggle for the survival of the fittest  as mr gompers has said they want more and more and more  the ethical import of mr kidds plan of the present generation putting up with less in order that race efficiency may be projected into a remote future has no bearing upon their actions they refuse to be the glad perishers so glowingly described by nietzsche  it remains to be seen how promptly the capitalist class will respond to the call to arms  upon its promptness rests its existence for if it sits idly by soothfully proclaiming that what ought not to be cannot be it will find the roof beams crashing about its head  the capitalist class is in the numerical minority and bids fair to be outvoted if it does not put a stop to the vast propaganda being waged by its enemy  it is no longer a question of whether or not there is a class struggle  the question now is what will be the outcome of the class struggle     the tramp   mr francis oneil general superintendent of police chicago speaking of the tramp says despite the most stringent police regulations a great city will have a certain number of homeless vagrants to shelter through the winter  despitemark the word a confession of organized helplessness as against unorganized necessity  if police regulations are stringent and yet fail then that which makes them fail namely the tramp must have still more stringent reasons for succeeding this being so it should be of interest to inquire into these reasons to attempt to discover why the nameless and homeless vagrant sets at naught the right arm of the corporate power of our great cities why all that is weak and worthless is stronger than all that is strong and of value  mr oneil is a man of wide experience on the subject of tramps  he may be called a specialist  as he says of himself as an oldtime desk sergeant and police captain i have had almost unlimited opportunity to study and analyze this class of floating population which seeks the city in winter and scatters abroad through the country in the spring  he then continues this experience reiterated the lesson that the vast majority of these wanderers are of the class with whom a life of vagrancy is a chosen means of living without work  not only is it to be inferred from this that there is a large class in society which lives without work for mr oneils testimony further shows that this class is forced to live without work  he says i have been astonished at the multitude of those who have unfortunately engaged in occupations which practically force them to become loafers for at least a third of the year  and it is from this class that the tramps are largely recruited  i recall a certain winter when it seemed to me that a large portion of the inhabitants of chicago belonged to this army of unfortunates  i was stationed at a police station not far from where an ice harvest was ready for the cutters  the ice company advertised for helpers and the very night this call appeared in the newspapers our station was packed with homeless men who asked shelter in order to be at hand for the mornings work  every foot of floor space was given over to these lodgers and scores were still unaccommodated  and again and it must be confessed that the man who is willing to do honest labor for food and shelter is a rare specimen in this vast army of shabby and tattered wanderers who seek the warmth of the city with the coming of the first snow  taking into consideration the crowd of honest laborers that swamped mr oneils stationhouse on the way to the icecutting it is patent if all tramps were looking for honest labor instead of a small minority that the honest laborers would have a far harder task finding something honest to do for food and shelter  if the opinion of the honest laborers who swamped mr oneils stationhouse were asked one could rest confident that each and every man would express a preference for fewer honest laborers on the morrow when he asked the ice foreman for a job  and finally mr oneil says the humane and generous treatment which this city has accorded the great army of homeless unfortunates has made it the victim of wholesale imposition and this wellintended policy of kindness has resulted in making chicago the winter mecca of a vast and undesirable floating population  that is to say because of her kindness chicago had more than her fair share of tramps because she was humane and generous she suffered wholesale imposition  from this we must conclude that it does not do to be humane and generous to our fellowmenwhen they are tramps  mr oneil is right and that this is no sophism it is the intention of this article among other things to show  in a general way we may draw the following inferences from the remarks of mr oneil 1 the tramp is stronger than organized society and cannot be put down 2 the tramp is shabby tattered homeless unfortunate 3 there is a vast number of tramps 4 very few tramps are willing to do honest work 5 those tramps who are willing to do honest work have to hunt very hard to find it 6 the tramp is undesirable  to this last let the contention be appended that the tramp is only personally undesirable that he is negatively desirable that the function he performs in society is a negative function and that he is the byproduct of economic necessity  it is very easy to demonstrate that there are more men than there is work for men to do  for instance what would happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps should become suddenly inspired with an overmastering desire for work  it is a fair question  go to work is preached to the tramp every day of his life  the judge on the bench the pedestrian in the street the housewife at the kitchen door all unite in advising him to go to work  so what would happen tomorrow if one hundred thousand tramps acted upon this advice and strenuously and indomitably sought work  why by the end of the week one hundred thousand workers their places taken by the tramps would receive their time and be hitting the road for a job  ella wheeler wilcox unwittingly and uncomfortably demonstrated the disparity between men and work 1  she made a casual reference in a newspaper column she conducts to the difficulty two business men found in obtaining good employees  the first morning mail brought her seventyfive applications for the position and at the end of two weeks over two hundred people had applied  still more strikingly was the same proposition recently demonstrated in san francisco  a sympathetic strike called out a whole federation of trades unions  thousands of men in many branches of trade quit workdraymen sand teamsters porters and packers longshoremen stevedores warehousemen stationary engineers sailors marine firemen stewards seacooks and so forthan interminable list  it was a strike of large proportions  every pacific coast shipping city was involved and the entire coasting service from san diego to puget sound was virtually tied up  the time was considered auspicious  the philippines and alaska had drained the pacific coast of surplus labor it was summertime when the agricultural demand for laborers was at its height and when the cities were bare of their floating populations  and yet there remained a body of surplus labor sufficient to take the places of the strikers  no matter what occupation seacook or stationary engineer sand teamster or warehouseman in every case there was an idle worker ready to do the work  and not only ready but anxious  they fought for a chance to work  men were killed hundreds of heads were broken the hospitals were filled with injured men and thousands of assaults were committed  and still surplus laborers scabs came forward to replace the strikers  the question arises whence came this second army of workers to replace the first army  one thing is certain the trades unions did not scab on one another  another thing is certain no industry on the pacific slope was crippled in the slightest degree by its workers being drawn away to fill the places of the strikers  a third thing is certain the agricultural workers did not flock to the cities to replace the strikers in this last instance it is worth while to note that the agricultural laborers wailed to high heaven when a few of the strikers went into the country to compete with them in unskilled employments  so there is no accounting for this second army of workers  it simply was  it was there all this time a surplus labor army in the year of our lord 1901 a year adjudged most prosperous in the annals of the united states 2  the existence of the surplus labor army being established there remains to be established the economic necessity for the surplus labor army  the simplest and most obvious need is that brought about by the fluctuation of production  if when production is at low ebb all men are at work it necessarily follows that when production increases there will be no men to do the increased work  this may seem almost childish and if not childish at least easily remedied  at low ebb let the men work shorter time at high flood let them work overtime  the main objection to this is that it is not done and that we are considering what is not what might be or should be  then there are great irregular and periodical demands for labor which must be met  under the first head come all the big building and engineering enterprises  when a canal is to be dug or a railroad put through requiring thousands of laborers it would be hurtful to withdraw these laborers from the constant industries  and whether it is a canal to be dug or a cellar whether five thousand men are required or five it is well in society as at present organized that they be taken from the surplus labor army  the surplus labor army is the reserve fund of social energy and this is one of the reasons for its existence  under the second head periodical demands come the harvests  throughout the year huge labor tides sweep back and forth across the united states that which is sown and tended by few men comes to sudden ripeness and must be gathered by many men and it is inevitable that these many men form floating populations  in the late spring the berries must be picked in the summer the grain garnered in the fall the hops gathered in the winter the ice harvested  in california a man may pick berries in siskiyou peaches in santa clara grapes in the san joaquin and oranges in los angeles going from job to job as the season advances and travelling a thousand miles ere the season is done  but the great demand for agricultural labor is in the summer  in the winter work is slack and these floating populations eddy into the cities to eke out a precarious existence and harrow the souls of the police officers until the return of warm weather and work  if there were constant work at good wages for every man who would harvest the crops  but the last and most significant need for the surplus labor army remains to be stated  this surplus labor acts as a check upon all employed labor  it is the lash by which the masters hold the workers to their tasks or drive them back to their tasks when they have revolted  it is the goad which forces the workers into the compulsory free contracts against which they now and again rebel  there is only one reason under the sun that strikes fail and that is because there are always plenty of men to take the strikers places  the strength of the union today other things remaining equal is proportionate to the skill of the trade or in other words proportionate to the pressure the surplus labor army can put upon it  if a thousand ditchdiggers strike it is easy to replace them wherefore the ditchdiggers have little or no organized strength  but a thousand highly skilled machinists are somewhat harder to replace and in consequence the machinist unions are strong  the ditchdiggers are wholly at the mercy of the surplus labor army the machinists only partly  to be invincible a union must be a monopoly  it must control every man in its particular trade and regulate apprentices so that the supply of skilled workmen may remain constant this is the dream of the labor trust on the part of the captains of labor  once in england after the great plague labor awoke to find there was more work for men than there were men to work  instead of workers competing for favors from employers employers were competing for favors from the workers  wages went up and up and continued to go up until the workers demanded the full product of their toil  now it is clear that when labor receives its full product capital must perish  and so the pygmy capitalists of that postplague day found their existence threatened by this untoward condition of affairs  to save themselves they set a maximum wage restrained the workers from moving about from place to place smashed incipient organization refused to tolerate idlers and by most barbarous legal penalties punished those who disobeyed  after that things went on as before  the point of this of course is to demonstrate the need of the surplus labor army  without such an army our present capitalist society would be powerless  labor would organize as it never organized before and the last least worker would be gathered into the unions  the full product of toil would be demanded and capitalist society would crumble away  nor could capitalist society save itself as did the postplague capitalist society  the time is past when a handful of masters by imprisonment and barbarous punishment can drive the legions of the workers to their tasks  without a surplus labor army the courts police and military are impotent  in such matters the function of the courts police and military is to preserve order and to fill the places of strikers with surplus labor  if there be no surplus labor to instate there is no function to perform for disorder arises only during the process of instatement when the striking labor army and the surplus labor army clash together  that is to say that which maintains the integrity of the present industrial society more potently than the courts police and military is the surplus labor army                                        it has been shown that there are more men than there is work for men and that the surplus labor army is an economic necessity  to show how the tramp is a byproduct of this economic necessity it is necessary to inquire into the composition of the surplus labor army  what men form it  why are they there  what do they do  in the first place since the workers must compete for employment it inevitably follows that it is the fit and efficient who find employment the skilled worker holds his place by virtue of his skill and efficiency were he less skilled or were he unreliable or erratic he would be swiftly replaced by a stronger competitor  the skilled and steady employments are not cumbered with clowns and idiots  a man finds his place according to his ability and the needs of the system and those without ability or incapable of satisfying the needs of the system have no place  thus the poor telegrapher may develop into an excellent woodchopper  but if the poor telegrapher cherishes the delusion that he is a good telegrapher and at the same time disdains all other employments he will have no employment at all or he will be so poor at all other employments that he will work only now and again in lieu of better men  he will be among the first let off when times are dull and among the last taken on when times are good  or to the point he will be a member of the surplus labor army  so the conclusion is reached that the less fit and less efficient or the unfit and inefficient compose the surplus labor army  here are to be found the men who have tried and failed the men who cannot hold jobsthe plumber apprentice who could not become a journeyman and the plumber journeyman too clumsy and dull to retain employment switchmen who wreck trains clerks who cannot balance books blacksmiths who lame horses lawyers who cannot plead in short the failures of every trade and profession and failures many of them in divers trades and professions  failure is writ large and in their wretchedness they bear the stamp of social disapprobation  common work any kind of work wherever or however they can obtain it is their portion  but these hereditary inefficients do not alone compose the surplus labor army  there are the skilled but unsteady and unreliable men and the old men once skilled but with dwindling powers no longer skilled 3 and there are good men too splendidly skilled and efficient but thrust out of the employment of dying or disastersmitten industries  in this connection it is not out of place to note the misfortune of the workers in the british iron trades who are suffering because of american inroads  and last of all are the unskilled laborers the hewers of wood and drawers of water the ditchdiggers the men of pick and shovel the helpers lumpers roustabouts  if trade is slack on a seacoast of two thousand miles or the harvests are light in a great interior valley myriads of these laborers lie idle or make life miserable for their fellows in kindred unskilled employments  a constant filtration goes on in the working world and good material is continually drawn from the surplus labor army  strikes and industrial dislocations shake up the workers bring good men to the surface and sink men as good or not so good  the hope of the skilled striker is in that the scabs are less skilled or less capable of becoming skilled yet each strike attests to the efficiency that lurks beneath  after the pullman strike a few thousand railroad men were chagrined to find the work they had flung down taken up by men as good as themselves  but one thing must be considered here  under the present system if the weakest and least fit were as strong and fit as the best and the best were correspondingly stronger and fitter the same condition would obtain  there would be the same army of employed labor the same army of surplus labor  the whole thing is relative  there is no absolute standard of efficiency                                        comes now the tramp  and all conclusions may be anticipated by saying at once that he is a tramp because some one has to be a tramp  if he left the road and became a very efficient common laborer some ordinarily efficient common laborer would have to take to the road  the nooks and crannies are crowded by the surplus laborers and when the first snow flies and the tramps are driven into the cities things become overcrowded and stringent police regulations are necessary  the tramp is one of two kinds of men he is either a discouraged worker or a discouraged criminal  now a discouraged criminal on investigation proves to be a discouraged worker or the descendant of discouraged workers so that in the last analysis the tramp is a discouraged worker  since there is not work for all discouragement for some is unavoidable  how then does this process of discouragement operate  the lower the employment in the industrial scale the harder the conditions  the finer the more delicate the more skilled the trade the higher is it lifted above the struggle  there is less pressure less sordidness less savagery  there are fewer glassblowers proportionate to the needs of the glassblowing industry than there are ditchdiggers proportionate to the needs of the ditchdigging industry  and not only this for it requires a glassblower to take the place of a striking glassblower while any kind of a striker or outofwork can take the place of a ditchdigger  so the skilled trades are more independent have more individuality and latitude  they may confer with their masters make demands assert themselves  the unskilled laborers on the other hand have no voice in their affairs  the settlement of terms is none of their business  free contract is all that remains to them they may take what is offered or leave it  there are plenty more of their kind  they do not count  they are members of the surplus labor army and must be content with a handtomouth existence  the reward is likewise proportioned  the strong fit worker in a skilled trade where there is little labor pressure is well compensated  he is a king compared with his less fortunate brothers in the unskilled occupations where the labor pressure is great  the mediocre worker not only is forced to be idle a large portion of the time but when employed is forced to accept a pittance  a dollar a day on some days and nothing on other days will hardly support a man and wife and send children to school  and not only do the masters bear heavily upon him and his own kind struggle for the morsel at his mouth but all skilled and organized labor adds to his woe  union men do not scab on one another but in strikes or when work is slack it is considered fair for them to descend and take away the work of the common laborers  and take it away they do for as a matter of fact a wellfed ambitious machinist or a coremaker will transiently shovel coal better than an illfed spiritless laborer  thus there is no encouragement for the unfit inefficient and mediocre their very inefficiency and mediocrity make them helpless as cattle and add to their misery  and the whole tendency for such is downward until at the bottom of the social pit they are wretched inarticulate beasts living like beasts breeding like beasts dying like beasts  and how do they fare these creatures born mediocre whose heritage is neither brains nor brawn nor endurance  they are sweated in the slums in an atmosphere of discouragement and despair  there is no strength in weakness no encouragement in foul air vile food and dank dens  they are there because they are so made that they are not fit to be higher up but filth and obscenity do not strengthen the neck nor does chronic emptiness of belly stiffen the back  for the mediocre there is no hope  mediocrity is a sin  poverty is the penalty of failurepoverty from whose loins spring the criminal and the tramp both failures both discouraged workers  poverty is the inferno where ignorance festers and vice corrodes and where the physical mental and moral parts of nature are aborted and denied  that the charge of rashness in splashing the picture be not incurred let the following authoritative evidence be considered first the work and wages of mediocrity and inefficiency and second the habitat  the new york sun of february 28 1901 describes the opening of a factory in new york city by the american tobacco company  cheroots were to be made in this factory in competition with other factories which refused to be absorbed by the trust  the trust advertised for girls  the crowd of men and boys who wanted work was so great in front of the building that the police were forced with their clubs to clear them away  the wage paid the girls was 250 per week sixty cents of which went for car fare 4  miss nellie mason auten a graduate student of the department of sociology at the university of chicago recently made a thorough investigation of the garment trades of chicago  her figures were published in the american journal of sociology and commented upon by the literary digest  she found women working ten hours a day six days a week for forty cents per week a rate of twothirds of a cent an hour many women earned less than a dollar a week and none of them worked every week  the following table will best

josiah flynt is on the tramp furnishes the following chicago experience      many of the men were so weakened by the want and hardship of the     winter that they were no longer in condition for effective labor     some of the bosses who were in need of added hands were obliged to     turn men away because of physical incapacity  one instance of this i     shall not soon forget  it was when i overheard early one morning at     a factory gate an interview between a wouldbe laborer and the boss     i knew the applicant for a russian jew who had at home an old mother     and a wife and two young children to support  he had had     intermittent employment throughout the winter in a sweaters den 5     barely enough to keep them all alive and after the hardships of the     cold season he was again in desperate straits for work      the boss had all but agreed to take him on for some sort of     unskilled labor when struck by the cadaverous look of the man he     told him to bare his arm  up went the sleeve of his coat and his     ragged flannel shirt exposing a naked arm with the muscles nearly     gone and the bluewhite transparent skin stretched over sinews and     the outlines of the bones  pitiful beyond words was his effort to     give a semblance of strength to the biceps which rose faintly to the     upward movement of the forearm  but the boss sent him off with an     oath and a contemptuous laugh and i watched the fellow as he turned     down the street facing the fact of his starving family with a     despair at his heart which only mortal man can feel and no mortal     tongue can speak  concerning habitat mr jacob riis has stated that in new york city in the block bounded by stanton houston attorney and ridge streets the size of which is 200 by 300 there is a warren of 2244 human beings  in the block bounded by sixtyfirst and sixtysecond streets and amsterdam and west end avenues are over four thousand human creaturesquite a comfortable new england village to crowd into one city block  the rev dr behrends speaking of the block bounded by canal hester eldridge and forsyth streets says in a room 12 by 8 and 55 feet high it was found that nine persons slept and prepared their food    in another room located in a dark cellar without screens or partitions were together two men with their wives and a girl of fourteen two single men and a boy of seventeen two women and four boysnine ten eleven and fifteen years oldfourteen persons in all  here humanity rots  its victims with grim humor call it tenanthouse rot  or as a legislative report puts it here infantile life unfolds its bud but perishes before its first anniversary  here youth is ugly with loathsome disease and the deformities which follow physical degeneration  these are the men and women who are what they are because they were not better born or because they happened to be unluckily born in time and space  gauged by the needs of the system they are weak and worthless the hospital and the paupers grave await them and they offer no encouragement to the mediocre worker who has failed higher up in the industrial structure  such a worker conscious that he has failed conscious from the hard fact that he cannot obtain work in the higher employments finds several courses open to him  he may come down and be a beast in the social pit for instance but if he be of a certain caliber the effect of the social pit will be to discourage him from work  in his blood a rebellion will quicken and he will elect to become either a felon or a tramp  if he have fought the hard fight he is not unacquainted with the lure of the road  when out of work and still undiscouraged he has been forced to hit the road between large cities in his quest for a job  he has loafed seen the country and green things laughed in joy lain on his back and listened to the birds singing overhead unannoyed by factory whistles and bosses harsh commands and most significant of all he has lived  that is the point  he has not starved to death  not only has he been carefree and happy but he has lived  and from the knowledge that he has idled and is still alive he achieves a new outlook on life and the more he experiences the unenviable lot of the poor worker the more the blandishments of the road take hold of him  and finally he flings his challenge in the face of society imposes a valorous boycott on all work and joins the farwanderers of hoboland the gypsy folk of this latter day  but the tramp does not usually come from the slums  his place of birth is ordinarily a bit above and sometimes a very great bit above  a confessed failure he yet refuses to accept the punishment and swerves aside from the slum to vagabondage  the average beast in the social pit is either too much of a beast or too much of a slave to the bourgeois ethics and ideals of his masters to manifest this flicker of rebellion but the social pit out of its discouragement and viciousness breeds criminals men who prefer being beasts of prey to being beasts of work and the mediocre criminal in turn the unfit and inefficient criminal is discouraged by the strong arm of the law and goes over to trampdom  these men the discouraged worker and the discouraged criminal voluntarily withdraw themselves from the struggle for work  industry does not need them  there are no factories shut down through lack of labor no projected railroads unbuilt for want of pickandshovel men women are still glad to toil for a dollar a week and men and boys to clamor and fight for work at the factory gates  no one misses these discouraged men and in going away they have made it somewhat easier for those that remain                                        so the case stands thus there being more men than there is work for men to do a surplus labor army inevitably results  the surplus labor army is an economic necessity without it present society would fall to pieces  into the surplus labor army are herded the mediocre the inefficient the unfit and those incapable of satisfying the industrial needs of the system  the struggle for work between the members of the surplus labor army is sordid and savage and at the bottom of the social pit the struggle is vicious and beastly  this struggle tends to discouragement and the victims of this discouragement are the criminal and the tramp  the tramp is not an economic necessity such as the surplus labor army but he is the byproduct of an economic necessity  the road is one of the safetyvalves through which the waste of the social organism is given off  and being given off constitutes the negative function of the tramp  society as at present organized makes much waste of human life  this waste must be eliminated  chloroform or electrocution would be a simple merciful solution of this problem of elimination but the ruling ethics while permitting the human waste will not permit a humane elimination of that waste  this paradox demonstrates the irreconcilability of theoretical ethics and industrial need  and so the tramp becomes selfeliminating  and not only self  since he is manifestly unfit for things as they are and since kind is prone to beget kind it is necessary that his kind cease with him that his progeny shall not be that he play the eunuchs part in this twentieth century after christ  and he plays it  he does not breed  sterility is his portion as it is the portion of the woman on the street  they might have been mates but society has decreed otherwise  and while it is not nice that these men should die it is ordained that they must die and we should not quarrel with them if they cumber our highways and kitchen stoops with their perambulating carcasses  this is a form of elimination we not only countenance but compel  therefore let us be cheerful and honest about it  let us be as stringent as we please with our police regulations but for goodness sake let us refrain from telling the tramp to go to work  not only is it unkind but it is untrue and hypocritical  we know there is no work for him  as the scapegoat to our economic and industrial sinning or to the plan of things if you will we should give him credit  let us be just  he is so made society made him  he did not make himself     the scab   in a competitive society where men struggle with one another for food and shelter what is more natural than that generosity when it diminishes the food and shelter of men other than he who is generous should be held an accursed thing  wise old saws to the contrary he who takes from a mans purse takes from his existence  to strike at a mans food and shelter is to strike at his life and in a society organized on a toothandnail basis such an act performed though it may be under the guise of generosity is none the less menacing and terrible  it is for this reason that a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours  to hold his place which is to live he must offset this offer by another equally liberal which is equivalent to giving away somewhat from the food and shelter he enjoys  to sell his days work for 2 instead of 250 means that he his wife and his children will not have so good a roof over their heads so warm clothes on their backs so substantial food in their stomachs  meat will be bought less frequently and it will be tougher and less nutritious stout new shoes will go less often on the childrens feet and disease and death will be more imminent in a cheaper house and neighborhood  thus the generous laborer giving more of a days work for less return measured in terms of food and shelter threatens the life of his less generous brother laborer and at the best if he does not destroy that life he diminishes it  whereupon the less generous laborer looks upon him as an enemy and as men are inclined to do in a toothandnail society he tries to kill the man who is trying to kill him  when a striker kills with a brick the man who has taken his place he has no sense of wrongdoing  in the deepest holds of his being though he does not reason the impulse he has an ethical sanction  he feels dimly that he has justification just as the homedefending boer felt though more sharply with each bullet he fired at the invading english  behind every brick thrown by a striker is the selfish will to live of himself and the slightly altruistic will to live of his family  the family group came into the world before the state group and society being still on the primitive basis of tooth and nail the will to live of the state is not so compelling to the striker as is the will to live of his family and himself  in addition to the use of bricks clubs and bullets the selfish laborer finds it necessary to express his feelings in speech  just as the peaceful countrydweller calls the searover a pirate and the stout burgher calls the man who breaks into his strongbox a robber so the selfish laborer applies the opprobrious epithet a scab to the laborer who takes from him food and shelter by being more generous in the disposal of his labor power  the sentimental connotation of scab is as terrific as that of traitor or judas and a sentimental definition would be as deep and varied as the human heart  it is far easier to arrive at what may be called a technical definition worded in commercial terms as for instance that a scab is one who gives more value for the same price than another  the laborer who gives more time or strength or skill for the same wage than another or equal time or strength or skill for a less wage is a scab  this generousness on his part is hurtful to his fellowlaborers for it compels them to an equal generousness which is not to their liking and which gives them less of food and shelter  but a word may be said for the scab  just as his act makes his rivals compulsorily generous so do they by fortune of birth and training make compulsory his act of generousness  he does not scab because he wants to scab  no whim of the spirit no burgeoning of the heart leads him to give more of his labor power than they for a certain sum  it is because he cannot get work on the same terms as they that he is a scab  there is less work than there are men to do work  this is patent else the scab would not loom so large on the labormarket horizon because they are stronger than he or more skilled or more energetic it is impossible for him to take their places at the same wage  to take their places he must give more value must work longer hours or receive a smaller wage  he does so and he cannot help it for his will to live is driving him on as well as they are being driven on by their will to live and to live he must win food and shelter which he can do only by receiving permission to work from some man who owns a bit of land or a piece of machinery  and to receive permission from this man he must make the transaction profitable for him  viewed in this light the scab who gives more labor power for a certain price than his fellows is not so generous after all  he is no more generous with his energy than the chattel slave and the convict laborer who by the way are the almost perfect scabs  they give their labor power for about the minimum possible price  but within limits they may loaf and malinger and as scabs are exceeded by the machine which never loafs and malingers and which is the ideally perfect scab  it is not nice to be a scab  not only is it not in good social taste and comradeship but from the standpoint of food and shelter it is bad business policy  nobody desires to scab to give most for least  the ambition of every individual is quite the opposite to give least for most and as a result living in a toothandnail society battle royal is waged by the ambitious individuals  but in its most salient aspect that of the struggle over the division of the joint product it is no longer a battle between individuals but between groups of individuals capital and labor apply themselves to raw material make something useful out of it add to its value and then proceed to quarrel over the division of the added value  neither cares to give most for least  each is intent on giving less than the other and on receiving more  labor combines into its unions capital into partnerships associations corporations and trusts  a groupstruggle is the result in which the individuals as individuals play no part  the brotherhood of carpenters and joiners for instance serves notice on the master builders association that it demands an increase of the wage of its members from 350 a day to 4 and a saturday halfholiday without pay  this means that the carpenters are trying to give less for more  where they received 21 for six full days they are endeavoring to get 22 for five days and a halfthat is they will work half a day less each week and receive a dollar more  also they expect the saturday halfholiday to give work to one additional man for each eleven previously employed  this last affords a splendid example of the development of the group idea  in this particular struggle the individual has no chance at all for life  the individual carpenter would be crushed like a mote by the master builders association and like a mote the individual master builder would be crushed by the brotherhood of carpenters and joiners  in the groupstruggle over the division of the joint product labor utilizes the union with its two great weapons the strike and the boycott while capital utilizes the trust and the association the weapons of which are the blacklist the lockout and the scab  the scab is by far the most formidable weapon of the three  he is the man who breaks strikes and causes all the trouble  without him there would be no trouble for the strikers are willing to remain out peacefully and indefinitely so long as other men are not in their places and so long as the particular aggregation of capital with which they are fighting is eating its head off in enforced idleness  but both warring groups have reserve weapons  were it not for the scab these weapons would not be brought into play  but the scab takes the place of the striker who begins at once to wield a most powerful weapon terrorism  the will to live of the scab recoils from the menace of broken bones and violent death  with all due respect to the labor leaders who are not to be blamed for volubly asseverating otherwise terrorism is a welldefined and eminently successful policy of the labor unions  it has probably won them more strikes than all the rest of the weapons in their arsenal  this terrorism however must be clearly understood  it is directed solely against the scab placing him in such fear for life and limb as to drive him out of the contest  but when terrorism gets out of hand and inoffensive noncombatants are injured law and order threatened and property destroyed it becomes an edged tool that cuts both ways  this sort of terrorism is sincerely deplored by the labor leaders for it has probably lost them as many strikes as have been lost by any other single cause  the scab is powerless under terrorism  as a rule he is not so good nor gritty a man as the men he is displacing and he lacks their fighting organization  he stands in dire need of stiffening and backing  his employers the capitalists draw their two remaining weapons the ownership of which is debatable but which they for the time being happen to control  these two weapons may be called the political and judicial machinery of society  when the scab crumples up and is ready to go down before the fists bricks and bullets of the labor group the capitalist group puts the police and soldiers into the field and begins a general bombardment of injunctions  victory usually follows for the labor group cannot withstand the combined assault of gatling guns and injunctions  but it has been noted that the ownership of the political and judicial machinery of society is debatable  in the titanic struggle over the division of the joint product each group reaches out for every available weapon  nor are they blinded by the smoke of conflict  they fight their battles as coolly and collectedly as ever battles were fought on paper the capitalist group has long since realized the immense importance of controlling the political and judicial machinery of society  taught by gatlings and injunctions which have smashed many an otherwise successful strike the labor group is beginning to realize that it all depends upon who is behind and who is before the gatlings and the injunctions  and he who knows the labor movement knows that there is slowly growing up and being formulated a clear and definite policy for the capture of the political and judicial machinery  this is the terrible spectre which mr john graham brooks sees looming portentously over the twentieth century world  no man may boast a more intimate knowledge of the labor movement than he and he reiterates again and again the dangerous likelihood of the whole labor group capturing the political machinery of society  as he says in his recent book 6 it is not probable that employers can destroy unionism in the united states adroit and desperate attempts will however be made if we mean by unionism the undisciplined and aggressive fact of vigorous and determined organizations  if capital should prove too strong in this struggle the result is easy to predict  the employers have only to convince organized labor that it cannot hold its own against the capitalist manager and the whole energy that now goes to the union will turn to an aggressive political socialism  it will not be the harmless sympathy with increased city and state functions which trade unions already feel it will become a turbulent political force bent upon using every weapon of taxation against the rich  this struggle not to be a scab to avoid giving more for less and to succeed in giving less for more is more vital than it would appear on the surface  the capitalist and labor groups are locked together in desperate battle and neither side is swayed by moral considerations more than skindeep  the labor group hires business agents lawyers and organizers and is beginning to intimidate legislators by the strength of its solid vote and more directly in the near future it will attempt to control legislation by capturing it bodily through the ballotbox  on the other hand the capitalist group numerically weaker hires newspapers universities and legislatures and strives to bend to its need all the forces which go to mould public opinion  the only honest morality displayed by either side is whitehot indignation at the iniquities of the other side  the striking teamster complacently takes a scab driver into an alley and with an iron bar breaks his arms so that he can drive no more but cries out to high heaven for justice when the capitalist breaks his skull by means of a club in the hands of a policeman  nay the members of a union will declaim in impassioned rhetoric for the godgiven right of an eighthour day and at the time be working their own business agent seventeen hours out of the twentyfour  a capitalist such as collis p huntington and his name is legion after a long life spent in buying the aid of countless legislatures will wax virtuously wrathful and condemn in unmeasured terms the dangerous tendency of crying out to the government for aid in the way of labor legislation  without a quiver a member of the capitalist group will run tens of thousands of pitiful childlaborers through his lifedestroying cotton factories and weep maudlin and constitutional tears over one scab hit in the back with a brick  he will drive a compulsory free contract with an unorganized laborer on the basis of a starvation wage saying take it or leave it knowing that to leave it means to die of hunger and in the next breath when the organizer entices that laborer into a union will storm patriotically about the inalienable right of all men to work  in short the chief moral concern of either side is with the morals of the other side  they are not in the business for their moral welfare but to achieve the enviable position of the nonscab who gets more than he gives  but there is more to the question than has yet been discussed  the labor scab is no more detestable to his brother laborers than is the capitalist scab to his brother capitalists  a capitalist may get most for least in dealing with his laborers and in so far be a nonscab but at the same time in his dealings with his fellowcapitalists he may give most for least and be the very worst kind of scab  the most heinous crime an employer of labor can commit is to scab on his fellowemployers of labor just as the individual laborers have organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab laborer so have the employers organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab employer  the employers federations associations and trusts are nothing more nor less than unions  they are organized to destroy scabbing amongst themselves and to encourage scabbing amongst others for this reason they pool interests determine prices and present an unbroken and aggressive front to the labor group  as has been said before nobody likes to play the compulsorily generous role of scab  it is a bad business proposition on the face of it  and it is patent that there would be no capitalist scabs if there were not more capital than there is work for capital to do  when there are enough factories in existence to supply with occasional stoppages a certain commodity the building of new factories by a rival concern for the production of that commodity is plain advertisement that that capital is out of a job  the first act of this new aggregation of capital will be to cut prices to give more for lessin short to scab to strike at the very existence of the less generous aggregation of capital the work of which it is trying to do  no scab capitalist strives to give more for less for any other reason than that he hopes by undercutting a competitor and driving that competitor out of the market to get that market and its profits for himself  his ambition is to achieve the day when he shall stand alone in the field both as buyer and sellerwhen he will be the royal nonscab buying most for least selling least for most and reducing all about him the small buyers and sellers the consumers and the laborers to a general condition of scabdom  this for example has been the history of mr rockefeller and the standard oil company  through all the sordid villanies of scabdom he has passed until today he is a most regal nonscab  however to continue in this enviable position he must be prepared at a moments notice to go scabbing again  and he is prepared whenever a competitor arises mr rockefeller changes about from giving least for most and gives most for least with such a vengeance as to drive the competitor out of existence  the banded capitalists discriminate against a scab capitalist by refusing him trade advantages and by combining against him in most relentless fashion  the banded laborers discriminating against a scab laborer in more primitive fashion with a club are no more merciless than the banded capitalists  mr casson tells of a new york capitalist who withdrew from the sugar union several years ago and became a scab  he was worth something like twenty millions of dollars  but the sugar union standing shoulder to shoulder with the railroad union and several other unions beat him to his knees till he cried enough  so frightfully did they beat him that he was obliged to turn over to his creditors his home his chickens and his gold watch  in point of fact he was as thoroughly bludgeoned by the federation of capitalist unions as ever scab workman was bludgeoned by a labor union  the intent in either case is the sameto destroy the scabs producing power  the labor scab with concussion of the brain is put out of business and so is the capitalist scab who has lost all his dollars down to his chickens and his watch  but the role of scab passes beyond the individual  just as individuals scab on other individuals so do groups scab on other groups  and the principle involved is precisely the same as in the case of the simple labor scab  a group in the nature of its organization is often compelled to give most for least and so doing to strike at the life of another group  at the present moment all europe is appalled by that colossal scab the united states  and europe is clamorous with agitation for a federation of national unions to protect her from the united states  it may be remarked in passing that in its prime essentials this agitation in no wise differs from the tradeunion agitation among workmen in any industry  the trouble is caused by the scab who is giving most for least  the result of the american scabs nefarious actions will be to strike at the food and shelter of europe  the way for europe to protect herself is to quit bickering among her parts and to form a union against the scab  and if the union is formed armies and navies may be expected to be brought into play in fashion similar to the bricks and clubs in ordinary labor struggles  in this connection and as one of many walking delegates for the nations m leroybeaulieu the noted french economist may well be quoted  in a letter to the vienna tageblatt he advocates an economic alliance among the continental nations for the purpose of barring out american goods an economic alliance in his own language which may possibly and desirably develop into a political alliance  it will be noted in the utterances of the continental walking delegates that one and all they leave england out of the proposed union  and in england herself the feeling is growing that her days are numbered if she cannot unite for offence and defence with the great american scab  as andrew carnegie said some time ago the only course for great britain seems to be reunion with her grandchild or sure decline to a secondary place and then to comparative insignificance in the future annals of the englishspeaking race  cecil rhodes speaking of what would have obtained but for the pigheadedness of george iii and of what will obtain when england and the united states are united said no cannon would   be fired on either hemisphere but by permission of the english race  it would seem that england fronted by the hostile continental union and flanked by the great american scab has nothing left but to join with the scab and play the historic labor role of armed pinkerton  granting the words of cecil rhodes the united states would be enabled to scab without let or hindrance on europe while england as professional strikebreaker and policeman destroyed the unions and kept order  all this may appear fantastic and erroneous but there is in it a soul of truth vastly more significant than it may seem  civilization may be expressed today in terms of tradeunionism  individual struggles have largely passed away but groupstruggles increase prodigiously  and the things for which the groups struggle are the same as of old  shorn of all subtleties and complexities the chief struggle of men and of groups of men is for food and shelter  and as of old they struggled with tooth and nail so today they struggle with teeth and nails elongated into armies and navies machines and economic advantages  under the definition that a scab is one who gives more value for the same price than another it would seem that society can be generally divided into the two classes of the scabs and the nonscabs  but on closer investigation however it will be seen that the nonscab is a vanishing quantity  in the social jungle everybody is preying upon everybody else  as in the case of mr rockefeller he who was a scab yesterday is a nonscab today and tomorrow may be a scab again  the woman stenographer or bookkeeper who receives forty dollars per month where a man was receiving seventyfive is a scab  so is the woman who does a mans work at a weavingmachine and the child who goes into the mill or factory  and the father who is scabbed out of work by the wives and children of other men sends his own wife and children to scab in order to save himself  when a publisher offers an author better royalties than other publishers have been paying him he is scabbing on those other publishers  the reporter on a newspaper who feels he should be receiving a larger salary for his work says so and is shown the door is replaced by a reporter who is a scab whereupon when the bellyneed presses the displaced reporter goes to another paper and scabs himself  the minister who hardens his heart to a call and waits for a certain congregation to offer him say 500 a year more often finds himself scabbed upon by another and more impecunious minister and the next time it is his turn to scab while a brother minister is hardening his heart to a call  the scab is everywhere  the professional strikebreakers who as a class receive large wages will scab on one another while scab unions are even formed to prevent scabbing upon scabs  there are nonscabs but they are usually born so and are protected by the whole might of society in the possession of their food and shelter king edward is such a type as are all individuals who receive hereditary foodandshelter privilegessuch as the present duke of bedford for instance who yearly receives 75000 from the good people of london because some former king gave some former ancestor of his the market privileges of covent garden  the irresponsible rich are likewise nonscabsand by them is meant that couponclipping class which hires its managers and brains to invest the money usually left it by its ancestors  outside these lucky creatures all the rest at one time or another in their lives are scabs at one time or another are engaged in giving more for a certain price than any one else  the meek professor in some endowed institution by his meek suppression of his convictions is giving more for his salary than gave the other and more outspoken professor whose chair he occupies  and when a political party dangles a full dinnerpail in the eyes of the toiling masses it is offering more for a vote than the dubious dollar of the opposing party  even a moneylender is not above taking a slightly lower rate of interest and saying nothing about it  such is the tangle of conflicting interests in a toothandnail society that people cannot avoid being scabs are often made so against their desires and are often unconsciously made so  when several trades in a certain locality demand and receive an advance in wages they are unwittingly making scabs of their fellowlaborers in that district who have received no advance in wages  in san francisco the barbers laundryworkers and milkwagon drivers received such an advance in wages  their employers promptly added the amount of this advance to the selling price of their wares  the price of shaves of washing and of milk went up  this reduced the purchasing power of the unorganized laborers and in point of fact reduced their wages and made them greater scabs  because the british laborer is disinclined to scabthat is because he restricts his output in order to give less for the wage he receivesit is to a certain extent made possible for the american capitalist who receives a less restricted output from his laborers to play the scab on the english capitalist  as a result of this of course combined with other causes the american capitalist and the american laborer are striking at the food and shelter of the english capitalist and laborer  the english laborer is starving today because among other things he is not a scab  he practises the policy of ca canny which may be defined as go easy  in order to get most for least in many trades he performs but from onefourth to onesixth of the labor he is well able to perform an instance of this is found in the building of the westinghouse electric works at manchester  the british limit per man was 400 bricks per day the westinghouse company imported a driving american contractor aided by half a dozen driving american foremen and the british bricklayer swiftly attained an average of 1800 bricks per day with a maximum of 2500 bricks for the plainest work  but the british laborers policy of ca canny which is the very honorable one of giving least for most and which is likewise the policy of the english capitalist is nevertheless frowned upon by the english capitalist whose business existence is threatened by the great american scab  from the rise of the factory system the english capitalist gladly embraced the opportunity wherever he found it of giving least for most he did it all over the world whenever he enjoyed a market monopoly and he did it at home with the laborers employed in his mills destroying them like flies till prevented within limits by the passage of the factory acts  some of the proudest fortunes of england today may trace their origin to the giving of least for most to the miserable slaves of the factory towns  but at the present time the english capitalist is outraged because his laborers are employing against him precisely the same policy he employed against them and which he would employ again did the chance present itself  yet ca canny is a disastrous thing to the british laborer  it has driven shipbuilding from england to scotland bottlemaking from scotland to belgium flintglassmaking from england to germany and today is steadily driving industry after industry to other countries  a correspondent from northampton wrote not long ago factories are working half and third time    there is no strike there is no real labor trouble but the masters and men are alike suffering from sheer lack of employment  markets which were once theirs are now american  it would seem that the unfortunate british laborer is twixt the devil and the deep sea  if he gives most for least he faces a frightful slavery such as marked the beginning of the factory system  if he gives least for most he drives industry away to other countries and has no work at all  but the union laborers of the united states have nothing of which to boast while according to their tradeunion ethics they have a great deal of which to be ashamed  they passionately preach short hours and big wages the shorter the hours and the bigger the wages the better their hatred for a scab is as terrible as the hatred of a patriot for a traitor of a christian for a judas  and in the face of all this they are as colossal scabs as the united states is a colossal scab  for all of their boasted unions and high labor ideals they are about the most thoroughgoing scabs on the planet  receiving 450 per day because of his proficiency and immense working power the american laborer has been known to scab upon scabs so called who took his place and received only 090 per day for a longer day  in this particular instance five chinese coolies working longer hours gave less value for the price received from their employer than did one american laborer  it is upon his brother laborers overseas that the american laborer most outrageously scabs  as mr casson has shown an english nailmaker gets 3 per week while an american nailmaker gets 30  but the english worker turns out 200 pounds of nails per week while the american turns out 5500 pounds  if he were as fair as his english brother other things being equal he would be receiving at the english workers rate of pay 8250  as it is he is scabbing upon his english brother to the tune of 7950 per week  dr schultzegaevernitz has shown that a german weaver produces 466 yards of cotton a week at a cost of 303 per yard while an american weaver produces 1200 yards at a cost of 02 per yard  but it may be objected a great part of this is due to the more improved american machinery  very true but none the less a great part is still due to the superior energy skill and willingness of the american laborer  the english laborer is faithful to the policy of ca canny he refuses pointblank to get the work out of a machine that the new world scab gets out of a machine  mr maxim observing a wasteful handlabor process in his english factory invented a machine which he proved capable of displacing several men  but workman after workman was put at the machine and without exception they turned out neither more nor less than a workman turned out by hand  they obeyed the mandate of the union and went easy while mr maxim gave up in despair  nor will the british workman run machines at as high speed as the american nor will he run so many  an american workman will give equal attention simultaneously to three four or six machines or tools while the british workman is compelled by his trade union to limit his attention to one so that employment may be given to half a dozen men  but for scabbing no blame attaches itself anywhere  with rare exceptions all the people in the world are scabs  the strong capable workman gets a job and holds it because of his strength and capacity and he holds it because out of his strength and capacity he gives a better value for his wage than does the weaker and less capable workman therefore he is scabbing upon his weaker and less capable brother workman  he is giving more value for the price paid by the employer  the superior workman scabs upon the inferior workman because he is so constituted and cannot help it  the one by fortune of birth and upbringing is strong and capable the other by fortune of birth and upbringing is not so strong nor capable  it is for the same reason that one country scabs upon another  that country which has the good fortune to possess great natural resources a finer sun and soil unhampering institutions and a deft and intelligent labor class and capitalist class is bound to scab upon a country less fortunately situated  it is the good fortune of the united states that is making her the colossal scab just as it is the good fortune of one man to be born with a straight back while his brother is born with a hump  it is not good to give most for least not good to be a scab  the word has gained universal opprobrium  on the other hand to be a nonscab to give least for most is universally branded as stingy selfish and unchristianlike  so all the world like the british workman is twixt the devil and the deep sea  it is treason to ones fellows to scab it is unchristianlike not to scab  since to give least for most and to give most for least are universally bad what remains  equity remains which is to give like for like the same for the same neither more nor less  but this equity society as at present constituted cannot give  it is not in the nature of presentday society for men to give like for like the same for the same and so long as men continue to live in this competitive society struggling tooth and nail with one another for food and shelter which is to struggle tooth and nail with one another for life that long will the scab continue to exist  his will to live will force him to exist he may be flouted and jeered by his brothers he may be beaten with bricks and clubs by the men who by superior strength and capacity scab upon him as he scabs upon them by longer hours and smaller wages but through it all he will persist giving a bit more of most for least than they are giving     the question of the maximum   for any social movement or development there must be a maximum limit beyond which it cannot proceed  that civilization which does not advance must decline and so when the maximum of development has been reached in any given direction society must either retrograde or change the direction of its advance  there are many families of men that have failed in the critical period of their economic evolution to effect a change in direction and were forced to fall back  vanquished at the moment of their maximum they have dropped out of the whirl of the world there was no room for them  stronger competitors have taken their places and they have either rotted into oblivion or remain to be crushed under the iron heel of the dominant races in as remorseless a struggle as the world has yet witnessed  but in this struggle fair women and chivalrous men will play no part  types and ideals have changed  helens and launcelots are anachronisms  blows will be given and taken and men fight and die but not for faiths and altars  shrines will be desecrated but they will be the shrines not of temples but marketplaces  prophets will arise but they will be the prophets of prices and products  battles will be waged not for honor and glory nor for thrones and sceptres but for dollars and cents and for marts and exchanges  brain and not brawn will endure and the captains of war will be commanded by the captains of industry  in short it will be a contest for the mastery of the worlds commerce and for industrial supremacy  it is more significant this struggle into which we have plunged for the fact that it is the first struggle to involve the globe  no general movement of man has been so widespreading so farreaching  quite local was the supremacy of any ancient people likewise the rise to empire of macedonia and rome the waves of arabian valor and fanaticism and the mediaeval crusades to the holy sepulchre  but since those times the planet has undergone a unique shrinkage  the world of homer limited by the coastlines of the mediterranean and black seas was a far vaster world than ours of today which we weigh measure and compute as accurately and as easily as if it were a childs playball  steam has made its parts accessible and drawn them closer together  the telegraph annihilates space and time  each morning every part knows what every other part is thinking contemplating or doing  a discovery in a german laboratory is being demonstrated in san francisco within twentyfour hours  a book written in south africa is published by simultaneous copyright in every englishspeaking country and on the day following is in the hands of the translators  the death of an obscure missionary in china or of a whiskeysmuggler in the south seas is served the world over with the morning toast  the wheat output of argentine or the gold of klondike are known wherever men meet and trade shrinkage or centralization has become such that the humblest clerk in any metropolis may place his hand on the pulse of the world  the planet has indeed grown very small and because of this no vital movement can remain in the clime or country where it takes its rise  and so today the economic and industrial impulse is worldwide  it is a matter of import to every people  none may be careless of it  to do so is to perish  it is become a battle the fruits of which are to the strong and to none but the strongest of the strong  as the movement approaches its maximum centralization accelerates and competition grows keener and closer  the competitor nations cannot all succeed  so long as the movement continues its present direction not only will there not be room for all but the room that is will become less and less and when the moment of the maximum is at hand there will be no room at all capitalistic production will have overreached itself and a change of direction will then be inevitable  divers queries arise what is the maximum of commercial development the world can sustain  how far can it be exploited  how much capital is necessary  can sufficient capital be accumulated  a brief resume of the industrial history of the last one hundred years or so will be relevant at this stage of the discussion  capitalistic production in its modern significance was born of the industrial revolution in england in the latter half of the eighteenth century  the great inventions of that period were both its father and its mother while as mr brooks adams has shown the looted treasure of india was the potent midwife  had there not been an unwonted increase of capital the impetus would not have been given to invention while even steam might have languished for generations instead of at once becoming as it did the most prominent factor in the new method of production  the improved application of these inventions in the first decades of the nineteenth century mark the transition from the domestic to the factory system of manufacture and inaugurated the era of capitalism  the magnitude of this revolution is manifested by the fact that england alone had invented the means and equipped herself with the machinery whereby she could overstock the worlds markets  the home market could not consume a tithe of the home product  to manufacture this home product she had sacrificed her agriculture  she must buy her food from abroad and to do so she must sell her goods abroad  but the struggle for commercial supremacy had not yet really begun england was without a rival  her navies controlled the sea  her armies and her insular position gave her peace at home  the world was hers to exploit  for nearly fifty years she dominated the european american and indian trade while the great wars then convulsing society were destroying possible competitive capital and straining consumption to its utmost  the pioneer of the industrial nations she thus received such a start in the new race for wealth that it is only today the other nations have succeeded in overtaking her  in 1820 the volume of her trade imports and exports was 68000000 pounds  in 1899 it had increased to 815000000 poundsan increase of 1200 per cent in the volume of trade  for nearly one hundred years england has been producing surplus value she has been producing far more than she consumes and this excess has swelled the volume of her capital  this capital has been invested in her enterprises at home and abroad and in her shipping  in 1898 the stock exchange estimated british capital invested abroad at 1900000000 pounds  but hand in hand with her foreign investments have grown her adverse balances of trade  for the ten years ending with 1868 her average yearly adverse balance was 52000000 pounds ending with 1878 81000000 pounds ending with 1888 101000000 pounds and ending with 1898 133000000 pounds  in the single year of 1897 it reached the portentous sum of 157000000 pounds  but englands adverse balances of trade in themselves are nothing at which to be frightened  hitherto they have been paid from out the earnings of her shipping and the interest on her foreign investments but what does cause anxiety however is that relative to the trade development of other countries her export trade is falling off without a corresponding diminution of her imports and that her securities and foreign holdings do not seem able to stand the added strain  these she is being forced to sell in order to pull even  as the london times gloomily remarks we are entering the twentieth century on the down grade after a prolonged period of business activity high wages high profits and overflowing revenue  in other words the mighty grasp england held over the resources and capital of the world is being relaxed  the control of its commerce and banking is slipping through her fingers  the sale of her foreign holdings advertises the fact that other nations are capable of buying them and further that these other nations are busily producing surplus value  the movement has become general  today passing from country to country an everincreasing tide of capital is welling up  production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself  it used to be that the impoverished or undeveloped nations turned to england when it came to borrowing but now germany is competing keenly with her in this matter  france is not averse to lending great sums to russia and austriahungary has capital and to spare for foreign holdings  nor has the united states failed to pass from the side of the debtor to that of the creditor nations  she too has become wise in the way of producing surplus value  she has been successful in her efforts to secure economic emancipation  possessing but 5 per cent of the worlds population and producing 32 per cent of the worlds food supply she has been looked upon as the worlds farmer but now amidst general consternation she comes forward as the worlds manufacturer  in 1888 her manufactured exports amounted to 130300087 in 1896 to 253681541 in 1897 to 279652721 in 1898 to 307924994 in 1899 to 338667794 and in 1900 to 432000000  regarding her growing favorable balances of trade it may be noted that not only are her imports not increasing but they are actually falling off while her exports in the last decade have increased 724 per cent  in ten years her imports from europe have been reduced from 474000000 to 439000000 while in the same time her exports have increased from 682000000 to 1111000000  her balance of trade in her favor in 1895 was 75000000 in 1896 over 100000000 in 1897 nearly 300000000 in 1898 615000000 in 1899 530000000 and in 1900 648000000  in the matter of iron the united states which in 1840 had not dreamed of entering the field of international competition in 1897 as much to her own surprise as any one elses undersold the english in their own london market  in 1899 there was but one american locomotive in great britain but of the five hundred locomotives sold abroad by the united states in 1902 england bought more than any other country  russia is operating a thousand of them on her own roads today  in one instance the american manufacturers contracted to deliver a locomotive in four and onehalf months for 9250 the english manufacturers requiring twentyfour months for delivery at 14000  the clyde shipbuilders recently placed orders for 150000 tons of plates at a saving of 250000 and the american steel going into the making of the new london subway is taken as a matter of course  american tools stand above competition the world over  readymade boots and shoes are beginning to flood europethe same with machinery bicycles agricultural implements and all kinds of manufactured goods  a correspondent from hamburg speaking of the invasion of american trade says incidentally it may be remarked that the typewriting machine with which this article is written as well as the thousandsnay hundreds of thousandsof others that are in use throughout the world were made in america that it stands on an american table in an office furnished with american desks bookcases and chairs which cannot be made in europe of equal quality so practical and convenient for a similar price  in 1893 and 1894 because of the distrust of foreign capital the united states was forced to buy back american securities held abroad but in 1897 and 1898 she bought back american securities held abroad not because she had to but because she chose to  and not only has she bought back her own securities but in the last eight years she has become a buyer of the securities of other countries  in the money markets of london paris and berlin she is a lender of money  carrying the largest stock of gold in the world the world in moments of danger when crises of international finance loom large looks to her vast lending ability for safety  thus in a few swift years has the united states drawn up to the van where the great industrial nations are fighting for commercial and financial empire  the figures of the race in which she passed england are interesting   year                    united

stocks of the iron and steel mills listed on the berlin bourse fell  while europe has been talking and dreaming of the greatness which was the united states has been thinking and planning and doing for the greatness to be  her captains of industry and kings of finance have toiled and sweated at organizing and consolidating production and transportation  but this has been merely the developmental stage the tuningup of the orchestra  with the twentieth century rises the curtain on the playa play which shall have much in it of comedy and a vast deal of tragedy and which has been well named the capitalistic conquest of europe by america  nations do not die easily and one of the first moves of europe will be the erection of tariff walls  america however will fittingly reply for already her manufacturers are establishing works in france and germany  and when the german trade journals refused to accept american advertisements they found their country flamingly billboarded in buccaneer american fashion  m leroybeaulieu the french economist is passionately preaching a commercial combination of the whole continent against the united statesa commercial alliance which he boldly declares should become a political alliance  and in this he is not alone finding ready sympathy and ardent support in austria italy and germany  lord rosebery said in a recent speech before the wolverhampton chamber of commerce the americans with their vast and almost incalculable resources their acuteness and enterprise and their huge population which will probably be 100000000 in twenty years together with the plan they have adopted for putting accumulated wealth into great cooperative syndicates or trusts for the purpose of carrying on this great commercial warfare are the most formidable    rivals to be feared  the london times says it is useless to disguise the fact that great britain is being outdistanced  the competition does not come from the glut caused by miscalculation as to the home demand  our own steelmakers know better and are alarmed  the threatened competition in markets hitherto our own comes from efficiency in production such as never before has been seen  even the british naval supremacy is in danger continues the same paper for if we lose our engineering supremacy our naval supremacy will follow unless held on sufferance by our successful rivals  and the edinburgh evening news says with editorial gloom the iron and steel trades have gone from us  when the fictitious prosperity caused by the expenditure of our own government and that of european nations on armaments ceases half of the men employed in these industries will be turned into the streets  the outlook is appalling  what suffering will have to be endured before the workers realize that there is nothing left for them but emigration                                        that there must be a limit to the accumulation of capital is obvious the downward course of the rate of interest notwithstanding that many new employments have been made possible for capital indicates how large is the increase of surplus value  this decline of the interest rate is in accord with bohmbawerks law of diminishing returns  that is when capital like anything else has become overplentiful less lucrative use can only be found for the excess  this excess not being able to earn so much as when capital was less plentiful competes for safe investments and forces down the interest rate on all capital  mr charles a conant has well described the keenness of the scramble for safe investments even at the prevailing low rates of interest  at the close of the war with turkey the greek loan guaranteed by great britain france and russia was floated with striking ease  regardless of the small return the amount offered at paris 41000000 francs was subscribed for twentythree times over  great britain france germany holland and the scandinavian states of recent years have all engaged in converting their securities from 5 per cents to 4 per cents from 45 per cents to 35 per cents and the 35 per cents into 3 per cents  great britain france germany and austriahungary according to the calculation taken in 1895 by the international statistical institute hold fortysix billions of capital invested in negotiable securities alone  yet paris subscribed for her portion of the greek loan twentythree times over  in short money is cheap  andrew carnegie and his brother bourgeois kings give away millions annually but still the tide wells up  these vast accumulations have made possible wildcatting fraudulent combinations fake enterprises hooleyism but such stealings great though they be have little or no effect in reducing the volume  the time is past when startling inventions or revolutions in the method of production can break up the growing congestion yet this saved capital demands an outlet somewhere somehow  when a great nation has equipped itself to produce far more than it can under the present division of the product consume it seeks other markets for its surplus products  when a second nation finds itself similarly circumstanced competition for these other markets naturally follows  with the advent of a third a fourth a fifth and of divers other nations the question of the disposal of surplus products grows serious  and with each of these nations possessing over and beyond its active capital great and growing masses of idle capital and when the very foreign markets for which they are competing are beginning to produce similar wares for themselves the question passes the serious stage and becomes critical  never has the struggle for foreign markets been sharper than at the present  they are the one great outlet for congested accumulations predatory capital wanders the world over seeking where it may establish itself  this urgent need for foreign markets is forcing upon the worldstage an era of great colonial empire  but this does not stand as in the past for the subjugation of peoples and countries for the sake of gaining their products but for the privilege of selling them products the theory once was that the colony owed its existence and prosperity to the mother country but today it is the mother country that owes its existence and prosperity to the colony  and in the future when that supporting colony becomes wise in the way of producing surplus value and sends its goods back to sell to the mother country what then  then the world will have been exploited and capitalistic production will have attained its maximum development  foreign markets and undeveloped countries largely retard that moment the favored portions of the earths surface are already occupied though the resources of many are yet virgin  that they have not long since been wrested from the hands of the barbarous and decadent peoples who possess them is due not to the military prowess of such peoples but to the jealous vigilance of the industrial nations  the powers hold one another back  the turk lives because the way is not yet clear to an amicable division of him among the powers  and the united states supreme though she is opposes the partition of china and intervenes her huge bulk between the hungry nations and the mongrel spanish republics  capital stands in its own way welling up and welling up against the inevitable moment when it shall burst all bonds and sweep resistlessly across such vast stretches as china and south america  and then there will be no more worlds to exploit and capitalism will either fall back crushed under its own weight or a change of direction will take place which will mark a new era in history  the far east affords an illuminating spectacle  while the western nations are crowding hungrily in while the partition of china is commingled with the clamor for the spheres of influence and the open door other forces are none the less potently at work  not only are the young western peoples pressing the older ones to the wall but the east itself is beginning to awake  american trade is advancing and british trade is losing ground while japan china and india are taking a hand in the game themselves  in 1893 100000 pieces of american drills were imported into china in 1897 349000  in 1893 252000 pieces of american sheetings were imported against 71000 british but in 1897 566000 pieces of american sheetings were imported against only 10000 british  the cotton goods and yarn trade which forms 40 per cent of the whole trade with china shows a remarkable advance on the part of the united states  during the last ten years america has increased her importation of plain goods by 121 per cent in quantity and 595 per cent in value while that of england and india combined has decreased 1375 per cent in quantity and 8 per cent in value  lord charles beresford from whose breakup of china these figures are taken states that english yarn has receded and indian yarn advanced to the front  in 1897 140000 piculs of indian yarn were imported 18000 of japanese 4500 of shanghaimanufactured and 700 of english  japan who but yesterday emerged from the mediaeval rule of the shogunate and seized in one fell swoop the scientific knowledge and culture of the occident is already today showing what wisdom she has acquired in the production of surplus value and is preparing herself that she may tomorrow play the part to asia that england did to europe one hundred years ago  that the difference in the worlds affairs wrought by those one hundred years will prevent her succeeding is manifest but it is equally manifest that they cannot prevent her playing a leading part in the industrial drama which has commenced on the eastern stage  her imports into the port of newchang in 1891 amounted to but 22000 taels but in 1897 they had increased to 280000 taels  in manufactured goods from matches watches and clocks to the rolling stock of railways she has already given stiff shocks to her competitors in the asiatic markets and this while she is virtually yet in the equipment stage of production erelong she too will be furnishing her share to the growing mass of the worlds capital  as regards great britain the giant trader who has so long overshadowed asiatic commerce lord charles beresford says but competition is telling adversely the energy of the british merchant is being equalled by other nationals   the competition of the chinese and the introduction of steam into the country are also combining to produce changed conditions in china  but far more ominous is the plaintive note he sounds when he says new industries must be opened up and i would especially direct the attention of the chambers of commerce british to    the fact that the more the native competes with the british manufacturer in certain classes of trade the more machinery he will need and the orders for such machinery will come to this country if our machinery manufacturers are enterprising enough  the orient is beginning to show what an important factor it will become under western supervision in the creation of surplus value  even before the barriers which restrain western capital are removed the east will be in a fair way toward being exploited  an analysis of lord beresfords message to the chambers of commerce discloses first that the east is beginning to manufacture for itself and second that there is a promise of keen competition in the west for the privilege of selling the required machinery  the inexorable query arises what is the west to do when it has furnished this machinery  and when not only the east but all the now undeveloped countries confront with surplus products in their hands the old industrial nations capitalistic production will have attained its maximum development  but before that time must intervene a period which bids one pause for breath  a new romance like unto none in all the past the economic romance will be born  for the dazzling prize of worldempire will the nations of the earth go up in harness  powers will rise and fall and mighty coalitions shape and dissolve in the swift whirl of events vassal nations and subject territories will be bandied back and forth like so many articles of trade  and with the inevitable displacement of economic centres it is fair to presume that populations will shift to and fro as they once did from the south to the north of england on the rise of the factory towns or from the old world to the new  colossal enterprises will be projected and carried through and combinations of capital and federations of labor be effected on a cyclopean scale concentration and organization will be perfected in ways hitherto undreamed  the nation which would keep its head above the tide must accurately adjust supply to demand and eliminate waste to the last least particle  standards of living will most likely descend for millions of people  with the increase of capital the competition for safe investments and the consequent fall of the interest rate the principal which today earns a comfortable income would not then support a bare existence  saving toward old age would cease among the working classes and as the merchant cities of italy crashed when trade slipped from their hands on the discovery of the new route to the indies by way of the cape of good hope so will there come times of trembling for such nations as have failed to grasp the prize of worldempire  in that given direction they will have attained their maximum development before the whole world in the same direction has attained its  there will no longer be room for them  but if they can survive the shock of being flung out of the worlds industrial orbit a change in direction may then be easily effected  that the decadent and barbarous peoples will be crushed is a fair presumption likewise that the stronger breeds will survive entering upon the transition stage to which all the world must ultimately come  this change of direction must be either toward industrial oligarchies or socialism  either the functions of private corporations will increase till they absorb the central government or the functions of government will increase till it absorbs the corporations  much may be said on the chance of the oligarchy  should an old manufacturing nation lose its foreign trade it is safe to predict that a strong effort would be made to build a socialistic government but it does not follow that this effort would be successful  with the moneyed class controlling the state and its revenues and all the means of subsistence and guarding its own interests with jealous care it is not at all impossible that a strong curb could be put upon the masses till the crisis were past  it has been done before  there is no reason why it should not be done again  at the close of the last century such a movement was crushed by its own folly and immaturity  in 1871 the soldiers of the economic rulers stamped out root and branch a whole generation of militant socialists  once the crisis were past the ruling class still holding the curb in order to make itself more secure would proceed to readjust things and to balance consumption with production  having a monopoly of the safe investments the great masses of unremunerative capital would be directed not to the production of more surplus value but to the making of permanent improvements which would give employment to the people and make them content with the new order of things  highways parks public buildings monuments could be builded nor would it be out of place to give better factories and homes to the workers  such in itself would be socialistic save that it would be done by the oligarchs a class apart with the interest rate down to zero and no field for the investment of sporadic capital savings among the people would utterly cease and oldage pensions be granted as a matter of course  it is also a logical necessity of such a system that when the population began to press against the means of subsistence expansion being impossible the birth rate of the lower classes would be lessened  whether by their own initiative or by the interference of the rulers it would have to be done and it would be done  in other words the oligarchy would mean the capitalization of labor and the enslavement of the whole population  but it would be a fairer juster form of slavery than any the world has yet seen  the per capita wage and consumption would be increased and with a stringent control of the birth rate there is no reason why such a country should not be so ruled through many generations  on the other hand as the capitalistic exploitation of the planet approaches its maximum and countries are crowded out of the field of foreign exchanges there is a large likelihood that their change in direction will be toward socialism  were the theory of collective ownership and operation then to arise for the first time such a movement would stand small chance of success  but such is not the case  the doctrine of socialism has flourished and grown throughout the nineteenth century its tenets have been preached wherever the interests of labor and capital have clashed and it has received exemplification time and again by the states assumption of functions which had always belonged solely to the individual  when capitalistic production has attained its maximum development it must confront a dividing of the ways and the strength of capital on the one hand and the education and wisdom of the workers on the other will determine which path society is to travel  it is possible considering the inertia of the masses that the whole world might in time come to be dominated by a group of industrial oligarchies or by one great oligarchy but it is not probable  that sporadic oligarchies may flourish for definite periods of time is highly possible that they may continue to do so is as highly improbable  the procession of the ages has marked not only the rise of man but the rise of the common man from the chattel slave or the serf chained to the soil to the highest seats in modern society he has risen rung by rung amid the crumbling of the divine right of kings and the crash of falling sceptres  that he has done this only in the end to pass into the perpetual slavery of the industrial oligarch is something at which his whole past cries in protest  the common man is worthy of a better future or else he is not worthy of his past                                        notethe above article was written as long ago as 1898  the only alteration has been the bringing up to 1900 of a few of its statistics as a commercial venture of an author it has an interesting history  it was promptly accepted by one of the leading magazines and paid for  the editor confessed that it was one of those articles one could not possibly let go of after it was once in his possession  publication was voluntarily promised to be immediate  then the editor became afraid of its too radical nature forfeited the sum paid for it and did not publish it  nor offered far and wide could any other editor of bourgeois periodicals be found who was rash enough to publish it  thus for the first time after seven years it appears in print     a review   two remarkable books are ghents our benevolent feudalism 7 and brookss the social unrest 8  in these two books the opposite sides of the labor problem are expounded each writer devoting himself with apprehension to the side he fears and views with disfavor  it would appear that they have set themselves the task of collating as a warning the phenomena of two counter social forces  mr ghent who is sympathetic with the socialist movement follows with cynic fear every aggressive act of the capitalist class  mr brooks who yearns for the perpetuation of the capitalist system as long as possible follows with grave dismay each aggressive act of the labor and socialist organizations  mr ghent traces the emasculation of labor by capital and mr brooks traces the emasculation of independent competing capital by labor  in short each marshals the facts of a side in the two sides which go to make a struggle so great that even the french revolution is insignificant beside it for this later struggle for the first time in the history of struggles is not confined to any particular portion of the globe but involves the whole of it  starting on the assumption that society is at present in a state of flux mr ghent sees it rapidly crystallizing into a status which can best be described as something in the nature of a benevolent feudalism  he laughs to scorn any immediate realization of the marxian dream while tolstoyan utopias and kropotkinian communistic unions of shop and farm are too wild to merit consideration  the coming status which mr ghent depicts is a class domination by the capitalists  labor will take its definite place as a dependent class living in a condition of machine servitude fairly analogous to the land servitude of the middle ages that is to say labor will be bound to the machine though less harshly in fashion somewhat similar to that in which the earlier serf was bound to the soil  as he says bondage to the land was the basis of villeinage in the old regime bondage to the job will be the basis of villeinage in the new  at the top of the new society will tower the magnate the new feudal baron at the bottom will be found the wastrels and the inefficients the new society he grades as follows      i  the barons graded on the basis of possessions      ii  the court agents and retainers  this class will include the     editors of respectable and safe newspapers the pastors of     conservative and wealthy churches the professors and teachers in     endowed colleges and schools lawyers generally and most judges and     politicians      iii  the workers in pure and applied science artists and     physicians      iv  the entrepreneurs the managers of the great industries     transformed into a salaried class      v  the foremen and superintendents  this class has heretofore been     recruited largely from the skilled workers but with the growth of     technical education in schools and colleges and the development of     fixed caste it is likely to become entirely differentiated      vi  the villeins of the cities and towns more or less regularly     employed who do skilled work and are partially protected by     organization      vii  the villeins of the cities and towns who do unskilled work and     are unprotected by organization  they will comprise the laborers     domestics and clerks      viii  the villeins of the manorial estates of the great farms the     mines and the forests      ix  the smallunit farmers landowning the petty tradesmen and     manufacturers      x  the subtenants of the manorial estates and great farms     corresponding to the class of free tenants in the old feudalism      xi  the cotters      xii  the tramps the occasionally employed the unemployedthe     wastrels of the city and country      the new feudalism like most autocracies will foster not only the     arts but also certain kinds of learningparticularly the kinds     which are unlikely to disturb the minds of the multitude  a future     marsh or cope or le comte will be liberally patronized and left     free to discover what he will and so too an edison or a marconi     only they must not meddle with anything relating to social science  it must be confessed that mr ghents arguments are cunningly contrived and arrayed  they must be read to be appreciated  as an example of his style which at the same time generalizes a portion of his argument the following may well be given      the new feudalism will be but an orderly outgrowth of present     tendencies and conditions  all societies evolve naturally out of     their predecessors  in sociology as in biology there is no cell     without a parent cell  the society of each generation develops a     multitude of spontaneous and acquired variations and out of these     by a blending process of natural and conscious selection the     succeeding society is evolved  the new order will differ in no     important respects from the present except in the completer     development of its more salient features  the visitor from another     planet who had known the old and should see the new would note but     few changes  alter et idemanother yet the samehe would say     from magnate to baron from workman to villein from publicist to     court agent and retainer will be changes of state and function so     slight as to elude all but the keenest eyes  and in conclusion to show how benevolent and beautiful this new feudalism of ours will be mr ghent says peace and stability it will maintain at all hazards and the mass remembering the chaos the turmoil the insecurity of the past will bless its reign    efficiencythe faculty of getting thingsis at last rewarded as it should be for the efficient have inherited the earth and its fulness the lowly whose happiness is greater and whose welfare is more thoroughly conserved when governed than when governing as a twentiethcentury philosopher said of them are settled and happy in the state which reason and experience teach is their godappointed lot  they are comfortable too and if the patriarchal ideal of a vine and fig tree for each is not yet attained at least each has his rented patch in the country or his rented cell in a city building  bread and the circus are freely given to the deserving and as for the undeserving they are merely reaping the rewards of their contumacy and pride  order reigns each has his justly appointed share and the state rests in security lapt in universal law  mr brooks on the other hand sees rising and dissolving and rising again in the social flux the ominous forms of a new society which is the direct antithesis of a benevolent feudalism  he trembles at the rash intrepidity of the capitalists who fight the labor unions for by such rashness he greatly fears that labor will be driven to express its aims and strength in political terms which terms will inevitably be socialistic terms  to keep down the rising tide of socialism he preaches greater meekness and benevolence to the capitalists  no longer may they claim the right to run their own business to beat down the laborers standard of living for the sake of increased profits to dictate terms of employment to individual workers to wax righteously indignant when organized labor takes a hand in their business  no longer may the capitalist say my business or even think my business he must say our business and think our business as well accepting labor as a partner whose voice must be heard  and if the capitalists do not become more meek and benevolent in their dealings with labor labor will be antagonized and will proceed to wreak terrible political vengeance and the present social flux will harden into a status of socialism  mr brooks dreams of a society at which mr ghent sneers as a slightly modified individualism wherein each unit secures the just reward of his capacity and service  to attain this happy state mr brooks imposes circumspection upon the capitalists in their relations with labor  if the socialistic spirit is to be held in abeyance in this country businesses of this character anthracite coal mining must be handled with extraordinary caution  which is to say that to withstand the advance of socialism a great and greater measure of mr ghents benevolence will be required  again and again mr brooks reiterates the danger he sees in harshly treating labor  it is not probable that employers can destroy unionism in the united states  adroit and desperate attempts will however be made if we mean by unionism the undisciplined and aggressive fact of vigorous and determined organizations  if capital should prove too strong in this struggle the result is easy to predict  the employers have only to convince organized labor that it cannot hold its own against the capitalist manager and the whole energy that now goes to the union will turn to an aggressive political socialism  it will not be the harmless sympathy with increased city and state functions which trade unions already feel it will become a turbulent political force bent upon using every weapon of taxation against the rich  the most concrete impulse that now favors socialism in this country is the insane purpose to deprive labor organizations of the full and complete rights that go with federated unionism  that which teaches a union that it cannot succeed as a union turns it toward socialism  in long strikes in towns like marlboro and brookfield strong unions are defeated  hundreds of men leave these towns for shoecentres like brockton where they are now voting the socialist ticket  the socialist mayor of this city tells me the men who come to us now from towns where they have been thoroughly whipped in a strike are among our most active working socialists  the bitterness engendered by this sense of defeat is turned to politics as it will throughout the whole country if organization of labor is deprived of its rights  this enmity of capital to the trade union is watched with glee by every intelligent socialist in our midst  every union that is beaten or discouraged in its struggle is ripening fruit for socialism  the real peril which we now face is the threat of a class conflict  if capitalism insists upon the policy of outraging the saving aspiration of the american workman to raise his standard of comfort and leisure every element of class conflict will strengthen among us  we have only to humiliate what is best in the trade union and then every worst feature of socialism is fastened upon us  this strong tendency in the ranks of the workers toward socialism is what mr brooks characterizes the social unrest and he hopes to see the republican the cleveland democrat and the conservative and large property interests band together against this common foe which is socialism  and he is not above feeling grave and wellcontained satisfaction wherever the socialist doctrinaire has been contradicted by men attempting to practise cooperation in the midst of the competitive system as in belgium  nevertheless he catches fleeting glimpses of an extreme and tyrannically benevolent feudalism very like to mr ghents as witness the following  i asked one of the largest employers of labor in the south if he feared the coming of the trade union  no he said it is one good result of race prejudice that the negro will enable us in the long run to weaken the trade union so that it cannot harm us  we can keep wages down with the negro and we can prevent too much organization  it is in this spirit that the lower standards are to be used  if this purpose should succeed it has but one issuethe immense strengthening of a plutocratic administration at the top served by an army of highsalaried helpers with an elite of skilled and wellpaid workmen but all resting on what would essentially be a serf class of lowpaid labor and this mass kept in order by an increased use of military force  in brief summary of these two notable books it may be said that mr ghent is alarmed though he does not flatly say so at the too great social restfulness in the community which is permitting the capitalists to form the new society to their liking and that mr brooks is alarmed and he flatly says so at the social unrest which threatens the modified individualism into which he would like to see society evolve mr ghent beholds the capitalist class rising to dominate the state and the working class mr brooks beholds the working class rising to dominate the state and the capitalist class  one fears the paternalism of a class the other the tyranny of the mass     wanted a new law of development   evolution is no longer a mere tentative hypothesis  one by one step by step each division and subdivision of science has contributed its evidence until now the case is complete and the verdict rendered  while there is still discussion as to the method of evolution none the less as a process sufficient to explain all biological phenomena all differentiations of life into widely diverse species families and even kingdoms evolution is flatly accepted  likewise has been accepted its law of development that in the struggle for existence the strong and fit and the progeny of the strong and fit have a better opportunity for survival than the weak and less fit and the progeny of the weak and less fit  it is in the struggle of the species with other species and against all other hostile forces in the environment that this law operates also in the struggle between the individuals of the same species  in this struggle which is for food and shelter the weak individuals must obviously win less food and shelter than the strong  because of this their hold on life relaxes and they are eliminated  and for the same reason that they may not win for themselves adequate food and shelter the weak cannot give to their progeny the chance for survival that the strong give  and thus since the weak are prone to beget weakness the species is constantly purged of its inefficient members  because of this a premium is placed upon strength and so long as the struggle for food and shelter obtains just so long will the average strength of each generation increase  on the other hand should conditions so change that all and the progeny of all the weak as well as the strong have an equal chance for survival then at once the average strength of each generation will begin to diminish  never yet however in animal life has there been such a state of affairs  natural selection has always obtained  the strong and their progeny at the expense of the weak have always survived  this law of development has operated down all the past upon all life it so operates today and it is not rash to say that it will continue to operate in the futureat least upon all life existing in a state of nature  man preeminent though he is in the animal kingdom capable of reacting upon and making suitable an unsuitable environment nevertheless remains the creature of this same law of development  the social selection to which he is subject is merely another form of natural selection  true within certain narrow limits he modifies the struggle for existence and renders less precarious the tenure of life for the weak  the extremely weak diseased and inefficient are housed in hospitals and asylums  the strength of the viciously strong when inimical to society is tempered by penal institutions and by the gallows  the shortsighted are provided with spectacles and the sickly when they can pay for it with sanitariums  pestilential marshes are drained plagues are checked and disasters averted  yet for all that the strong and the progeny of the strong survive and the weak are crushed out  the men strong of brain are masters as of yore  they dominate society and gather to themselves the wealth of society  with this wealth they maintain themselves and equip their progeny for the struggle  they build their homes in healthful places purchase the best fruits meats and vegetables the market affords and buy themselves the ministrations of the most brilliant and learned of the professional classes  the weak man as of yore is the servant the doer of things at the masters call  the weaker and less efficient he is the poorer is his reward  the weakest work for a living wage when they can get work live in unsanitary slums on vile and insufficient food at the lowest depths of human degradation  their grasp on life is indeed precarious their mortality excessive their infant deathrate appalling  that some should be born to preferment and others to ignominy in order that the race may progress is cruel and sad but none the less they are so born  the weeding out of human souls some for fatness and smiles some for leanness and tears is surely a heartless selective processas heartless as it is natural  and the human family for all its wonderful record of adventure and achievement has not yet succeeded in avoiding this process  that it is incapable of doing this is not to be hazarded not only is it capable but the whole trend of society is in that direction  all the social forces are driving man on to a time when the old selective law will be annulled  there is no escaping it save by the intervention of catastrophes and cataclysms quite unthinkable  it is inexorable  it is inexorable because the common man demands it  the twentieth century the common man says is his day the common mans day or rather the dawning of the common mans day  nor can it be denied  the evidence is with him  the previous centuries and more notably the nineteenth have marked the rise of the common man from chattel slavery to serfdom and from serfdom to what he bitterly terms wage slavery he has risen  never was he so strong as he is today and never so menacing  he does the work of the world and he is beginning to know it  the world cannot get along without him and this also he is beginning to know  all the human knowledge of the past all the scientific discovery governmental experiment and invention of machinery have tended to his advancement  his standard of living is higher  his common school education would shame princes ten centuries past  his civil and religious liberty makes him a free man and his ballot the peer of his betters  and all this has tended to make him conscious conscious of himself conscious of his class  he looks about him and questions that ancient law of development  it is cruel and wrong he is beginning to declare  it is an anachronism  let it be abolished  why should there be one empty belly in all the world when the work of ten men can feed a hundred  what if my brother be not so strong as i  he has not sinned  wherefore should he hungerhe and his sinless little ones  away with the old law  there is food and shelter for all therefore let all receive food and shelter  as fast as labor has become conscious it has organized  the ambition of these classconscious men is that the movement shall become general that all labor shall become conscious of itself and its class interests  and the day that witnesses the solidarity of labor they triumphantly affirm will be a day when labor dominates the world  this growing consciousness has led to the organization of two movements both separate and distinct but both converging toward a common goalone the labor movement known as trade unionism the other the political movement known as socialism both are grim and silent forces unheralded and virtually unknown to the general public save in moments of stress  the sleeping labor giant receives little notice from the capitalistic press and when he stirs uneasily a column of surprise indignation and horror suffices  it is only now and then after long periods of silence that the labor movement puts in its claim for notice  all is quiet  the kind old world spins on and the bourgeois masters clip their coupons in smug complacency  but the grim and silent forces are at work  suddenly like a clap of thunder from a clear sky comes a disruption of industry  from ocean to ocean the wheels of a great chain of railroads cease to run  a quarter of a million miners throw down pick and shovel and outrage the sun with their pale bleached faces  the street railways of a swarming metropolis stand idle or the rumble of machinery in vast manufactories dies away to silence  there is alarm and panic  arson and homicide stalk forth  there is a cry in the night and quick anger and sudden death  peaceful cities are affrighted by the crack of rifles and the snarl of machineguns and the hearts of the shuddering are shaken by the roar of dynamite  there is hurrying and skurrying  the wires are kept hot between the centre of government and the seat of trouble  the chiefs of state ponder gravely and advise and governors of states implore  there is assembling of militia and massing of troops and the streets resound to the tramp of armed men  there are separate and joint conferences between the captains of industry and the captains of labor and then finally all is quiet again and the memory of it is like the memory of a bad dream  but these strikes become olympiads things to date from and common on the lips of men become such phrases as the great dock strike the great coal strike the great railroad strike  never before did labor do these things  after the great plague in england labor finding itself in demand and innocently obeying the economic law asked higher wages  but the masters set a maximum wage restrained workingmen from moving about from place to place refused to tolerate idlers and by most barbarous legal methods punished those who disobeyed  but labor is accorded greater respect today  such a policy put into effect in this the first decade of the twentieth century would sweep the masters from their seats in one mighty crash  and the masters know it and are respectful  a fair instance of the growing solidarity of labor is afforded by an unimportant recent strike in san francisco  the restaurant cooks and waiters were completely unorganized working at any and all hours for whatever wages they could get  a representative of the american federation of labor went among them and organized them  within a few weeks nearly two thousand men were enrolled and they had five thousand dollars on deposit  then they put in their demand for increased wages and shorter hours  forthwith their employers organized  the demand was denied and the cooks and waiters union walked out  all organized employers stood back of the restaurant owners in sympathy with them and willing to aid them if they dared  and at the back of the cooks and waiters union stood the organized labor of the city 40000 strong  if a business man was caught patronizing an unfair restaurant he was boycotted if a union man was caught he was fined heavily by his union or expelled  the oyster companies and the slaughter houses made an attempt to refuse to sell oysters and meat to union restaurants  the butchers and meat cutters and the teamsters in retaliation refused to work for or to deliver to nonunion restaurants  upon this the oyster companies and slaughter houses acknowledged themselves beaten and peace reigned  but the restaurant bakers in nonunion places were ordered out and the bakery wagon drivers declined to deliver to unfair houses  every american federation of labor union in the city was prepared to strike and waited only the word  and behind all a handful of men known as the labor council directed the fight  one by one blow upon blow they were able if they deemed it necessary to call out the unionsthe laundry workers who do the washing the hackmen who haul men to and from restaurants the butchers meat cutters and teamsters and the milkers milk drivers and chicken pickers and after that in pure sympathy the retail clerks the horse shoers the gas and electrical fixture hangers the metal roofers the blacksmiths the blacksmiths helpers the stablemen the machinists the brewers the coast seamen the varnishers and polishers the confectioners the upholsterers the paper hangers and fresco painters the drug clerks the fitters and helpers the metal workers the boiler makers and iron ship builders the assistant undertakers the carriage and wagon workers and so on down the lengthy list of organizations  for over all these trades over all these thousands of men is the labor council  when it speaks its voice is heard and when it orders it is obeyed  but it in turn is dominated by the national labor council with which it is constantly in touch  in this wholly unimportant little local strike it is of interest to note the stands taken by the different sides  the legal representative and official mouthpiece of the employers association said this organization is formed for defensive purposes and it may be driven to take offensive steps and if so will be strong enough to follow them up  labor cannot be allowed to dictate to capital and say how business shall be conducted  there is no objection to the formation of unions and trades councils but membership must not be compulsory  it is repugnant to the american idea of liberty and cannot be tolerated  on the other hand the president of the team drivers union said the employers of labor in this city are generally against the tradeunion movement and there seems to be a concerted effort on their part to check the progress of organized labor  such action as has been taken by them in sympathy with the present labor troubles may if continued lead to a serious conflict the outcome of which might be most calamitous for the business and industrial interests of san francisco  and the secretary of the united brewery workmen i regard a sympathetic strike as the last weapon which organized labor should use in its defence  when however associations of employers band together to defeat organized labor or one of its branches then we should not and will not hesitate ourselves to employ the same instrument in retaliation  thus in a little corner of the world is exemplified the growing solidarity of labor  the organization of labor has not only kept pace with the organization of industry but it has gained upon it  in one winter in the anthracite coal region 160000000 in mines and 600000000 in transportation and distribution consolidated its ownership and control  and at once arrayed as solidly on the other side were the 150000 anthracite miners  the bituminous mines however were not consolidated yet the 250000 men employed therein were already combined  and not only that but they were also combined with the anthracite miners these 400000 men being under the control and direction of one supreme labor council  and in this and the other great councils are to be found captains of labor of splendid abilities who in understanding of economic and industrial conditions are undeniably the equals of their opponents the captains of industry  the united states is honeycombed with labor organizations  and the big federations which these go to compose aggregate millions of members and in their various branches handle millions of dollars yearly  and not only this for the international brotherhoods and unions are forming and moneys for the aid of strikers pass back and forth across the seas  the machinists in their demand for a ninehour day affected 500000 men in the united states mexico and canada  in england the membership of workingclass organizations is approximated by keir hardie at 2500000 with reserve funds of 18000000  there the cooperative movement has a membership of 1500000 and every year turns over in distribution more than 100000000  in france oneeighth of the whole working class is unionized  in belgium the unions are very rich and powerful and so able to defy the masters that many of the smaller manufacturers unable to resist are removing their works to other countries where the workmens organizations are not so potential  and in all other countries according to the stage of their economic and political development like figures obtain  and europe today confesses that her greatest social problem is the labor problem and that it is the one most closely engrossing the attention of her statesmen  the organization of labor is one of the chief acknowledged factors in the retrogression of british trade  the workers have become class conscious as never before  the wrong of one is the wrong of all  they have come to realize in a shortsighted way that their masters interests are not their interests  the harder they work they believe the more wealth they create for their masters  further the more work they do in one day the fewer men will be needed to do the work  so the unions place a days stint upon their members beyond which they are not permitted to go  in a study of trade unionism by benjamin taylor in the nineteenth century of april 1898 are furnished some interesting corroborations  the facts here set forth were collected by the executive board of the employers federation the documentary proofs of which are in the hands of the secretaries  in a certain firm the union workmen made eight ammunition boxes a day  nor could they be persuaded into making more  a young swiss who could not speak english was set to work and in the first day he made fifty boxes  in the same firm the skilled union hands filed up the outside handles of one machinegun a day  that was their stint  no one was known ever to do more  a nonunion filer came into the shop and did twelve a day  a manchester firm found that to plane a large bedcasting took union workmen one hundred and ninety hours and nonunion workmen one hundred and thirtyfive hours  in another instance a man resigning from his union day by day did double the amount of work he had done formerly  and to cap it all an english gentleman going out to look at a wall being put up for him by union bricklayers found one of their number with his right arm strapped to his body doing all the work with his left armforsooth because he was such an energetic fellow that otherwise he would involuntarily lay more bricks than his union permitted  all england resounds to the cry wake up england  but the sulky giant is not stirred  let englands trade go to pot he says what have i to lose  and england is powerless   the capacity of her workmen is represented by 1 in comparison with the 225 capacity of the american workman  and because of the solidarity of labor and the destructiveness of strikes british capitalists dare not even strive to emulate the enterprise of american capitalists  so england watches trade slipping through her fingers and wails unavailingly  as a correspondent writes the enormous power of the trade unions hangs a sullen cloud over the whole industrial world here affecting men and masters alike  the political movement known as socialism is perhaps even less realized by the general public  the great strides it has taken and the portentous front it today exhibits are not comprehended and fastened though it is in every land it is given little space by the capitalistic press  for all its plea and passion and warmth it wells upward like a great cold tidal wave irresistible inexorable ingulfing presentday society level by level  by its own preachment it is inexorable  just as societies have sprung into existence fulfilled their function and passed away it claims just as surely is present society hastening on to its dissolution  this is a transition periodand destined to be a very short one  barely a century old capitalism is ripening so rapidly that it can never live to see a second birthday  there is no hope for it the socialists say  it is doomed  the cardinal tenet of socialism is that forbidding doctrine the materialistic conception of history  men are not the masters of their souls  they are the puppets of great blind forces  the lives they live and the deaths they die are compulsory  all social codes are but the reflexes of existing economic conditions plus certain survivals of past economic conditions  the institutions men build they are compelled to build  economic laws determine at any given time what these institutions shall be how long they shall operate and by what they shall be replaced  and so through the economic process the socialist preaches the ripening of the capitalistic society and the coming of the new cooperative society  the second great tenet of socialism itself a phase of the materialistic conception of history is the class struggle  in the social struggle for existence men are forced into classes  the history of all society thus far is the history of class strife  in existing society the capitalist class exploits the working class the proletariat  the interests of the exploiter are not the interests of the exploited  profits are legitimate says the one  profits are unpaid wages replies the other when he has become conscious of his class therefore profits are robbery  the capitalist enforces his profits because he is the legal owner of all the means of production  he is the legal owner because he controls the political machinery of society  the socialist sets to work to capture the political machinery so that he may make illegal the capitalists ownership of the means of production and make legal his own ownership of the means of production  and it is this struggle between these two classes upon which the world has at last entered  scientific socialism is very young  only yesterday it was in swaddling clothes  but today it is a vigorous young giant well braced to battle for what it wants and knowing precisely what it wants  it holds its international conventions where worldpolicies are formulated by the representatives of millions of socialists  in little belgium there are threequarters of a million of men who work for the cause in germany 3000000 austria between 1895 and 1897 raised her socialist vote from 90000 to 750000  france in 1871 had a whole generation of socialists wiped out yet in 1885 there were 30000 and in 1898 1000000  ere the last spaniard had evacuated cuba socialist groups were forming and from far japan in these first days of the twentieth century writes one tomoyoshi murai the interest of our people on socialism has been greatly awakened these days especially among our laboring people on one hand and young students circle on the other as much as we can draw an earnest and enthusiastic audience and fill our hall which holds two thousand    it is gratifying to say that we have a number of fine and welltrained public orators among our leaders of socialism in japan  the first speaker tonight is mr kiyoshi kawakami editor of one of our city tokyo dailies a strong independent and decidedly socialistic paper circulated far and wide  mr kawakami is a scholar as well as a popular writer  he is going to speak tonight on the subject the essence of socialismthe fundamental principles  the next speaker is professor iso abe president of our association whose subject of address is socialism and the existing social system  the third speaker is mr naoe kinosita the editor of another strong journal of the city  he speaks on the subject how to realize the socialist ideals and plans next is mr shigeyoshi sugiyama a graduate of hartford theological seminary and an advocate of social christianity who is to speak on socialism and municipal problems  and the last speaker is the editor of the labor world the foremost leader of the laborunion movement in our country mr sen katayama who speaks on the subject the outlook of socialism in europe and america  these addresses are going to be published in book form and to be distributed among our people to enlighten their minds on the subject  and in the struggle for the political machinery of society socialism is no longer confined to mere propaganda  italy austria belgium england have socialist members in their national bodies  out of the one hundred and thirtytwo members of the london county council ninetyone are denounced by the conservative element as socialists  the emperor of germany grows anxious and angry at the increasing numbers which are returned to the reichstag  in france many of the large cities such as marseilles are in the hands of the socialists  a large body of them is in the chamber of deputies and millerand socialist sits in the cabinet  of him m leroybeaulieu says with horror m millerand is the open enemy of private property private capital the resolute advocate of the socialization of production    a constant incitement to violence    a collectivist avowed and militant taking part in the government dominating the departments of commerce and industry preparing all the laws and presiding at the passage of all measures which should be submitted to merchants and tradesmen  in the united states there are already socialist mayors of towns and members of state legislatures a vast literature and single socialist papers with subscription lists running up into the hundreds of thousands in 1896 36000 votes were cast for the socialist candidate for president in 1900 nearly 200000 in 1904 450000  and the united states young as it is is ripening rapidly and the socialists claim according to the materialistic conception of history that the united states will be the first country in the world wherein the toilers will capture the political machinery and expropriate the bourgeoisie                                        but the socialist and labor movements have recently entered upon a new phase  there has been a remarkable change in attitude on both sides for a long time the labor unions refrained from going in for political action  on the other hand the socialists claimed that without political action labor was powerless  and because of this there was much ill feeling between them even open hostilities and no concerted action but now the socialists grant that the labor movement has held up wages and decreased the hours of labor and the labor unions find that political action is necessary  today both parties have drawn closely together in the common fight  in the united states this friendly feeling grows  the socialist papers espouse the cause of labor and the unions have opened their ears once more to the wiles of the socialists  they are all leavened with socialist workmen boring from within and many of their leaders have already succumbed  in england where class consciousness is more developed the name unionism has been replaced by the new unionism the main object of which is to capture existing social structures in the interests of the wageearners  there the socialist the tradeunion and other workingclass organizations are beginning to cooperate in securing the return of representatives to the house of commons  and in france where the city councils and mayors of marseilles and monteaulesmines are socialistic thousands of francs of municipal money were voted for the aid of the unions in the recent great strikes  for centuries the world has been preparing for the coming of the common man  and the period of preparation virtually past labor conscious of itself and its desires has begun a definite movement toward solidarity it believes the time is not far distant when the historian will speak not only of the dark ages of feudalism but of the dark ages of capitalism and labor sincerely believes itself justified in this by the terrible indictment it brings against capitalistic society  in the face of its enormous wealth capitalistic society forfeits its right to existence when it permits widespread bestial poverty  the philosophy of the survival of the fittest does not soothe the classconscious worker when he learns through his class literature that among the italian pantsfinishers of chicago 9 the average weekly wage is 131 and the average number of weeks employed in the year is 2785  likewise when he reads 10 every room in these reeking tenements houses a family or two  in one room a missionary found a man ill with smallpox his wife just recovering from her confinement and the children running about half naked and covered with dirt  here are seven people living in one underground kitchen and a little dead child lying in the same room here live a widow and her six children two of whom are ill with scarlet fever  in another nine brothers and sisters from twentynine years of age downward live eat and sleep together  and likewise when he reads 11 when one man fifty years old who has worked all his life is compelled to beg a little money to bury his dead baby and another man fifty years old can give ten million dollars to enable his daughter to live in luxury and bolster up a decaying foreign aristocracy do you see nothing amiss  and on the other hand the classconscious worker reads the statistics of the wealthy classes knows what their incomes are and how they get them true down all the past he has known his own material misery and the material comfort of the dominant classes and often has this knowledge led him to intemperate acts and unwise rebellion  but today and for the first time because both society and he have evolved he is beginning to see a possible way out  his ears are opening to the propaganda of socialism the passionate gospel of the dispossessed  but it does not inculcate a turning back  the way through is the way out he understands and with this in mind he draws up the programme  it is quite simple this programme  everything is moving in his direction toward the day when he will take charge  the trust  ah no unlike the trembling middleclass man and the small capitalist he sees nothing at which to be frightened  he likes the trust  he exults in the trust for it is largely doing the task for him  it socializes production this done there remains nothing for him to do but socialize distribution and all is accomplished  the trust  it organizes industry on an enormous laborsaving scale and abolishes childish wasteful competition  it is a gigantic object lesson and it preaches his political economy far more potently than he can preach it  he points to the trust laughing scornfully in the face of the orthodox economists you told me this thing could not be 12 he thunders  behold the thing is  he sees competition in the realm of production passing away  when the captains of industry have thoroughly organized production and got everything running smoothly it will be very easy for him to eliminate the profits by stepping in and having the thing run for himself  and the captain of industry if he be good may be given the privilege of continuing the management on a fair salary  the sixty millions of dividends which the standard oil company annually declares will be distributed among the workers  the same with the great united states steel corporation  the president of that corporation knows his business very good  let him become secretary of the department of iron and steel of the united states  but since the chief executive of a nation of seventyodd millions works for 50000 a year the secretary of the department of iron and steel must expect to have his salary cut accordingly  and not only will the workers take to themselves the profits of national and municipal monopolies but also the immense revenues which the dominant classes today draw from rents and mines and factories and all manner of enterprises                                        all this would seem very like a dream even to the worker if it were not for the fact that like things have been done before  he points triumphantly to the aristocrat of the eighteenth century who fought legislated governed and dominated society but who was shorn of power and displaced by the rising bourgeoisie  ay the thing was done he holds  and it shall be done again but this time it is the proletariat who does the shearing  sociology has taught him that might spells right  every society has been ruled by classes and the classes have ruled by sheer strength and have been overthrown by sheer strength  the bourgeoisie because it was the stronger dragged down the nobility of the sword and the proletariat because it is the strongest of all can and will drag down the bourgeoisie  and in that day for better or worse the common man becomes the masterfor better he believes  it is his intention to make the sum of human happiness far greater  no man shall work for a bare living wage which is degradation  every man shall have work to do and shall be paid exceedingly well for doing it  there shall be no slum classes no beggars  nor shall there be hundreds of thousands of men and women condemned for economic reasons to lives of celibacy or sexual infertility  every man shall be able to marry to live in healthy comfortable quarters and to have all he wants to eat as many times a day as he wishes  there shall no longer be a lifeanddeath struggle for food and shelter  the old heartless law of development shall be annulled  all of which is very good and very fine  and when these things have come to pass what then  of old by virtue of their weakness and inefficiency in the struggle for food and shelter the race was purged of its weak and inefficient members  but this will no longer obtain  under the new order the weak and the progeny of the weak will have a chance for survival equal to that of the strong and the progeny of the strong  this being so the premium upon strength will have been withdrawn and on the face of it the average strength of each generation instead of continuing to rise will begin to decline  when the common mans day shall have arrived the new social institutions of that day will prevent the weeding out of weakness and inefficiency all the weak and the strong will have an equal chance for procreation and the progeny of all of the weak as well as the strong will have an equal chance for survival  this being so and if no new effective law of development be put into operation then progress must cease  and not only progress for deterioration would at once set in  it is a pregnant problem  what will be the nature of this new and most necessary law of development  can the common man pause long enough from his undermining labors to answer  since he is bent upon dragging down the bourgeoisie and reconstructing society can he so reconstruct that a premium in some unguessed way or other will still be laid upon the strong and efficient so that the human type will continue to develop  can the common man or the uncommon men who are allied with him devise such a law  or have they already devised one  and if so what is it     how i became a socialist   it is quite fair to say that i became a socialist in a fashion somewhat similar to the way in which the teutonic pagans became christiansit was hammered into me  not only was i not looking for socialism at the time of my conversion but i was fighting it  i was very young and callow did not know much of anything and though i had never even heard of a school called individualism i sang the paean of the strong with all my heart  this was because i was strong myself  by strong i mean that i had good health and hard muscles both of which possessions are easily accounted for  i had lived my childhood on california ranches my boyhood hustling newspapers on the streets of a healthy western city and my youth on the ozoneladen waters of san francisco bay and the pacific ocean  i loved life in the open and i toiled in the open at the hardest kinds of work learning no trade but drifting along from job to job i looked on the world and called it good every bit of it  let me repeat this optimism was because i was healthy and strong bothered with neither aches nor weaknesses never turned down by the boss because i did not look fit able always to get a job at shovelling coal sailorizing or manual labor of some sort  and because of all this exulting in my young life able to hold my own at work or fight i was a rampant individualist  it was very natural  i was a winner  wherefore i called the game as i saw it played or thought i saw it played a very proper game for men  to be a man was to write man in large capitals on my heart  to adventure like a man and fight like a man and do a mans work even for a boys paythese were things that reached right in and gripped hold of me as no other thing could  and i looked ahead into long vistas of a hazy and interminable future into which playing what i conceived to be mans game i should continue to travel with unfailing health without accidents and with muscles ever vigorous  as i say this future was interminable  i could see myself only raging through life without end like one of nietzsches blondbeasts lustfully roving and conquering by sheer superiority and strength  as for the unfortunates the sick and ailing and old and maimed i must confess i hardly thought of them at all save that i vaguely felt that they barring accidents could be as good as i if they wanted to real hard and could work just as well  accidents  well they represented fate also spelled out in capitals and there was no getting around fate  napoleon had had an accident at waterloo but that did not dampen my desire to be another and later napoleon  further the optimism bred of a stomach which could digest scrap iron and a body which flourished on hardships did not permit me to consider accidents as even remotely related to my glorious personality  i hope i have made it clear that i was proud to be one of natures strongarmed noblemen  the dignity of labor was to me the most impressive thing in the world  without having read carlyle or kipling i formulated a gospel of work which put theirs in the shade  work was everything  it was sanctification and salvation  the pride i took in a hard days work well done would be inconceivable to you  it is almost inconceivable to me as i look back upon it  i was as faithful a wage slave as ever capitalist exploited  to shirk or malinger on the man who paid me my wages was a sin first against myself and second against him  i considered it a crime second only to treason and just about as bad  in short my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics  i read the bourgeois papers listened to the bourgeois preachers and shouted at the sonorous platitudes of the bourgeois politicians  and i doubt not if other events had not changed my career that i should have evolved into a professional strikebreaker one of president eliots american heroes and had my head and my earning power irrevocably smashed by a club in the hands of some militant tradesunionist  just about this time returning from a seven months voyage before the mast and just turned eighteen i took it into my head to go tramping on rods and blind baggages i fought my way from the open west where men bucked big and the job hunted the man to the congested labor centres of the east where men were small potatoes and hunted the job for all they were worth  and on this new blondbeast adventure i found myself looking upon life from a new and totally different angle  i had dropped down from the proletariat into what sociologists love to call the submerged tenth and i was startled to discover the way in which that submerged tenth was recruited  i found there all sorts of men many of whom had once been as good as myself and just as blondbeast sailormen soldiermen labormen all wrenched and distorted and twisted out of shape by toil and hardship and accident and cast adrift by their masters like so many old horses  i battered on the drag and slammed back gates with them or shivered with them in box cars and city parks listening the while to lifehistories which began under auspices as fair as mine with digestions and bodies equal to and better than mine and which ended there before my eyes in the shambles at the bottom of the social pit  and as i listened my brain began to work  the woman of the streets and the man of the gutter drew very close to me  i saw the picture of the social pit as vividly as though it were a concrete thing and at the bottom of the pit i saw them myself above them not far and hanging on to the slippery wall by main strength and sweat  and i confess a terror seized me  what when my strength failed when i should be unable to work shoulder to shoulder with the strong men who were as yet babes unborn and there and then i swore a great oath  it ran something like this all my days i have worked hard with my body and according to the number of days i have worked by just that much am i nearer the bottom of the pit  i shall climb out of the pit but not by the muscles of my body shall i climb out  i shall do no more hard work and may god strike me dead if i do another days hard work with my body more than i absolutely have to do  and i have been busy ever since running away from hard work  incidentally while tramping some ten thousand miles through the united states and canada i strayed into niagara

his soul somewhereat least since that experience he finds that he cares more for men and women and little children than for imaginary geographical lines                                        to return to my conversion  i think it is apparent that my rampant individualism was pretty effectively hammered out of me and something else as effectively hammered in  but just as i had been an individualist without knowing it i was now a socialist without knowing it withal an unscientific one  i had been reborn but not renamed and i was running around to find out what manner of thing i was  i ran back to california and opened the books  i do not remember which ones i opened first  it is an unimportant detail anyway  i was already it whatever it was and by aid of the books i discovered that it was a socialist  since that day i have opened many books but no economic argument no lucid demonstration of the logic and inevitableness of socialism affects me as profoundly and convincingly as i was affected on the day when i first saw the walls of the social pit rise around me and felt myself slipping down down into the shambles at the bottom     footnotes   1  from 43 to 52 per cent of

court  westlake is seventytwo years old  a charge of habitual drunkenness was placed against him and he was sentenced to a term in the county jail though it is more than probable that he was never under the influence of intoxicating liquor in his life  the act on the part of the authorities was one of kindness for him as in the county jail he will be provided with a good place to sleep and
