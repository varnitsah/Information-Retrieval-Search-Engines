99836266	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     a golden venture   the elders of the tidger family sat at breakfastmrs tidger with knees wide apart and the youngest tidger nestling in the valley of printdress which lay between and mr tidger bearing on one moleskin knee a small copy of himself in a red flannel frock and a slipper  the larger tidger children took the solids of their breakfast up and down the stoneflagged court outside coming in occasionally to gulp draughts of very weak tea from a gallipot or two which stood on the table and to wheedle mr tidger out of any small piece of bloater which he felt generous enough to bestow  peg away ann said mr tidger heartily  his wifes elder sister shook her head and passing the remains of her slice to one of her small nephews leaned back in her chair  no appetite tidger she said slowly  you should go in for carpentering said mr tidger in justification of the huge crust he was carving into mouthfuls with his pocketknife seems to me i cant eat enough sometimes  hullo whos the letter for  he took it from the postman who stood at the door amid a bevy of tidgers who had followed him up the court and slowly read the address  mrs ann pullen he said handing it over to his sisterinlaw nice writing too  mrs pullen broke the envelope and after a somewhat lengthy search for her pocket fumbled therein for her spectacles  she then searched the mantelpiece the chest of drawers and the dresser and finally ran them to earth on the copper  she was not a good scholar and it took her some time to read the letter a proceeding which she punctuated with such ohs and ahs and gaspings and god bless my souls as nearly drove the carpenter and his wife who were leaning forward impatiently to the verge of desperation  whos it from  asked mr tidger for the third time  i dont know said mrs pullen  good gracious who ever would ha thought it  thought what ann  demanded the carpenter feverishly  why dont people write their names plain  demanded his sisterinlaw impatiently  its got a printed name up in the corner perhaps thats it  well i never didi dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels  youre sitting down thats what youre adoing said the carpenter regarding her somewhat unfavourably  perhaps its a takein said mrs pullen her lips trembling  ive heard o such things  if it is i shall never get over itnever  getoverwhat  asked the carpenter  it dont look like a takein soliloquized mrs pullen and i shouldnt think anybodyd go to all that trouble and spend a penny to take in a poor thing like me  mr tidger throwing politeness to the winds leaped forward and snatching the letter from her read it with feverish haste tempered by a defective education  its a takein ann he said his voice trembling it must be  what is  asked mrs tidger impatiently  looks like it said mrs pullen feebly  what is it  screamed mrs tidger wrought beyond all endurance  her husband turned and regarded her with much severity but mrs tidgers gaze was the stronger and after a vain attempt to meet it he handed her the letter  mrs tidger read it through hastily and then snatching the baby from her lap held it out with both arms to her husband and jumping up kissed her sister heartily patting her on the back in her excitement until she coughed with the pain of it  you dont think its a takein polly  she inquired  takein  said her sister of course it aint  lawyers dont play jokes their times too valuable  no youre an heiress all right ann and i wish you joy  i couldnt be more pleased if it was myself  she kissed her again and going to pat her back once more discovered that she had sunk down sufficiently low in her chair to obtain the protection of its back  two thousand pounds said mrs pullen in an awestruck voice  ten hundered pounds twice over said the carpenter mouthing it slowly twenty hundered pounds  he got up from the table and instinctively realizing that he could not do full justice to his feelings with the baby in his arms laid it on the teatray in a puddle of cold tea and stood looking hard at the heiress  i was housekeeper to her eleven years ago said mrs pullen  i wonder what she left it to me for  didnt know what to do with it i should think said the carpenter still staring openmouthed  tidger im ashamed of you said his wife snatching her infant to her bosom  i expect you was very good to her ann  i never ad no luck said the impenitent carpenter  nobody ever left me no money  nobody ever left me so much as a fipun note  he stared round disdainfully at his poor belongings and drawing on his coat took his bag from a corner and hoisting it on his shoulder started to his work  he scattered the news as he went and it ran up and down the little main street of thatcham and thence to the outlying lanes and cottages  within a couple of hours it was common property and the fortunate legatee was presented with a congratulatory address every time she ventured near the door  it is an old adage that money makes friends the carpenter was surprised to find that the mere fact of his having a moneyed relation had the same effect and that men to whom he had hitherto shown a certain amount of respect due to their position now sought his company  they stood him beer at the bell and walked by his side through the street  when they took to dropping in of an evening to smoke a pipe the carpenter was radiant with happiness  you dont seem to see beyond the end of your nose tidger said the wife of his bosom after they had retired one evening  hm  said the startled carpenter  what do you think old miller the dealer comes here for  demanded his wife  smoke his pipe replied her husband confidently  and old wiggett  persisted mrs tidger  smoke his pipe was the reply  why whats the matter polly  mrs tidger sniffed derisively  you men are all alike she snapped what do you think ann wears that pink bodice for  i never noticed she ad a pink bodice polly said the carpenter  no  thats what i say  you men never notice anything said his wife if you dont send them two old fools off i will  dont you like em to see ann wearing pink  inquired the mystified tidger  mrs tidger bit her lip and shook her head at him scornfully  in plain english tidger as plain as i can speak itshe said severely theyre after ann and er bit o money  mr tidger gazed at her openmouthed and taking advantage of that fact blew out the candle to hide his discomposure  what he said blankly at er time o life  watch em tomorrer said his wife  the carpenter acted upon his instructions and his ire rose as he noticed the assiduous attention paid by his two friends to the frivolous mrs pullen  mr wiggett a sharpfeatured little man was doing most of the talking while his rival a stout cleanshaven man with a slow oxlike eye looked on stolidly  mr miller was seldom in a hurry and lost many a bargain through his slownessa fact which sometimes so painfully affected the individual who had outdistanced him that he would offer to let him have it at a still lower figure  you get younger than ever mrs pullen said wiggett the conversation having turned upon ages  young aint the word for it said miller with a praiseworthy determination not to be left behind  no its age as youre thinking of mr wiggett said the carpenter slowly none of us gets younger do we ann  illustration you get younger than ever mrs  pullen  some of us keeps young in our ways said mrs pullen somewhat shortly  how old should you say ann is now  persisted the watchful tidger  mr wiggett shook his head  i should say shes about fifteen years younger nor me he said slowly and im as lively as a cricket  shes fiftyfive said the carpenter  that makes you seventy wiggett said mr miller pointedly  i thought you was more than that  you look it  mr wiggett coughed sourly  im fiftynine he growled  nothing ll make me believe as mrs pullens fiftyfive nor anywhere near it  ho  said the carpenter on his mettleho  why my wife here was the sixth child and she  he caught a gleam in the sixth childs eye and expressed her age with a cough  the others waited politely until he had finished and mr tidger noticing this coughed again  and she prompted mr miller displaying a polite interest  she aint so young as she was said the carpenter  cares of a family said mr wiggett plumping boldly  i always thought mrs pullen was younger than her  so did i said mr miller much younger  mr wiggett eyed him sharply  it was rather hard to have miller hiding his lack of invention by participating in his compliments and even improving upon them  it was the way he dealt at marketlistening to other dealers accounts of their wares and adding to them for his own  i was noticing you the other day maam continued mr wiggett  i see you going up the road with a step free and easy as a young girls  she allus walks like that said mr miller in a tone of surprised reproof  its in the family said the carpenter who had been uneasily watching his wifes face  both of you seem to notice a lot said mrs tidger much more than you used to  mr tidger who was of a nervous and sensitive disposition coughed again  you ought to take something for that cough said mr wiggett considerately  gin and beer said mr miller with the air of a specialist  beds the best thing for it said mrs tidger whose temper was beginning to show signs of getting out of hand  mr tidger rose and looked awkwardly at his visitors mr wiggett got up and pretending to notice the time said he must be going and looked at mr miller  that gentleman who was apparently deep in some knotty problem was gazing at the floor and oblivious for the time to his surroundings  come along said wiggett with feigned heartiness slapping him on the back  mr miller looking for a moment as though he would like to return the compliment came back to everyday life and bidding the company good night stepped to the door accompanied by his rival  it was immediately shut with some violence  they seem in a hurry said wiggett  i dont think i shall go there again  i dont think i shall said mr miller  after this neither of them was surprised to meet there again the next night and indeed for several nights  the carpenter and his wife who did not want the money to go out of the family and were also afraid of offending mrs pullen were at their wits end what to do  ultimately it was resolved that tidger in as delicate a manner as possible was to hint to her that they were after her money  he was so vague and so delicate that mrs pullen misunderstood him and fancying that he was trying to borrow half a crown made him a present of five shillings  it was evident to the slowergoing mr miller that his rivals tongue was giving him an advantage which only the everwatchful presence of the carpenter and his wife prevented him from pushing to the fullest advantage  in these circumstances he sat for two hours after breakfast one morning in deep cogitation and after six pipes got up with a twinkle in his slow eyes which his brother dealers had got to regard as a danger signal  he had only the glimmering of an idea at first but after a couple of pints at the bell everything took shape and he cast his eyes about for an assistant  they fell upon a man named smith and the dealer after some thought took up his glass and went over to him  i want you to do something for me he remarked in a mysterious voice  ah ive been wanting to see you said smith who was also a dealer in a small way  one o them hins i bought off you last week is dead  ill give you another for it said miller  and the others are so forgetful continued mr smith  forgetful repeated the other  forget to lay like said mr smith musingly  never mind about them said mr miller with some animation  i want you to do something for me  if it comes off all right ill give you a dozen hins and a couple of decentishsized pigs  mr smith called a halt  decentishsized was vague  take your pick said mr miller  you know mrs pullens got two thousand pounds  wiggetts going to have it said the other he as good as told me so  hes after her money said the other sadly  look ere smith i want you to tell him shes lost it all  say that tidger told you but you wasnt to tell anybody else  wiggett ll believe you  mr smith turned upon him a face all wrinkles lit by one eye  i want the hins and the pigs first he said firmly  mr miller shocked at his grasping spirit stared at him mournfully  and twenty pounds the day you marry mrs pullen continued mr smith  mr miller leading him up and down the sawdust floor besought him to listen to reason and mr smith allowed the better feelings of our common human nature to prevail to the extent of reducing his demands to half a dozen fowls on account and all the rest on the day of the marriage then with the delightful feeling that he wouldnt do any work for a week he went out to drop poison into the ears of mr wiggett  lost all her money  said the startled mr wiggett  how  i dont know how said his friend  tidger told me but made me promise not to tell a soul  but i couldnt help telling you wiggett cause i know what youre after  do me a favour said the little man  i will said the other  keep it from miller as long as possible  if you hear any one else talking of it tell em to keep it from him  if he marries her ill give you a couple of pints  mr smith promised faithfully and both the tidgers and mrs pullen were surprised to find that mr miller was the only visitor that evening  he spoke but little and that little in a slow ponderous voice intended for mrs pullens ear alone  he spoke disparagingly of money and shook his head slowly at the temptations it brought in its train  give him a crust he said and somebody to halve it witha homemade crust baked by a wife  it was a pretty picture but somewhat spoiled by mrs tidger suggesting that though he had spoken of halving the crust he had said nothing about the beer  half of my beer wouldnt be much said the dealer slowly  not the half you would give your wife wouldnt retorted mrs tidger  the dealer sighed and looked mournfully at mrs pullen  the lady sighed in return and finding that her admirers stock of conversation seemed to be exhausted coyly suggested a game of draughts  the dealer assented with eagerness and declining the offer of a glass of beer by explaining that he had had one the day before yesterday sat down and lost seven games right off  he gave up at the seventh game and pushing back his chair said that he thought mrs pullen was the most wonderful draught player he had ever seen and took no notice when mrs tidger in a dry voice charged with subtle meaning said that she thought he was  draughts come natural to some people said mrs pullen modestly its as easy as kissing your fingers  mr miller looked doubtful then he put his great fingers to his lips by way of experiment and let them fall unmistakably in the widows direction  mrs pullen looked down and nearly blushed  the carpenter and his wife eyed each other in indignant consternation  thats easy enough said the dealer and repeated the offense  mrs pullen got up in some confusion and began to put the draughtboard away  one of the pieces fell on the floor and as they both stooped to recover it their heads bumped  it was nothing to the dealers but mrs pullen rubbed hers and sat down with her eyes watering  mr miller took out his handkerchief and going to the scullery dipped it into water and held it to her head  is it better  he inquired  a little better said the victim with a shiver  mr miller in his emotion was squeezing the handkerchief hard and a cold stream was running down her neck  thank you its all right now  the dealer replaced the handkerchief and sat for some time regarding her earnestly then the carpenter and his wife displaying manifest signs of impatience he took his departure after first inviting himself for another game of draughts the following night  he walked home with the air of a conqueror and thought exultingly that the two thousand pounds were his it was a deal after his own heart and not the least satisfactory part about it was the way he had got the better of wiggett  he completed his scheme the following day after a short interview with the useful smith by the afternoon wiggett found that his exclusive information was common property and all thatcham was marvelling at the fortitude with which mrs pullen was bearing the loss of her fortune with a view of being out of the way when the denial was published mr miller after loudly expressing in public his sympathy for mrs pullen and his admiration of her qualities drove over with some pigs to a neighbouring village returning to thatcham in the early evening  then hurriedly putting his horse up he made his way to the carpenters  the tidgers were at home when he entered and mrs pullen flushed faintly as he shook hands  i was coming in before he said impressively after what i heard this afternoon but i had to drive over to thorpe  you eard it  inquired the carpenter in an incredulous voice  certainly said the dealer and very sorry i was  sorry for one thing but glad for another  the carpenter opened his mouth and seemed about to speak  then he checked himself suddenly and gazed with interest at the ingenuous dealer  im glad said mr miller slowly as he nodded at a friend of mrs tidgers who had just come in with a long face because now that mrs pullen is poor i can say to her what i couldnt say while she was rich  again the astonished carpenter was about to speak but the dealer hastily checked him with his hand  one at a time he said  mrs pullen i was very sorry to hear this afternoon for your sake that you had lost all your money  what i wanted to say to you now now that you are poor was to ask you to be mrs miller  what dye say  mrs pullen touched at so much goodness wept softly and said yes the triumphant miller took out his handkerchiefthe same that he had used the previous night for he was not an extravagant manand tenderly wiped her eyes  well im blowed  said the staring carpenter  ive got a nice little ouse continued the wily mr miller  its a poor place but nice and well play draughts every evening  when shall it be  when you like said mrs pullen in a faint voice  ill put the banns up tomorrow said the dealer  mrs tidgers lady friend giggled at so much haste but mrs tidger who felt that she had misjudged him was touched  it does you credit mr miller she said warmly  no no said the dealer and then mr tidger got up and crossing the room solemnly shook hands with him  money or no money shell make a good wife he said  im glad youre pleased said the dealer wondering at this cordiality  i dont deny i thought you was after her money continued the carpenter solemnly  my missus thought so too  mr miller shook his head and said he thought they would have known him better  of course it is a great loss said the carpenter  money is money  thats all it is though said the slightly mystified mr miller  what i cant understand is continued the carpenter ow the news got about  why the neighbours knew of it a couple of hours before we did  the dealer hid a grin  then he looked a bit bewildered again  i assure you said the carpenter it was known in the town at least a couple of hours before we got the letter  mr miller waited a minute to get perfect control over his features letter  he repeated faintly  the letter from the lawyers said the carpenter  mr miller was silent again  his features were getting tiresome  he eyed the door furtively  whatwasinthe letter  he asked  short and sweet said the carpenter with bitterness  said it was all a mistake because theyd been and found another will  people shouldnt make such mistakes  were all liable to make mistakes said miller thinking he saw an opening  yes we made a mistake when we thought you was after anns money assented the carpenter  im sure i thought youd be the last man in the world to be pleased to hear that shed lost it  one thing is youve got enough for both  illustration well leave you two young things alone  mr miller made no reply but in a dazed way strove to realize the full measure of the misfortune which had befallen him  the neighbour with the anxiety of her sex to be the first with a bit of news had already taken her departure  he thought of wiggett walking the earth a free man and of smith with a threemonths bill for twenty pounds  his pride as a dealer was shattered beyond repair and emerging from a species of mist he became conscious that the carpenter was addressing him  well leave you two young things alone for a bit said mr tidger heartily  were going out  when youre tired o courting you can play draughts and ann will show you one or two of er moves  so long
